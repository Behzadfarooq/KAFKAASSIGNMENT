<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggestion on precedence</span></h2>
<p>When the U.S. Constitution was first created they voted to approve a long detailed version with lots of nuances and caveats. Then a small group was appointed to go through and 'clean it up' a bit. Their mandate was to not change any of the meanings, but to shorten it. However, without all the details and nuances and caveats people <b>inevitably</b> take different interpretations of the text than they would if all that further explanation were still in there. Which is why, officially, the original text still holds and people still go back and quote it as the <b>actual</b> intent of the Constitution (e.g. the standards for impeachment of the President are given as "high crimes and misdemeanors", but in the original it was, "high crimes and misdemeanors <i>against the state</i>").</p>
<p>Given all of the above consternation about variations in wording from the 'merge' I'd suggest we do something similar here. The <i>intent</i> of this page was to merge the content of the 'Verifiability' and 'No original research' policies without changing their <b>meaning</b> at all. Thus, I'd suggest that we lock down those two policies and let this one go live with the understanding that 'interpretations' of the text need to square with the original policies that this one was intended to NOT change. Going forward there may be consensus to amend / alter this policy in ways that contradict the older two, but at present it should not be taken to <i>mean</i> anything different than the two policies it was derived from. They are still the 'original and officially approved text' which was established by community consensus. This page is then the 'working copy' which is intended to provide the same meaning as those more detailed texts in a 'cleaned up' and unified form. Make sense? --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 16:52, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>That would make any changes to this policy difficult, as they would have to be phrased as, well, amendments. This is exactly the kind of problem that the proposal to merge was intended to solve. So, no, I don't think keeping the old versions as an aid for interpretation helps. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 16:55, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Changes to the policy would require <i>consensus</i>... just as they always do. Barring a consensus to change the intent/meaning of the old policies they would still be held to apply. It needn't be done as amendments. I'm just suggesting that rather than wrestling over whether the phrasing of this page projects <b>exactly</b> the same nuances as the two originals (it doesn't and never could) we accept it as 'good enough' with the understanding that those nuances are all still in effect and citable from the old policies until/unless there is an actual consensus to change them. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 18:27, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with any retention of the old policies (as Guidelines or anything), because to my mind it would defeat the point of ATT. V + NOR = ATT is a reduction of two pages to one. Good. Keeping the two former as supplements only means increasing "link-creep"--I have to go here, then here, then here, <i>to understand.</i> At present our policies are stable but still not as easy as they could be. One does have to click on links too much: from V to RS back to V and V over to NOR and back to V, etc. WP:ATT, IMO, was to solve this, and this merge (while certainly not solving it completely) was the first step. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 21:50, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">This policy sucks</span></h2>
<p>The basic point of this policy, as far as I can tell, is that anything that is not a book or a newspaper or some such is not a valid source. Congratulations, you've just made it impossible to source anything related to Internet-only stuff as well as most pop culture/anime/TV things and so forth.

<dd>In general, Jtrainor has a point. In the past, editors on the policy and guideline pages have debated what is or is not <i>published</i> but, if I recall correctly, never reached a consensus on a definition. That failure is reflected in the failure of this policy to define <i>published</i>, even though forms of the word are used more times than I care to count. There is a substantial danger that some readers will only think of books, newspapers, and magazines as being published, and will not think of DVDs, CDs, computer programs, and websites as publications. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 03:53, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, it is technically true that there is nothing <i>new</i>. However, that excludes the multiple deletions from the policies (which were somehow supposed to be a compromise?), and removals change things just as well as additions. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">moo!</a></small> 03:54, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What this policy <i>is</i> about is ensuring that wikipedia presents the highest quality attainable.

But that's a thorny issue, and a lot of people don't like it. So it can't happen here, not right now. But later, I'm sure it will be proposed again, and we can start gathering consensus to make that change. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 12:17, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The first two are fine, in my opinion, although it might make more sense to summarise in <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, leaving the details to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, rather than duplicating and allowing forking. It is the third one I have a problem with because, having discussed it much on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WT%7ERS_bc01.html" title="WT:RS">WT:RS</a>, I disagree and have seen exceptions that seem to enjoy consensus. Well, you saw my suggestion on <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EReliable_sources_715d.html#Self-published_sources:_Can_we_simplify_this.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Reliable sources">WT:RS</a> recently, so I guess I don't have to explain here. If I were to suggest a part of WP:RS to be included in policy, it would be a summarised version of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Aspects_of_reliability" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources#Aspects_of_reliability</a>, but a lot of that material is new so it might not actually have enough consensus to become part of policy.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Concern</span></h2>
<p>I'm concerned that a couple of editors are using the merge as an excuse to change the policy. PMAnderson's change, for example: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAttribution&amp;diff=109322734&amp;oldid=109235207" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAttribution&amp;diff=109322734&amp;oldid=109235207" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> the example <b>is</b> OR, which is why it's cited. Why would it only "probably" be OR?</p>
<p>Please, no more changes. There's a consensus for a merge, but not for change. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:57, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because the distinction <i>this</i> page draws between OR and unsourced material, which is a good one - and sharper than it used to be- is that original research <i>cannot</i> be attributed to a reliable source. Phrasing it as at present destroys this distinction; it is probable, but not certain, that the example paragraph is some editor's own opinion; it is possible that he saw the <i>CMS</i> cited in some reliable source's comment on the Smith-Jones matter, and has forgotten to cite it. The existing text also leaves unstated that the implied conclusion is what may well be OR. Both of these have been discussed on this page before. I <b>strongly oppose</b> letting this policy go live with this confusion.<a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 17:54, 19 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, I see what you mean. In this case, however, it's clear from the writing that it's the editor's argument, and in a case like that, we assume that it's OR until the editor shows that it's someone else's argument. Otherwise, we'd never be able to call anything OR, because it's always possible that there might be a source out there somewhere, not yet found. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:59, 19 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that it's a reasonable inference; but the existing text goes on to discuss the possibility of finding a source, when we have just defined OR as making that impossible. As far as I am concerned, this is a matter of phrasing, not of policy; it may be sufficient to state the assumption SV makes to avoid misleading those who will read this policy. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 18:06, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have modified this to explicitly make Slim Virgin's assumption. I believe it was true of the actual case from which this is adapted, but it was not certain of the hypothetical; now it is.</p>

<p>The following material is a change; it is a good change</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Unsourced material</b> is material <i>not yet</i> attributed to a reliable source.</li>
<li><b>Original research</b> is material that <i>cannot be</i> attributed to a reliable source.</li>
</ul>
<p>but as long as it stands and is not used consistently <i>on this page</i> at a minimum, this page is not fit to be policy.

<dd>The wording in question is:
<dl>
<dd>This entire paragraph is original research, because the editor has put two (citable) assertions together in order to imply the editor's opinion that, given the <i>Chicago Manual of Style's</i> definition of plagiarism, Jones did not commit it. If there were a reliable source <i>that specifically comments on the Smith and Jones dispute</i> and makes the same point about the <i>Chicago Manual of Style</i> and plagiarism, it would not be original research; but should express the conclusion as <i>that source's</i> opinion, not Wikipedia's.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Redundancy</span></h2>
<p>The article layout has a serious redundancy problem. The key principles are stated twice in different formulations. This is not a good idea. The two iterations need to be combined so there is one definitive statement for each. I think the best way to do this is to refactor the headings from:</p>
<pre>
1 Key principles
2 No original research
3 Reliable sources
</pre>
<p>to:</p>
<pre>
1 Key principles

<p>Forgive me if this was already discussed, but what is included in "Questionable sources may only be used in articles about themselves"? Assuming the criteria from the first exception are met, it's obvious that we can use the homepage of a person as a source for the article about the person. It is also somewhat obvious that we can use the homepage of a company as a source for the article about the company. So far, so good, but there are also enough unclear cases, IMHO. Can the homepage of a person be used as a source for an article about a band that the person is a member of? Can the homepage of a person be used as a source for an article about a book/song/painting the person created? Can the homepage of a small subculture be used in the article about said subculture (For example: Can <a href="http://www.otherkin.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.otherkin.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.otherkin.com/</a> be used as a source for <a href="../../../o/t/h/Otherkin.html" title="Otherkin">Otherkin</a>)? --<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EContiE_b35e.html" title="User:ContiE">Conti</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/User_talk%7EContiE_12d8.html" title="User talk:ContiE">✉</a> 02:43, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Small subculture web site in articles about the subculture: no.

<dd>IMO the current policy covers these situations, in that self-published sources "[do] not involve claims about third parties" and the claims "[are] not contentious". Using this for your questions, I would say that the band, which includes persons other than the writer, would be 'third parties' hence excluded. If it's some work created by the self-publisher, s/he could opine about it in the web page, as long as the opinion is non-controversial. I would say that an organization's self-published web site can be used as source about the organization, again with the above caveats: not about others, and only non-controversial facts. Bottom line: your examples are covered in the current policy, AFAICT. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 03:10, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would like to change the following sentence in Questionable or Selfpublished sources "Editors should exercise caution for two reasons: first, if the information on the professional researcher's blog (or self-published equivalent) is really worth reporting, someone else will probably have done so; secondly, the information has been self-published, which means it has not been subject to any independent form of fact-checking." to "Editors should exercise caution as the information has not been subject to any independent form of fact-checking."

<dd>I actually agree with the current wording, because many editors, upon seeing a blogged source, give up on looking for any more sources. As WP we would like the best possible sources, and by telling editors that there are good odds that a fact worth reporting, if true, is likely to be found elsewhere on a better source than a blog, we are encouraging them to look harder, wider and deeper, and improve our content. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 21:59, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, we see that "Because this is the English Wikipedia, for the convenience of our readers, English-language sources should be used in preference to foreign-language sources, assuming equal quality, so that readers can easily verify that the source material has been used correctly."

<dd>I think that "whenever possible" tends to deprecate the use of foreign-language sources regardless of their quality prior to the ending qualifier. Equivalence could mean simply the ability to act as a citation for a certain statement, as opposed to being a description of the quality of the sources. This is more a question of clarity than anything else; I fear an increase in the number of editors who, for example, say that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> have not been met when an article contains only foreign-language sources. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a><a href="../../../d/e/k/User_talk%7EDekimasu_df11.html" title="User talk:Dekimasu"><font color="darkgreen">が...</font></a> 03:39, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the policy should recognize that different editors have different sources available to them, and different abilities to search for sources. A phrase like "when there are no English equivalents of equal quality" can be interpreted to place on each editor the burden of searching the entire English-language literature to make sure there is no source as good as the foreign language source that the editor has convenient access to. I would like to see that section restated to say that when several sources of equal quality have been found, the English language version should be used. I have no objection to waiting until the merger issue is settled for such a change. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 20:20, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"Equal quality" are not the same as "English equivalent". For example, we can have two books of equal quality wriiten by two equally distinguished scholars, but with opposing POVs. One book is in English, another one in French. The "equal quality" clause will rule out the French source because an English one of the same quality is available. However, the "English equivalent" phrase will allow both sources because there is no English book written by a similarly distinguished scholar and representing the same POV. "Whenever possible" are also crucial words here. Many editors of the English Wikipedia do not speak languages other than English and often cannot possibly verify the quality of sources in languages other than English unless the sources have reviews in English. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 19:29, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't interpret the sentence as Or does; to me, every significant point of view should be included, and the fact that one point of view has an English language source and another has a French source in no way prevents the latter POV from being included. The phrase "English equivalent" could be interpreted in a variety of ways too; if two sources convey the same information in a science article, but the one in French is published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, while the one in English is a popular newspaper, some people might argue the newspaper is an English equivalent and the French version should not be cited.</dd>

<dd>If we are to cover not English language topics at all , the best sources will often--perhaps even usually-- be in the language appropriate to the topic-- either by being available in translation or if necessary having them translated, as is in the current (ideal) practice. The pattern of using lower quality sources because they are in English is like the practice of using low quality internet sources because they are easier to find than print: to some extent its a practical necessity, but if challenged the best sources must be followed.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:12, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A very frequent mistake made by editors is thinking that you can't do O.R. on Talk pages. I believe it would be useful to include the following paragraph:</p>
<p><b>Original research is allowed on Talk pages</b></p>
<p>A large amount of Wikipedia activity takes place on the Talk pages, and users sometimes believe that the prohibition to use original research applies to those pages as well, which is not the case. Actually, original research is not only allowed, but also necessary on Talk pages, particularly when an editor argues for or against the use of a certain source. In those cases, the editor may do some research about the source, find that it is reliable or unreliable, and argue for using it or not based on his research. Other users participating in the Talk page may accept or reject his arguments, but may not refuse to consider them on the grounds that they constitute original research. --<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> 19:57, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I believe you misunderstand wikipedia's idiosyncratic use of "original research". We are <i>supposed</i> to do research to understand the subject of an article, the nature of the sources and the qualifications of the authors of those sources. This helps us in making editorial decisions such as what is or is not "original reseach"; such as what is a neutral way of phrasing something; such as what not to include as if it were a fact because the author is a liar or fraud or an incompetant. In short, <b>research is how we know what is original research or not</b>. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 21:14, 17 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, your answer is proof of why my proposed paragraph is necessary. Talk pages are <i>not</i> (<i><b>NOT!</b></i>) an integral part of an article. That's a big confusion <i>many</i> (if not most) editors have. In talk pages we discuss the articles and we may do as much research as we like for discussing what gets and what doesn't get into the article. What we don't do is publish that research <i>in the article itself</i>. I may do a lot of research to conclude that Fulano de Tal is not a reliable source on Rioplatense Spanish, and thus convince my fellow editors that he mustn't be used as a source. What I can't do is write "Fulano de Tal is not a reliable source" <i>into the article on Rioplatense Spanish</i>.--<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbenyosef_ae4d.html" title="User:Abenyosef">Abenyosef</a> 15:46, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Interestingly enough, I found myself involved in a discussion on this very subject not long ago, after I decided to challenge a source that was being used in the "New antisemitism" article. I held that the source was inappropriate, as it included material that was both demonstrably false and irrelevant to the subject matter. (Click <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:New_antisemitism&amp;diff=103558228&amp;oldid=103554081" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:New_antisemitism&amp;diff=103558228&amp;oldid=103554081" rel="nofollow">here</a> for details. The relevant sections are those marked "Source Credibility" and "Demonstrably Poor Scholarship").</p>
<p>I thought I had a pretty strong argument: after all, I was able to show that one of the statements included in the article was outright <b>false</b>. Most contributors seemed to agree with my position. Nevertheless, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:New_antisemitism&amp;diff=104124525&amp;oldid=104121694" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:New_antisemitism&amp;diff=104124525&amp;oldid=104121694" rel="nofollow">two</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:New_antisemitism&amp;diff=104145460&amp;oldid=104128378" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:New_antisemitism&amp;diff=104145460&amp;oldid=104128378" rel="nofollow">editors</a> chose to advance the view that my criticism of the source was irrelevant, as it constituted a form of Original Research.

<p>It's now been almost a month since my original post appeared on the discussion page. The "New antisemitism" article continues to include factually inaccurate information, and efforts to remove it have been met with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_antisemitism&amp;diff=104475721&amp;oldid=104470645" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_antisemitism&amp;diff=104475721&amp;oldid=104470645" rel="nofollow">resistence</a>. The matter is currently before informal mediation, although neither of my interlocutors have contributed to this process as of yet.</p>
<p>I remain confused by the adamantine efforts of certain editors to retain false information in this article. I can only imagine that these editors have concluded that (i) "false, but verifiable" is an acceptable standard for the inclusion of information, and (ii) any efforts to demonstrate the falsehood of such information are contrary to Wikipedia policy. In the back of my mind, I cannot help but wonder if the "No Original Research" policy is being abused in some way. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 00:18, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is WP's core policy that we strive for "attributability, not truth". It is not a view held by 'certain editors', but by WP as a whole, by consensus and policy. Regarding the specific issue of OR on talk pages, as I replied to Abenyosef <a href="../../../a/b/e/User_talk%7EAbenyosef_09f4.html#WP:ATT" title="User talk:Abenyosef">on his Talk page</a>, the key point is that we don't vet authors or their work - we vet the publishers and publications. Once we deem a publication/publisher as acceptable, we leave it to the editors and publishers at that publication to vet the authors and provide an editorial oversight, while we summarize and cite the work. Trying to vet authors and their work in Talk pages is OR and is wrong, we need to focus on the publication. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:44, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The policy you're referring to is, "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth", and it's a policy with which I strongly agree. This policy, however, was designed to ensure that "accurate, but unverifiable" information would be excluded from Wikipedia, not to allow "demonstrably false, but attributable" information to be included.</p>
<p>Beyond this, I cannot agree with your arguments on Abenyosef's page concerning "tests of verifiability". If the NY Times or a major scientific journal prints a statement which can shown to be false, there is surely no obligation on our part to convey the statement as fact.</p>
<p>In any event, I raised concerns about the method of publication in my initial post on the subject. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 00:56, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you disagree with a policy, which of course is perfectly legitimate, you can certainly work to revise it. But as long as the policy is in force, we must all respect it and abide by it. I think that WP's strength is in not trying to be 'accurate' or 'truthful' but instead to present attributable information, in a neutral and balanced fashion. An encyclopedia is not a religious document that we accept as gospel - it is a collection of summarized published information, properly balanced and attributed to its sources. If the NYT reports that the moon is made of green cheese (to use SlimVirgin's example), once we deem the NYT as an acceptable source, we could hypothetically report that the NYT said that, and perhaps with due weight show that it is in a small minority (and possibly even exclude it if it is on the fringe). In a less extreme example, we would include information published by an otherwise reliable source, and cite it to that source, even if some of us at WP suspect it is false. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 01:09, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's a serious problem with this statement. Edward Flannery does, in fact, write that Zosa Szajkowski could not find a "single word on behalf of Jews" from 1820 to 1920. The problem is that Szajkowski himself did not make this statement. I looked up the Szajkowski article cited by Flannery, and found that Flannery had misstated Szajkowski's position: ZS's survey ended in 1886, and he spoke of French socialists opposing antisemitism in 1889.</dd>

This point, called synthesis, is not covered directly by WP:V. Regarding your example of source A misquoting source B, I accept that when we present a statement that appears to be self inconsistent or contradictory, we may carefully mention that fact to prevent reader confusion, bending over backwards to be extra neutral and use minimal verbiage.

If anything, the title "No original research" is misleading, because the OR policy is not about research in the common sense of the term; if readers only look at the title, they will never understand the OR policy. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 12:54, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree, a user cannot simply look at the title of the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy for example and be expected to understand it.

<dd>(conflict -- response to CMummert) No, but on the other hand it is useful if the title is a convenient summary of what the policy requires.</dd>
<dd>I think, however, that that is achieved here: We can say, in the case of either "unverifiable" or "originally researched" contributions, the they "lack attribution". And this makes a lot more sense to somebody who hasn't read the policy than either of the other two terms do -- those names don't carry an implicit understanding with them of why they're bad.

<dd>I agree. I think that from the title significance alone, this is a major step forward. It clearly tells editors that our statements must be attributed or attributable (depending on the controversy level) to some other published source. I think that is the core concept of Wikipedia's content - that we are here to summarize what has been published elsewhere. None of the previous titles so clearly conveyed this critical point, IMO. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 16:09, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the problem with 'verifiability' is that it is a constant source of confusion. Many editors interpret 'verification' as digging into the 'truth' of a source, as in verifying its veracity. OTOH, the term 'attributability' clearly conveys that we as WP are not interested in truth per se, only in faithfully and neutrally reporting what reliable sources are saying about an issue, and <i>attributing it to them</i>. I personally consider the term 'attributability' a major step forward in clearly explaining our core content policies. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:58, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point you are trying to make — that if a source can be found even in principle, it's not OR — is true, but trivially so. Every single meaningful combination of words imaginable might have a reliable source for it, somewhere, some day, so we couldn't ever call anything OR if our definition of OR is that we <b>know</b> there's no source. So it's trivially true that, although OR is material that isn't attributable, the state of our knowledge is going to be imperfect.

<li>It will not be obvious to all readers what is OR here (the argument that Jones is not actually a plagiarist); nor is it <i>obvious</i> that the editor's argument is OR rather than unsourced; let's state that assumption.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Repeats of source information when using summary style</span></h2>
<p>We acknowledge that Wikipedia can't be used as a source. Howevery, do summary style paragraphs have to repeat sources made in primary articles? For instance, if we have a main article called "Religion in Fictional Country" and then a summary link about religion in the article about Fictional Country, do the two or three sentences in the summary need to be entirely resourced? I just watched someone do a wholesale wipeout of 30 or so entries from a summary list where each entry had it's own (presumably sourced) article because "the entries weren't sourced." I think the original articles sourcing should stand up when repeated in summary articles - or at least, if an existing summary exists with a link to the main article, it's <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">bullying</a> to delete it without checking the main article for a source. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 22:43, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This was discussed at <a href="../../../v/_/_/WT%7EV_c6a9.html" title="WT:V">WT:V</a> a while back; the general consensus (IIRC) was that the risk of the two articles getting out of sync with each other was too high, so the policy shouldn't make any allowance for it. Each article must be sourced, rather than relying on the sources of other articles.</dd>
<dd>Deleting the information without making a good-faith effort to look for a source isn't particularly great editing, but it doesn't violate policy. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 23:11, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But that depends on the nature of the summary. If, as is common, the summary is one paragraph, taking the non-controversial points of a whole article, then it will fall under the "not likely to be challenged" exception. Insisting on sourcing 1492 in a summary of exploration of the Americas is not helpful to the encyclopedia; adding a footnote is silly; removing the information is actively harmful.</dd>

Claims about "first discovery" <i>are</i> controversial, and stating the claim with enough precision that it becomes unquestionably accurate belongs in the summarized article, not the summary. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 23:29, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Can information be both verifiable and demonstrably false?</span></h2>
<p>I have serious concerns about one particular aspect of the proposed WP:A policy.</p>
<p>The essence of the old WP:NOR policy was that "Articles may not contain any unpublished material, or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that serves to advance a position." This policy established that verifiability, rather than truth, was the standard for determining whether or not information could be posted on an article page.</p>
<p>The purpose was to ensure that "true, but unverifiable" information would be excluded from the project, so as to prevent contributors from posting personal knowledge and/or novel theories and approaches.</p>
<p>I have concerns that the new WP:A policy could be misused, and invert the principle of WP:NOR to permit "false, but attributable" information to be presented as fact.</p>
<p>I would ask readers to consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a source which is generally considered to be reliable publishes a false statement, should we convey that statement? If so, how should we convey it?</li>
<li>If a source of suspect reliability publishes a false statement, should we convey that statement? If so, how should we convey it?</li>
<li>Does it violate Wikipedia's original research policies to show that a published statement is demonstrably false?</li>
</ul>
<p>And,</p>
<ul>
<li>Should WP:A clarify that *verifiability*, rather than *attributability*, is the most appropriate standard for the inclusion of factual information?</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not believe it was ever the intent of WP:NOR to permit false statements to be included on Wikipedia as "statements of fact", and I am concerned that the proposed policy change would lead to this very outcome.

<dd>I think WP should not engage in deciding on the merit of issues. Deciding if something is 'true' or 'false' is definitely a value judgment, and we should refrain from it, as doing so would violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Therefore, the only issue that we can address is "is it attributable to a reliable source or not". If yes, it's acceptable, else not. The remaining issues would be to find the proper balance required for a neutral presentation, but that also does not require us to make a true or false value judgment - only to determine the relative weight a given view point has in the overall published information about the subject. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 01:48, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With respect, I cannot entirely agree with this assessment.</p>
<p>This may come as a surprise in light of our disagreements earlier on the page, but I understand where you're coming from with your objections. I recognize the inherent dangers in evaluating a published source, and I understand the problems associated with "mission creep" (as some have described it). Notwithstanding this, I cannot accept the conclusion that <i>all</i> evaluation is inappropriate for this project.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would be worthwhile to compare the following situations ...</p>
<p>A.</p>
<p>A credible and respected newspaper asserts that the moon is made of green cheese. Should Wikipedia convey this information? If so, how?</p>
<p>Answer: Wikipedia should convey this information, as a simple statement of fact and without embellishment.</p>
<p>B.</p>
<p>"Respected Author X" attributes a statement to "Respected Author Y", citing one of "Respected Author Y"'s works. However, "Respected Author Y" does not actually make the assertion attributed to him/her in the citation provided.</p>
<p>Should Wikipedia convey "Respected Author X"'s assertion? If so, how? Is it a violation of WP:A to review "Respected Author Y"'s original statement?</p>
<p>I'll leave this for others to contemplate. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 02:12, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I basically agree with you about the intent of the policy, but I think that it's a relatively limited danger for a few reasons. For one thing, attribution is a criterion for inclusion, rather than exclusion. The burden of persuasion is always on the editor who wishes to include a statement to demonstrate that it represents the content of a reliable source; an editor who feels that the statement is insufficiently sourced, or that the source is unreliable, has the authority to delete it.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, I think that the reliability of a "reliable source" has to be adjudicated on a case by case basis, and implicit in that adjudication is an evaluation of whether the source is reliable at this time, on that subject. The possession of a PhD by the author of a book does not inherently confer reliability, particularly on subjects outside his specialty. Similarly, sources that were quite reliable at the time of their publication may become outdated. The 1911 <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> was authoritative at the time of its publication, and written by some of the foremost scholars of the time, but relatively little of its content should be deemed authoritative now. This is why the policy makes clear that it cannot be read in isolation from other policies, particularly not NPOV. NPOV's discussion of "undue weight" clearly presumes that an evaluation of "prominent adherents" and "significant viewpoints" will take place.</dd>
<dd>Third, given the inclusion rules, the "demonstrably" prong will generally mean that there are contrary sources to cite. If a statement can be demonstrated to be false using other reliable sources, then one of two things is likely to happen: 1) the contents of the debate will be included in the article, allowing the reader to observe that one side is plainly wrong, or 2) the debate will be on the talk page and the false statements will be removed from the article. Some debates among the experts are sufficiently notable for 1) to be appropriate, but I think 2) will be more common, particularly on minor points.<a href="../../../d/c/b/User%7EDCB4W_e3cc.html" title="User:DCB4W">DCB4W</a> 02:21, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A big problem happens when the statement can be (in the ordinary sense) demonstrated to be false, but the sources used to do so don't meet Wikipedia's standards for reliable sources. Then no "debate" can be included in the article.</dd>
<dd>Of course, you can say "if you haven't demonstrated it to be false using reliable sources, then you really haven't demonstrated it false at all", but that ignores the fact that Wikipedia's requirements are strict enough to exclude the kind of reasoning that we accept in almost any non-Wikipedia context. If the sources say a bridge has no traffic, and a person who visits it sees that it has traffic, then that person has, in any reasonable sense, demonstrated that the reliable source is wrong, even if Wikipedia policy says that we can't use his words because they aren't professionally published. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 03:50, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see it as a problem. Wikipedia is simply a summary of published sources. This does not mean that all sources are always correct, in any sense. All we are trying to do is to present a balanced summary of what reliable sources are saying about a given topic, and if some are clearly wrong, so be it. We as WP are just objective witnesses of the published information, not judges of fact or truth. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 03:57, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Except we allow articles on topics that have relatively few, less reliable sources. If Wikipedia presents some information on Newtonian mechanics, there are thousands of highly reliable sources on this to corroborate it and with which to correct any errors. If Wikipedia presents some information that only has a handful of weak sources (perhaps even simply old sources) we have a situation where if any highly reliable source were to examine the issue they would correct the obvious errors in the weak sources—but the topic has so little notability that no publisher cares to do so. Consider another possibility. There is a published book from 1950 on some obscure physical theory that has "false" information, versus a physicist's blog today. The book is conventionally more "reliable", and the blog is a self-published website, but the book is demonstrably wrong. Also, note that even in topics with numerous highly reliable sources, Wikipedia is not simply a summary of published sources; in order for that to be the case "Wikipedia" would need to review all published sources in order to reflect them accurately. What we have instead is some editors who might only look at a couple published sources, and someone else comes along and points out that the layman wrongly copied the idea out of a wrong textbook (and hopefully points us to a more reliable source, but often not). —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 05:24, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll respond to both Centrx and CJCurrie. I see WP as a diligent and intelligent librarian who is being asked by someone interested in a topic to neutrally summarize the published information about it. The librarian would try to only look at 'reliable' publications, would summarize them and balance their contributions to the summary based on their relative preponderence and acceptance (i.e. cross citations) in the published literature. The librarian is not a researcher beyond knowing how to summarize the existing materials. Yes, there could be topics as Centrx said where the sources are weak, where old books compete with modern blogs, and as CJCurrie says where some 'reliable' source are plain wrong (assuming a refutable type topic). But the librarian still has to come up with an optimal summary given the facts on the ground, and creates a reasonable common sense document. That should be our approach, where all of us collectively are that librarian, and we'll keep tweaking each entry to get it closer to the ideal optimum, given the constraints of poor or inconsistent sourcing etc. Bottom line: we want pure summary of attributed sources, no OR, we keep working on the balance and source quality, we get ever closer to the the 'sweet spot', but may never quite get there. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 06:04, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see a red herring above. "False, but attributable" information is only going to become a problem if people cease using common sense. Nowhere is it suggested that if you know a supposed fact to be wrong, you must assert it.
<ul>
<li>"If a source which is generally considered to be reliable publishes a false statement, should we convey that statement?" If you know it's false don't assert it or do an in-sentence attribution: "The <i>Times</i> reports the moon is made of cheese.[1]"</li>
<li>"If a source of suspect reliability publishes a false statement, should we convey that statement?" No, obviously, and the policy doesn't say we should.</li>
<li>"Does it violate Wikipedia's original research policies to show that a published statement is demonstrably false?" If it's "demonstrably false" than you can find another reliable source saying so.

<dd>This isn't a red herring. I was recently involved in a situation where I discovered that a statement on an article page was patently false (one author misquoted another; we presented the erroneous information as a statement of fact). When I tried to remove the line, two administrators informed me that my "discovery" constituted original research. The erroneous statement is still included in the article. No one has disputed my contention that the statement is false. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 22:54, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Only a misunderstanding of what the policy meant by verifiable let people think that whether something is <i>true</i> or not entered into it at all.</p>
<p>I still think this policy should include text that instructs editors to use common sense. Reliable sources publish incorrect information, and unreliable ones publish correct information. If there's a good way of telling the difference (which may be specifc to the particular situation), that should be enough for us. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 09:35, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Something can be demonstrably false when there is no other "reliable source" saying so. In Wikipedia articles, only statements supported by reliable sources are allowed. But on article talk pages, editors can express their opinions; present logical arguments; refer to blogs; report that they've emailed an institution and gotten a certain answer; encourage other editors to email the same institution; ask other editors to go and look at the sky right now to see whether an eclipse is happening, etc. If the editors on the talk page are convinced that a statement in a reliable source is false, or that there's a good chance it's false, they can and should simply delete the statement from the Wikipedia article. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 09:42, 22 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with some parts - I agree that we should use common sense as we try to investigate the various sources. But our goal should still be to simply present a balanced and neutral summary of what's been reliably published. If something that was reliably published is 'demonstrably wrong', odds are extremely high someone else would have said so and published that, so obviously we can add this into the balance. We could also use time as a factor - if a modern publication disputes an older one, we should say that, and it of course would impact the presented balance. I see no need to send editors outside to look at the sky, or to otherwise do OR - but I do see it very reasonable to seek better sources, or seek input from sources via email. Often the source may give you via email a pointer to a publication you missed. But at the end of the day, all we do is present a balanced picture of the published reliable sources, period - we use our 'source research' only to seek more sources and vet the ones we have. And our 'vetting' should focus on the publisher/publication, not on the individual author or work, per my comments elsewhere on this page. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 10:57, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I agree with DCB4W, above, that "attribution is a criterion for inclusion, rather than exclusion". If a statement is false, and it isn't crucial to the article, we can and should simply exclude it, even if we only explain why on the talk page, rather than in the article itself. We ran into that sort of thing lots of times in writing <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenna_Jameson_fd39.html" title="Jenna Jameson">Jenna Jameson</a>, where several of our sources disagreed. We weighed the evidence, and simply excluded the ones we believed were false. <a href="../../../j/e/n/Talk%7EJenna_Jameson_Archive_2_c545.html" title="Talk:Jenna Jameson/Archive 2">Talk:Jenna_Jameson/Archive_2</a> has many instances. If a statement is crucial to the article, then we need to give it, then give the sources that describe it as false. For example, in Situation A, we have to ask, is the article about the newspaper, or about the composition of the moon? If about the newspaper, we can probably just exclude it, the newspaper publishes lots of things every day. If about the composition of the moon, we should include it, in an "alternative views" section; hopefully we have lots of more scientific views earlier in the article. In Situation B, similarly, we need to treat the assertion differently based on what the article is ostensibly about. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 16:14, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Presenting a balanced summary of sources requires discretion and common sense. If some reliable source appears to represent a tiny fringe view then it can be excluded. OTOH, if there is a reliable source which appears to many Wikipedians to present 'false' information, yet is clearly widely accepted by many people and is relevant to the subject at hand, we cannot exclude it. Otherwise, someone can decide to start removing certain well-sourced religious views or historical interpretations they don't accept because they consider them 'false', etc. Of course when we do include something controversial, we attribute it to its source. But we can't just arbitrarily remove well sourced relevant items because editors on a given page decide they are 'false'. I think "attributability, not truth" sums it up nicely. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 16:25, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think what many Wikipedians fail to understand is that we are not here to present the <b>truth</b> - simply a summary of reliably published sources. So if once in a while we'll have a case where all the published sources are plain wrong, we would still not be able to say so, since that would be OR. All we can do in such cases is search long and hard for the <b>correct</b> source, and make sure it is properly presented. I would not even rule emailing a local reporter to write a little blurb about a widely mis-reported phenomenon. Once that article is published, we can then use it. Until then, it would violate our policies to create OR or ignore the reliably published sources. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 17:04, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, there's no policy <i>requiring</i> us to unthinkingly include data. (Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> an indiscriminate collection of information, after all.) And there is a huge difference between a "reliably published source" (which you just wrote) and a previously published <i>reliable source of information</i>, which is the <i>minimum</i> criterion for inclusion. Again, this begs two questions: 1) Doesn't the notion of "reliable source" presuppose some sort of inquiry into the source's reliability? and 2) Even if a source meets the minimum threshhold for inclusion, is the minimum, standing alone, always enough? <a href="../../../d/c/b/User%7EDCB4W_e3cc.html" title="User:DCB4W">DCB4W</a> 22:49, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't disagree with you, though I suspect that it's exceedingly unlikely that we'd encounter a situation where Wikipedians would be aware of the "correct" information and all published, reliable sources would be plain wrong. Perhaps this might occur for very short period of time (a few hours) where the media is relatively slow to publish a story confirming what was already being reported by blogs or such. You're quite correct in your main point: that Wikipedians often see "truth" as the primary goal of the project. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChazBeckett_1565.html" title="User:ChazBeckett">ChazBeckett</a> 17:58, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree with you, and I don't think the policy really supports your argument. Sometimes the "neutral and balanced presentation" of "the best sources" (your words) requires us to exclude the worst source <i>if it's not a "significant minority viewpoint"</i>. We're discussing clearly aberrant data points here, not situations where there's a legitimate debate in the sources. Aberrations, like fringe theories, don't belong in the encyclopedia, even if you can go into Barnes and Noble and buy a book that contains them.

<li>Exactly. I agree entirely with your point, and with the fact that it is supported by examples not accounted for in the replies you've been given. There is a significant potential discrepancy between how this proposal is <i>supposed</i> to work and how it can be <i>expected</i> to work based upon observation of how WP rules are actually applied during editing of articles. When this discrepancy is pointed out, as in this thread or <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_Archive_9_085b.html#Diligent_dissident.27s_scythe" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Archive 9">here</a>, the likelihood of resulting problems is denied, in the face of the contrary evidence. Or it is dismissed as "invalid/irrelevant criticism because nothing's in the new policy that wasn't in the old ones", ignoring the fact that policies, too, exist in the abstract and, <i>differently</i>, as applied, so that when an old policy is re-stated it sets a new norm likely to conflict with the previous norm. Understandably, those who've worked so hard on developing this policy share a consensus and are swept up in its momentum. But that seems to render the policy impervious to other input at this point in the process. That's likely to force these types of concern to be brought up more insistently once the policy is promulgated, in hopes that those who aren't so invested in it can hear concerns that are going unheeded at this juncture. Too bad, but not hopeless. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 23:03, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">A comment and a suggestion</span></h3>
<p>It appears that there is no agreement among contributors as to the precise definition of "original research", nor on the propriety of including "demonstrably false, but attributable" information. I suspect that the present disagreements are likely to continue, unless some steps are taken to clarify the situation.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I would move the following motions:</p>
<ul>
<li>That Wikipedia's Attribution Policy be amended to include an explicit statement as to the situations (if any) where demonstrably false information can be deemed worthy of inclusion on an article page.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That Wikipedia's Attribution Policy be amended to include an explicit statement as to whether or not an editor may engage in independent fact-checking, with the intent of removing or challenging a dubious or suspect statement.</li>
</ul>
<p>I fear that the current wording (which permits the inclusion of false information, but does not openly acknowledge this fact) will result in the worst of all possible situations, and allow unscrupulous editors to convey and disseminate false information under the auspices of a poorly-explained technical provision.</p>
<p>If our encyclopedia allows the inclusion of demonstrably false statements, we should at least be honest enough to acknowledge this fact in a clear and open manner. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 23:06, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that the point about true vs. attributable is easily confused. The point is that it's not what you know, it's what you can prove. But the way it is presented, it makes it sound that it's OK to make a case you know to be false. I have been thinking that we need to say the it's OK to do OR, it's just not OK to include it in articles. So you can do OR on the reliability of sources, and you can talk about it on the talk page, but you can't say a source is unreliable in an article based on your research. You can say that source A says that source B is unreliable, and present verifiable evidence from source A if you found that in your research, as long as you are not making your own synthesis, and just using the reliable source. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 01:40, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My own take is that there is no 'true' or 'false' statements at WP. We have attributable or non-attributable statements -- the attributable ones stay, while the others go. The concept that Wikipedians are somehow empowered or expected to determine the ultimate truth is plain wrong, and contradictory to our mission here. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 02:08, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Determining the truth would be OR, and not allowable. But there should be some responsibility for vetting the sources presented. It's not enough that a source meets <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> guidelines, an editor needs to present them in good faith.

<dd>If 'demonstrably false' means that our attributable sources are in conflict, then I agree. For example imagine a case where source A says that source B says C, and we can plainly see that B says D, where D clearly differs from C. In such clear cut cases, where the reader may simply be confused if we ignore the discrepancy, and where we have no third party source describing it, we may do it in a very neutral manner, with minimal verbiage, IMO. For example we could say: "A says that B says C,[1] but B appears to say D.[2]". Even in this case we don't say that A is wrong, only that the sources appear to be in conflict. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 02:26, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Clearly RS can be wrong--newspapers print corrections all the time. The original incorrect material is attributable, but demonstrably false.

<dd>I don't think so. In that case we won't be acting as faithful summarizers of attributable statements, but as censors of what we consider to be conflicting statements. Obviously if sources are weak in the first place and they conflict this way, it would be one more reason not to include them, but once the published sources are deemed otherwise reliable and verifiable, then I believe we have a duty to report the facts, and deal with any discrepancies that may arise. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 02:36, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not at all. Your concept of an encyclopedia is different from ours. An encyclopedia is not the Book of Truth - it is simply a summary of reliably published information. Thus even 'demonstrably false' information, to use your words, would be included. By publishing it in WP we are not making it 'true' - we only recognize that is was published by a reliable source, without rendering our own opinion about it. I don't see any absurdity in that. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 03:07, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, it does sound like you have a different concept of encyclopedia than I do. An encyclopedia is a general reference work, and like all reference works is practically useless if its information is incorrect. I really don't see WP or any other encyclopedia as a literature summary. Our content policies are the way they are as a means, rather than as an end; we focus on source-based research because, by and large, it's one of the best ways (and sometimes <i>the</i> best way) to present full and fair coverage of the subject, not because we think literature reviews are fun. <a href="../../../d/c/b/User%7EDCB4W_e3cc.html" title="User:DCB4W">DCB4W</a> 01:50, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A few of my thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>I think part of the problem has to do with the type of fact checking. Not allowed: conducting your own telephone survey, and using it as evidence to remove something on WP as untrue. Should be allowed: comparing internal consistency of a source, whether the information has been accurately portrayed, whether contrary statements have been ignored, etc. Also should be allowed: looking to a primary source to see if it actually says what a secondary source attributes to it.</li>
<li>Another part of the problem: the excessive reliance on he-said-she-said to establish factual information. To make a factual statement, I believe an encyclopedia generally should require not just one source, but several sources to make that point. If only one person says something (which would often be the case with something that's not true), that information should probably be removed as an extreme minority viewpoint. If many people say it, on the other hand, then it probably should be reported whether true or not. This might apply in many situations.</li>
<li>Somewhat unrelatedly, one concern I have with combining the policies is that people would then simply be able to say "Please see <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>" as a supposed explanation for the removal of material, which really then explains nothing, and subsequently gives immense wiggle room for the person citing the policy to slip and slide around in his or her basis. Maybe a problem or maybe not.</li>
<li>Relating to point 2, one problem I'm also seeing is the use of NOR to disallow the very most basic synthesis of material, which seems to me fundamentally necessary in putting together a paragraph. If WP really can't synthesize anything, then the result is precisely this excessive reliance on single sources, since putting sources together, naturally, requires some synthesis. Yet, it would seem to me that an encyclopedia should absolutely be trying to put paragraphs together that compare and describe different sources and how they fit together. My experience with these policies is limited, but that strikes me as a major issue. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan79_33e2.html" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> 04:25, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Mackan's summary seems to make a fair bit of sense. That said, there is at least one circumstance where we can definitely do this- cases where a source later issued a correction.

<dd>Peer review is only one of a number of criteria. And journals have varying degrees of peer review, they can claim peer review but have pretty low standards for it, or only do it in some cases. The context of a study should be included in an article so readers can decide how much credibility to grant it. And results of a study should be presented as just that - things shouldn't be presented as "fact" unless there's extremely widespread and documented acceptance.

<dd>I've done a little checking. From what I have read, every chapter in a science textbook is submitted to peer-review by the publisher prior to publication. The sample chapters are often (always?) peer-reviewed even before the manuscript is accepted for publication. I've asked for clarification on the sci.physics newsgroup. The sources I've found the information in are how-to manuals for science writers via google and amazon searches but it may be that some publishers are more reliable than others (doubtful given that the big universities set the standards for all college textbooks just as the big states do for K-12 textbooks). -<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparaig_444b.html" title="User:Sparaig">Sparaig</a> 03:29, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

This issue is quite important for this wikipedia page, IMHO, because while everyone says that "we don't just allow peer reviewed sources because that would eliminate textbooks as sources" the fact is that textbooks are probably the MOST peer-reviewed sources of scientific information out there. Not only is the basic science itself virtually (always?) always based on journal articles that are peer-reviewed AND widely accepted, but the chapters and the overall text itself passes an extensive peer-review process, not only for accuracy, but for presentation and style and usefulness to other teachers in the field. IOW, the example is specious: college science textbooks are more peer-reviewed than journal articles--generally FAR more peer-reviewed.This is one important reason why book publishers claim that they aren't over-charging for college textbooks: the peer-review process is extremely time-consuming and very expensive. -<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparaig_444b.html" title="User:Sparaig">Sparaig</a> 19:05, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Unintent)If we can demonstrate that textbooks are peer-reviewed (and it seems Sparaig has begun to do that), splendid. Once the editors reach a consensus that textbooks are peer-reviewed, this should be mentioned in the policy, because I don't think it is widely understood by potential editors. Also, there are worthwhile science publications that appeal to a more popular audience (<i>Scientific American</i>, <i>Nova</i>, and <i>New York Times</i> science section, for example), that either are not peer-reviewed, or it is not apparent from looking at the publication that they are peer-reviewed. Such publicatons may be more useful in explaining concepts to Wikipedia's readership than a cutting-edge research journal would be. So I still don't think that we should require that only peer-reviewed sources should be used for science articles. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 19:29, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't mean to insist that only peer-review should be used (though I think a case can be made that peer review is better than not), only that arguments against only using peer review that are made using science textbooks (not sure about other kinds) as an example of non-peer-reviewed sources are wrong: college-level science textbooks (at least) are most certainly peer-reviewed and more-so than almost any journal article. The point is to make sure we're arguing from the facts, if possible. -<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparaig_444b.html" title="User:Sparaig">Sparaig</a> 20:04, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Strong Objection</span></h2>
<p>This page purports not to be creating policy innovations. However, <a href="../../../r/e/f/WP%7EREF_ecd4.html" title="WP:REF">WP:REF</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> are guidelines, not policy. This document incorporates too much of the content of those documents not to be seen as creeping innovation. I cannot help but feel that this direction of creeping innovation has made Wikipedia worse over the past year or so (for instance the bazillion pages littered with citations whereby some self-proclaimed expert is trying to enforce his POV with what he deems to be reliable sources (and where <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nationalism.html" title="Nationalism">nationalism</a> gets involved, it just gets ugly)).</p>
<p>Aside from the innovation matter, this proposed policy is far less clear than the two it is trying to replace. The nationalist misunderstanding (and its variations) will be perpetuated and accentuated, and élitism will be re-inforced (there *is* a cabal), an élitism which I cannot reconcile with <a href="../../../d/b/n/WP%7EDBN_b18e.html" title="WP:DBN">WP:DBN</a>.</p>
<p>Two policies give two lines of attack against the bad-faith "but I've attributed everything" brigade. One policy gives just one, and this proposed policy would not be a very good one at that.</p>
<p>I am not advocating an "if it's not broke, don't fix it" approach to the two policies concerned. My opinion is that they are very much broke, but that this is absolutely not the way to fix them. <a href="../../../a/4/3/User%7EA435%28m%29_7574.html" title="User:A435(m)">A435(m)</a> 22:29, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I beg to differ. I think Wikipedia keeps improving, both in content as well as its body of policies and guidelines. The merging of WP:NOR and WP:V into WP:A is very natural, and we can still point to sections within WP:A to get to specific issues. Combining two policies that overlap and hence create coherency issues, will improve our content policy structure even more. Also, IMO the name itself is excellent, as it conveys the essence of our content policy: attributability. Verifiability was always a confusion point, as it implied some kind of verification of the stated facts, whereas what we really meant is that we just want proper attribution. IMO this merge and the new name are a major step forward. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 22:49, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is a major change, and in my opinion, one for the significantly worse. If something is <i>really</i> "common knowledge", it won't take but a minute's Googling to find a thousand reliable sources for it. If you can't do that, the knowledge is not as common as you thought it was. Regardless, though, this is discouraging the removal of unsourced information, something we should be <i>encouraging</i> people to <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">be bold</a> in doing, and this change opens the door to fighting over whether or not it should be removed. If it's unsourced, and someone chooses to challenge and remove it, it should stay gone until sourced, end of story. This was advertised as a <i>merge</i>, not a <i>policy change</i>, and that change in wording is a significant policy change. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 00:02, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Question</span></h3>
<p>CJC, could you say precisely please what is in here that is not in V and NOR? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:04, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here's one example:</p>
<p>WP:V reads as follows: <i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth. "Verifiable" in this context means that any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source. Editors should provide a reliable source for quotations and for any material that is challenged or is likely to be challenged, or it may be removed.</i></p>
<p>WP:A reads as follows: <i>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a publisher of original thought. The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is attributable to a reliable published source, not whether it is true. Wikipedia is not the place to publish your own opinions, experiences, or arguments.</i></p>
<p>I would submit that there is a qualitative difference between "The threshold for inclusion [is] not truth" and "The threshold for inclusion [is] not whether it is true". The former wording is ambiguous, but it could be read as meaning that truth is <i>insufficient</i> as a standard for inclusion. (It could also be read to mean that the simple fact of a statement not being false is insufficient to permit its inclusion.) The latter wording implies that truth is irrelevant.</p>
<dl>
<dd>They both imply that. What matters, here and in V and NOR, is that the material be sourced, not whether any individual editor thinks it's true or otherwise. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:32, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In that case, do you believe that Wikipedia should explicitly clarify that (i) truth is irrelevant, and (ii) information that can be demonstrated as inaccurate may still be included (and presented as a simple statement of fact), if it can be shown to be derived from a "reliable source"? <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 03:39, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>CJC, please listen to what people are saying. <b>We are not changing or arguing about the policies on this talk page.</b> This is just a merge. If you want to argue about substantive issues, you should go to the talk pages of V or NOR. I'm not going to get drawn into a debate about changing policy. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:42, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I would further submit that there are some situations where truth (or, if you wish, accuracy) is quite relevant to our purposes. While it is not within our mission statement to define the "truth" in regards to any particular subject matter, there are nevertheless some circumstances in which certain statements may be shown to be demonstrably false (ie. "Author A writes that Author B writes C in Document D. Author B does not write C in Document D"). I have difficulty believing that it was ever the intention of WP:V or WP:NOR to ward against the removal of false-but-attributable statements.</p>
<p>It seems to me that an overly strict reading "The threshold for inclusion [is] not whether it is true" will open the door for unscrupulous editors to include attributable information which they know to be factually inaccurate, and I cannot help but think that this would compromise the reputation of our project somewhat. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 03:27, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I should add one further comment. Although I've had several disagreements with SlimVirgin having to do with content issues, I've generally admired her work on policy. In this instance, however, I fear that our "clarification" of policy is taking us in the wrong direction. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 03:36, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>CJ, you're an editor who often engages in OR, and therefore it's not surprising that you object.

<dl>
<dd>'Knowing' whether something is false or not, is OR. Our job here is strictly to determine the quality of a source, and if it is of sufficient quality, and otherwise relevant and pertinent, we include it. This has nothing to do with our own perception of the <i>veracity</i> of the source. You seem to think that WP is the Book of Truth. It is not - it is a neutrally presented summary of reliably published information. Both V + NOR, as well as A, make that very clear. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 03:36, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hopefully this'll be my last response because this is going nowhere. CJ, you keep on repeating that you think there's a difference but you can't show how and no one agrees with you. "The threshold is not truth" and "the threshold is not whether it is true" mean the same thing viz. that sources, not truth, are what matter. I'm constantly adding stuff to this encyclopedia that I think is nonsense, but it's well-sourced and others disagree with me, so in it goes. That's what both those sentences mean. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 03:54, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually, I've explained my rationale, and three other editors (including yourself) have indicated their disagreement. I continue to believe there's a qualitative difference between the statements, insofar as the former is more open to interpretation. If the consensus view is that the statements are identical, however, I'm prepared to drop the point.</p>
<p>I will also note that I'm not opposed to the principle of merging WP:V with WP:NOR. I simply have some concerns about the "clarifying" language.</p>
<p>Finally, I'll note that there's a difference between printing material that we believe to be nonsense, and printing material that can be demonstrated as inaccurate. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 04:45, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The old "verifiability, not truth" had a noun in opposition to another noun; the new version has a clause in opposition to another clause. Both were sylistically balanced. To change it so as to have a clause followed by an opposing noun would be a bit clumsy, in my view. And I think it's good to have a clause for the "verifiability" bit ("whether material is attributable to a reliable published source"), as it gives more information. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">Musical L</a><a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist">inguist</a> 10:35, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Truth <i>is</i> insufficient as a standard for inclusion. There's the covered-bridge example above, where the published sources are jointly wrong, but the facts are unverifiable - I hope that's rare. More importantly, it may well be true that the new band The Zebra-Striped Ocarina (I hope I've made up a name too lame to be a real band) has formed, and has played at the members high school; but we delete their article under <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> all the same. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 18:05, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">truth and verifiability</span></h2>
<p>I am a little bit concerned that the "verifiability/attributability-not-truth" formulation is unfortunate. I'm guessing that it has a long history, and that ultimately it started as an arresting way to highly the importance of verifiability (now attributability) rather than to dismiss truth outright; it was a rhetorical defence against <a href="../../../s/o/a/WP%7ESOAP_5cc8.html" title="WP:SOAP">WP:SOAP</a>. It strikes me, however, that the best articles are not completely unconcerned with "truth", and that there are some articles where "truth" remains an important category. Think, for example, of various bits of pseudo-science, where advocates are out there producing attributable material that is on the borderline of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, which mainstream scientists are ignoring, but which well-meaning advocates will push into wikipedia. Having "attributablity-not-truth" embedded into policy gives the upper hand to pushers of fringe theories. Wouldn't it be better to water down the opposition between attributability and truth here with a "not merely" or "not necessarily"? that is, to identify "truth" as a necessary but not sufficient condition? <a href="../../../s/e/m/User_talk%7ESemperf_0e01.html" title="User talk:Semperf"><font color="#008000"><b><i>semper fictilis</i></b></font></a> 15:10, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>We can agree on the attribution of a claim to a published source. We can even sometimes agree on what is "reliable". There is no agreement on what "truth" is.

<dd>Let's not throw out the baby with the bathwater.</dd>
<dd>We agree that if something is true but not attributable to a RS, it doesn't belong in Wikipedia. And we agree, I think, that if something is false but all the RS's agree on it, it can be mentioned in Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>Nevertheless, truth (or what Wikipedian editors perceive as true or false) does and should play a role in the writing of Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>If a statement in Wikipedia is false, it should be changed. If an editor or editors know that it's false, or thinks it's likely to be false or contentious, they can change it into an explicitly attributed statement -- for example: change "It never rains in California<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>" to "According to the CWS, it never rains in California<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>". Or, they can delete it or modify it to a different attributable statement. If some Wikipedian editors disagree about whether it's true, they can usually still find a wording that satisfies both sides.</dd>
<dd>It's not always possible to know for sure what's true -- but that doesn't mean truth has nothing to do with the purpose of, and method of writing, the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 01:34, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Truth can never truly be known, so I think it is worded very well. This is an important distinction. Keep in mind an encyclopedia should not present anything new, but on show that which is already part of society. Thus in many cases(such as where the common knowledge of the subject is contrary to the truth) the truth would be inappropriate. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC"><small><sup>High</sup></small>InBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 01:44, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Truth can <b>never</b> be known? Really? What's 2+2?</dd>
<dd>I continue to think that hard-core epistemological skeptics should probably not write reference works. Some truth can be known with a reasonable degree of certainty. Where it can, it doesn't hurt to say so. The reason for the policy is that, to <i>promote</i> reliability, we can't allow <i>individual editors</i> to proclaim the truth. Data must come from a reliable source. It doesn't help to get carried away with rhetoric, or to try to make the policy into something it isn't.<a href="../../../d/c/b/User%7EDCB4W_e3cc.html" title="User:DCB4W">DCB4W</a> 03:09, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The practical difficulty here is that the encyclopedia has different sections to serve different audiences. In some cases -- politics, religion, ideology, articles on culture, etc. -- these cautions can be helpful because editors are constantly using Wikipedia to proclaim truths that are obvious to them and on initial discussion of the need to cite sources, often respond by simply adding a footnote to an edit written in "this is the way it is" style. There really does need to be something in the written policy to back up efforts to explain to an editor the need to say "according to" and to convey, on disputed matters, that just because an opinion is referenced means that it can be presented as Wikipedia's own position or "the truth". Meeting this practical need, however, certainly doesn't require Wikipedia to adopt or proclaim its own epistemological philosophy or any elaborate ideas about the nature of truth.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">If this is now Policy...</span></h2>
<p>I gather that WP:ATT is now considered Policy... a merging of WP:V and WP:NOR. I have no problem with this, but I do have a concern with how this is being done. At the moment all three Policies are up and running... and this is going to lead to confusion and argument. The three policies do not completely agree with each other (or to put it more exactly, they agree with each other in surface substance, but they differ in greatly in tone and emphysis). This is especially noticable in the area of reliability of sources(especially Self-published sources - a frequent area of controversy) are dealt with. Look at them side by side: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Sources" title="WP:V">WP:V#Sources</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html#Sources" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR#Sources</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html#Reliable_sources" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT#Reliable_sources</a>. As a frequent contributer at WP:RS... a guideline that is supposed to help explain this particular aspect of Policy... I am seeing this conflict of tone writ large. Many of the questions we are asked involve parsing Policy statements and intent. Those of us at WP:RS agree that we need to conform what is said there to what is stated in Policy, but right now there is confusion as to <i>which</i> policy we should conform to. I would therefore request that, if WP:ATT is indeed confirmed as Policy, we redirect WP:V and WP:NOR to this page. If not, please move WP:ATT back to "proposed" status until the community can reach consensus. I don't care which, but we need clarity and not confusion. I have posted this request at the Village Pump Policy Page as well. Thank you. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 15:25, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>ATT has been tagged as policy for 8 days, and as far as I can tell there are no outstanding objections. Perhaps it is time to implement the redirects? It is somewhat pointless that wording changes continue to be made to the old policies, but these changes will be lost when the old policies become redirects. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 17:45, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Status of WP:RS?</span></h2>
<p>Looking at some of the tags notifying people that WP:ATT is now Policy (and that WP:V and WP:NOR are to be merged into it) I have seen a statement that WP:RS is to be demoted to being a FAQ. I think that is a mistake. I think it is very helpful to have a guideline that further explains what what constitutes a reliable source and what does not. I would like to see RS remain a guideline, but one tied to <i>this</i> Policy as opposed to WP:V and WP:RS. As I see it, it would not say anything different than what is said here... it would just say it in more depth and with more guidance (which is what the difference between a guideline and a policy should be). If you agree, please pop over and help us conform that guideline to both the wording and the intent of this policy. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 20:54, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I strongly agree with particular reliable-sources issues being dealt with in an FAQ while the principles of the matter are covered in a single policy page. The FAQ structure doesn't change the presentation of the issues, as far as I can see: if you think some issues are missing, add them. The point about an FAQ is that it gives no one the illusion of being policy. We had got to the state with the Reliable Sources page where some people regarded it as containing policy and some people edited it without at the same time editing Verifiablility or No Original Research to the same effect. Being an FAQ removes any possibility that the page may itself seem to be policy: only the policy pages are policy, and the FAQ is no more than a reference page for practical issues that arise from policy. All principles to do with the reliability of sources should be covered in the Attribution page: if you think there are any left out, please add them. All practical issues to do with the reliability of sources should be covered by the FAQ page: if you think there are any left out, please add them. There should be no place for a separate, semi-autonomous page on Reliable Sources, if everyone takes that approach. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 21:28, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Trying to rewrite WP:RS again gets back into the whole debate over whether to have a spirit-based guideline, where there are degrees of reliability, or a checklist reliability is on/off one. For the record, I think it should be spirit-based. What the FAQ says about WP:RS is heavily focused on whether certain types of sources should be considered reliable or not, not why they should be considered reliable or not. It is very heavy on self-published sources, a controversial topic, without explaining well why self-published sources are generally reliable.</dd>
<dd>Also, the problem with the examples-based approach is that not all sources of a particular type are always self-published. A wiki could, for example, only be open to editing by carefully selected experts, if account creation required a rigorous approval process and only registered users could edit. Also, it is inefficient and long-winded to denounce each type of self-published source separately when the problem is the lack of editorial oversight, which they all have in common.</dd>

<dd>That may need to be made clear. Various sources recently, including the prose at the header of this policy, suggest that only WP:V and WP:NOR are being replaced.

<dd>Actually, this part of the chat is the first I've heard of RS's replacement. I'm largely indifferent as to that issue-- the practical distinction between a guideline and a FAQ is probably not huge, and in any event, the definition of "reliable source" has always been left fairly vague on purpose. So while I don't much care if that's done, EngineerScotty is absolutely right: it definitely needs to be advertised better. <a href="../../../d/c/b/User%7EDCB4W_e3cc.html" title="User:DCB4W">DCB4W</a> 23:48, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As far as I'm concerned we have now (give or take a day or so) agreed to replace V and NOR with ATT but the announcement to deal with RS has yet to take place. Once the technical aspects of the replacement of V and NOR with ATT are completed, and the announcement of a proposal to deal with RS occurs THEN we can argue that issue.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Improving"?</span></h2>
<p>Reading through policy I'm very confused now: we have to attribute all information that we include in Wikipedia per WP:A.. but if adding that information "improves" Wikipedia, we apparantly <i>don't</i> have to, due to WP:IAR. What constitutes an improvement here? The document WP:A itself suggests that it exists in order to verify that information is correct, and the importance of this implies that Wikipedia would be "improved" if it held more correct information; this is supported by the discussion above - that objectively false information incidentally published by a reliable source should not be retained. But if this principle is applied it means that an objectively true fact that is not published could be included in any article, since increasing the amount of truth on WP is an improvement and thus WP:IAR trumps all else - but directly contradicts the opening paragraph of WP:A. How is this resolved? Hyphz 04:51, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>If you're adding unsourced information, that does not improve Wikipedia. Note also in practice what happens: If you add an "objectively true fact" which no one contests or finds at all suspicious, then it will remain there until someone gets around to properly sourcing it; if someone contests its truth, the only way you can convince them of its truth is by reference to reliable sources. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 05:27, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm confused about the redirect destination of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, since it goes to a section called "reliable sources". Could perhaps the following text, or something like it, be added:
<dl>
<dd>Attribution means that any reader should be able to <b>verify</b> that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source. Editors should provide a reliable source for quotations and for any material that is challenged or is likely to be challenged, or it may be removed.</dd>

</dd>
<dd>It is essentially the 2nd sentence from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> with "check" replaced by "verify", which is bolded because of being a redirect destination. Since this is the sentence from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> that introduces the term "reliable sources" it might be a good section intro here. I mean from a geeky consistency point of view this is just so neat that I had to suggest it, but I don't know if perpetuating the term <i>verify</i> is practically a wise thing, so there are things to consider; but at least some section intro would be helpful if WP:V is redirecting there. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 11:41, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree, with Marksell about that specific sentence (which I missed). On the other hand, your other addition: <i>The only way to demonstrate that you are not presenting original research is to cite reliable sources that provide information directly related to the topic of the article, and to adhere to what those sources say.</i> is not necessary as the requirement for sources is already explained in the policy. When we had V and NOR decoupled, we needed that text in NOR. Now that we have merged, it is unnecessary in my opinion. It is not a big deal, Dragonfield.

<dd>I just re-added the one under key principles, but tweaked to "If no reliable, third-party sources can be found for an article topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it." I thought that "If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources..." could be mis-interpreted: deleting a start-up, say, which has no reliable sources but for which reliable sources could be found.

<dd>The problem with that sentence, Marksell, is that it introduces the term "third-party sources", a term that is not used elsewhere in the policy. I would stay with the confines of "Alone, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary sources</a> and sources affiliated with the subject of the article are not sufficient for an accurate encyclopedia article." as per {{<a href="../../../p/r/i/Template%7EPrimarysources_fe8b.html" title="Template:Primarysources">primarysources</a>}}, if at all. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 20:48, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I was hesitating in the back of my head over "third-party" and just dropped it. Partly, I just like the pithiness of the sentence. If it introduces no adjectives beyond "reliable" I think it inarguable. I really don't like the wording of that template, though--"and sources affiliated with the subject of the article"? What does that mean? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 20:54, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>One: secondary sources are <i>required</i> for an article to exist is an innovation.</dd>
<dd>Two: "sources affiliated with a subject" is plain bad wording and I don't think we should be pointing to it.</dd>
<dd>Three: I'm not getting the radical re-write with "If no reliable sources can be found for an article topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it." Yes, in certain cases a self-published source is considered reliable. So it's always been, and so the sentence is consistent. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 21:31, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If this policy holds that "an article can be based entirely on self-published sources", that is a radical departure from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>'s "If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it."

<dd>(ec) Well, I thought by proposing "If no reliable sources can be found for an article topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it" I was proposing a compromise, but apparently not.

<dd>To split hairs, Robert's is identical to mine (and thus I'm not sure what the issue is), except for reverting to "has no reliable sources" v "no reliable sources can be found".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposed change to self-published sources section</span></h2>
<p>(copied from <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EVerifiability_44f5.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Verifiability">Wikipedia talk:Verifiability</a>)</p>
<p>I'd like to suggest a change to this paragraph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Self-published material may be acceptable when produced by a well-known, professional researcher in a relevant field or a well-known professional journalist. These may be acceptable so long as their work has been previously published by reliable third-party publications. However, exercise caution: if the information in question is really worth reporting, someone else is likely to have done so."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I would like to do two things:</p>
<dl>
<dd>(a) remove "or a well-known professional journalist." I have seen this being (as I see it) abused a few times recently; lots of professional journalists are now setting up blogs and publishing material there that their newspapers might not be willing to publish. Allowing editors to copy that material arguably puts us at risk in the same way the newspapers might be put at risk. I suggest we restrict the use to "well known, professional researcher in a relevant field" — any journalist that fits that description can then be used, even on his or her blog.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(b) add to the end: "If a third-party source has published the same or very similar material, that source should be used in preference to the blog." That is, if the same or very similar material is found both on an acceptable blog and in a reliable third-party source, the blog should not be used.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>If two acceptable sources, one from a reputable publisher and the other self-published, are available, I would cite the reputable publisher version, unless access to the reputable publisher version costs money and the self-published version is free, in which case I would cite both. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 21:07, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd strongly disagree with (a). Journalists sites are a useful source of material, and they are, as a general rule, fairly responsible about what they include in them. I've never heard a journalist referred to as a 'researcher' (however much research is part of their job, it's not a common word that's used to refer to them). I do, however, still propose either changing 'researcher' to 'notable expert' or adding it as an additional option. This change might obviate the need for journalists to be included -- the most important journalists would usually be considered notable experts in their field, I think. Regarding (b), I agree with Gerry Ashton's point: if the third-party source is one that isn't freely accessible, both should be included. Otherwise, this seems pretty much common sense. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 23:16, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>We are discussing "journalists" as if they were all cut from the same cloth. That is not the case, and SlimVirgin's concern should be addressed: Some journalists that publish blogs are not experts in a specific field, but often are biased towards one position or another (that is why the publish blogs, to bypass the burden of editorial oversight). A journalist's blog is no different tan an <a href="../../../o/p/-/Op-ed.html" title="Op-ed">op-ed</a> in most cases. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 22:50, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I agree with Jossi and SV. I think that by giving a well known journalist a free ride, i.e. the ability to provide otherwise unsourced evidence into WP article, we are creating a giant loop-hole in our content policies. If the material is well sourced and otherwise valid, then why doesn't the journalist publish it in the journal's own site? One could easily surmise that the reason is that the editors there felt the article is improperly sourced, or possibly that it puts the publication at risk, in which case we expose WP to that same risk. I think this loop-hole really needs to be clamped down. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 22:59, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

So long as the material complies with the conditions we've laid out, it may be included; and indeed, in some cases, must be included per BLP; and (b) when used as third-party sources, self-published sources may add key insights or valuable information not covered by third-party sources; again, so long the person is a well-known researcher in that field previously published by third-party sources, it's fine. To add to these exceptions that secondary sources must substantiate the self-published source's opinion entirely misses the point; indeed, if you were to add that, the exceptions may as well not exist. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:14, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was suggesting replacing the existing exceptions. Articles about the subject should not even exist if no reliable source thinks the subject is significant. A reliable secondary source can prove significance, and also provide proof that the self-published source was indeed written by the subject. Also, the current wording, unless it has changed recently, says that self-published sources can only be used in articles about themselves, i.e. not as third party sources.</dd>
<dd>Whether or not someone is a well-known expert (or researcher) can only be proven by recognition from reliable secondary sources, as far as I know. My suggestion addresses that.</dd>

<dd>You mean "If an article topic has no reliable sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it." and "Wikipedia articles should rely on reliable, published secondary sources wherever possible."? The former seems to imply that as long as an article has at least one reliable source, in can also include non-reliable ones, although that is probably not the intention. Also, if self-published sources magically become reliable in articles about themselves, doesn't that defeat the purpose of the first statement?

<dd>Are there any specific modifications that could be made to make you happier with it, or are you totally against it? You said, "To add to these exceptions that secondary sources must substantiate the self-published source's opinion [...]" My proposed version means to say that reliable secondary sources should prove that the self-published source's opinion is significant, not necessarily agree with said opinion.

The same secondary sources that make the articles about self-published sources worthy for inclusion in Wikipedia would at the same time demonstrate the significance of the opinion of the self-published source to the article.

<dd>(edit conflict) <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a>, I am suggesting replacing the selfpub section with something vague, so that we could try this out in a guideline. The current version there leaves out certain exceptions that I (and others, I think) consider to be good.</dd>
<dd>Awhile back, someone posted <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EReliable_sources_archive7_850c.html#Blogs_again" title="Wikipedia talk:Reliable sources/archive7">this</a>, and in the <a href="../../../a/d/n/Adnan_Hajj_photographs_controversy_15e4.html" title="Adnan Hajj photographs controversy">Adnan Hajj photographs controversy</a> article bloggers had uncovered some scandal involving doctored photographs, and many major news outlets gave them credit for it. This is uncommon, but, in my personal opinion, a clear exception. However, these bloggers are not experts, and the article is not about the blog or the bloggers.</dd>
<dd>In <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_BSD_operating_systems_6052.html#_note-10" title="Comparison of BSD operating systems">this citation</a>, the official NetBSD site linked to an official mailing list announcement. So, the NetBSD Foundation proved that they did indeed make the announcement on the mailing list. However, this is not in an article about a NetBSD mailing list, and I don't think the experts exception would work. Not all sources needed to balance things out per <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a>/<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> will fit under the "in articles about themselves" exception, but a refutation can prove a very limitted degree of significance. Should I go on?</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a>, if the opinion of the subject of an article could not be included, that could lead to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and possibly <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> problems.

<p>(unindent) <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a>, I changed the wording on the <s>essay</s> <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_Self-published_sources_da2d.html" title="User:Armedblowfish/Self-published sources">essay</a> a bit, hopefully addressing your concern about self-published sources in articles about themselves, by adding, "Opinions of self-published sources are always relevant in articles about themselves, but per above secondary sources are still needed to demonstrate the article is worthy of inclusion." — <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>) 14:39, 25 February 2007 (UTC), 17:39, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Woah, "Opinions of self-published sources are <b>always</b> relevant in articles about themselves". That's not true at all. Is George Bernard Shaw's opinion of the 23rd October relevant in the article on him? That's a bad edit and opens the door to people claiming license to include every unflattering quote a person has ever made in their article. I really cannot see the problem you are trying to fix here. I'd suggest the bloggers referred to in the the <a href="../../../a/d/n/Adnan_Hajj_photographs_controversy_15e4.html" title="Adnan Hajj photographs controversy">Adnan Hajj photographs controversy</a> example can be treated as experts in this instance, since their opinion has been cited by a reliable source. I have no idea what you are talking about in the NetBSD example, but you appear to be confusing the issue. A mailing list announcement is not made by a mailing list, since to my knowledge mailing lists have yet to gain sentience. Therefore I don't get your point about it only being permissable to be used in article about a NetBSD mailing list. You seem to have indicated that the NetBSD organisation authored the mailing list announcement, and indicate you have a source to that effect, so it therefore is a statement made by the organisation and can be used in an article on that organisation. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:25, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are right, I just removed the statement per you. Do you think there is a better phrasology that would address SlimVirgin's concern without introducing that problem? By the way, I really don't mind if you all edit the essay.</li>
<li>Technically, the mailing list announcement was authored by a member of the NetBSD team on behalf of the NetBSD Foundation, who demonstrated their approval of the message with a link to the mailing list announcement from their main website, which can only be edited by developers trusted with commit access. So, the mailing list announcement was still technically self-published.</li>
<li>All of the situations I can think of where use of a self-published sources seems appropriate seem to involve more reliable sources reconising them in some way. Established experts are recognised by others as experts, fringe theories are reconised by reliable sources refuting them, otherwise unreliable sources and people are demonstrated worthy of having an article on them by recognition from reliable sources. The recognition of a reliable source can also prove authorship, if an author's name is listed.</li>
<li>There may be times when it is appropriate to include a self-published sources opinion on an article not about itself, in a manner prescribed by <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue_weight</a>. For example, the NetBSD citation above is in an article not about NetBSD, but BSD operating systems in general. NetBSD's opinions might also be relevant in other open source related topics. Rather than limiting use of non-expert (or "professional researchers") opinions to articles about themselves, I think we should leave the question of when their opinions are relevant to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue_weight</a>.</li>

<dd>A quote by definition is a citation with a source. Are you saying that a quote must be cited to a particular book, or not just an individual? "Reliable source" applies only to scientific peer-reviewed journals. It does not cover political aspects, which is the bulk of the controversial article body. Within the context of politics, RS simply doesnt apply, and thats why the genius of NPOV is to explain the positional sides. There needs to be some language describing how NPOV trumps an exclusionist applications of RS - particularly in matters where RS is difficult to determine. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">Ste</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">vertigo</a> 02:11, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>RS as stated means distinguishing between sources, not to order their views in a NPOV way, but to exclude sources which are deemed to be "unreliable." How does one make this distinction without violating NPOV, on matters in which "expertise" is subjective. Even the AMA may say something on a medical issue which must be balanced with a differing view, explaining the context surrounding the disagreement. The line between NPOV and RS needs to be stated. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">Ste</a>|<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">vertigo</a> 02:42, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't know how many of you have gone to college or -- in particular -- graduate school. But, in those environments you are taught to cite sources that are not found in several other works or that are not "common knowledge." For example, no one needs to "cite the fact that the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese failed to destroy the oil tanks and sumarines. You would, however, need to credit a source that argued that the failure to destroy the sumarines meant that Japan was destined to lose the war." (Andrea Lunsford, <i>The Everyday Writer,</i> p. 120 [2001]). There — I just cited a reliable source for why every claim doesn't need a citation. Now, those arguing against verifiability in favor of attribution please cite a <i>reliable</i> source from a respected authority on sourcing that says that every statement in an essay needs to be sourced. Thank you.--Buenos días 14:09, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This policy says that <i>not</i> every sentence needs to be sourced. All material must be attributable to a reliable published sourced, but need not actually be attributed. Fourth sentence. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 14:35, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Then why does "WP:V" direct to "Reliable sources"? That section barely mentions verifiability -- much less than the introduction. You also merged "Wikipedia<i>:Verifiability</i>" into "Wikipedia<i>:Attribution,</i>" which are two different things in my mind. It's getting really bad out there. There are some really fanatical editors insisting on actually sourcing every single fact in articles. I just got into a dispute about this at "Talk:Pedro Almodóvar" and at "Internet Relay Chat" on another account. The latter dispute was mainly just a blatant attempt to delete a passage the editors found offensive -- which is the the most common way in which it occurs. A group of editors shows up at an article they don't like (say, "List of ethnic slurs") and then begins insisting on sources. The information can be obtained by a simple Google search, but instead of doing that, the editors just remove the information. This happens <i>a lot.</i>--Buenos días 23:29, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Editors that find a statement in an article that they assess it to be not credible, have the right to insist that a source is provided. When the source is provided the dispute shall end. Of course, if some editors want to editwar, this or any other policy will not help them. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 23:50, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps I wasn't clear. First, an editor insists on a source for a fact that he himself knows to be true, as with Almodovar. In another scenario, he is told that the information is blatantly obvious and instantaneously verifiable, as with "Internet relay chat." The editor refuses to argue about whether it is true or not. "Wikipedia:Verifiability" says that editors should discuss the issue on the talk page, and ask instead of remove unsourced statements. Also, demanding a source when it really isn't necessary is <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">disruptive</a>. These people don't have a leg to stand on, and I agree that there's nothing at all that can stop them. They're, as you said, prepared to edit war in order to enforce their abusive (but increasingly-common) interpretation of verifiability.
<p>Second, "WP:V" should not redirect to this article, and especially to some section that barely mentions verifiability.</p>
<p>Third, I would like to know whether you guys just merged the articles without a formal vote. Did you have a vote, or did you have some sort of discussion where an editor or two took it upon themselves to merge the pages?</p>
<p>In sum, I agree with the line that SlimVirgin pointed out to me on this policy page and I also agree with Professor Lunsford -- who I cited above.--Buenos días 00:52, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps some context may be helpful. Although it may well be less common in some areas of Wikipedia, in many of the religion articles it's actually quite common for a well-meaning editor -- not a vandal or a crank but a well-meaning editor -- to think something "obviously" true that other editors and sources may disagree with. Hence, asking to source the "obvious" is not an uncommon occurrence. This shouldn't be made into a game, and I acknowledge that abusive requests for sources may exist, but in my experience the worst problems are the opposite, editors who simply aren't aware that the opinions they're expressing are their opinons. I would think that <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a> would apply to requests for sources and such requests should not be presumed abusive.

It would be rediculous to require someone to cite such material to the source. Obviously, more substantive things (the definition of a word, an analysis of a topic taken from an encyclopedia, etc) needs to be cited.

<p>Why should something as simple as the birthdate of a living famous Korean scientist be documented? Sources disagree on the birthdate of <a href="../../../h/w/a/Hwang_Woo-Suk_aaea.html" title="Hwang Woo-Suk">Hwang Woo-Suk</a> due to confusion between different calendar systems. Hwang was born on January 29, 1953 in the Gregorian calendar. However, older Koreans often list their birthdate in the lunisolar Korean calendar, which in this case is December 15, 1952. This date is sometimes repeated in English language media without specifying that it is in the Korean calendar, causing further confusion when the Gregorian year and Korean calendar month and day are used together to produce an incorrect birthdate of December 15, 1953. Sources specifying a December 15, 1952 birthdate include the Los Angeles Times and Channel News Asia. The Encyclopedia Britannica (via New York Times) and The Korean Academy of Sciences and Technology cite the December 15, 1953 date. The Korea Times states the birthdate is January 29, 1953. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 06:03, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Taking WP:RS in a new direction?</span></h2>
<p>As I contemplate the impending debate over whether to get rid of WP:RS (replacing it with a combination of this policy and it's FAQ), I find I am of mixed opinions. I think that there is a need for a guideline that specifically discusses the issues of reliability and sourcing... but I also understand the potential for conflict and confusion that having such a guideline could pose. As it stands now WP:RS has achieved a pseudo-policy status... it calls itself a guideline but many people treat it as if it were policy. I think that accounts for some of the resistance to the idea of replacing it. But I also think this is one of the prime reasons for replacing it... we should not have two authoritive statements on the same topic.</p>
<p>I have also been thinking about the most common question that has been asked at the talk page of WP:RS over the years ... that question is "Can I use citation x in an article about y?"... ninety percent of the time, the answer is "Yes, depending on how you use it. It can be used as a citation for the opinion of the author, but not as a citation of fact." In other words, the underlying issue for the question is actually HOW to use the source, not IF the source can be used. Often questions such as this really involve issues of NPOV rather than ATT (or V and NOR as it was then). I see a need for continued advice for these kinds of questions... and hence a need for <i>some</i> sort of guideline on choosing and using sources.</p>
<p>The trick, as I see it, is to provide a guidance page that will not involve the potential for conflict. Thus, I come to the realization that we actually should get rid of WP:RS... and create WP:S (Wikiepdia:Sourcing ... as a working title). Leave the core issues and definitions of reliability to ATT, and instead create a significantly broader, but less authoritive guideline that offers true guidance about <i>all</i> the different aspects of sourcing statements: the different ways one can use a source; the different ways to source a statement; what kinds of sources should be used to cite which kinds of statements; when and how one can use POV sources; etc. As I see it, such a guideline would have repeat what is stated in Policy to some extent, but it would do so from a "guidance" standpoint and avoid language that hints at "rule making" ... it would refer the editor back to Policy frequently. In some ways it would help explain the intent of the policy pages, and avoid contraditing them.</p>
<p>I suppose such a page could be included as a FAQ attached to a policy page ... but since my concept would also tie in NPOV, FRINGE, and some other policies and guidelines, I do see it working better at a guideline level. I would have to draw up an essay to really demonstrate what I am talking about... but I wanted to discuss it here a bit, and find out if others think this is even a possible suggestion.

<dd>It seems good to me. A guideline along the lines of "assessing sources" or something like that. Phrasing that made it very clear it's subsidiary to this policy. I think the major problem with RS was that it wasn't always clear that it was subsidiary to V; it's title was a phrase that was used in WP:V, which kind-of led to the conclusion that when WP:V mentioned <i>a reliable source</i>, it must mean something that is acceptable according to what was described at <i>reliable source</i>. Break this problem, stop it from attempting to repeat the definition of reliable sources, and we'll have a much stronger, more useful guideline at the end of it, I think. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 18:01, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One needs to define what a primary source is before stating how to use it.

<dd>No, Philip. The idea is that we have a short sentence preceding the longer explanation. And the issue at hand is about an edit and by extension, to "content." Each edit needs to be attributed, if challenged. Also note that you have already reverted twice, and as an experienced editor, you should know better. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 22:23, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The section below also has it, Philip, so you're making things lopsided. We start with the key thing, "Edits that rely on primary sources should only make descriptive claims that can be checked by anyone without specialist knowledge," which is the point of the section, and then we move into the longer explanation. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 22:40, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>jossi Who is we? How can one know what is a "primary source", if it has not been defined? The sentence does not explain what a primary source is, so what do you mean by "longer explanation" were is the proceeding shorter explanation?</p>
<p>Each edit to an article page does not need to be attributed if challenged. Sentences in the article need to be attributed, if challenged. As for your last sentence jossi, I think you mean "... I think that as an experianced ..." or at least I will take it that is what you meant --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 22:50, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>IMHO as the sentence stands the sentence has two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no definition of what a primary source is, one has to read further down the page for that. Stylistically it is not elegant to do this. This is a Policy page, it should be written to the same standards as a legal contract and I have yet to read a legal contract, worth the paper it is written on, that does put the definition before first usage.</li>
<li>In line with what is written in the nutshell, it is not the edit which can be challenged, it is the text in the article (in reality a sentence or at the very least a phrase). --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 06:58, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't agree with Philip's line of reasoning about edits having proper attribution; if a fact in an article is properly attributed, and an edit neither introduces a new fact nor disturbs the existing attribution, then the new edit is properly attributed too. However, I have noticed that new edits tend to be held to a higher standard than material already in the article. I suppose this is just a matter of practicality; it's easier to see if a new edit is properly attributed than to rewrite a poorly sourced article. I don't know that we should try to address this situation in the policy. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 19:44, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A question on Primary, Secondary (and Tertiary) Sources?</span></h2>
<p>I raised this at WP:RS a while ago, but I would be interested in what the thinking here is... As I see it, a source's reliability is not determined by its type (primary, secondary, or tertiary), but rather how the source is used. Take, for example, a primary source such as the Declararion of Independance. I think everyone would agree that it is reliable for use as a citation for what it says... ie the statement: "The declaration of Independance says 'all men are created equal'". I would say it is <i>probably</i> a reliable citation to back the statement: "The founding fathers of the United States felt that all men are created equal"... But I would say it is not a reliable source for the simple statement "All men are created equal". In other words it's reliability depends on the context in which it is used. I like having a statement explaining the types of sources... but, as written, I think we unintentially imply that the type of source determines its reliability. We need to correct this impression. I think it can be done with a simple sentence. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 22:47, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The reliability of a source is not always determined by its type, but by how it is used. For example, the diary of a famous politician would probably be reliable as source for a asserting the politician's opinion, but might not be reliable as a source for an assertion of fact.</p>

<dd>WAS's comment reminds me of a difference between Wikipedia and the kinds of papers that style manuals and university professors focus on, which I'll call academic papers for short. The authors of academic papers are usually experts, or at least aspiring experts, and will ordinarily be read by other experts. Vandals and disingenuous POV-pushers are not a problem to the degree they are on Wikipedia. So no formal system has been established to indicate in a paper how the reliability of the source was evaluated. If wikis become even more important in the future, perhaps a formal method of indicating how sources were evaluated will evolve. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 19:55, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that concluding directly that the car was a red Mustang would be OR. It is not up to us to play detective. All we could do in such a case, assuming reliable sources, and no third party source putting the witness statements together for us, is to simply list the statements. IOW, we could report the individual sourced witness statements, but not conclude from them that "the car was a red Mustang". As an example, we don't know if it was the same car, or that the witnesses are reliable, etc. That's a job for the police, or a third party source reporting the case, not Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 11:18, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Anynobody has it right ... The policy states that: "Editors may make ... <b>logical deductions based on fully attributed data that neither change the significance of the data nor require additional assumptions beyond what is in the source</b>. It is acceptable to combine the two sources and state that the car was a red mustang. While it <i>is</i> OR to make this connection, it is an allowable form of OR. What would be unacceptable would be to take it any further... to say it was <i>Joe Blow's</i> red Mustang.</dd>

<dd>Since A and B are factual statements backed by reliable sources, we have no basis to exclude them from an article. That stating them may lead the reader to making a logical (or even an illogical) conclusion does not change this. Yes, it is problematic... I have participated in several talk page debates that center around "implied" conclusions (for a good example, see <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_and_religion_8b6e.html" title="George Washington and religion">George Washington and religion</a>)... it is indeed very easy for a clever POV editor to imply something that, if they actually stated it would be slapped down for being OR.

<p>What is the problem is stating in the article: "Source A states that a color-blind witness to a crime reported the suspect driving away in a Ford Mustang, a witness in source B saw the same car but could only identify it as red." Period. No need for anything else. That is what WP:ATT is advising editors.

<dl>
<dd>Agreed. Also, if the issue is controversial, we may not even juxtapose two sources together if they seem to advance a position. For example, let's say that we have a source that says that a witness saw a person running away from the crime scene at night, and claimed to see some details about the person in the moonlight. We could in theory quote this source, if otherwise reliable and pertinent. Then, some diligent Wikipedian finds that there was no moon at all on that date and time, and decides to quote that, from some almanac. That would be OR by juxtaposition and unacceptable, unless we can find a source that directly mentions the lack of moonlight in relation to the witness statement. In this case, the reliability of the individual sources is immaterial - it is the combination that is unacceptable, per OR. In the red car example we may include the two sources, as they were both directly related to the same event that is the subject, but may not draw a conclusion. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 15:28, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Crum... with a nod to Abraham Lincoln&#160;:&gt;) ... it is definitely not OR to state that there was no moon that night. That is a simple fact that can be backed by a reliable source.

<dd>Blueboar, I think you are missing an important point about OR: we are not allowed to include a source to advance a position unless it is already mentioned by another source in relation to the subject. What this means, in my moonlight example, is that the moonless night fact is only found in the almanac, and by including that fact, even if perfectly sourced, we would be advancing the position that the witness was possibly lying, hence including the moonlight info would be an unacceptable juxtaposition of sources, violating OR. OTOH, if some other reliable source made the point about the moonless night contradicting the witness's claim, then it would be acceptable. The point is, we are not allowed to combine sources where the combination advances a position, unless someone reliable has already published that combination. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 16:02, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone adds sourced data that the witness said it was a moonless night. Someone else adds a statement sourced from the almanac that there was a quarter moon. Someone else adds that that there was heavy cloud cover blocking the moon sourced from a local newspaper. Someone else adds a statement sourced from a rival newspaper that the first newspaper's weather reports are unreliable.

<dd>With some caution, WAS. Although connecting the dots is left to the reader, using specific "dots" may be construed as advancing a certain position.

<dl>
<dd>Yet again, I fail to spell things out because I think something is obvious and I am misunderstood. Sorry for not being more clear. In my example, every added piece of data in which the source did not explicitly tie the data to the subject of the article constitutes "original research" in wikipedia terms and is not allowed to be in the article. So in my example, none of those "data points" can be added in that back and forth "yes, but" fashion of arguing. This is what I meant by "shuts down". The <i>whole</i> back and forth thing is not allowed to take place in the wikipedia article. That back and forth must take place at a reliable published source that is discussing the subject of the article for us to include it. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 17:04, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Again... it all comes down to HOW the sources are used in a particular article. Statements about the sources can be worded and presented in different ways... some of which are neutral, some of which strongly support an implied POV conclusion. You also need to make sure that <i>all</i> the dots are presented (assuming they can be backed by a reliable source) and not just the ones that support a given implication. It is indeed tricky, and does have to be handled on an article by article basis. I think this is really a NPOV issue more than a NOR issue. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 17:05, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My example illustrates the problem with your point what you are saying Blueboar. Everything connects to everything so there is no end to the dots. There are always more. NOR is an excellent tool to help manage articles that anyone can add to. By limiting content to what is sourced from reliable published sources that are discussing the subject of the article, we have a chance to achieve a consensus on what is neutral. Allowing people to add dots they think are relevant opens the floodgates to an infinite number of dots all connected to each other. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 17:19, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

Forty-four of these glaciers are in the Fitzpatrick Wilderness, centered around the highest mountain peaks. However, the state water board for Wyoming lists only 63 glaciers for the entire Wind River Range, and this includes areas outside the forest boundaries.</dd>

<dd>The problem is that some sense we are making the case here that the forest recreational guide are conflating the numbers, and basically lying about the attractiveness of their park.

<dd>Um, the one about forests isn't original research to me because each assertion appears to sit on its own. To take our red Ford Mustang example, it would be okay to say one eye witness reported a red car, whilst another reported seeing a Ford Mustang. The synthesis is in conflating the two to state eyewitnesses reported seeing a red Ford Mustang. We aren't making the case that the forest recreational guide are conflating the numbers, and basically lying about the attractiveness of their park, that's your reading of it. We are stating that A says X and B says Y, and you work out who is lying. You seem to have decided the first recreational guide is lying. Personally, I take the point of view that I'd need to do more research to work out which source is right. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 21:24, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Pictures, audio, and video can be reliable sources. However, interpreting them can be easy or difficult. In the example in this thread, it would be easy to say a car is a Mustang if the brand were clearly legible, but if the quality of the picture were marginal, a reliable source might be required to state that the picture shows a Mustang. Editors should confine themselves to only the most obvious interpretations. Indeed, some editors throw a fit when they see the word "interpret", and will say no interpretaion by editors is allowed whatsoever. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 04:31, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A problem I see with that is that if a reliable publisher publishes a document, for example a collection of papers, we need not care about who originally wrote each paper and when. I agree that it would be most useful to have more information, but I am not sure that we would automatically reject that entire document (assuming it has a publication date of the entire collection). Also, in a related vein, I am aware of many historical documents that have no date nor known author, but have been extensively republished. I would argue that they are acceptable as primary sources, presumably then analyzed by secondary sources. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 16:12, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I would hope that the statement would be interpreted by the average Wikipedian similar to as the rewording suggests. However, leaving out that caveat can lead to misapplication of the line.</p>
<p>If something is simply "widely thought as fringe or extremist", that may be interpreted to mean "according to the standards of the general public". However there are some cases where the general opinion of relevant experts as to what's fringe may clash with the ideas of the public.</p>
<p>For example, many ideas found in, for example, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a> would be thought of as "fringe" by the general public. However, experts in quantum mechanics would support them wholeheartedly as being shown by science.</p>

<dd>An example of a simple logical deduction: Source A states the Confusion Junction School District requires students to use transparent backpacks to reduce the chance of weapons or drugs being brought into schools, and further states no individual school can override or be granted a waiver from the policy. Source B states that the John Wilkes Booth Middle School is in the Confusion Junction School District.

<dd>But not necessarily. What if there is a special grandfather exclusion for JWB? What if they just disagree with the policy?

<dd>I agree with Crum. While the policy may technically apply to all schools, including JWB, a WP editor would have to make an assumption that JWB was following the policy and that no exceptions applied. It's not uncommon for a policy that's universal in theory to have exceptions in practice. It would probably be better to state the information from Source A and B and let the readers come to their own conclusions. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChazBeckett_1565.html" title="User:ChazBeckett">ChazBeckett</a> 20:43, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The risk of error should be kept in perspective. There is always a risk that the sources we rely on could be wrong, or that the editor made typographical errors while copying information from the source, or that the Wikipedia servers corrupted the article through technical failures.

<dd>I agree with you that it wouldn't make sense to forbid simple logical deductions; I guess we disagree that your example required only a simple logical deduction. I think the earlier examples in this section were simple deductions (A is 5 km west of B = B is 5 km east of A). However, the example you provided required the assumption that a particular school was following policy. This is an assumption that could be made by the reader, but probably shouldn't be made by an editor. In what situation(s) would it be beneficial to the reader to have this deduction made for them? In the specific case where it would important to mention in the article whether JWB students have transparent backpacks, wouldn't it be essential to have a primary source that states this? <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChazBeckett_1565.html" title="User:ChazBeckett">ChazBeckett</a> 20:57, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I have a problem with Chaz's east/west example, since it does not really involve a <i>deduction</i>... they are simply a rephrasing of the same information... both of your sentences could be replaced with "town A and town B are 5km apart"... in mathematical terms your statement is expressed by A=B, and B=C, so A=C. not A+B=C. The same sort of true for the backpack example... JBW = School in District, School in District = Clear Backpack, thus JBW = Clear Backpack... this is a logical statement, but not really one that combines two seperate ideas to form a third (which is how I understand the A+B=C statement.)... and as for Steve's Superman cite... I don't see a deduction at all. I see a statement that is directly backed by the source (if you want A=B so B=A). No logical deductions involved. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 21:38, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you wish to have a higher threshold for what constitutes a logical deduction than some other editors, thats fine. However, we must realize that some editors may have a very low threshold for what constitutes a logical deduction, and if not carefully worded, the policy could have the chilling effect of preventing these editors from making useful contributions, or could have the effect of editors removing material that ought to remain.</dd>
<dd>Could you give an example of a deduction that is just barely allowable according to the line you would like stricken; a deduction that you think should be disallowed? --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 21:47, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Gerry, if your question is directed at me... this is exactly what I have been asking for myself. I no longer am sure I know where the line should be drawn. My problem is that <i>thought</i> I had a very high threshold... but it seems I have a lower threshold than those who have been responding to me. Statements that I feel are "logical deductions" and should be allowable are apparently not allowable (according to what most people are telling me). So I am trying to figure out what <i>is</i> allowable. if you want to see an example of where I draw the line... look at <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_and_religion_8b6e.html" title="George Washington and religion">George Washington and religion</a>... the information presented, and the implied conclusion that Washington was a deist seem a perfect example of a boarderline case of logical deduction ... reliable source A + reliable source B = {not stated, but clearly implied} concusion C.

<p>When it turns into a problem then don't do it. Example: Someone claims something like their birthyear or high school on their web page and we add it to an article with their name as the title (probably not really a biography, but we call it that anyway). Someone contests the data. Fine. So remove it since it is now contested and the source is questionable (COI). Same with what appears to be simple reasonable logic. When it is contested then back off to simply stating what the sources say - maybe even direct quotes not even paraphrasing. Understand that <i>everything</i> is a simplification. Don't complicate it until there is a reason. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 00:31, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would agree that any summary tends to draw some inferences from sources and this is not intrinsically a problem, but contesting should be allowed and a contested inference should be strikable. It's amazing what people will consider an "obvious" logical consequence, particularly when it comes to viewpoints they feel strongly about. We regularly get folks who object to Wikipedia having any articles on religion on the ground that atheism is a simple logical consequence of scientific observation. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 02:59, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I have ideas on the style and direction that such a guideline would take (see some of my rantings above), and I am sure that others have ideas as well (see, for example, Jossi's excellent idea for discussing what <i>is</i> reliable and how to assess such sources - below). In other words, I agree that RS should eventually be redirected... but I would strongly advise that this process be done slowly, with LOTS of notice to the general community, etc. RS is a favorite of many editors... as such there will be resistance to merging it.

Some editors are speaking of using "scholarly sources" only, others say "Publisher X isn't considered an academic publisher" and attempt to dismiss a source for that reason, while others say "Publisher Y is too young to be considered a reliable publisher" while dismissing the fact that the author of the book in question is a well-known best-seller author, etc. Any ideas on how we can address and clarify these issues? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 19:09, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The value of different sources is of course relative. For many topics, such as the article you mentioned, there are many scholarly sources, including many from the highest quality publishers, and it is reasonable that they be given special weight. Another relevant question there might be whether to emphasize the authority of Western academic sources or traditional Arabic scholarship.

<dd>We should link to reliable published sources on the subject of "Assessing sources". Whole books have been written on the subject. Any claims made about the validity of using a specific source to provide credibility for a specific claim are claims made about the real world and are not just claims about Wikipedia policy/guidelines. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 20:31, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Rule of thumb I have been toying with is "has someone else cited the author, and the topic I'm citing them on is within the area they've been cited on before?" We certainly need something, but it is all somewhat subjective. Reliable sources should be reliable enough to substantiate what you source I guess, but I know of one editor who has claimed that using a source to describe a work's achievement or impact is an exceptional claim and so requires an exceptional source. Wording this stuff is a nightmare. Sometimes it confuses the hell out of me. I'd be happy if we could just write articles in a balanced way, sourcing what we have written, and discuss any problems with the balancing or the sourcing on article talk pages. Wasn't their at one stage a recognition that the reader would also be able to judge the sources? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 21:27, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, Steve, addressing this is like opening the proverbial can of worms...

<dd>I think we should perhaps guide towards discussing, forming a consensus and dispute resolution more than anything else.&#160;;) Um, how to assess a source in context. I'd say you have to look at where the source is published. Does that publication typically publish on the field. Ask the same of the author. Then check for weighting, is the source likely a fringe view or not. Then check for relevancy. Have a look on google scholar, maybe, and see if anyone else has cited the author or the publication, that'd be useful. Things like that? I mean, pretty much you've got to listen to the source, haven't you. Start from a position of mistrust and build up reasons for trusting. Always compare the source to the bloke in the pub/bar. Is it more reliable than that, that sort of thing, although that one seems a little subjective. Isn't it all subjective though? I mean, sure, most of us who have been around a while sort of instinctively know. I mean, you don't cite Gombrich on Space Exploration, but that doesn't mean Gombrich is unreliable period. Unless Gombrich happens to have declared "space exploration to be the furthest imagining of modernist art". Which kind of proves the point. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 14:45, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Clarification: "the relevant academic community"</span></h2>
<p>In the Exceptional Claims section, does "the relevant academic community" refer to the smaller group of those who specifically study a topic, or the field as a whole? For example, when talking about <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parapsychology.html" title="Parapsychology">Parapsychology</a>, is the relevant academic community parapsychologists or scientists in general? For a controversial topic to be presented as having general acceptance, does it have to have general acceptance in the mainstream (such as mainstream science) or just general acceptance among experts in that specific field? Specific examples are things like "Parapsychologists say X causes Y" versus just "X causes Y". Is it appropriate with controversial subjects to write an article so that it reflects primarily the scientific consensus of experts in that field (and not science overall)? Do sources for controversial claims need to be general sources, or are publications in journals of parapsychology sufficient? And with controversial topics, is it POV to say "X describes himself as a psychic" or even "X is a self-described/proported/alleged psychic" as opposed to "X is a psychic" (assuming there's no hard evidence demonstrating the person actually has psychic powers)? --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 14:09, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Notability of some of these subjects depends as much or more upon the public attention to them as the scientific attention. There is then typically no problem about finding admiring articles in newspapers, but for a relatively new or obscure one, it can be very difficult to find any science publication that explains the nonsense from a scientific point of view. To do a NPOV article, we need both. This is one place where reliable science websites are useful--and even reliable blogs--for many of the websites are turning themselves into blogs, and some of the blogs are edited, rather than left open to the public. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 22:45, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And Jossi's point is correct about every person AnonEMous names. One could write a worthwhile article on any of them without ever quoting the diaries directly. (Quoting the secondary source when it quotes the diary is a different matter.) The articles are doubtless improved by including primary source material, but the articles should rely on the secondary sources: otherwise, we are committing Original Research.

<p>That sounds good, but needs clarification. There seem to be two slightly different points.

<dd>Robert, that <i>is</i> a very good point... there is a difference between self-published and self-referential/autobiographical sources.

It is published by the U.S. government, and does not list an author, so superficially it is self-published by the government. However, it was actually written by a commission of experts, who reviewed vast amounts of primary source material, so it is really not self-published. As a separate issue, it is a secondary source because of the expertise of the commission and the review of primary source material. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 21:49, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, my point is that "sources independent of the subject of the article" is not the same thing as "published by a reliable publisher". The diaries of Pepys, Frank, etc, are published by major publishers, but are surely not independent of their authors! If the intent is to say "the article is primarily based on reliable and not self-published sources", we should say that, and not "the article is primarily based on sources independent of the subject". Otherwise the current phrasing means "you can only use self-published sources if the article is primarily based on sources independent of of the subject" which wouldn't apply to the list. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 21:50, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Yes, of course, because he is mentioned in <i>thousands</i> of reliable sources he didn't write.</li>

<li>Should we have an article on somebody's cousin Fred, who vanity-published his diary, which has been ignored?

</li>
<li>Should we write the article <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Pepys_035c.html" title="Samuel Pepys">Samuel Pepys</a> from his diary?
<ul>
<li>With caution; Pepys was frank, but he was boastful, and his diary is <i>very</i> long.

<dd>So I guess an example where AnonEMouse's objection would be where X wrote an autobiography published by a major publisher, and also wrote a self-published book on his favorite topic, stamp collecting. Editor Y could write a Wikipedia article titled "X" that is based mainly on the autobiography (although it would be better to use independent sources), but the Wikipedia article could not use any material from X's stamp collecting book, because the article is based mainly on a dependent source. Although this is a potential problem, I don't think it would come up very often. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 22:22, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Nor is it much of a problem. If X is an acknowledged expert on stamp collecting, then he counts as a professional researcher in his field of expertise, so it comes under the second exception.

<dd>Since when is "acknowledged expert" the same thing as "professional researcher"? I doubt that if you asked X he would say that he had ever been called a 'professional researcher in stamp collecting'. In fact, I'm not even sure if there is such a thing, as most professional activity in the field is in the form of trading or writing. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 09:46, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All I want is for the policy to say <u>just that</u>, replace "independent of subject" with "self-published". Here is an example of why it matters, somewhat hypothetical, but quite close to real. Person X has an independently published autobiography. Per the Pepys, Frank, etc., precedent, we are all agreed that is a fine source. The article on her is to a large extent directly or indirectly based on that autobiography. She also has a personal web site, on which she self-publishes information that hasn't made it into the autobio. According to the policy as written it could be argued that <i>that web site</i> can not be cited in the article, since the article is not "primarily based on sources independent of the subject". It's just misleading, and needs to be rephrased. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 21:38, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>NO... independant of the subject is a subset of self-published... one can not replace the other. You are equating "self-published" with "not independant of the subject"... they are different. If I write a web page about person X it is "self-published"... and yet it is also "independant of the subject" (she had nothing to do with writing my page). Assuming my web page meets the other criteria for reliability (say I was an acknowleged expert on X), then an article on X can rely heavily on my self-published page. (However, it would be even better to find multiple sources.)</dd>
<dd>Also, nothing in this policy says her website <i>can't</i> be cited in an article... the policy simply says it should not be the <b>primary</b> source of information. Assuming person X is notable <i>for</i> writing her autobiography, (thus puting her in the same realm as Pepys, Boswell, and Frank) the autobiography will certainly be a major source ... ideally we should look for others as well.

<p>That's what I want it to say too, but it doesn't say that. It says "Material from self-published or questionable sources may be used in articles about those sources, so long as ... the article is primarily based on sources independent of the subject of the article." The article about X is not primarily based on "sources independent of the subject", so according to the current wording, no material from self-published sources may be used. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 15:17, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This seems illogical, if the materials are used with care. Imagine that I want to establish that it would not be unknown in the 16th century to use the juice of unripe grapes as an ingredient in salad dressing. As my source for this, I cite to a primary source, a 16th century recipe book that has a salad dressing recipe fitting that description. If the book is in the rare cookbooks collection at the University of Iowa library, what does it matter that it is unpublished? It is cited, the document exists, and it is in a location where another person could obtain access to it and confirm that the salad dressing recipe I cite really is there.

In fact, instead of it being a book of any kind, make it a collection of private letters written by Queen Elizabeth I's chef to his mother-in-law. Still "published" for Wikipedia purposes?

<dd>The problem then becomes "is your interpretation of this primary source correct?" If in fact the juice of unripe grapes as an ingredient in salad dressing was not unknown in the sixteenth century, and it is some not unimportant and not doubtful fact, then that information will appear in history books, it will be published elsewhere. If you are citing this one-of-a-kind cookbook for something that is never mentioned elsewhere, your interpretation of it may not be reliable. For example, the author of the book may have been some unusual creature of bizarre tastes, which may not be at all important to the history. Many things are "not unknown", but that does not mean they warrant mention as representative in an encyclopedia. Then you are left making the statement "The juice of unripe grapes was used as an ingredient in this one cookbook", which may not warrant inclusion at all, and would probably be misleading as to the time period. There are also other problems with the source, but overall, if the fact is actually important, it will be mentioned elsewhere, and we need professional historians with editorial review working over the course of months or years to verify if it is representative or even accurate. —<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentrx_80e4.html" title="User:Centrx">Centrx</a>→<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECentrx_84e7.html" title="User talk:Centrx"><i>talk</i></a>&#160;• 04:58, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Yes, the point of "published" is to make matters verifiable. The use of rare or manuscript material in scholarship has the hidden assumption that all of the few scholars interested will be willing and eager to travel to see the cookbook, and will succeed in getting permission to view it. This does not describe the situation at WP, where most editors cite books of which they have only seen the title, and articles of which they have at most seen the abstract, because they do not have even ordinary university library facilities. The best way to deal with unpublished material is to publish it on Wikisource if permission can be obtained, and the other way to write an article about it and get that article published. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b>

<p>The word "published" occasionally means two different things on Wikipedia. In the above discussion, it means "made available to the public"--which can include being placed on the Web, being available in a public archive or library, being available (or formerly available) for sale, etc. It excludes materials which are secret, only available in private collections, ephemeral, or which are only found in a highly fluid medium (such as Usenet) such that their authenticity cannot be assumed. Non-published materials can be considered published if documented or vouched for in a reliable secondary source.</p>
<p>Sometimes, "published" is taken to mean "published by a reliable source; this excludes many things like self-published material.</p>

<dd>(after two edit conflicts) The key issue is whether or not the material is available for scrutiny by an unprivileged member of the public. If anyone can make an appointment during regular business hours to look at the material, then it is citable. If it is only available for viewing by members of the House of Lords, or people who are prepared to pay a million quid for a viewing, or people who have indicated they might be interested in buying the collection, or any other exclusive group, then it is not citable.</dd>

<p>Sometimes. A primary source means, "here is a fact never before seen." "A car overturned on Highway 29 last night" this sort of reporting makes the newspaper primary if the reporter was an eye-witness. If the reporter is reporting *from* a public source like a police blotter, than that blotter is primary and the report is secondary. So yes newspapers can sometimes be primary. Mostly I'd say they are secondary. It's isn't "newspaper" that needs to be removed, but rather the language may need to be rephrased better if the intent is not clear. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 17:48, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The reason we might use an account of a traffic accident as an example of a primary source is that many editors have encountered such reports; since different people giving such accounts may be biased, and since each witness only saw the accident from one angle, this example illustrates some of the reasons primary sources should be used with care. The problem with this example is that most such accounts are not published, except the ones that appear in newspapers. If we just say "accounts" without "newspaper", we give the impression that unpublished accounts may be used in Wikipedia, and a careless reader might not notice such use is prohibited elsewhere. If we say "newspaper account" we create confusion, because in many cases, although one passage in a newspaper story may be a primary source, the article as a whole is likely to be a secondary source because the reporter gathered information from several sources, selected the most credible accounts, and created a cohesive summary. Perhaps we should find a different example; something that is usually a primary source, and usually published. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 18:10, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
