<p>The Black Scar of Page Vandalism Scoured 'The Show's' wikipedia profile and so sat the once great Kevin.</p>
<p>Kevin stood in a daze as the black smoke of nothingness engulfed him....."NOOOOOOOO!!!" He cried "It can't be over not since we got this really cool name NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!"</p>
<p>and As he Cried a great flash of light came forth and before him stood Brendan, who of course "IS THE BEST!!"</p>
<p>"I'm The Best!!! Oh and by the way...YOU KEVIN MUST RETURN THE LUSTER TOO 'THE SHOW'!!!" Brendan Cried boomingly "I went a little Ape on the set so you need to go find everything."</p>
<p>"But how its all lost FOREVERRRRRRRR!!!!!" Kevin cried as he bawled in his Tight Jinx tshirt "Oh here use this" and from Brendan great hands came the Bright light, the saving light that is The Katamari.</p>
<p>"I understand!!! I UNDERSTAAAAAAAND!!!!" Screamed Kevin "Well. Go." pushed Brendan, "I need my paycheck too."</p>
<p>As Kevin began to roll The one Katamari, It began to Grow and Grow with all the things 'The Show' needed. Computers, monitors, Neat photoshop graphics, interns and even a special Guest or two.</p>
<p>Tonight on Attack of the Show we have Jimmy Wales and a batch of Other interesting goodies to give to you including a 5 minute look at The Greatest band of All time Three Happenin' guys.</p>

<p>Kevin is eating a birthday cake when Jesus comes in.</p>
<p>JESUS: I want some cake.</p>
<p>KEVIN: No way, get your own.</p>
<p>JESUS: Why not?!</p>
<p>KEVIN: You didn't let me use your blackberry when my wife was in the hospital!</p>
<p>A red filer is put in, dramatic music is played, a thunder effect is used.</p>
<p>KEVIN: Never mind, have the cake, in fact have some coffee, or better yet, have my wallet, anything(while crying).</p>
<p>JESUS: (in a deep scary voice) I will wipe your entrails on my feet, and I will use them as shoes!!!</p>

<p>scene starts with a grainy black and white film showing kevin in an old gangster suit from the 20's. he is sitting in a bar drinking a hard liquor of some sort and is all alone.</p>
<p>kevin: (inner monolouge) If I could go back to that day, I would have given it all up for her.</p>
<p>flashback to "that day", still black and white, not grainy, we see kevin (from a view seeing his face) sitting with a controller in his hand. he is obviosly playing a video game because we seem him grinning, moving his thumbs to press the buttons, and see the glow of the screen on his face.</p>
<p>kevin: (this time he actually speaks) ok, got to kill one more zombie(furiously plays the game) HA! i did it!!!</p>
<p>we then hear from the tv the voice of a female from the game</p>
<p>female: thank you, you saved me from the zombies, i am yours forever.</p>
<p>game voiceovering narrator: press "a" to initiate hot tea minigame</p>
<p>at this moment, we see kevin's thumb about to press with anticipation of the upcoming minigame filled with sex, when suddenly his girlfriend enters the room(in lingerie) and unplugs the video game, making the glow disappear(yes, kevin has a girlfriend in this scene).</p>
<p>kevin: NO!! I was just about to...beat the game(in a questioning voice because he didn't want to say "have sex with a game character)!</p>
<p>girlfriend: come on kevin, dont you want to come to bed?</p>
<p>kevin: (in a huff and upset) ok fine...</p>
<p>back to kevin in the bar, and grainy again.</p>
<p>kevin: (back to inner monologue) i'm so glad i broke up with my girlfriend, because now i can play hot tea all the time. (now speaking) What the hell am i doing here? i have to get back to my woman! here i come hot tea!!</p>

<p>When Sarah starts to talk about the news of the day, she starts to talk about telemarketers slumping to low, low levels such as showing up on online console games. Goes to a scene of sacom 2 where a team finds out that one of the members is a telemarketer trying to sell penis enlargement pills. Then it goes back to Sarah to which she goes on to say that gamers are starting to fight back against the new comers. Another scene goes to halo to a person trying to give out free hemorrhoid cream, to which it goes back to Sarah saying that death match is now being called get the hell away from me, goes back to players talking a bunch of telemarketer nonsense being killed over and over again in death match.</p>

<p>SKIT FOR WIKIPEDIA EDITION OF AOTS</p>
<p>"OFFICE JESUS HITS ON SARAH LANE"</p>
<p>Sarah is at her cubicle, searching for the latest "gems" and various things that are damn good, when Office Jesus suddenly appears behind her. Jesus is looming over Miss Lane; his evil smirk reveals his intentions to extend the holy spirit to Sarah, and he will not be denied.</p>
<p>Startled, Sarah turns to Jesus with a less-than-warm welcoming.</p>
<p>Sarah: What do you want? Jesus: (still smirking, his replies as if Barry White(RIP)was his dating coach) Office Jesus likes what he sees. And what Jesus likes, Jesus gets.</p>
<p>Sarah: (visibly offended) How about getting lost? And shave that dead muskrat on your chin while you're at it.</p>
<p>Jesus: Oooh. Spicy. Not the Mary Magdeline type, huh? Ever had a man turn water to '93 Cabernet Sauvignon?</p>
<p>Sarah: Security! Jesus: (still unfazed) You want to play hard to get. I'll give you some time. Just know that being in the position I am, I have been endowed with many gifts...well endowed.</p>
<p>Sarah: (pissed off) That's it!</p>
<p>Sara digs in one of her desk drawers and pulls out a can labeled "Office Jesus Repellent". Jesus sees his crytonite and now knows that his time to depart has arrived.</p>
<p>Jesus: Toodles.</p>
<p>By the time Sarah turns to spray, Jesus is gone. A female coworker passes by.</p>
<p>Female coworker: Who was that? Sarah: Jesus. Female coworker: You always get the good ones!</p>
<p>Suddenly Jesus reappears, and puts his arm around the coworker.</p>
<p>Jesus(with Barry white smoothness) Hey. Coworker: (caught in his rapture) Hey.</p>
<p>They both walk away. And as Sarah shakes her head in disgust, Jesus shoots a look back at her with a smirk that could kill a kitten. (Since we all know Sarah loves kittens).</p>

<p>Kevin is playing battlefield 2. Then he gets a lightbulb above his head. He dresses up in army gear and grabs the mouse. He does some rolls and sneaking around until he sees someone. Then he aims the mouse and acts like hes shooting them and they go down. Then Kevin exclaims "Yes! Headshot"! Then he goes on to do this to a few other co-workers yelling other exclamations. Then he goes up to a wall and when he jumps around it so does Sarah and Sarah is wearing army gear too like she was playing battlefield too. When he sees Sarah and he stops and smiles and tender loving music plays. Then Sarah knifes him and he falls to the floor and cries while he is dieing (dieing?). I would want to see Kevin cry after the love of his life killed him.</p>

<p>The scene opens with a shot of a persons feet strutting down a sidewalk. Just like in Saturday Night Fever. With maybe some cheesy rip off sounding music.</p>
<p>The camera slowly pans up. And Lo and behold it's the Sixteenth President of the United States Of America Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>Lincoln is headed to the Theater.</p>
<p>Lincoln walks into the lobby and buys some popcorn and stuff. He heads into the Theater. Sits down and starts to watch the movie.</p>
<p>Outside we see John Wilkes Booth. He is sneaking into the theater through an emergency exit, which some people have just left the theater from.</p>
<p>Inside, Abraham Lincoln, is enjoying the movie and eating popcorn.</p>
<p>John Wilkes Booth slides up from behind Abraham Lincoln, and Home rows him. John Wilkes Booth exclaims 'HOMEROW'D!'</p>

<p>FADE IN:</p>
<p>INT. ATTACK OF THE SHOW SET - DAY</p>
<p>KEVIN and BRENDAN are sitting on the trademark red couch. A bottle of vodka and 6 filled shot glasses sit on the coffee table in front of them.</p>
<pre>
                   KEVIN
         Bet I could drink more shots in
         15 seconds then you.
</pre>
<p>Brendan picks up one of the shot glasses.</p>
<pre>
                   BRENDAN
         Oh, you're on!
</pre>
<p>Like a machine Brendan grabs one shot glass after the other, gulping them down.</p>
<pre>
                   KEVIN
         Time! That was 6 shots.
</pre>
<p>INT. ATTACK OF THE SHOW SET - MOMENTS LATER</p>
<p>All the shot glasses have been refilled.</p>
<pre>
                   BRENDAN
              (slightly drunk)
         Ready, get set, go.
</pre>
<p>Kevin empties the shot glass into his mouth but sprays it out right back out.</p>
<pre>
                   KEVIN
              (throat horse)
