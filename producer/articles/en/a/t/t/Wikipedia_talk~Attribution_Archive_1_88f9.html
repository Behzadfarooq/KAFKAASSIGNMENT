<h2><span class="mw-headline">Original research definition</span></h2>
<p>The definition needs to be rewritten, because it confuses <i>defining</i> original research with prohibiting the publication of original research in Wikipedia. It says "Original research refers to material for which no reliable published source could be found...." I'm sure <i>Science</i> would be horrified to discover they don't publish any original research. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 05:40, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>We have an entire encyclopedia people can fill with words detailing the fine points of "original research". Our policy should help editors make content choices, not pretend it can substitute for clue or to substitute for encyclopedia articles such as one on "original research". <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 05:47, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are you suggesting the original research key term be deleted? --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 05:53, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The original research key principle now reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia does not publish original research.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Original research refers to material for which no reliable published source could be found; that is, it refers to material that is not attributable to a reliable source. It includes unpublished arguments, concepts, data, ideas, statements, and theories. It also includes any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This way of phrasing it perpetuates a way that many Wikipedians have of writing about original research on talk, policy, and guideline pages. Anything that cannot, after a reasonable effort, be attributed is original research. This differs from the meaning of original research outside of Wikipedia, where original research involves creating new ideas, as contrasted with regular research, which involves organizing and summarizing existing ideas.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is a publication. To the extent Wikipedia publishes original research, it violates its own policy, but the material is published nonetheless. Furthermore, much of the material in academic journals and newpapers is original research, yet it is published in a reliable source. To avoid a self-contradictory paragraph, I suggest this (italics are to distinguish proposed wording from my commentary):</p>
<p><i>Wikipedia does not publish original research that is not attributable to a reliable source. Previously unpublished arguments, concepts, data, ideas, statements, and theories are excluded, and so are any previously unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position.</i></p>

<dd>Gerry, OR is material for which no reliable source exists, or could reasonably be found (we can never say definitively that no source exists). That is, it is material that is not attributable to a reliable source. Unattributed = unsourced. Unattributable = original research. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:22, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Suppose I create a Wikipedia article that is a verbatim copy of a U.S. patent. It's original research; the law says it has to be novel to get a patent. It's a reliable source. It's not protected by copyright. So Wikipedia has published original research. The reason it does not violate policy is that Wikipedia is not the <b>first</b> publisher; the U.S. Patent Office was the first publisher. To say that something stops being original research just because Wikipedia republishes it is a concept that only exists within Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think a real benefit of combining the No original research and Verifiability policies is we can stop trying to distinguish whether a Wikipedia editor performed original research while composing an article, or whether the original research was done by some other person whom the WP editor copied, or whether the material is original research at all, and just focus on whether the same ideas can be attributed to a reliable source. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 06:55, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't believe the USPTO counts as a reliable source. They may claim that everything they publish is a novel invention, but the facts just don't back it up. They've published a lot of junk in the past. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 08:02, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That isn't especially relevant to the point I was making, but I'd say the USPTO is a reliable source when compared to the spectrum of sources that are accepted on Wikipedia. I wouldn't trust USPTO as much as <i>Science</i>, but I'd trust it as much as the typical evening TV newscast in a medium sized city. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 09:55, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure how long an article which is a direct copy of a U.S. patent would last on Wikipedia, and this seems a very convoluted example. Are there any other areas where this might cause a problem, because at the minute I'm happy that verbatim copies of U.S. patents would be deleted. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 15:18, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This discussion is about whether, using the normal meaning of "original research", and not any jargon meaning that only applies within Wikipedia, should Wikipedia publish original research? On the "yes" side, an article or a passage in an article might be copied from a reliable source that presents original research, and we are allowed to copy from such sources as long as we follow the other policies too. On the "no" side, the process of the Wikipedia editor finding and copying the material is non-original research, so by the time it gests to Wikipedia it isn't original research anymore. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 17:34, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess since this is a Wikipedia policy we'd use the Wikipedia definition. I'd also make a stab that issues like that are so rare and complex they don't really matter. If the only example we have is copying a U.S. patent I'm not sure we need to document that. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 18:15, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(unindent) I'd say that something as prominent as policy, to which new editors will be referred frequently, should use as few specialized definitions, or jargon, as possible. And copying a patent is hardly the only example; anytime we copy material from a primary source, this applies. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 18:26, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think we do copy from a primary source, we quote a primary source. At least, that's my take on it. Copying would violate copyright. And material sourced from a primary source isn't necessarily original research. And I'd say policy on Wikipedia should do what Wikipedians want it to do, and be Wikipedia specific. Otherwise we'd be unable to use the term Wikipedia and Wikipedian, for starters. As long as we explain what we mean, I don't see the issue. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 18:39, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Quoting and copying are nearly the same thing, although quoting has connotations of citing the source and brevitiy while copying does not have those connotations. Not all sources are covered by copyright, for example, patents, US government publications, laws, and court decisions. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 18:53, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Quoting and copying are nearly the same thing, but as you note, aren't for important .

<dd>Whenever Wikipedia copies or quotes previously published original research, it publishes original research, and doing so is perfectly fine as long as the material is properly attributed and copyright laws are obeyed. The quoting or copying is apt to be more extensive if the first publication is not copyrighted. When Wikikpedia assign a jargon definition to "original research" and then says that it is against policy to publish original research, this is an affront to the English language and I oppose abusing the English language in this way. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 19:19, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>The section titled "Some key terms" does not confine itself to defining terms, it also expresses policy (e.g. edits that rely on primary sources should only make descriptive claims that can be checked by anyone without specialist knowledge).

<dd>If you're staging a play nobody has written about, then it's prima facie OR. There's two concepts here. Regardless of whether something is "notable" or not, if we can't find reliable sources to talk about it, it can't be written about. But just because we can find reliable sources, doesn't necessarily mean it's notable. I think we need to clearly separate the two, because otherwise we end up with the concept that "if we can find a single reliable source that talks about it, that means it's notable and we can write about it."

<dd>And it has to be secondary or tertiary (britannica articles only). If you are notable playwright and publish your play on your blog, it doesn't deserve an entry in Wikipedia until a secondary source publishes something about it. The abuse is that notable persons publish views that are not covered by secondary sources. It would technically be Original Research to summarize the play, but if the summary is provided by the playwright, it should still not be in Wikipedia because it's a RS issue. There is also a number of articles that publish original thought by notable people that self-publish outside their area of notability. This type of primary sourcing is particularly insidious because it has the color of authority even though it is not peer-reviewed or covered as a secondary source. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 06:36, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The problem is the play isn't notable.

<p>I changed the first sentence in "Requesting sources" to read "If an article topic has no reliable sources that can be cited, it cannot be written about in Wikipedia because this is not the place to pubish information for the first time."</p>
<p>I made this change because I think this is the covers the gamut of reasons why sources are necessary better than the previous wordings. One previous wording mentioned notability, but something can be notable even if reliable sources about the event do not yet exist. Another wording mentioned that information for which no reliable sources exist is by definition original research. This is not strictly true; a Wikipedia editor copying from a privately held source is not doing original research, but the material must nevertheless be excluded from Wikipedia on the grounds of lack of attribution. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 06:40, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is just our own internal definition of original research. It means "stuff that Wikipedians have made up." This could be a lie, or some other type of fabrication or creative input.

<dd>Indeed; that's what I meant by the word "jargon".

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Secondary and Tertiary sources</span></h2>
<p>I think it's important to mention that articles have at least one secondary source. Tertiary sources were mentioned to include the old Britannica articles that aren't covered by copyright. There are articles with only primary sources that should be deleted and we might as well close this door before it's opened if we are amending policy. I can think of no case where a primary source only article is a valid entity on Wikipedia. But the circular reasoning is if Person A is notable (through whatever means), his blog entry can be cited as an article for Theory X even though there is no secondary source coverage of Theory X.

<dd>But one should be able (in most cases) to find secondary sources for those articles. The proposal makes a distinction between articles that can be made policy-conforming and those that cannot. The former should be fixed or tagged, the latter deleted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In addition, this excellent proposal still leaves is with the classification problem: what is the dividing line between a primary and a secondary source? For example, I would judge that an article in a peer-reviewed journal is a secondary source, even though it proposes a novel theory and is written by the scientists who did the fundamental experiment, whereas the raw data, lab notebooks and so on are the primary sources. Other Wikipedians hold the view that such a journal article is a primary source, because it first presents a new theory. Similarly, is <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plutarch.html" title="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> a secondary source when he quotes a work no longer extant? I would judge not. In fact, I would regard practically all ancient and medieval sources as primary, because of the huge cultural and linguistic abyss that separates us, necessitating expert intepretation.

<li>It allows us to use a self-published work in an article on the author of that work, but not on an article about the author's theories. If interpreted literally, it would leave us substantially short of sources for articles like <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Cube_3125.html" title="Time Cube">Time Cube</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> and others, because most of the body of work that those articles are about was self-published.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A self-published work should always be usable as a source for the opinion of its author. If the opinion of the author is deemed relevant, it should be possible to include it on any page, so long as it is phrased as an attributed opinion. I think there would have to be a separate guideline about when it's useful to include opinions, but this is probably needed already anyway. For instance, the self-published opinions of <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hemming_bbc0.html" title="John Hemming">John Hemming</a> MP in his <a href="http://gasissues.blogspot.com/" class="external text" title="http://gasissues.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">blog on gas supply issues</a> should be citable on <a href="../../../e/n/e/Energy_policy_in_the_United_Kingdom_3ebd.html" title="Energy policy in the United Kingdom">Energy policy in the United Kingdom</a>, if anything he says is relevant to that page.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">But brevity</span></h2>
<p>In my opinion this is far too long. It succumbs to the same structural fault of the policies it combines by tailing off into details and dog-show definitions. My preference would be for either this new policy or each of the existing two to be reduced to a maximum of, say, a thousand words (we kid ourselves if we think most people will plough through more than that). In my opinion, the policy or policies should state their principles only, using a minimum of examples and those only where unavoidable; each policy, however, should be connected by links or summary style to a guideline, the repository for all the niggling little ifs and buts that accrete on a policy like fluff on the tail of a rat. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 13:28, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. That's what went wrong with the other policies. WP:V started filling up with material that people felt was too detailed for NOR. Then V became policy, and people wanted to streamline it too, so material was moved to RS. RS was only a guideline so lots of people piled in to edit it, and it ended up a mess. Let's not go down that road again.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In my view, we need one policy on sources that is comprehensive on the important, basic points, but succinct, and no forking to more detailed guidelines that end up contradicting it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 13:37, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not forking, it's the difference between front-of-house and the back cupboard, in my opinion. Guidelines on this subject can't help but disintegrate into detail, which is where, as you say, they become a mess. That's inevitable, I think, so lets push that mess as far away from the statement of principles as possible, where the pokers, pedants, and cruft-shufflers can nitpick and spraint to their heart's content without fouling the policy pages in the process. That's my opinion, anyway; but I'm impressed by what you're trying to do; certainly we need a lot fewer words than in the combined originals. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 13:52, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I completely agree with you on front-of-house and back cupboard, and RS was meant to fulfill the function of providing a space for detailed discussion of issues that would only serve to confuse the policy. But then links to RS were provided on V and NOR â€” in sentences like "verifiability depends on <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> â€” and people started getting the impression that V depended on RS; and RS was a mess, therefore V was fatally flawed. Then of course you have to make sure nothing in RS contradicts V, but whenever I tried to make copy edits to get rid of creeping contradictions, I'd get reverted because I wasn't one of the editors who were on the talk page every day. So it all becomes very maintenance heavy. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 14:06, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Scientific controversies</span></h2>
<p>This proposal has major implications for scientific controversies.</p>
<p>The "truth" of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theory_of_Evolution_042b.html" title="Theory of Evolution">Theory of Evolution</a> would immediately be downgraded from a "fact" (needing no attribution) to a "mainstream view" (requiring attribution to a source).</p>
<ul>
<li>We'd have to write <i><b>According to biologists</b> natural selection et al. produces new species</i> rather than <i>Natural sselection et al. produces new species</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The controversy over anthropogenic (human-caused) <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_Warming_8f17.html" title="Global Warming">Global Warming</a> would likewise need recasting. The proportion of "consensus" vs. disgreement would no longer be something any Wikipedia contributor could simply assert as a "fact". Instead, the contributor would have to write:</p>
<ul>
<li>According to an essay (or editorial) in <i>Science</i>, scientific journals have never published a peer-reviewed article denying the anthropogenic global warming theory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Articles could also include statements from AGW sceptics like scientist <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Lindzen_e9b5.html" title="Richard Lindzen">Richard Lindzen</a> and novelist <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Crichton_1cc6.html" title="Michael Crichton">Michael Crichton</a>, M.D., who <b>claim that</b> numerous peer-reviewed articles have been published rebutting various aspets of AGW.</p>
<p>I like the new Attribution policy, because it will take Wikipedia out of the business of "getting to the bottom" of scientific controversies and put it back to where it was originally intended to be. It will not assert that "X is a fact" but rather that "A says X is true" and also "B says X is not true". This will allow readers to make up their own minds. --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 13:31, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Just to address the concerns above, actually it wuld be great if we could say that according to Nature of date <i>foo</i> no scientific journal has never published a peer-reviewed article denying the anthropogenic global warming theory; we can then say that within the scientific community it is generally regarded as accepted fact and that there is no significant informed dissent from this view in independent scientific thought. That is a very strong statement. So strong that the theory could justly be stated as fact (or as <i>generally accepted</i>) in the lead and the evidence stated a subsequent paragraph. It would be foolish to deny that there are climate change deniers, just as there are holocaust deniers and evolution deniers, but if we can make a directly attributable statement which unequivocally demonstrates the complete lack of acceptance of these denials by mainstream thought, I really see no problem.

<dd>I think this "reviewed and recommended" exception is problematic. First, we're an encyclopedia, not a newspaper or magazine, and we don't use sources in the same way that they do; so just because a reliable source â€” say, a newspaper â€” recommends a blog, that doesn't mean we can suddenly regard it as a reliable source. Secondly, it's usually particular material from a blog or other self-published source that's reviewed and referred to, not the whole thing. Just because the blog was good on Tuesday when the newspaper reviewed it doesn't mean it's good at any other time. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 13:00, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wonder about older books, which may have been self-published before publishing houses play the role they do today. I have never worked with this type of material, but I'm concerned about excluding anything important. Furthermore, the self-published definition has been edited to include organizations as self-publishers, so the "reviewed and recommended" exception may be necessary to use material published by organizations, with no author listed. The current wording requires us to decide if the organization is "well-known and reliable". It may be more practical to see if the material has been recommended in reliable sources. Also, the reliability of any source can always be discussed on the talk page, and the discussion might be more productive if discussing specific recommendations versus whether the organization is "well-known and reliable". --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 18:02, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Those which have been analyzed and commented on over the years by more recent scholars. These I have no issue with using (subject to the opinions of the scholars of their worth)--the lens of history can serve as a replacement for publication.</li>
<li>Those which have not. In some cases, an archaic work may have been lying dormant for years in an archive, recently discovered; in other cases, it wasn't considered worth commentary. In either case, the lack of historical perspective on these should disallow their use on Wikipedia; at least until modern scholars outside Wikipedia comment on and analyze them.</li>

<p>Why are we doing this? Surely this rewrite is valuable <i>only</i> if this rewrite clarifies what is meant by NPOV. That is, we have no independent reason to want Verifiability, ReliableSource, Attribution, . . . . except as they are required to implement <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. For example, it would be very useful to have a few very clear pages to which we could send newcomers to explain what it takes to produce the NPOV quality of Wikipedia pages, is that not true?</p>
<p>Accordingly, this combination of Verifiability and ReliableSource into one page makes no improvement. I see nothing wrong with combining those two pages into this one. But the combination at <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">WP:ATT</a> does not address our real problem--which is how to resolve the controversies on pages.</p>
<p>I suggest that our goal in all of these policy pages is to tease out the details of this NPOV process of "representing significant views fairly and without bias." So we are wasting our time on these policy pages unless we are explaining to newcomers what we mean by 1) "representing," 2) "significant," 3) "fairly," and 4) "without bias." The current texts of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> are murky and self-contradictory in explaining how to resolve controversies over what is meant by 1) representing, 2) significant, 3) fairly, and 4) without bias. And the proposed <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">WP:ATT</a> is no better.</p>
<p>I give you an example of what we should be working here. We should be spending our time explaining here clearly what we mean by <i>fairly</i> when we say we should be "representing significant views fairly and without bias." Specifically, our policy text should state that it is "unfair" to paraphrase published <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html#In_Logic" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem fallacies</a> as a criticism of any political, economic, or scientific point-of-view. That is, it is "unfair" to paraphrase on the <a href="../../../p/y/t/Pythagorean_theorem.html" title="Pythagorean theorem">Pythagorean theorem</a> page any <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> publication that states that Pythagoras's writing "calls for the use of deception, misinformation and divisiveness to [conquer his opponents]." Even if some <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> scholar actually said that Pythagoras's writing "calls for the use of deception, misinformation and divisiveness to [conquer his opponents]" that would not have relevance to any proof or disproof of the <a href="../../../p/y/t/Pythagorean_theorem.html" title="Pythagorean theorem">Pythagorean theorem</a>.</p>
<p>So, I repeat with others above: <i>What is the purpose of this combination page?</i> Our grand mission here should be "representing significant views fairly and without bias." The current texts of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">WP:ATT</a> mischaracterize that grand mission. For all of the above reasons, we should organize the sub-pages of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> around explaining in clear and self-consistent text the elements of 1) "representing," 2) "significant," 3) "fairly," and 4) "without bias." --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> 19:22, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a name="Fact_vs_opinion" id="Fact_vs_opinion"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fact vs opinion</span></h2>
<p>My main concern with where this seems to be going, it that it blurs the distinction between claims of fact (statements of the form "<b>P</b>") and claims of opinion (statements of the form "according to source <b>S</b>, <b>P</b>")--where <b>P</b> is a proposition (which may be true, may be false, may be disputed, or may be entirely personal opinion) and <b>S</b> is a source for that proposition (which may be authoritative or relevent, or not). (Assume that in both cases, <b>S</b> is cited in the notes).</p>
<p>Current policy doesn't really address this well; <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> comes closest to dealing with it.</p>
<p>Obviously, a claim of fact should only apply when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact is manifest and undisputed ("the sun rises in the East")</li>
<li>The fact is a matter of established historical record, and undisputed ("Babe Ruth hit 714 home runs in his major league career")</li>
<li>The fact is a matter of established scholarship or science, and is undisputed ("The bite of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Cobra_3a60.html" title="King Cobra">King Cobra</a> is toxic to humans").</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, "undisputed" excludes <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crank_%28person%29.html" title="Crank (person)">cranks</a> and the like--the fact that a few crackpots think they can square the circle with only compass and straightedge (though none have shown how, and it's been long proven otherwise) doesn't denigrate the claim that "it is impossible to square the circle using only compass and straightedge" from the status of fact.</p>
<p>As an encyclopedia, we should be presenting facts as facts.</p>
<p>Claims of opinion--which should always be attributed <i>in prose</i>--should apply when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The claim is widely regarded as false or nonsense ("The Earth is flat", vs. "According to the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flat_Earth_Society_b62d.html" title="Flat Earth Society">Flat Earth Society</a>, the Earth is flat.")</li>
<li>The claim itself is an opinion ("<i><a href="../../../i/s/h/Ishtar.html" title="Ishtar">Ishtar</a></i> is a lousy movie." vs "According to <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Ebert_1ae7.html" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>, <i><a href="../../../i/s/h/Ishtar.html" title="Ishtar">Ishtar</a> is a lousy movie").</i></li>
<li>The claim involves an active controversy ("<i>The <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_in_Iraq_db7e.html" title="War in Iraq">War in Iraq</a> is a failure" vs "According to many critics of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a>, the War in Iraq is a failure").</i></li>
<li>The claim involves an area of scholarship or science which is significantly disputed, or presents a significant minority opinion ("According to most scientists, human activities have caused global warming"; "according to proponents of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiropractic.html" title="Chiropractic">chiropractic</a>, many maladies can be cured with spinal adjustments")</li>
<li>The source is of questionable reliablity. ("According to <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jane_Fonda_5ebb.html" title="Jane Fonda">Jane Fonda</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/u/Plutonium.html" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> is the most toxic substance on Earth"--I heard that one from an old chemistry prof many years ago). In this case, of course, better sources that Fonda are available on this topic, and she ought not be quoted at all--but there are some propositions that are significant enough to merit mention but not terribly well-sourced</li>
<li>The source is a statistcal aggregate ("According to a Gallup poll, 62% of Americans believe that..."). Note that two sources--the researcher (Gallup), and the group being sampled ("62% of Americans"), are needed for this sort of claim.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of importance to this instant topic is the following observation: <b>Claims of fact require stronger evidence</b>. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, for its faults, attempted to note that some sources are stronger than others. This current proposal seems to gloss over or ignore the difference. It would be a massive step backward were Wikipedia to be reduced to Uncle Ed's carciture above.</p>

<dd>To a point yes. but statements like 'the Bible contains many references to Jericho/flowers/trees/donkeys' whilst strictly exegesis, are probably best referenced by citing some of the Biblical references. Likewise statements like 'according the Genesis Adam and Eve had a son called Cain', or 'According to John's gospel, Jesus claimed to be the 'true vine <i>etc. To draw a distinction between a 'plain reading' and a 'hermeneutic' is in theory vety difficult, but in practice many readings will be uncontested.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Foreign-language sources</span></h2>
<p>My pet issue, I'll admit: as a person who reads about half a dozen languages decently, I find the strong preference for English language sources annoying. Try doing research on Romania, or on Spanish-language literature, with only English-language sources. Especially, try doing <i>online</i> research on these topics with only English-language sources.</p>
<p>Right now we say "English-language sources should be used whenever possibleâ€¦" I would like to change that to something like "There is a strong preference for including English-language sourcesâ€¦". The fact that it is <i>possible</i> to find English-language sources on these topics (in a university library in the English-speaking world, for example) should not be an argument against using readily available sources in the relevant languages. A Romanian in Bucharest writing on Romanian historical figures should not be told that he or she must hunt down an obscure book in a library 2000 kilometres away rather than using equally good materials readily at hand. To be honest, even I, living in Seattle, shouldn't be told that: for many topics, my personal library contains useful books in other languages, the public library is useless, and nothing else is readily available to me unless it happens to be in the one university library I have access to.</p>
<p>It's great if someone wants to add English-language references to such articles, but it is ridiculous to say that, because they could, in principle, be found, other equally reliable and more readily available sources are not acceptable. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 16:25, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Y'know: on most topics this is no problem at all. There are perhaps 2% of pages where things are really contentious, and where people start worrying about the subtle connotations of sources. But that happens just as readily with English-language sources. And, frankly, where the primary materials are in another language and the area is controversial, it is as likely as not that a professional translator has an axe to grind, too. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 18:09, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, such editors can always cite their publications if otherwise in conformity with the "redefined" policies and enjoy the publication of their work on Wikipedia in <i>absentia</i>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Primary sources and articles in scientific journals</span></h2>
<p>I've been wondering for some time whether an article in a scientific journal (a typical article, not a review article) is a "primary source" in the Wikipedia meaning of that term. I think that, according to the standard definitions in science, articles are primary sources (see e.g. <a href="http://library.curtin.edu.au/infotrekkplus/trek11.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://library.curtin.edu.au/infotrekkplus/trek11.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and <a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/~natsci/writing/sources.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ucalgary.ca/~natsci/writing/sources.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>). However, in my experience articles are used extensively in current practice at Wikipedia, contravening "Edits that rely on primary sources should only make descriptive claims that can be checked by anyone without specialist knowledge" if articles are indeed primary sources. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 07:23, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess science is out then, except for those popular media commentaries.&#160;;)</dd>
<dd>Or not... Science publications may be primary sources, however, the synthesis that needs to happen to make up the publication means that if you are commenting on the underlying issue, the science publication acts like a secondary source, which is possibly more appropriate under this proposal. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 07:28, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ansell wrote "the synthesis that needs to happen to make up the publication means that if you are commenting on the underlying issue, the science publication acts like a secondary source." That may happen in some cases, but many scientific journals consist of a collection of unrelated articles with no attempt at synthesis.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The problem I have with "Edits that rely on primary sources should only make descriptive claims that can be checked by anyone without specialist knowledge" is the phrase "specialist knowledge". Suppose I spot something in an existing article that does not seem right. I try to trace the questionable material back to the source, and when I do, I find that (1) the original source is a primary source, and (2) the WP article does indeed need correction. So far, no problem. But what if the WP article is written using different units of measure, and I have to convert the units in the primary source into the units in the WP article? Is that specialist knowledge? Where do we draw the line?</dd>
<dd>In the current policies and guidelines, the part about specialist knowledge only appears in a passage about articles based predominantly on primary sources. By expanding the scope in this way, it makes the use of primary sources for narrow fact-checking of articles that are mostly based on secondary sources a bit more difficult. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 07:46, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was trying to get at the concept of synthesis of ideas <i>within</i> scientific articles.

<dd>IMHO when and where to rely on (non-review) articles depends on the topic. In articles about established and broad topics like <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entropy.html" title="Entropy">entropy</a>, using or referring to a single journal article would be the exception (the history sections will refer to important first publications like <i>Caratheodory, C., Math. Ann. 67, 355 (1909)</i>).</dd>

<dd>IMO, Textbooks are lower than Peer Reviewed journal articles in terms of reliability. Textbooks generally have editors who are general purpose employees of publishing companies, whereas, the editors of Peer Reviewed Journals are intimiately involved with the subject area. This often results in Textbooks having false statements in my experience. In my current research, I have not used a single "textbook" on the area, preferring to stick to articles, as the textbook commentaries are not useful to me. I do not see Wikipedia's role as being a parrot for textbook companies, who have a distinct profit motive for their work. As you say though, it depends on the maturity of the area in question in the end. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 00:27, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Primary sources</span></h2>
<p>I've added this to the section about secondary sources being preferred in general: "Articles about pop culture and works of fiction may sometimes rely on editors' interpretations of primary source material, because of the lack of secondary sources. In these cases, editors should use good editorial judgment and common sense."</p>
<p>I did this because editors who write about pop culture often complain that the current versions of V and NOR (and RS) would prevent them from writing their articles if they stuck to them. This is a point Phil Sandifer has made many times, pointing to the featured article <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoo.html" title="Spoo">Spoo</a> as an example of an article that relies on primary sources. Therefore, it seems reasonable to add an exception for pop culture. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 08:59, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the cautioning needs to be much stronger. Frankly, many of the pop culture articles should be removed under V, NOR and RS. I've seen way too many pop culture articles that are original research and deserve deletion. This particular discussion, I believe, should be separated from the discussion on merging the policy documents.</dd>
<dd>This also contradicts <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (which is echoed at <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>) "<b>Plot summaries</b>.

<li>For better or worse, stripping Wikipedia of articles on pop culture is not likely to happen any time soon.

<ul>
<li>I think if there's analysis that's not in the original source material, then that would be original research (plot summaries, though heavily discouraged by themselves, fall under this). I do have another question though. Popular works of fiction like Star Wars have sourcebooks written about them. So does Anime like Dragon Ball and Naruto, but the difference is that many anime sourcebooks will be written by the creator, but Star Wars, where there's the creator (Lucas) and other people who have been licensed to write extra material. Are these all the same in terms of being "primary"? To me it is because these tend to be either written by the creator or paid by the creator to write. (If we're going to open this can of worms, might as well let them all out.) <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 06:20, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'd say you are correct in that most factbooks and the like about any fictional setting are written by the author of that setting, or someone in his pay. Actual analytical works of books of fiction exist but are rare; Tolkien is one of the few fantasy authors I can think of that has third-party books about his work. However, Wikipedia has zillions of articles on fiction. We could then (1) make an exception in this policy with respect to fiction; or (2) accept the fact that this policy doesn't apply to all articles; or (3) embark on a massive deletion of material related to fiction. I'm sure we're agreed that (3) is not such a good idea and will get a lot of editors angry? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 16:04, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Material for which no reliable published source could be found</span></h2>
<p>Firstly, I very much welcome this initiative in re-framing policy.</p>
<p>It has been widely discussed, and, I think, agreed, that some types of material may be added for which no already-published source may be available. A good example is converting a length previously published in yards so it can also be reported in metres. Conversion factors have obviously "already been published", but not the specific quantities involved.</p>
<p>I would like it to be explicit that this is not only permitted, but encouraged.</p>
<p>Another example that was contentious at the time. I wished to report that Western Avenue in London is 11 to 12 miles long. Nobody actually believes this statement is false but I have never been able to find a source reporting it. Reference to a map was rejected on grounds that OR was involved in computing the length. Reference to <a href="http://www.multimap.com/map/aproute.cgi?client=public&amp;lang=&amp;rn=GB&amp;input_rt=aproute_pan&amp;startcountry=GB&amp;startrd=old+oak+common+lane&amp;starttown=acton+&amp;startpc=W3&amp;endcountry=GB&amp;endrd=denham+roundabout&amp;endtown=denham&amp;endpc=&amp;qs=q&amp;starttime=00%3A00" class="external text" title="http://www.multimap.com/map/aproute.cgi?client=public&amp;lang=&amp;rn=GB&amp;input_rt=aproute_pan&amp;startcountry=GB&amp;startrd=old+oak+common+lane&amp;starttown=acton+&amp;startpc=W3&amp;endcountry=GB&amp;endrd=denham+roundabout&amp;endtown=denham&amp;endpc=&amp;qs=q&amp;starttime=00%3A00" rel="nofollow">Multimap travel directions from Old Oak Common Lane Acton W3 to Denham Roundabout Denham UB9</a> was rejected by some on grounds of OR and by others on grounds of verifiabliity (that the length had not already been published). The article <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Avenue_b1be.html" title="Western Avenue">Western Avenue</a> has never been challenged over this but many editors disliked Longest streets in London and wanted to avoid its continued existence through references to systems such as MultiMap.</p>
<p>Under these sort of circumstances I have found comforting the statement in <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> "All articles in Wikipedia should be based on information collected from published primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research"; it is "source-based research", and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia". Should this be resurrected?</p>
<p>I think the policy should say it is disruptive to remove material on grounds of lack of source unless one believes the material to be false. <a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThincat_aebc.html" title="User:Thincat">Thincat</a> 12:44, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The idea that reference to the map constitutes original research is wrong, unless you drew the map. I'm staggered that that argument won the debate. How do people think maps are created, and for what purpose? Do people not realise what the scale on a map does? People can go away and verify it and state you got your measurement wrong and amend the info, but that's the same as text which is sourced, people can misrepresent those. We really need to tweak our policies if people are pushing those sorts of fallacies. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 13:08, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The lenghty discussion in Wiki-EN did not incude replacing NOR. As I said, I am open to be convinced that our work here will not be a waste if time. I really doubt at this point that we can change or replace long standing policies. Tens of thousands of articles and discussions refer to these policies and guidelines. The momentum is way to string for such overraching change. Let's attempt to demove the need for RS by tightening V, first. If we are successful, we could take the next step. As for my "evisceration" of this proposal. Feel free to revert.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here's where I come from on this: I would like to see all Wikipedia policies reduced to a <i>very</i> small statement of the policy. What I see here is the potential to reduce the formally agreed canonical policy back to its basis: Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought. With enough work we might be able to get <i>all</i> the canonical policies onto a single page. That would be fantastic, because it's really really important to have as few absolute rules as possible, and for them to be as unambiguous as they can be. If we then replace all the clarifications and hedging on V and NOR with <i>this</i>, and make this a guideline - a descriptive guide to how the policies are appplied in practice - then we have the opportunity to replace RS. We can also chip away at EL, VAIN, conflict of interest and others. Guidelines grow to prevent "that stupid thing Bob did three years ago" and should be ruthlessly pruned periodically, but if we can get the formal <i>policies</i> right down then it will be <i>much</i> easier to argue <i>from policy</i> not from guidelines, because in the end that is what we should be doing. <i>Foo is notable</i> is subjective; <i>Foo has (or has not) generated significant verifiable coverage in independent sources of known and acceptable authority to allow a verifiably neutral article</i> is far less likely to be a cause of dispute.</dd>
<dd>So: I see a positive benefit to retaining the policies, stated in plain language and without ornamentation, whether singly or in a single article. That way the policies will remain above the hurly-burly of debate which inevitably affects guidelines, and the policies will become much more important and the guidelines much less, to the extent that the guidelines can start being drastically shortened, merged or quietly dropped. Policy -&gt; Application guideline -&gt; Subject specific examples. And preferably nothing below that level; although some user essays are extremely useful in some circumstances (<a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> for example), who can find these things without being pointed to them? <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 15:37, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

As I understood it, that is one of the main points. If it is to merely be a re-write of WP:V, then why bother with renaming it? ASFAIC, one of the main weaknesses of NOR is the discrepency between the idiosyncratic usage within Wikipedia and the more common understanding of original research. Seems there was significant volumes of tedious discussions attempting to address this. I think this is a bold new direction for addressing that (and other) shortcomings in the policies. I'm not entirely sure what I think about it overall just yet, but I do think the proposal should be given a chance. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> â‰  <a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 15:43, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dt>What is not original research</dt>
</dl>
<p>Conversely, the prohibition on original research should not be carried to absurd extremes. If a published source gives the numbers of votes cast in an election, it is not original research to calculate percentages. Similarly, if a source says that someone was born in 1954 in Baltimore, Maryland, it is not original research to extrapolate that she was born in the United States.</p>
<p>If there is an obvious typographical error in a source, it is not original research to take the sentence for its obvious meaning (clearly, an author is not claiming that England had a king named "Hen3ry VII"). Similarly, if a source article refers to "the painter DalÃ­", it is not original research to presume that they mean <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD_43d7.html" title="Salvador DalÃ­">Salvador DalÃ­</a>, unless the context suggests otherwise.</p>

<dd>I would agree. I suspect others might not (I know that Slim has argued for an interpretation of NOR that would not allow us to point out possible mistakes in a source unless we can find a reliable source that does the same.) There certainly are any number of articles on wikipedia that do this without coming under serious scrutiny - articles on historical errors in films, for instance, tend to merely cite sources about the real history, not sources that point out the particular error in the particular film. Of the others, I think that "obvious deductions" needs to be laid out clearly, in particular, as some of the stronger presentations of the NOR policy have tended to suggest, at least, that obvious deductions are forbidden as OR. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 17:49, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Regarding the sentence: "Not all material must actually be attributed to a source, but it must be capable of being attributed" â€” this is an important sentence. It goes right to the heart of the issue. Material that <i>cannot be attributed</i> is original research. Just because something doesn't have a source doesn't mean that it's OR i.e. that no source could be found for it. And just because something is in Wikipedia doesn't mean it necessarily has to be sourced. The sentence you're objecting to sums that all up: material must be attributable, but need not actually be attributed. And it then goes on to say when we do need a source: for all material that is challenged or likely to be challenged. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:40, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Primary vs secondary sources</span></h2>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_Flaws_17ac.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Flaws">Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Flaws</a>, there is a lot of confusion on this topic; I think this policy would do well to avoid the "primary/secondary/tertiary" taxonomy where possible--instead focusing on other issues like publication, editorial oversight, etc.</p>
<p>In particular, many in science use "primary source" to refer to research papers. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> largely uses the definition from <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historiography.html" title="Historiography">historiography</a>, wherein primary sources are artifacts such as public records, interviews with persons of interest, physical objects of import, and other things of a non-descriptive, non-synthetic, non-analytical nature. Papers, books, and other forms of scholarship, to a historian, are always secondary sources. Were science to adapt history's terminology, primary sources would be things like fossil records, laboratory notebooks, the output (and source code) of computer simulations, samples of chemicals, samples of biological tissue, biological specimens, medical records, etc.</p>
<p>Some primary sources (under the definition of historiography) <i>are</i> published--court records and other records of official acts, published literature (including textual works, recorded music, film). Many of these lack analyses, though some (decisions of a court) contain an analytical component.</p>
<p>IMHO, the properties of a source (analytical or not; published or not; is it an idea or is it a thing) are more relevant to the distinction between "primary" and "secondary"; we ought to focus on properties and not the terminology used in historiography (and abused in science). &#160;:)</p>

<dd>I'm increasingly thinking the primary/secondary distinction isn't helpful, but I know that other editors rely on it. It <i>is</i> useful to be able to say to a newbie that they can't base an article directly on their view of the New Testament because it's a primary source. It cuts through all the explanations about not using source material <i>properly</i>, which is the main point, because secondary sources can be misused too. But it requires a lot more explanation to get that across without mentioning the primary/secondary distinction. It's also useful to talk about the need for secondary sources to establish that something is notable enough to be written about. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:49, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Any source can be misused if the editor is not careful to avoid "editorialising". I think that the distinction is not accurately portrayed between history and science "primary sources". In reality, the primary sources in science are the actual data that is collected during experiments. Articles on the topic will contain summarised statistics based on this data, but they are also required to contain analysis of the data, which is IMO, a second "layer" of knowledge. A "tertiary source" in this sense will be the heavily summarised version of these articles which are included in textbooks. Whether the restriction in content that the textbook publisher puts on the final version affects the "accuracy" of what can be said about the original articles is past what Wikipedia should be using or not, well, I don't know about that. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 00:33, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that any kind of source can be misused, and ideally I'd like not to have to even mention the primary/secondary/tertiary distinction. But it can be useful; for example, an editor arrives at <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_rights.html" title="Animal rights">Animal rights</a> and adds that the Sikh religion supports animal rights, using the <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bhagavad_Gita_08a2.html" title="Bhagavad Gita">Bhagavad Gita</a> as his source. The easiest way to explain the problem with that kind of editing is to say it's his own interpretation of primary source material, and that he needs to produce a secondary source that supports what he wants to add. How else would you get that across, succinctly, without relying on the primary/secondary distinction? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:06, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Websites</span></h2>
<p>I think this proposal will set off a huge firestorm if it is enacted and then fully acted upon, but I'm willing to humor it for the nonce.</p>
<p>What with the emphasis on publication and reliability of sources, it seems to me that this proposal will outlaw the use of a wide variety of websites. Specifically, it seems to me that it will exclude all but the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Official websites as a primary source about the sponsoring entity</li>
<li>Archives on official sites of publications which would be acceptable as print sources</li>
</ul>
<p>It would specifically appear to outlaw use of websites as secondary sources for documents, because one cannot be sure that the website is presenting an accurate copy thereof. (I ran across a case of this just today.) Perhaps more problematically it will outlaw the kind of reference that is common in articles about "things" (<a href="../../../t/o/a/Toaster.html" title="Toaster">toaster</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple.html" title="Apple">apple</a>, etc.): websites that do not relate vetted research, but might by a reasonable person be considered reliable. There are plenty of articles of this kind in which a strict application of the proposal would remove all but the trivia, because only the trivia is readily amenable to such documentation.</p>
<p>Only the second bullet is addressed in the document as a legitimate source. -- <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 19:47, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Modulo official websites, it is clear as to what it <i>in</i>cludes. I deduce that it <i>ex</i>cludes this other sort of site I described, but I suspect that a lot of editors-- maybe the overwhelming majority-- might not catch onto the implied exclusion. Or worse, there would be radically conflicting views as to what was excluded, because levels of mistrust do vary wildly. It seems to me that the kind of sites it specifically excludes are obviously excluded by a reasonable person anyway; but it also seems to me that perhaps a majority of articles rely on some grey-area source which implied to be unacceptable but not so stated. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangoe_79f9.html" title="User:Mangoe">Mangoe</a> 20:34, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Michael Straczynski, but his self-published material is its main source. It is an article about Babylon 5, which is a show he created, wrote most of, produced, and is the sole determinant of what is and is not canon for.

<li>The pop culture and fiction section is, I think, a bit off-target because the anti-blog, message board, Usenet, and Wiki tone has largely been removed, making it an extraneous clarification. (All of those now seem to fall under self-publication, with the issues of authenticity dealing with identity verification). So there's nothing new in this section to deal with things like the fact that a lot of comics news comes off of creator's message boards, or the importance of Usenet to B5. (Which is good - that was only ever one example. Scientology articles also NEED Usenet as a primary source) There's still something to be said here so that we can deal with something like, say, The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5 for B5, or Outpost Gallifrey for Doctor Who. Perhaps a note about how popular culture topics often have excellent resources that are self-published by fans, and that these sites are perfectly reasonable sources, and a note about deferring to the consensus of editors on those topics.</li>

<dd>As far as I understand it, this attempt does not increase the reliability of USENET, blogs or personal web pages. These should not be accepted as reliable sources for anything, with the exception of popular culture and non-controversial subjects. Let's not re-write well established principles. My understanding is that this is an attempt to merge several policies into one, and *not* an attempt to re-write policy. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">â‰ˆ jossi â‰ˆ</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> â€¢ <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 20:02, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was, I believe, a merge and revision. Certainly there's nothing in there that inherently rules out blogs, Usenet, etc on the grounds that they are blogs, Usenet, etc. They're ruled out because the specific source fails a test within - it's not that they're Usenet posts, it's that they're not easily attributed, or because they're not a reputable scholar, etc. In other words, enshrine the reasons we were banning Usenet posts before, and then any exceptions to the rule get taken care of automatically. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 20:24, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This page will need to be debated to determine if it has concensus or not. It's hard to get consensus together for small changes to policies, because not many people are interested in such small changes, so it is difficult to overcome resistance. Now is therefore probably the best time to debate any such changes.</dd>
<dd>I don't see any objection to using a Usenet posting (etc.) as a primary source, as long as it is clear that it means what it is claimed to mean (e.g. if the identity of the poster is an issue, there may be concerns that it is a forgery). Obviously the usual caveats of prefering secondary sources apply.</dd>
<dd>I think the suggestion that such sources are more welcome on pop culture articles is very welcome. Specifically, it's hard to write about (say) Usenet culture without refering to Usenet sources. This should make the task easier. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 20:34, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>All sources are unreliable, unless they meet one of the criteria in the policy.

<p>The "Self-published sources" section begins "A self-published source is a published source, online or on paper...." We already have an explaination of what publication means, and it's long. I suggest that elsewhere in the policy we only say "published source" or "publication", and avoid spelling out all the possible publication media. Otherwise we will have bloat and contradictions.

<p>Starting with the content of WP:V was a bad idea, IMHO. It hops from topic to topic, it's not clear where the policy begins and ends, and every statement threatens to explode with further rambling explanations and peripheral info. I would rewrite it from scratch. Well, not scratch, exactly, but pretend the WP:V page doesn't exist at all. 1. Express your policy in precise terms, as a bulleted list of single sentences, with no explanations. This is the only part that is going to be normative (and it should expressly say so). If you find yourself writing "which means that" after any sentence, then start over. 2. Precede the list with an executive summary. I wouldn't try to restate all the points in the list; instead, make it say something more to the effect that the list exists, comprises the policy, and addresses topics toward a general goal. 3. Follow the list with an expansion of each item in the list: the item's motivations (e.g. "Wikipedia is / is not a ..."), examples and verbose explanations of every little nuance, as needed. â€”<a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMjb_eccd.html" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a> 23:49, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bloat is inevitable, I think, unless examples, quibble-fodder etc. are shifted to a species of FAQ subpage where sheep may safely graze. I'd like this proposed policy (or the existing policies) to be restricted to hard policy. And though sub-guidelines might become ragbags, no-one would want to read them whole anyway, so that wouldn't matter so much as it does on a policy page. The policies could point to the subpages ('see examples here', or whatever) but be constructed never to depend on them, so ensuring that the subs could never, as RS is at the moment, be mistaken for policy themselves. I'm serious: unless a decision is quickly taken to limit the detail level of this policy proposal page, it's doomed, in my opinion, to, as SV fears, inherit the windiness of the existing policies and guidelines. If we don't make this a slim version, so to speak, I'm out (for what then really would be the point?). <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 00:11, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'd certainly like to see a big hierarchical gap between a policy page and the next step down, because "guideline" was starting to sound too important a page type, as if it was "almost policy". The Wikipedia way, in my opinion, is that "ignore all rules" caps intricate what-is-a-published-source guidelining, which is why, for example, I advised Plange to go ahead and use original documents housed in official collections, if she so wished, rather than worrying too much about what it said on RS. Let people object at the editing level, if they want: we don't need mandatory rules at the microlevel, surely; but nuances can appear that way if they squat on a policy page or a jumped-up guideline page. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 00:36, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Separating the basic original research</span></h2>
<p>No original research made it quite clear that the writer should not be making new theories, concepts, or personal analysis. Verifiability is about proper sourcing. They are tied, but then, they're not. The overlap is moreso in "It introduces an argument, without citing a reputable source for that argument, that purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position." I think that OR needs to be more streamlined insted.. It talks too much about primary and secondary sources that should be better covered in Verifiability. The section "Citing oneself" in OR I think is esspecially importantant, considering we ought help clear up the difference between original research, and someone adding stuff their own wealth of knoledge to wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 07:42, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, let me put another one.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Popular culture section</span></h2>
<p>I've added a section on popular culture to give it two explicit exceptions to the reliable sources rule: (1) that pop culture articles may rely on pseudonymous posts on bulletin boards and blogs; and (2) that in some areas, self-published non-professional secondary sources may be used, such as fansites.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some articles about popular culture rely on self-published posts on bulletin boards, blogs, and Usenet, because few other sources exist for them. In such cases, the material used must have been posted by named, or well-known pseudonymous, individuals with a known expertise in the area, although the individual need not be a professional in a relevant field. Anonymous posts should never be used.</p>
<p>Some areas of popular culture also rely on self-published secondary sources, such as well-known fansites. If in doubt about how to use a source in this area, consult the relevant WikiProjects for advice.</p>
<p>This exception applies only to articles about popular culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a significant departure from the previous policies. The reason I added it is twofold: first, the policies are supposed to be descriptive as well as prescriptive, and it's a fact that editors working on pop culture do use these types of sources. The second reason is that a number of good editors have repeatedly criticized V and NOR as too restrictive for pop culture articles; and in fact someone recently wrote to the mailing list saying he had decided to ignore V and NOR because otherwise he'd get no work done. There's clearly a problem when good editors are saying they can't work within the policies.</p>
<p>At the same time, we don't want to open the floodgates to Usenet posts and bulletin boards. The wording of this section is therefore important, so please everyone take a look and say whether it needs to be tightened and made more specific. Editors working in that area should say whether it becomes too specific. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 10:23, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My only concern is what the definition of "popular culture" would include. For instance, if I were writing an article on the history of a particular USENET group, would this section allow me to use posts from that group as sources? It certainly seems like the sort of thing that <i>should</i> be allowed, but it's not currently certain that it would be. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 12:02, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Slim, you misspoke when you said "This is a significant departure from the previous policies" because it is only a significant departure from the previous <b>wording</b> of policies. The fact that all that popular culture stuff exists and is being expanded shows we know it meets actual policy even if the current wording of policy is insufficiently clear about that. Please see Jimbo's talk page for further reading about the map is not the territory. Let's not confuse people into thinking new policy is being written here. We are only rewording.

<p>I don't like this section. Who gets to decide what is a "reliable", self-published fan site and what is a non-reliable, self-published fansite? A concensus of the editors working on the article? They're most likely all fans of the topic themselves and will set a low bar. And what if reliable, non-self-published material <i>is</i> available? For example, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donkey_Kong_%28video_game%29_f462.html" title="Donkey Kong (video game)">Donkey Kong (video game)</a> uses no self-published sources, no fan pages, no blogs, no Usenet (except for Killer List of Video Games, which is used as a primary source). But what if someone wants to go in and add some random fact they found on a fan page? With this new wording that would be acceptable. â€” <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 09:09, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What you are talking about occurs right now. And right now you may delete anything you believe to be false <i>and</i> believe is inadequately sourced.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Broadening the popular culture exception</span></h2>
<p>Are there areas other than popular culture that need self-published sources from people without traditional credentials? Technology issues, perhaps some hobbies? I don't really know here, but I can think of a bunch of things that might. I mean, I honestly have no idea if our articles on, say, quilting require reference to some widely respected quilting website. Or maybe the absolute best information on DVD players comes from some compendium of technical specs on them. I've no idea, but I'm skeptical that we could possibly come up with an exhaustive list, and even if we did, it would be likely to change under our feet. Should we perhaps carve the exception so that it can be adjusted on the fly when one of these comes up? Something like "Many topics, particularly those that do not recieve substantial coverage from academic and mainstream presses, have used the Internet to create excellent self-published secondary sources. These sources are rare - most topics will not have more than one or two - but they are generally reliable.

<dd>Also, the self-publication definition now includes organizations. If the organization employs substantial editorial control, we can consider it a reliable publisher, and its publications would not be self-published even if no author is listed. But we may not have insight into the organization's editorial process, and may have to rely on external indicators of the reliability of the organization or the publication. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 18:21, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed for the non-academic subjects (crafts, hobbies, much of technology) as Phil Sandifer proposed. I also think that prior to some point in the 1800s or early 1900s almost all publication was effectively self-publication. I know that as of a generation before <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> wrote the normal arrangement in the UK was for an author and a printer to decide on a project, jointly solicit subscriptions, and then to print the book. The foundational works in <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography.html" title="Geography">geography</a> were published in this manner. I'm not sure how to address this, but we need another commentary here, that mentions "be aware that in many fields these sources are reliable to discuss historical understanding of a subject but are no longer considered to accurate on that subject." <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 22:09, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>"Many topics, particularly those that do not receive substantial coverage from academic and mainstream presses, have used the Internet to create excellent self-published secondary sources."</i> Grammatically this is saying "topicsâ€¦have used the Internet", which is poor wording. I think you intend to say "<i>Subject-matter experts</i> have used the Internet to create excellent self-published secondary sources for many topics, particularly those that do not receive substantial coverage from academic and mainstream presses."</dd>
<dd>However, we always have to keep the crackpot pseudoscientists in mind; their self-published ramblings are ignored by academia and the press more often than not <i>for a good reason</i> (e.g., their claims have been debunked). So I suggest slipping in some qualifiers to ensure that you don't accidentally open the door to sources for refuted claims.</dd>
<dd>Also something that should be addressed is the fact that Wikipedia itself, especially when it comes to pop culture topics, is increasingly becoming the most popular Internet-based self-publishing venue. Subject matter experts often don't want to bother self-publishing info on their own websites when they can instead publish it on Wikipedia (so long as they avoid original research), where it will have the benefit of (over time) extensive peer review and refinement by other experts in the field as well as random contributors who can fill in gaps. We need to make sure it's clear to the reader that the sources you're talking about don't include Wikipedia in large part (I assume) because WP articles don't currently indicate which statements have been authored and/or reviewed by experts. â€”<a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMjb_eccd.html" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a> 02:07, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is anyone else troubled with the statement that we allow cites from unpublished materials in archives? My concern is that materials in archives aren't readily available: usually someone who wants to consult items in an archive has to jump thru a lot of hoops to gain access to specific documents -- &amp; the next person to want to see those documents may not be able to successfully repeat the performance.</p>
<p>My suggestion is that materials from archives are only permitted <i>if</i> they are also scanned &amp; posted in a publically-accessible fashion, say at Wikisource. The same for rare books that can't be obtained thru normal means like Inter-Library Loan. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 01:32, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I dislike the idea of such a widespread ban of this material unless, although I also dislike relying on archives when more reliable sources are available. However there are topics which have simply not been the subject of more reliable sources. The suggestion of scanning and posting these materials is unlikely to be of great use. Although I think it would be great to get these things on Wikisource, I have prized but unfortunately extremely short list of libraries which will allow their archives and rare books to be scanned. Since we are mainly talking about material that is out of copyright in these cases, the libraries only means to control these materials is by controling access to them. Some libraries even make quite outrageous claims of copyright to what copies they will allow you to pay them to create. I do not understand what you mean by people needing to jump through hoops for access. Generally you must show up to the rare book room between 9-4 Monday - Friday, occassionally you must call two weeks ahead and make certain the head archivist will be in that day in order to be allowed acces to some particularly fragile documents. On the other hand permission to photogragh or scan these items is often explictly forbidden. I do not mean to imply there are no libraries that allow such things, but I wish it were more common. --<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_e0e3.html" title="User:BirgitteSB"><font color="#F4A460">BirgitteÂ§Î²</font></a> Êˆ <a href="../../../b/i/r/User_talk%7EBirgitteSB_b59e.html" title="User talk:BirgitteSB"><small><font color="#778899">Talk</font></small></a> 03:55, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because the word "archive" was not defined, I assumed it mean collections of unpublished materials kept by government or corporate bodies -- &amp; sometimes collections in research libraries. Because access to these archives are restricted to only serious students -- e.g., academics &amp; graduate students -- someone applying for access at the minimum needs a letter of introduction from a person that archive will accept as a reliable reference. And in some cases, access to certain papers is even more restricted, &amp; may require permission from the person (or persons) who donated the material.</dd>

If I quote directly from a book that exists in only two copies, both of which are under lock in key on another continent, wouldn't you suspect that I am fabricating my source? If you insist that you <i>need</i> to cite this source in this article, then provide us a copy of the source so we can verify it; otherwise, find a secondary source that repeats those facts or quotes the unpublished materials. I honestly can't think of any reason not to follow this rule; as it has been said time &amp; again, we aren't engaging in original research here, so we don't need to permit access to these sources. Until someone can provide a real-life example for ignoring this rule in a Wikipedia article (so far we've been tlaking in hypothetical situations), allowing unpublished material from archives, or rare books only serves to help the original research none of us wants to slip into Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 21:37, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Unacceptable sources</span></h2>
<p>I added back a few things on blatantly unacceptable sources. Some sources should be used carefully--but some sources, such as material which is unsourced, unpublished, or likely fraudulent--shouldn't be used at all.</p>
<p>On a related-though-separate note, perhaps a general "consensus" exception might be useful, along the lines of:</p>
<p><b>Exception:</b> This policy may be overridden with respect to a given usage of a source, if a consensus of editors on the article's talk page believe it appropriate to do so. A separate consensus is required for each article that the source is used on.</p>
<p>The rationale behind this is obvious. Rather than trying to enumerate case-by-case all the exceptions here (or on a subpage), or having a policy which is a straitjacket, or appealing to blank checks like <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>--I think it reasonable that a consensus of editors on a topic should be able to override the rules here.

I propose that instead of a concensus of editors, what is needed is a concensus among the area specialists. And that consensus would need to be established by a "reliable source". We ought to be able to use whatever sources the experts in the field regard as the best sources for that field.

However, it would be mistaken to give organizational self-publishers a free pass; many of them are quite good at producing impressive-sounding bullshit. &#160;:) OTOH, most newspapers frequently self-publish, as the same guy who signs the editors' paychecks also signs those of the writers.</dd>
<dd>The key issue, really, is the level of editorial restraint which the publisher requires of the author. For certain entities (large publishing houses, many academic publishers, major news outfits, <i>Britannica</i>), the level is known to be acceptable. For others (most blogs), it is known to be deficient. The self-published/not-self-published dichotomy is really a proxy for this issue, as we often cannot tell just what scrutiny a given work was placed under, but we can tell if the author and the publisher are different entities.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Primary/Secondary Mess</span></h2>
<p>The logic on primary and secondary sources is still a mess. First of all, it's still suggesting that sources are ontologically primary or secondary, instead of contextually. A New York Times account of the President's speech is a secondary source <i>for the President's speech</i>. It's a primary source for the New York Times's coverage of the Presidency. This is a vital issue, especially as it relates to questionable sources.</p>
<p>Second of all, the bias against primary sources is far too strong. We ought not be favoring a NYT account of the President's speech over a transcript for reporting the content of the speech. It's just silly. And in terms of literary criticism, I have no idea how to even make the distinction work. Is Paul De Man's famous reading of Yeats a secondary source on Yeats, or a primary source for the section on literary analysis of Yeats?</p>
<p>Ideally, I think we should do away with the primary/secondary distinction entirely, as it leads to many more exceptions than clarifications. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 16:31, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We do say that primary sources are fine for descriptive claims, so it'd be okay to use the transcript of the speech over the NYT's account of it, so long as we're describing and not analysing.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the description we give of the primary/secondary distinction is simplistic. The problem is that it's a complicated distinction; whether something is primary/secondary depends on context and on where you stand in relation to the source. It's too complex to explain properly for this policy. I've also thought about leaving it out entirely, but it can sometimes be useful. What do you say otherwise to an editor who wants to base an edit on the New Testament? It's useful to be able to ask for a secondary source for whatever the claim is. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:40, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, obviously, it depends on the edit. If it's "Jesus is the Son of God (citation to the New Testemant)," I point out that there is substantial dispute on that point, and it has to be cited more precisely as "The New Testament claims..." If it's a matter of, say, evolution and someone is trying to introduce the Book of Genesis, I point out that it's not a reliable source - primary or secondary - in the field of science, which is the field in which we're dealing. Either way, the issue doesn't seem to me to be one of primary/secondary but of reasonable/unreasonable. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:04, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think a key distinction is that secondary sources, in whatever context, are usually <i>analytical</i>. At a minimum, they present and vouch for the authenticity and relevance of a primary source. More useful secondary sources provide more in-depth analysis, often using multiple primaries and drawing more complicated inferences then would be possible from examining primary sources in isolation. In many ways, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> (and the passages here that seek to replace NOR) address the issue; only information/claims that are manifest in a given source may be included in Wikipedia.

<dd>But, especially in fields like philosophy and literature, those secondary sources are also primary sources, because analysis of the analysis is vital to the process. And novel synthesis of secondary sources is just as bad as novel synthesis of primary ones. The issue is the novel synthesis - no building something new and putting it on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:04, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think we should rely on insisting on sources that <b>directly</b> support what someone wishes to add to wikipedia rather than indirectly through analysis. A source that does that analysis can itself be used as a source (and it <i>is</i> a primary source for that analysis). I think the use of a <i>no conflict of interest for controversial claims</i> criteria combined with insistance on direct support will allow getting rid of all talk of primary and secondary sources. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 17:15, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think I could go for that. As Phil said above, it's the novel synthesis that's the problem, regardless of whether it's of primary or secondary sources.

<li>What conflicts of interest are you referring to? Cases where it's obvious that a given researcher has an axe to grind--i.e. the Tobacco Institute? Any researcher will have an investment in his/her own theories and writings; this can sometimes lead to <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pathological_science.html" title="Pathological science">pathological science</a> and error, but it would be absurd to suggest that researchers should be disqualified from their areas of expertise because the effect of publishing is to make them bias.

<p>Here's what I wrote about this on NOR talk last month:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Would it be possible to avoid discussion of the primary/secondary distinction in the policy? We must use material from reliable published sources. The important questions therefore are: (1) is the source published by a third-party? and (2) is it a reliable source that's appropriate for the subject matter?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The issue of whether it's primary, secondary, or tertiary doesn't really come into it. We do want to discourage editors from using primary sources, but only because, in so doing, they are more likely to misinterpret how the source should be used, and what its limits are. But that can happen with a secondary source too. It's not the type of source that's the issue, but the misuse.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The sentence that says articles relying on primary sources should make no interpretive claims is problematic, because if the primary source makes interpretive claims, and if the source is reliable and appropriate, then the article can make them too, citing the source. For example, if the day after 9/11 the New York Times published stories by a bunch of journalists who were present when the planes hit the WTC â€” i.e. eyewitness accounts, primary-source material â€” there would be no reason we couldn't use those articles to repeat interpretive claims that the journalists made, so long as we felt they were appropriate sources.</dd>

<dd>I don't really regard those 9/11 witnesses as primary sources for Wikipedia; they're primary sources for the newspaper. I think it's muddling to include that example alongside the White House summary-of-a-speech example in the text, because the first type of source is perfectly usable and the second not (until it too appears in a newspaper). I've never agreed with policy bracketing all types of primary sources together; nothing brings a history article to life better than quotations from primary sources (quoted or collected in a published book, of course); if interpretation is required, you just report the interpretation of a historian.</dd>

<dd>It's simply saying that interpretive claims need <b>sources</b> (reliable ones, that is), the word secondary in the above is completely unnecessary. It doesn't matter whether this historian is categorized as a primary, secondary, or zillionary source&#160;:); just that he is a reliable source for the interpretation offered.

We're not using the primary source, any more so that we are using <s>secondary</s>primary sources if we cite a historian's book. The historian's book is a secondary source; the fact that the historian doubtless drew on numerous primary sources is irrelevant to us.

<p>(unindent)The problem with "many <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary sources</a> need to be interpreted to be properly used" is that "primary source" is not really a description of a specific <i>type</i> of source, but rather a description of the <i>use</i> of a source. Many things can be used either as primary or secondary sources. I understand that the intention is to describe things which cannot be used as secondary sources, and are therefore limited to being used as primary sources. However there has to be a better way to describe this. The only thing I can think of is "documentary source", but is there any established terminology for what we are describing?--<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_e0e3.html" title="User:BirgitteSB"><font color="#F4A460">BirgitteÂ§Î²</font></a> Êˆ <a href="../../../b/i/r/User_talk%7EBirgitteSB_b59e.html" title="User talk:BirgitteSB"><small><font color="#778899">Talk</font></small></a> 19:23, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The closest thing we have is "unpublished source". I think that suffices for most cases.

<p>I've never really been comfortable with the primary/secondary/tertiary analysis. We have to judge reliability of all sources. In some fields, primary sources are nearly always preferred over secondary sources or tertiary sources. Genealogy is an obvious example - primary sources are almost always preferred. (We aren't a genealogy site, so this specific example is of limited relevance.) I think the primary/secondary/tertiary source discussion would be an excellent one to move out to an essay (or guideline). The policy should emphasize reliability, the essay(s) should explain how primary/secondary/tertiary sources are more or less reliable in a given field. Given the different usage of the term in science and history, we may well need one essay for science, a second for historical topics, et. cetera. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 22:17, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The importance of the primary/secondary distinction (beyond the special case of the sciences mentioned above) is that the primary source documents the facts, &amp; the secondary source documents the resulting discussion. An example from history would be to say <a href="../../../b/e/d/Bede.html" title="Bede">Bede</a> and the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxon_Chronicle_2487.html" title="Anglo-Saxon Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a> (ASC) are primary sources, which offer facts (e.g. the ASC states that in 751 something happened), while the writings of historians provide verification of the discussion over what the facts mean (e.g., according Sir Frank Stenton, the ASC is wrong, &amp; that event actually happened in 749); as Jayjg noted above, we desperately need to observe this distinction when covering exegesis. However, if we observe this distinction it will cause havoc in some areas, such as our articles on literature: for example, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cantos_4610.html" title="The Cantos">The Cantos</a>, which is a FA, includes a great amount of unattributed interpretation -- yet most of it can be verified by simply reading the work. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 23:14, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However Bede is clearly setting out to write a history. Why do you consider the authors of the ASC any less of historians than Sir Frank Stenton? It is true we should avoid using the ASC as secondary sources, because it has proven to be inaccurate. However the ASC was certainly <i>written</i> to be used as a secondary source at the time. Whereas Anne Frank was intentionally writing to document her own experience rather tell the history of Netherlands during WWII.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Self-published sources in articles about "themselves"</span></h2>
<p>A couple of issues with this section.</p>
<p>First up, I've seen people get confused in the past about what exactly "themselves" means in this case. It should be a reference to the <b>author</b> of the source, but it's sometimes interpreted as a reference to the source itself. I'm not sure how best to clarify this, though.</p>
<p>Secondly, I'm of the opinion that the exception should be widened. Current practice seems to be that self-published sources are frequently used in articles on subjects which the authors are deeply involved with, but not directly about the authors themselves. It's a frequently cited example, but its still true: most of the sources on <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> are self-published, either by <a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._Ron_Hubbard_3ec8.html" title="L. Ron Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a> or by the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_Scientology_879d.html" title="Church of Scientology">Church of Scientology</a>, neither of which "are" Scientology, as can be witnessed by the fact that we have separate articles on each. By a strict reading of this rule, these sources are not permitted (although you could argue that Hubbard was an expert on the subject, I don't see a good argument that can be made for the CoS), but there is little doubt that they make the article better. Again, I'm not sure how best to achieve this. The suggestion I put in the text was reverted quickly.</p>

<dd>Scientology is an interesting case--many of the commentators on it are either affiliated with the CoS, or sued by it&#160;:); few if any of the published sources on the controversies surrounding Scientology are very good. Scientology is an important enough topic that we can't ignore it; but it is terribly difficult to cover in a reliable, NPOV manner. Other than my throwaway comment here, it's one of several Wikipedia topics that I avoid like the plague. &#160;:)--<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngineerScotty_c6c0.html" title="User:EngineerScotty">EngineerScotty</a> 20:04, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a name="The_foundation_concept_of_attribution" id="The_foundation_concept_of_attribution"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">The foundation concept of attribution</span></h2>
<p>The foundation concept of attribution is that because "anybody can edit" we MUST, in every article, for every questionable claim, answer the question "Who says so?" in a way that makes sense to the reader. This has nothing to do with primary or secondary sources. This has to do with claims made by a source that we directly quote or use without alteration or analysis. If we quote an analysis it is a primary source for that analysis and it doesn't matter because what matteres is can we trust that author (source) for that analysis which is not a question a lot of talk about primary versus secondary adequately handles. This has to do with why that source should be believed. If there is a conflict of interest of the type that makes their claim suspect then that must be made clear ("Scientologists say ... about scientology." or "Cold fusion researcher says ... about <i>his own work</i>".) If they lack expertise then that should be made clear. If other experts disagree then that should be made clear. We are not going to clue in all our wikipedia editors into the all the details of proper sourcing no matter how many pages we write. We only need to tell our editers to provide for the reader the answer to "Who says so and why should I believe them?" and here are some wikipedia articles that do that and here are some external links into the art of proper sourcing for further study if you wish. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 20:21, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

The current ability to discount a group for being "extremist" is a huge argumentum ad hominem.

<ul>
<li>Those which have been analyzed and commented on over the years by more recent scholars. These I have no issue with using (subject to the opinions of the scholars of their worth)--the lens of history can serve as a replacement for publication.</li>
<li>Those which have not. In some cases, an archaic work may have been lying dormant for years in an archive, recently discovered; in other cases, it wasn't considered worth commentary. In either case, the lack of historical perspective on these should disallow their use on Wikipedia; at least until modern scholars outside Wikipedia comment on and analyze them.</li>

<dd>Hmm. I'm not at all sure I agree with that claim. For example, no one generally reprints critical editions of 19th-century newspapers, but 1860s <i>New York Times</i> issues would be sources for the events of their period of roughly the same quality as the <i>New York Times</i> today, which we don't hesitate to cite. And when something is being cited as a primary sourceâ€”for example, as a citation for a quotationâ€”there is no problem at all with the source being "archaic". Certainly one wouldn't normally quote a 19th-century science book for any reason other than to show the state of a science at the time, but (again for example) if you are writing about 19th century actors, it is likely that for any but the most famous, 19th century periodicals are the best sources there are. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 04:19, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
