<p>Scene opens with Kevin and Sarah in their jammies asleep on the big red couch. Kevin wakes up startled and immediately wakes up Sarah. He tells her about his dream of a cool show called The Screen Savers where everyone was intelligent and the show was worth watching. Then Kevin Rose enters the scene, punches Kevin P-whatever-his-name-is and pulls out a big TSS logo'd sign from behind the couch, setting it up against the coffee table-whatever it is. Camera zooms in on sign then fades to black. Wednesday we're all treated to the return of TechTV. Woohoo!</p>

<p>Sarah wakes up in a place unknown to her. She realizes that she doesn't remember ANYTHING. Ms. Lane, being the adventurous one she is, gets up and decides to explore what we know are the G4 studios. She REALLY doesn't know what this place is and it shows.</p>
<p>She stumbles upon Kevin's cubicle.</p>
<p>SARAH: Who are you?</p>
<p>Kevin looks puzzled for a brief moment, but he's a bright kid, and comes to the conclusion that she either had to much to drink from Margarita Friday or has amnesia.</p>
<p>KEVIN: Don't play games with me, baby! Anyway, we're still on for tonight, right?</p>
<p>SARAH: (Pretending she knows)Yeah...where are we going again?</p>
<p>KEVIN: Well, I was thinking about a nice candlelight dinner at my place.</p>
<p>Then Office Jesus comes around the corner and Sarah remembers everything in a flashback. Basically, OJ just homerowed her for no apparent reason. What is up with the women abuse on this show? We snap back to the present time and Sarah kicks Kevin in the naughty berries. OJ runs off, screaming like a little girl.</p>
<p>SARAH: SEANBABY, WHERE ARE YOU MY LOVE?</p>
<p>End of skit.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/User%7EAttackoftheshow_ScriptArchive3_aaec.html" title="Edit section: A Triad Of Ideas">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A Triad Of Ideas</span></h2>
<p>I Actually Have 3 Relatively Good Ideas...</p>
<p>1. -Two Interns are trying to play Zelda on an NES system but the screen keeps turning Green. Intern #1 opens the front cartridge slot and blows into it. A large cloud of dust billows out and the guy who thinks he's link appears behind the console.-</p>
<p>Link: You have awakened me from my 800 year rest..."</p>
<p>Intern #1: But Zelda was released in 1987-"</p>
<p>Link: Silence! Now, because you have awoken me, you will be premitted 1 wish each."</p>
<p>Intern #2: I wish was immune to being Homerowed!"</p>
<p>-A magical sound is placed here as Link waves his sword over Intern #2.-</p>
<p>Link: It is done. And you?"</p>
<p>Intern #1: I don't know... the only thing I could ever really wish for is..."</p>
<p>-a sortof flash back/dream like sequence plays out where sarah is facing the camera (intern #1) and as she says his name Prepares to kiss him. Suddenly Intern #1 is Snapped out of his Dream By Intern #2. The scene has returned to him blowing on the console, only now his lips are shut in the console door.-</p>
<p>Intern #2: Dude, I know you love gaming.... but... c'mon!</p>
<p>__________________</p>
<p>2. -Kevin is sitting at his computer. Sarah walks over."</p>
<p>Sarah: What are you doing.</p>
<p>Kevin: Just checking out Half Baked Ideas again... check out this one: "Kevin and Sarah should let more people write the opening skit for them. Have a whole bunch of people submit ideas for this skit and then, when the time comes to pick one... they will have a great one!"</p>
<p>-Both Kevin and Sarah stare at eachother for about 10 seconds in silence. then Kevin laughs.-</p>
<p>Kevin: Hilarious huh? totally insane I know!"</p>
<p>Sarah: Yah, nice try genius... but next time don't use your own user name.</p>
<p>-Kevin looks at the screen while saying "Darnit" and then types out while saying out loud "Nevermind, Sarah says it's a no go."-</p>
<p>____________________ 3. This idea is actually sort of a Soap Opera begining to the show, so imagine a soft edge around the screen and everyone being very dramatic as they perform this like Passions or something.</p>
<p>-The office appears on the screen and Text fades in which reads:-</p>
<p>"As The Office Stays Incredibly Still and Boring"</p>
<p>-Sarah walks in, distressed, she confronts Kevin who has his face turned from the camera till Sarah speaks, at which time he swivels around in his chair, placing his elbow on the arm rest and his hand on his chin.-</p>
<p>Sarah: There's something I need to tell you... it's... about The Gems..."</p>
<p>Kevin: What is it Sarah, talk to me... whats the matter?"</p>
<p>Sarah: The Gems... they are.. they are having an affair!"</p>
<p>Kevin: No! this can't be!"</p>
<p>Sarah: It's true! I saw them... "</p>
<p>Kevin: Impossible... but your carrying their child! What a sick sick world we live in..."</p>
<p>-sarah sobs as an Intern comes in looking very upset-</p>
<p>Intern: I just got a call from the hospital... it appears that the Set of Attack of the show was in a Car accident... it... it didn't survive."</p>
<p>Kevin: My God..."</p>
<p>Sarah: No... not the set... it was so young... so...kind and helpful...</p>
<p>Kevin: Thats it... I can't take anymore of this madness.. I'm leaving television for good."</p>
<p>Sarah: but how can you? They towed your car last week! I drove you to work today..."</p>
<p>Kevin: Oh... then... I guess I'll stay.... for one... more... day."</p>
<p>(Whatever works best... I just like these three Ideas: 1. Genie in an NES Game 2. Kevin's Half Baked Idea Shot Down 3. Soap Opera opening)</p>

<p>so I think the 30 seconds should be devoted to recognizing that you're show at 3am has very specific commercials. What you present in between your quality Attack programming makes me feel as if I've already become something I truly hope to avoid, in debt. I mean you run the commercial of the guy dressed in the suit covered in question marks running around DC screaming about unknown government programs that can save you money. That commercial is so dated he says that you're sticking it to Clinton by buying his book. Along with riddler wannabe you have both (usually seen back to back) versions of the entrepreneur commercials. I.e. "I made money (but not really that much money) just by going to this website, so you should too!" While these 3 commercials only melt my eyes slightly, the worst of them all is the Rhapsody online music program commercial where the guy repeats "You gotta get Rhapsody!" until your toes no longer exist. Why do I not need a credit card? am I not good enough for a credit card? The worst part is that it's run by the realNetworks (exhibited in the fine print) which produces the most annoying audio format in existence and already a devout money-mongering organization. Oh and last but not least, don't forget the Debt Free commercials, which are only marginally mindnumbing. For some reason, I just don't believe it's an actual non-profit organization. These four commercials are run ad nauseam throughout the program. So what I'd like to see is some sort of giveaway to help a special viewer get out of the debt that they are most obviously in, as your commercials only allow one viewpoint of the viewers, that they are: 1. In need of money. 2. In debt and in need of money. 3. College students in debt and in need of money.</p>

<p>Kevin, Sarah and Brendan are standing in a blank room.</p>
<p>Announcer: It was a normal day at the Attack of the Show set, when suddenly. . .!</p>
<p>(a generic explosion takes place to the left. Out of the explosion Crash Bandicoot appears wearing an eye patch, pirate hat, with a parrot on his right shoulder and left arm decaying.)</p>
<p>Crash: Yarr, It be I, Zombie. . .Pirate Crash Bandicoot and I'm here to kill Naughty dog for selling me (voice slowly getting quieter) to. . .you know. . .t-that one guy. . .(starts crying uncontrollably) I don't even know anymooooorre.</p>
<p>Announcer: Then, with Crash's breakdown, an unseen force notices its chance to strike. Suddenly it began to rain evil, radio active Ice Creams! (A bunch of strawberry ice cream cones fall from the sky) And they decided to posses Crash Bandicoot to make him think he's Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>Crash (In Sonic like voice): Hey, I'm Sonic the Hedgehog and I'm going to turn the world into a music based game.</p>
<p>Kevin: Nooo, what will the lawn gnomes do?</p>
<p>???: We'll save the day!</p>
<p>(cue Original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Theme Song with the TMNT going through various poses)</p>
<p>Announcer (talking over the theme:) Yes, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have come to save the day, but will they succeed? But we all know the only way they will succeed against the horrible Crash, Sonic pirate zombie hybrid. . .of doom. . .is with a bout of mortal Tetris!!!</p>
<p>(A Black Screen with the word LATER in white letters)</p>
<p>(The Crash/Sonic thing floating triumphantly with tentacles now growing out his back with Turtles in hurt position)</p>
<p>Crash: (in 5 year old girl voice:) Yea, I win!</p>
<p>Mario: Not-a-if I can-a help it-a. It's-a me-a, Mario!</p>
<p>(A black screen with the words two hours later in white letters)</p>
<p>Some guy: (to the tune of the tetris theme) two hours later</p>
<p>(Crash now with chicken head, floating triumphantly once again with Mario in a hurt position)</p>
<p>Mario: Mama mia.</p>
<p>Crash: (Opens his beak and we hear a wild assortment of barnyard animal sounds)</p>
<p>Mircosoft Sam: Here I come to save the day!</p>
<p>Everyone: Mircosoft Sam-ta!</p>
<p>Crash: (Lets out barnyard assortment again)</p>
<p>Mircosoft sam-ta: Ho Ho Ho merry holidaymas</p>
<p>Announcer: So then Mircosoft Sam-ta released the universe's greatest gift, Mentos the fresh maker! (Mentos in boxes and rolls rain from the sky and a giant yellow banner with the word "YEY!" floats down from the ceiling)</p>
<p>Everyone: Yea!!!</p>

<p>Scene opens up with insane heavy metal riff in the background. Wide shot of Kevin Pereira skiing down a slope of a mountian, shooting a pistol at a fleet of helicopters chasing him. The helicopters are all black, and are only firing machine guns.</p>
<p>PEREIRA: Give up, Dr. Tallarico! I've got your precious secret plans, and you won't stop me from reporting you to the proper authorities!</p>
<p>One of the helicopters pulls ahead of the pack and flies ahead of Pereira. In it, Dr. Tallarico (Played by David Duchovny) speaks on a megaphone to Agent Pereira.</p>
<p>DR. TALLARICO: The end is now, Kenneth! Behold, for your death is at this moment, where we will kill you, and then you will die! From the pain!</p>
<p>Dr. Tallarico gives the signal to his fleet. They fire hundreds of missiles at the skiing Pereira, who finds a ramp/hill in the mountain side, and does a 1080 double whats-it flip to avoid all blasts.</p>
<p>PEREIRA: For Capitalism!</p>
<p>Using his pistol (in mid-air), Pereira shoots one bullet at each Helicopter. The bullets hit precisely the right spot of the fuel tank, causing each to explode with one shot. Out of bullets, Agent Pereira throws his pistol at the last helicopter (Carrying Dr. Tallarico), which breaks through the glass, hits the helicopter driver in the face, and causes him to get knocked out. The helicopter is explodes.</p>
<p>The chase over, Agent Pereira comes to a stop and observes the mountainscape. He takes out a forty out of nowhere and pours it on the ground.</p>
<p>PEREIRA: This ones for you, Agent Moran. Mission accomplished.</p>

<p>(on the idea that each show eventually ties together to make a daily mini show/series and each skit has significance's [to keep us dying to see more "<b>WOW THAT WAS AMAZING</b>" stuff] I create this)</p>
<p>4&amp;1/2 second intro Office Jesus is at the urinal (chest up only view) Gavin walks in and is in pleasant "awe" to see that o/j uses the urinal. o/j's right shoulder does three hard twitches the sound of the gown/dresss/robe? falling into place. O/j turns towards Gavin and lays his right hand on Gavin's forehead as if blessing him or palming it like a basket ball, O/j then turns to the sink and lightly washes his hands. then leaves the can. he glides past (probably on a skateboard pulled by a rope) steve's "cubicle/office" and we see a glimpse of what might be either the words "home rowed" or something of the like on the monitor. the lights flicker in the office and the monitor sparks and the screen shuts off. this happens really fast and you have to be a forum /aots geek to even begin to catch it, most will notice that jesus just killed the editor's office. Office jesus then glides past kevin and sarah doing one of the other skits posted by a user (hopefully the fart skitt)[on a later date when they do that skit you see office jesus glide by in the background for no explained reason] .. then sarah farts uncontrollably. Office jesus pops up in the bar where drunk vader is and makes all the liquor disappear and hurries to brendan's location and puts a vex on him rendering him babeless and walks away with woman brendan is about to score.Brendan then says <i>"I think my mojo is gone"</i> then an evil look comes over his face as if he has plan.While he watches O/j leave with the hotty (or fat pig who cares)... maybe hitman for hire krose to pull a homerowed on office jesus? who knows.. stay tuned and we shall see how this plays out!</p>

<p>Ok...this script is a little longer than 30 seconds but its only like 40-50 seconds, but atleast it isnt some unoriginal piece of crap by some freak tard that couldnt come up with something so he just wrote a stupid story about Office Jesus farting on Drunk Vaders head. I think Kevin and Sarah will enjoy this script...srry Brendan couldnt fit you in.</p>
<hr />
<p>-Kevin walks out of studio and two henchmen quickly throw a pimp robe on him and give him a bejeweled cup and a cane-</p>
<p>While Henchies put on robe Kevin says-"Uhg...I cant stand working with those nobodies and pretending I like it."</p>
<p>Kevin is walking down the street and notices some slutty dressed girls and says-"Hey there...ladies"</p>
<p>-A homeless guy, ofcourse the generic homeless guy, brown clothes, dirty, grey mustache, older, bumps into Kevin-</p>
<p>Kevin-"Do you have any idea who I am, I am the only person in the world to rate a 10 on a scale of ass-kickery"</p>
<p>-Kevin pulls out a poster from inside his robe that displays the official scale of ass-kickery, it looks like 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10 the camera zooms into the zero and slowly pans across to the number ten, but above the number 0 is a picture of Vin Diesel, above the 1 is a picture of Little Orphan Annie in order to truly show how uncool Vin Diesel is, and above the 10 is a picture of Sarah Lane-</p>
<p>-The homeless guy mumbles and walks off-</p>
<p>-Kevin looks at the poster and realizes he is no longer the highest ranked on the scale and breaks down-</p>
<p>-Changes scene to Sarah back in the studio behind the desk where Kevin usually is-</p>
<p>Sarah-"This will all soon be mine Muhahahaha"</p>
<p>-Kevin bursts on studio and grabs a shovel out of his robe and hits Sarah's head off, which is obviously a manican.</p>
<p>Kevin-"Over my dead body." ...or some other lame line</p>
<hr />
<p>This is a pretty good script, and it will be funny after its done cause clearly Sarah isnt dead cause she is still on the show, so the script holds no meaning</p>
<p>Some things that might add to the humor would be having the two henchmen be huge and thick (preferrably uncut-im not gay or anything but it would funnier) dudes and one accidentaly drops the bejeweled cup, and Kevin gets pissed and says "Why I oughta" and threatens to hit the henchi with the cane, this would be funny cause his henchies are huge (like i prefer) and i am a skinny white guy who is probably very small</p>
<p>Another would be have the homeless guy instead of being generic homeless guy, have him look like the homeless guy off of Aqua Teen Hunger Force, I know Kevin knows what im talking about here</p>
<p>And last, have Sarah say "This will all soon be mine Muhahahaha" in a bored normal voice like she was reading it or something, and have her actually say Muahahaha, instead of laughing</p>
<p>OH AND ALSO---All u dumb basterds dont bother editing this cause its perfect as is, cept for the AOTS writers</p>
<p>Written by J-Koenig heyman18@hotmail.com</p>
<p><i>I believe it is up to us, the readers, to decide what is perfect and what is not. Telling people not to edit your script that you posted to a wiki is... basically being a n00b and telling people not to treat you like one even though you are. And it's not perfect.

<p>Music: We hear mock-up score similar to the theme in the movie 'Home Alone' - we just change a few notes here and there</p>
<p>Kevin plays himself (Note that McCaulay's character in 'Home Alone' was Kevin anyway, which adds extra underlying humor to it)</p>
<p>Kevin is sitting in a room type setting sipping on a mocha-frappa-whatever drink (it would be funny if the side of the cup said that as well) as purchased from his local hip-corporate coffee chain. Instead of wild and crazy things happening, he just sits there drinking his coffee.</p>
<p>Camera gets a side angle view of him sitting at the computer desk table, with a Window in the background (it would be nice if it looked as if it were night-time with a fake full moon in the sky)</p>
<p>(dramatic movie voice)</p>
<p><i>announcer:</i></p>
<p><i><b>THIS SUMMER</b></i></p>
<p>cut to a shot of Kevin typing on the keys from different dramatic angles</p>
<p><i><b>YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN KEVIN FINDS HIMSELF LEFT..</b></i></p>
<p>cut to a shot of him sipping the coffee up close, casually (to hear a slurp sound effect would be nice too)</p>
<p>Camera pans back to get a better shot of the window.</p>
<p>Cue Jeff knocking on the outside window behind kevin, wearing a beanie cap and a sweatshirt with another shirt underneath, also a jacket -ala Joe Pesci with an overly pesci-mean look on his face (he should be kneeling slightly since Pesci is short IRL)</p>
<p>Brendan is standing next to him with a fake goatee and a crowbar, wearing a plaid paul-bunyon-esque red shirt ala Daniel Stern (raises crowbar in the air and shakes it)</p>
<p>Kevin rolls the chair around to face the camera</p>
<p>Camera zooms quickly in on his face</p>
<p>Kevin puts his hands on his face ala the classic Home Alone face. Maybe we can have him take a really quick sip of the coffee right before he puts his hands on his face (before the camera zoom) for comedic effect.</p>
<p><i>announcer:</i></p>
<p><i><b>HIPSTER ALONE</b></i></p>
<p>(use chyron to add the text of this to the screen - if possible, add a small picture of the sillouette of a house in between the HIPSTER and ALONE to simulate the actual movie poster)</p>
<p>End segment</p>

        Look! (pointing) Wikipedia! It's all interlinked, and I noticed some 
        articles needed updating....

                   KEVIN
        Sarah, you've already got your own website.
        Why don't you just update that? 

                   SARAH
        But... But... Wikipedia is COLLABORATIVE! It's DISTRIBUTED! 
        It's a NOBLE EXPERIMENT!

                   BRENDAN
         Yeah, just like the Internet. 
        (short silence)

                   SARAH
        (still staring at screen) Hey, can you loan me $40? 
        Wikipedia is having a fund-raising drive....
