<p>I view the Mongolian theory of Attila as a biased concoction of Roman scholars. I would like to address the historical bias and inaccuracies regarding Attila’s ethnic background. Although there are many Roman accounts of King Attila, one may find the true answer through Hungarian (Magyar) mythology and history. The Hungarians themselves are a truly special and unique people of the European continent. Hungarian oral tradition claims that Attila was the leader of one of many Hungarian klans, whose loosely organized principalities stretched from the Danube to the black sea. Furthermore, The Hungarian language itself is NON-Indo-European, and the people are descendents of nomadic warriors who’s tribal networks stretched from the Danube to the black sea between the 5th and 9th century. Even today, Hungarian legend is full of beautiful stories about their origin and national hero. You can read an interesting collection of translated stories in English at this website.

<li>Since the Huns were nomadic they might have come from anywhere. John Man, author of Attila The Hun (Bantam Books, 2005), convincingly paint them as 'out of asia' few centuries prior to the same stock that also gave birth to later Mongols. - <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERed1_D_Oon_823d.html" title="User:Red1 D Oon">Red1 D Oon</a> 12:56, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am currently translating the article to Bulgarian and here is a list of my questions/remarks. I hope that they will help to improve the text.</p>
<ul>
<li>Background
<ul>
<li>Mongolian/Turkic tribe - the statement will be disputable; Turk/Mongols are first mentioned scenturies later - may be it is better to use pre-Mongolian/pre-Turkic instead?
<ul>
<li>Possibly. "Proto-Mongolian" or "proto-Turkic" might also work. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">—No-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<i>Jones</i></a>&#160;<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv"><sup>(m)</sup></a> 17:58, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shared kingship
<ul>
<li>What means <i>350 pounds of gold</i>? I suppose that it has to be the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_weights_and_measures.html#Weight_2" title="Historical weights and measures">Roman libra</a>. May be a conversion in <a href="../../../k/g/_/Kg.html" title="Kg">kg</a> will be of some use.
<ul>
<li>My source (Thompson, if I remember correctly) used "pounds"; I assume he meant the Roman pound, so that works out to about 114.5 kg of gold. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">—No-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<i>Jones</i></a>&#160;<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv"><sup>(m)</sup></a> 18:03, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Their ambitions contented for a time...</i> - is it precise? If I understand well they just wanted the observance of the 434 treaty. My English is not perfect but I wouldn't call this <i>ambition</i>.
<ul>
<li>Well, that was their pretense for the attack. Their behavior suggests that simple greed played some part as well; perhaps "desire" would be a better word. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">—No-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<i>Jones</i></a>&#160;<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv"><sup>(m)</sup></a> 17:58, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>...more to come until the end of the week. --<a href="../../../n/k/_/User%7ENk_5884.html" title="User:Nk">Nk</a> 12:42, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sole ruler
<ul>
<li>Similar problem with the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Mile.html" title="Mile">miles</a>. I suppose they are Roman miles of 1479 m.
<ul>
<li>Yes, very probably. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">—No-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<i>Jones</i></a>&#160;<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv"><sup>(m)</sup></a> 12:14, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Appearance, character, and name
<ul>
<li>The Gothic/Atil origins of the name are clear. But the pre-Turkish is not explained; the language of the Land-Father is not indicated. Is Land-Father the pre-Turkish origin or we have two different origins: pre-Turkish and something else (what?)?</li>
<li>May be we can use pre-Tukic instead of pre-Turkish. The connection with the Turkish seems too distant for me.
<ul>
<li>I did not write those parts and am not sure about what's there. This part may need rewriting with reference to real scholarship: I suspect that some of the etymologies derive more from nationalist feelings than from linguistic study. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">—No-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<i>Jones</i></a>&#160;<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Mirv_1dda.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Mirv"><sup>(m)</sup></a> 12:14, 6 Dec 2004 (UTC)</li>

Second, the ethnic and linguistic identity of the European Huns is not at all certain; they were probably proto-Mongolian or proto-Turkic, but without knowledge of their language (scholars know exactly one word, <i>strava</i>, which means something like <i>funeral</i>) we can't say for sure. Third, the quotation from Callinicus is a quotation and should not be changed; he called the Huns "barbarian", not "glorious", and he used the name "Constantinople", not "Istanbul". <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">—No-One</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<i>Jones</i></a> 19:20, 10 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am half hungarian and my family is very proud of its heritage, my father talks about Hungry all the time, and eat hungarian sausages on thanksgiving, any way, no one in my family ever talks about Attilia the Hun or how much they love him. I do know owever that Attilia is a common Hungarian name, my grandfather had another Hungarian friend named Attilia.</p>
<p>So im not sure if the hungarians realy love Attila, to say that we think of ourselves as his decendants or decendants of the huns is rediculous. Most hungarians, at consider themselves decendants of the megyar people, another tribe from the urasian steps. In fact in hungaraisn the word for "hungarain" is "megyar" &amp; the word for "Hungry" is "Megyarortzag" (i apalogize i think i butchered that spelling) Gregor Vincent 20:00, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The idea comes from such literature as <a href="../../../g/e/s/Gesta_Hunnorum_et_Hungarorum_f2fa.html" title="Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum">Gesta_Hunnorum_et_Hungarorum</a>, which is supposedly based upon earlier stories no longer extant. A common analysis is that the intended purpose of creating a pedigree from Huns to Hungarians is to legitimize Magyar rule and sovereignty over the area recognized as being Attila's former kingdom in that age's politics. --<a href="../../../s/b/o/User%7ESborsody_63e3.html" title="User:Sborsody">Stacey Doljack Borsody</a> 22:25, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I reverted some edits; here's my explanation. I mean no insult to the author, but the text is sophomoric at best and would not of much use even if it were to get the thorough copyediting that it needs.</p>
<p><i>Atilla was raised as a true Hun, and from a young age was known as an excellent horseman. He grew up along side a Roman named Flavius Aetieus, who stayed with the huns as part of a hostage exchange. A literal show of good faith between the two peoples. While the two became freinds, in an ironic twist of histroy; Aetieus later lead the Romans against Attilla on the field of battle.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../a/e/t/Aetius.html" title="Aetius">Aetius</a> was between 10 and 15 years Attila's senior, and while he did spend some time (how much, exactly, is unclear) as a hostage among the Huns, it is misleading to state that Attila "grew up alongside him". Certainly they knew each other; quite possibly they got along well. Speculation like this needs to be cited to scholarly sources.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I know that "ironic" is so frequently misused that it has lost much of its original meaning, but there is nothing ironic about people who spent time together in youth fighting each other in adulthood. Especially when they are both sons of important political figures of two major empires that were at war throughout much of their history.</p>
<p><i>It should be noted that Bleda was killed during a hunting accident. Hunting already a dangerous sport, would provide an acceptable explanation. While providing an easy opporotunity for assasination.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I can't find the origin of this story about hunting in the classical sources. I'm pretty sure it's later speculation; I can't figure out exactly where it came from. Again it needs attribution (and not to Age of Empires, please: it's a great game, but it's not a reputable source).</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>It should also be noted that there is some speculation that Bleda may have assasinated Rua. Thus having eventually been supplanted through the same means he used to gain power.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Speculation like this needs to be cited to scholarly sources.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Near the turn of the century a TV movie based on Atilla was produced by Turner Network Television. However a number of liberties went into the story of the movie, libeties which actually supplanted a much more interesting real-life series of ironies.</i></p>
<p>See <a href="#representation_in_art" title="">#representation in art</a> above; the same comments apply. Previous remarks about the use of "irony" also apply. —<a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Charles&#160;P.</a><a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">&#160;<small>(Mirv)</small></a> 08:44, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have changed origin of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Huns_a59a.html" title="The Huns">The Huns</a>. First of all, I should make a clear defination of <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_peoples.html" title="Turkic peoples">The Turks</a>. It is mostly used to identify 25 tribes( such as Hun, Kıyçak, Tatar, Őzbek, Oĝuz, Siyenpi, Azeri ) who lived in <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Asia_5707.html" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a>.

The word of Turk " Tǖra ", is firstly found at the early Persian sources " Firdavsi ". The Persian used the word of Tura-Turan to identify the area of <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Asia_5707.html" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a>. They were under a great pressure of people who lived in Tura-Turan. That's why, the people who lived in <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Asia_5707.html" title="Central Asia">Central Asia</a> were called Türa.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_peoples.html" title="Turkic peoples">Turk</a> is used to identify a group of families. Teoman, the great leader of the Turks, took over control of all families, with idea of Great Türaian Empire. In 2nd century, the kingdom was divided into two kingdom, Northern Hun Kingdom and Southern Hun Empire.</p>
<p>In the 3rd century, Siyenpies had fought aganist Huns to have control over the tribes. At the end, the Huns lost the war. There were many reasons for the Turks to walk through east, and one of them was the result of the war. Since, leader family of The Huns was forced to migrate, and some of the tribes didn't recognize Siyenpies as the leader of The Great Türaian Empire.</p>
<p>The families started to migrate through the East. <b>Balamir</b>, a great commander of The Huns, and his approximately two thousand riders passed <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Europe_1e16.html" title="Western Europe">Western Europe</a> with a great speed. They were lastly seen in Spain.</p>
<p><br />
Atilla the Hun was a European Huns' king. He was assassinated. After his dead, the kingdom disappeared.</p>

<p>Hungary comes from Onoguri, a Bulgar sub-branch. There are different theories about this. Some claim that prince Arpad was the son of Khan Almash, the Bulgar ruler on Volga. Arpad led a horde of fino-ugrians away. Others say that the Majars were mistaken to be part of the Onoguri. Both seem plausible as all empires at that time were multi-ethnic. A horde of fino-ugrians could have easily lived together with the Onoguri and broken away later on. -- Kaloyan* 16:33, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, there are nothing that indicates parts of Scandinavia was ever controlled or even visisted by the Huns. The map is clearly exaggerating the extent of the Huns. Something should really be done about it.</dd>

<dd>

<dd>I have completely re-engineered the map. The map is now centered on the the empire itself (instead of Iran), the "borders" of the empire are more conservatively drawn (no more Sweden), the colors are based on the semi-official ones at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Maps#Map_colors" class="extiw" title="w:en:Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Maps">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Maps</a>, and I made an attempt to place Attila's capital.

<dd>Interestingly, I found a map in which also shows modern Denmark and the southern half of Sweden as part of Attila's empire. Even more interesting, these maps were originally created by a Norwegian team. So, there must be some (other) source out there that insists that this part of Scandinavia was conquered by the Huns.</dd>
<dd>But it makes no sense to me. It would have been nearly impossible for the Huns to reach Sweden, given that they were almost exclusively cavalry. And what does it mean to be part of the Hun empire? Likely, it means that the territory paid tribute and perhaps contributed troops.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I thought I would bring it up here. <a href="../../../m/a/p/User%7EMapMaster_75f4.html" title="User:MapMaster">MapMaster</a> 01:26, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>hello guys, the problem is that Attila has been taught as a powerful turkic leader in class in Turkey. And many people has its name -even my name resembles Attila:) Therefore it has a clear influence in turkish culture. However, there is no clear proof of that in academic world. What is clear is that eastern Huns (Xiongnu) has some Turkic roots. However the relation between european Huns and Xiongnu is not clear, too. I think many nations today can see Huns as their origin (magyar, german, turk etc.). This is just fine since Huns were a confederation, not a single entity. I would suggest to stress this, instead of providing a clear connection to any nation. by the way, the first undisputed Turks are Gokturks in 6th century. <a href="../../../a/t/i/User%7EAti7_80aa.html" title="User:Ati7">Ati7</a> 09:38, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to Dr Peter Heather, the celebrated historian and author of 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' the stuff about Attila having been a hostage in Rome in his youth is a 'later piece of nonsense' with no basis in fact.± Attila the Hungarian?

<p>MapMaster, there is some speculation regarding the location of Attila's capital. In Hungarian folklore in particular, it was either based on the ruins of the Roman city of Acquincum (today in Budapest), or it was his mobile 'wooden castle' (as described by Priscus rhetor on his visit to Attila's camp), which as you say was based primarily in the Hungarian Great Plain, somewhere near the Tisza River. And, unlike is stated in the text, it was the Tisza that was diverted to bury the dead king. (Shame that Hungarian is not better understood, people with an interest in Attila and the Huns would find a gold mine of information and stories&#160;:)) <a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHunor-Koppany_3959.html" title="User:Hunor-Koppany">Hunor-Koppany</a> 04:53, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
