<dd><i>White House news release.</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd><i>The President completed his review of the findings and sentences of the Military Commission appointed by him on July 2, 942 which tried the eight Nazi saboteurs. The President approved the judgment of the Military Commission that all of the prisoners were guilty and that they be given the death sentence by electrocution. However, there was a unanimous recommendation by the Commission, concurred in by the Attorney General and the Judge Advocate General of the Army, that the sentence of two of the prisoners be commuted to life imprisonment because of their assistance to the Government of the United States in the apprehension and conviction of the others. The commutation directed by the President in the case of Burger was to confinement at hard labor for life. In the case of Dasch, the sentence was commuted by the President to confinement at hard labor for thirty years. The electrocutions began at noon today. Six of the prisoners were electrocuted. The other two were confined to prison. The records in all eight cases will be sealed until the end of the war.</i></dd>

<p>The 'U-Boat operations' section of this article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attacks_on_America_during_WWII#U-Boat_operations" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attacks_on_America_during_WWII#U-Boat_operations" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> badly needs fixing. It implies there were only a few ships sunk off the eastern seaboard of the US during WWII by German U-boats. This is false.</p>
<p>In reality, the German U-boat crews quite rightly referred to the carnage they inflicted on US east coast shipping as "the second happy time." Over 500 ships were sunk, multiple <i>millions</i> of tons lost. Only US government wartime censorship prevented this news from reaching the US public during the war.

<p>The ship sinkings that this article covers I feel should be limited to ships that were sunk within sight of the mainland.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Most of the millions of tons of US coastal shipping sunk by U-Boats during "the second happy time" were within sight of the US mainland. Many of them were visible to the German submarines at night because they were backlit by the lights of US cities.

<p>The title of the article is "Attacks on the United States <i>mainland</i> during World War II" From the Wikiepdia articles on <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainland.html" title="Mainland">Mainland</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_United_States_c894.html" title="Continental United States">Continental United States</a> it seems Hawaii doesn't belong in any description of the US mainland; and while Alaska might be considered a part of the <i>continental</i> US, the islands off Alaska are not -- as defined in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_United_States_c894.html" title="Continental United States">Continental United States</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps Pearl Harbour and the Battle of the Aleutian Islands should be moved to the "See also" section? Or is there any other solution which will work? Cheers, <a href="../../../m/a/d/User%7EMadmagic_062e.html" title="User:Madmagic">Madmagic</a> 08:06, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Good point, Madmagic. If not move Pearl Harbor and the Aleutians to another page, would renaming the article "Attacks on United States soil during World War II" or the like suffice? Then again, I'm now seeing images of jackbooted people wielding spray-bottles...

<p>Afterthought: Thinking of shipping, make that something like "Attacks on United States territory during World War II"...? (Also dismisses the fiendish bottle-wielders.)</p>
<hr />
<dl>
<dd>And another point: neither Alaska nor Hawaii were <b>states</b> at the time! Neither were the Philipines, Wake, Guam nor Midway, but they were US territory; where to draw the line? What the heck - leave it as it is - shoot all pedants! <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolks_at_137_5f34.html" title="User:Folks at 137">Folks at 137</a> 17:07, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps it would help to expand the opening paragraph, which currently is only a single line: "Attacks on the United States mainland during World War II by the Axis Powers were rare, mainly due to North America's geographical separation from the central theatres of conflict in Europe and Asia."</dd>

<dd>I can add to this to state the scope of the article, including links to the <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainland.html" title="Mainland">Mainland</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_United_States_c894.html" title="Continental United States">Continental United States</a> articles.

<dd>Good luck! I suspect that the scope of this is largely subjective, since most Americans probably regard the "mainland" or the "contiguous states" as insulated from foreign attack, therefore they (and others) are interested in the exceptions. In terms of WW2, attacks on Hawaii, or Guam, are probably of less curiosity than those on Alaska. I talk as a non-American not living in North America, so unreliable. Probably best to just restate the existing scope and back off quickly. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolks_at_137_5f34.html" title="User:Folks at 137">Folks at 137</a> 16:24, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How about including Hawaii and the Aleutians under the title "Attacks on the United States <i>homeland</i> during World War II" – or might that upset another group of people? &#160;<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Kernow_9a2b.html" title="User:David Kernow">David Kernow</a> 21:34, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I must be blind or daft! Just realised that the new-ish article name (after all the wrangling) refers to the United States. But in the U-boat section there are refs to attacks in the St Lawrence and Newfoundland .... not US territory. Don't want to lose the info as it is related, but the title could become longer than the article (slight exaggeration for emphasis). <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolks_at_137_5f34.html" title="User:Folks at 137">Folks at 137</a> 19:26, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe a separate, smaller article covering attacks on Canada during World War II would be just as well; the present article is already quite long. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Kernow_9a2b.html" title="User:David Kernow">David Kernow</a> 20:18, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Cubdriver's suggestion sounds good to me; I doubt if there were sufficient attacks on non-US North America to be worth a separate article and there is a common thread. Better be careful, though: apart from US and Canada, Newfoundland was a separate British Crown Colony, St Pierre et Miquelon was Vichy French (subsequently Free French) and Greenland was Danish. I assume that the Aleutians will still be included in Alaska&#160;;-). There was Axis activity in each of these territories. I don't think there's anything else .... Sorry to have re-opened this can of worms. Good news is: I'm on holiday from Sunday so can't cause more bother for a while. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolks_at_137_5f34.html" title="User:Folks at 137">Folks at 137</a> 22:55, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, Greenland is usually considered part of North America, although under current U.S. military doctrine only the west coast is under the North American command; the east coast (where German WWII activity was limited) falls under the European command. I reckon the title would therefore have to be "Attacks on the North American continent" which would handily rule out Greenland and the French islands. What a deliciously convoluted subject! --<a href="../../../c/u/b/User%7ECubdriver_1b95.html" title="User:Cubdriver">Cubdriver</a> 00:14, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Using "mainland" was ruled out thanks to shipping; see above. Would people understand "North American territory" (as in "Attacks on North American territory during World War II") to include, incorrectly, territories such as the Philippines, Guam, etc? I think that line of thinking is what led to the current title, although it overlooks the Canadian references. Would it bear stretching to "Attacks on Canada and United States territory in North America during World War II"... or, if I may mix similies more or less deliciously, are the worms from the can about to crawl over another pitfall in this minefield of a title? &#160;Burp, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Kernow_9a2b.html" title="User:David Kernow">David Kernow</a> 00:48, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hang on, not just "Canadian", please. If Cubdriver's <b>strict</b> use of "continent" is used then Newfoundland and the Aleutians are also excluded (and Long Island?). I think that we should use the commonly accepted usage of North America, or the Wiki equivalent, and include adjacent islands. Most readers won't use the US military doctrine so don't be bound by that - inclusion of Greenland is debatable but I'd include it for completeness. How about "Attacks on North America during WWII" as previously suggested by Cubdriver? It's concise, easily understood and can be clarified in the intro. Nothing will be perfect. My head hurts, my fault for putting my foot in this minefield. Nice one Mr Kernow! <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolks_at_137_5f34.html" title="User:Folks at 137">Folks at 137</a> 08:18, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not at all! The continent includes the Continental Shelf, so the shipping lanes are included. And the islands under the jurisdiction of mainland capitals would be included as well. Not to worry about the Aleutians, Long Island, or Nova Scotia. I think that Greenland is another matter altogether. It was supposedly governed from Copenhagen, hence more European than North American. Heck, even the Tuborg bottles are today returned to Denmark for recycling. (I wasn't advancing the U.S. "commands" structure as an argument for including half of Greenland in the continent.) --<a href="../../../c/u/b/User%7ECubdriver_1b95.html" title="User:Cubdriver">Cubdriver</a> 10:20, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If anyone wants to attend to the title sooner rather than later, I'd agree that "Attacks on North America during World War II" seems the best fit. I'm intending to revisit a few areas of the article, but probably later rather than sooner.

<p>The article is confusing to read at the moment because actions and plans are not clearly delineated. Any military worth its salts has contingency plans for almost everything. It is just that they become more detailed the closer they come to operations. I suggest rearranging it under:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operations

<p>Can anyone point to evidence for German invasion plans of the US? I thought (supported by evidence) that <i>Felix</i> was to be the capture of Gibraltar and German access to bases in north-west Africa, with the objectives of denying the Mediterranean and north-west Africa to the Allies. It sounds more like a propaganda story, but I'm open to persuasion. <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolks_at_137_5f34.html" title="User:Folks at 137">Folks at 137</a> 23:02, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is a page <a href="../../../a/x/i/Axis_plans_for_invasion_of_the_United_States_during_WWII_8269.html" title="Axis plans for invasion of the United States during WWII">Axis plans for invasion of the United States during WWII</a> already.

<dd>I have added a merge tag. The two articles are going over the same ground to a large extent and all the information about invasion in the other article seems speculative to me. However, I can see that this article only covers actual attacks wheras the other one covers planned attacks that never actually happened, such as the Italian plans for midget submarine attacks on the USA. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimbo_c673.html" title="User:Shimbo">Shimbo</a> 19:18, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was disapointed to see the merge tag was removed without any discussion of the merits of the idea, or any reasoning. I've put it back until a consensus emerges. If the majority of people think it is a bad idea then fine I'll withdraw it. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimbo_c673.html" title="User:Shimbo">Shimbo</a> 08:36, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Once again the merge tag was removed without discussion. The comment said "There is a difference between plans and actual attacks", something I already mentioned just above. The solution to this is, as stated just above to have two sections to the article, one for attacks that happened and one for attacks which were planned but did not take place. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimbo_c673.html" title="User:Shimbo">Shimbo</a> 19:32, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I reinstated the description "defeat" for the U-boat campaign off the US east coast. It seems valid to me, given the avoidable losses that were suffered. Is there a consensus? Alternative words like "setback", "losses", "damage" just don't seem to indicate the severity of the impact and the fact that it stemmed from a policy decision (or indecision?). <a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolks_at_137_5f34.html" title="User:Folks at 137">Folks at 137</a> 21:01, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cubdriver removed the words and said: "<i>United States - I'm not aware that the "U.S. Navy" surrendered to Adm Donitz!</i>" True enough. But a defeat doesn't imply surrender (eg, Dunkirk (Allied defeat), El Alamein (Axis defeat), Kasserine pass (Allied defeat), etc): just a military setback at the hands of an opponent. And the U-boat campaign was certainly that.</dd>
