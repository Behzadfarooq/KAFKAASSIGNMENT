<p>It is usual in complex decisions to have an approval poll. For example, I can see approving "retain <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> as historic" and "finish work on <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> and redirect the other two when done" Thia has the advantage that we don't need to spend so much time on wording; anybody who disagrees with all the options can just add one. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 14:43, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The disadvantage is that the divergence makes it next to impossible to determine (let alone agree upon) which options(s) have consensus. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 14:56, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The solution has usually been to compile a count of all those&#160;!voting at all; usually compiled afterwards, but we could request that anyone&#160;!voting sign an overall list. If 80%, say, of those who have expressed any opinion approve "historic" or "redirect" then that's the consensus; if 80% approve both, it doesn't much matter which we do, but we can have a runoff if either of the 20% minorities feel strongly. (As I write, we have one Yes/No question, and one "If Yes, then..." question, so this is less of a problem.) <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 16:24, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Insofar as ATT has a policy tag on it now, I think it fine to say "merger implemented." Or at least I don't think anyone will be confused as to what they're voting on.

<dd>Well, I'm of two minds. For the last month WT:ATT has been hit by like five threads a day. It <i>has</i> been talked about. I don't know how much more useful information is going to be derived by (re-)posting to various locations. At the same time, we need to show due diligence to Jimbo. One thing we should not do is have this talk become another swamp—perhaps your Community discussion page is a better place to go. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 16:58, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Do we want a merger at all?</li>
<li>Is the present text of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> such a merger? does it represent present policy and practice?</li>
<li>Should present policy/practice be changed?

<p>Marksell, several editors in the mailing list have complained loudly that they did not know about ATT, despite all the activity that it generated.

<p>Look at it this way, Marskell: we are wagging the dog with the tail. First, we need the "wide community debate" as per Jimbo's and only then, a poll. But it seems that we are more gang-ho to get the poll designed before the discussion. Let's change that and focus on promoting the debate. Shall we? Giving some attention to the discussion page at <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_Community_discussion_ecd9.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Community discussion">Wikipedia_talk:Attribution/Community discussion</a>, would be best. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 22:35, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh yes. The wide community debate will be good. I suggest a pop culture exception be suggested off the top. More seriously, I'm just not getting it here—usually when you're a minority of one, you can deduce why you're wrong, but I can't. Given that Qs 2, 3, 4 <b>depend</b> on Q1, <i>why don't we just ask Q1</i>? It <i>will be</i> the community debate. It can be left up for a week, a month.

<p>Wow, there's already a talk page here.</p>
<p>I am concerned that canonical might not be a word everyone is familiar with, especially non-native speakers of English. I know we are not the Simple English Wikipedia, but is there a reason another word, like "primary policy", cannot be used?</p>

<dd>It's short and to the point. (I think user Marskell put in this version of the question.)

<dd>OK, maybe that question is too simple. However, I object to the wording "agree in principle" and the wording "intended" -- intended by whom? What is actually intended? Much too vague. I'm waiting for user Jossi to explain the reason for the revert to this vague wording. This wording is now in the third question.

<p>Some of the options currently seem rather polarising. It is possible that some editors will want some pages to stay merged, but not all three.</p>
<p>There is also the question of what to do if there is not consensus for WP:ATT. I am not sure what options everyone would like to see there, but I think "remain active with primary policy at WP:V and WP:NOR" should be on the list.</p>

<dd>You're missing my point. What we have <b>right now</b> are several options. To ask whether or not people agree with the merger in principle is to artificially limit them to the two extreme options (instead of permitting them to advocate compromise). Given the current wording, I'll have to vote "no" (despite the fact that I support <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>'s existence). If others act in kind, this could lead to a false consensus.</dd>

After your consultation, he announced that for the time being, "WP:ATT is canonical, and WP:V and WP:NOR exist as separate pages to more fully describe those."

<dd>David, he didn't, even at the very start, say he preferred ATT as a supplement. That would be senseless. I think we should remove that option, because clearly if NOR and V were restored as the main policies, there would be no need for ATT (as supplement, summary, or anything). <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:04, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>2. Again, I'm not claiming that Jimbo expressed a preference for such a solution. (I'm merely describing the situation that initially existed when Jimbo restored the old pages' policy/guideline status.) But that's irrelevant to the fact that several users <i>have</i> expressed a preference for this outcome. Your belief that it's a bad idea is a reason to vote against it, <i>not</i> valid justification for removing the option. If the community agrees with you, they'll vote against it too. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 17:14, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But using that reasoning, we could add any number of questions. The point is that we need to keep the poll as simple and meaningful as possible. If NOR and V are restored as policy pages, the last thing we want is to retain ATT with any kind of formal status, because it simply adds to the number of policy pages to be maintained, so we'd be in an even worse situation than we were before the merge. ATT could easily be retained as an essay anyway if the other two were retained as policy, so it's pointless including that as an option in this poll. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:18, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think that you quite understand the proposal. No one is arguing that all of the pages should retain "policy" status. Either compromise would result in exactly the same content appearing on the various pages. The only distinction lies in how to tag the pages and which one(s) to edit on a primary basis (as opposed to mirroring some or all of the content in modified form). One proposal would mean that the old pages would serve as expanded versions of the policy, while the other would mean that <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> would serve as a condensed version of policies/guideline (and not be a policy in and of itself).</dd>
<dd>In any case, I've merged two options into one (with the specifics to be addressed later). Hopefully, this is an acceptable solution. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 17:34, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because it doesn't ask it straight out. Remember that it's not just gathering input, but sorting it afterwards. Q1 as it stands is going to give us a straight, identifiable majority opinion—<i>the very thing that Wiki polls always fail to do.</i> I'm worried about Q3 and think it should be put on hold until we get an answer to Q1. Q3 may well produce only a plurality and thus indecision. Let's get the Yes/No done, and input on which of the three should be merged first. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 18:31, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. On the contrary, it <i>does</i> ask it straight out. Two of the options are essentially identical to the "yes"/"no" responses of question 1. The only difference is the inclusion of two compromise options (which allow respondents to express their actual viewpoints instead of forcing them to select an extreme scenario that they don't necessarily advocate).</dd>
<dd>2. This is <i><b>not</b></i> a majority vote. It's a straw poll, and we don't base policy decisions directly on straw polls. (By definition, they're non-binding.) This is merely an attempt to gauge the community's opinions (whatever they may be) for the purpose of furthering discussion, <i>not</i> an attempt to lump everyone together in one of two groups for the sake of expedience.</dd>
<dd>I did, however, attempt to eliminate unnecessary fragmentation by combining the two compromise options (leaving the specifics to be addressed down the road), but SlimVirgin reverted this change. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 18:44, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>2. Of course. This is still all subject to Jimbo's discretion and 50+1 isn't something we can rush to the bank with.

<dd>1. If you feel that the wording is confusing, why don't you help to revise it? You say that we "risk only deriving a plurality," as though that would be terrible thing. If no majority opinion exists, why do you seek to artificially create one by limiting people's choices? We can easily apply common sense to any plurality outcome or even a tie. (If each option were selected by 1/4 of respondents, that would mean that 3/4 of them favored the continued existence of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> in some form.)</dd>
<dd>2. The derivation of ambiguous data is precisely my concern. By forcing respondents to adopt an extreme position, we won't know how many of them would have preferred a compromise. As I said earlier, given question 1's current wording, I'll have to vote "no" (despite the fact that I support <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>'s creation). —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 19:17, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good surveys "artificially create" majorities all the time; if you're designing a survey, you often set out to do just that on particular questions. But it's not actually artificial, when you think about it more closely.

<p>&lt;&lt;&lt; (outdent). This all process was initiated by Jimbo, upon a request to gauge the level of consensus for ATT which he believes was not wide enough. I personally thing that all this process is not useful and that his proposal for discussion and poll was based on lack of detailed information about the aims of WP ATT and resulting work done by the 300 editors that participated in its development. Nonetheless, I want to pursue this process because we need to get an unambiguous response from the community: Do you agree with ATT, or not, based on the facts described at the top of the poll. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 19:51, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The wording must be unambiguous. There's no use having people vote that "yes, I agree that the pages be merged" and later have their vote interpreted as consensus for "Let's accept WP:ATT as it stands as the final version of the merge". It must be clear which one of these (or some other question) is really being asked. Words such as "agree in principle with" and "as intended at" must be avoided because they are ambiguous. One option for a clear question is "Do you agree with merging two or more of the policy pages listed below?" Another option is "Do you agree to accept WP:ATT as a merger of two or more of the policy pages listed below?"</dd>

<dd>Congratulations to user Pmanderson for coming up with a wording of the first question which is short, clear, to the point, and a nice complement to the other questions:
<ul>
<li><i>Should Wikipedia:Attribution be policy?</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Question 2 needs to be clearer, though: "Which pages, if any, should be merged into Wikipedia:Attribution?" Someone might vote "yes" meaning "yes, please move the contents of page X into page WP:ATT", and then be surprised to have their "yes" interpreted as "yes, please consider WP:ATT as it stands to represent fairly the contents of page X, which can now simply be demoted." Before the poll, perhaps we need to lay out what process will be followed afterwards. At the moment, the question looks quite ambiguous to me.</dd>

<dd>If question 3 accurately reflects what's going to happen, then a more accurate version of question 2 might be: "Which pages, if any, should be considered as having been merged into Wikipedia:Attribution?" However, a better way would be to make it clear that there will be reasonable time for moving material from the original pages to the merge page before the merges are considered complete. This would require rewriting question 3, which doesn't seem to allow that possibility. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 22:30, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But. .. that is not the question that need to be asked, as that was not what was challenged. What was challenged was <i>the merger of NOR and V into ATT</i>.

<dd>Regarding your second comment, what Q2 and Q3 seek to cvlarify is the consensus about how the merger (if at all) should be implemented.

<dd>You're not being dense. Coppertwig doesn't understand the situation or is pretending not to. ATT is policy, and that's not going to change. V and NOR are policy, and that's not going to change.

<dd>Thank you, Slim. I don't want to get into an edit war, but I've read the arguments here, and it seems quite clear that the poll is not on whether or not <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> is policy. The heat over the last few days seems to have been over whether or not the merge was a good idea. I have reverted back to Jossi's version, which I agree with, but I am open to arguments on the other side. I just didn't find the arguments in Coppertwig's edit summary to be compelling. A "clear, unambiguous, short" phrase can still have the wrong meaning. Coppertwig, instead of reverting again, could you explain on this talk page what the poll is actually about? <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElinorD_4da6.html" title="User:ElinorD">ElinorD</a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EElinorD_6fce.html" title="User talk:ElinorD">(talk)</a> 23:21, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It may be clear to some people that WP:ATT is now policy, but it is not clear to everyone. There are discussions on its talk page that there should be a "disputedpolicy" or similar tag on it to demonstrate its currently uncertain status. I consider its status uncertain, not currently clearly policy. And I don't think any one of us can predict the future.</dd>
<dd>Even if WP:ATT is now policy, that doesn't logically prevent us from writing the poll to ask whether it should be policy or not; if is now policy and if the poll says it should not be policy, then it can stop being policy.</dd>
<dd>It's my understanding that the purpose of "merging" policy pages was to reduce the number of policy pages. Having WP:ATT become policy while the others remain policy would be going in completely the opposite direction as far as that goes.</dd>
<dd>There was no merge tag on the policies to be merged during the long process of writing WP:ATT, and there is no merge tag on them now. If they are to be merged, they need merge tags for a good long time so that people who like those policies and don't want them merged (if there are any such people) have a good opportunity to notice the merge tags and participate in discussion. Policy pages should have merge tags for much longer than what is usually done for mere article pages (where I think two weeks is standard.)</dd>
<dd>My understanding of the situation is this: There was a proposal to merge pages and to present WP:ATT as the merged page, demoting the other pages and reducing the number of policy pages. Some people agreed to that; some opposed the specific wording of WP:ATT and were ignored; and some were not made aware of the debate due to lack of prominent merge tags on the pages to be merged. Nowhere was a wide consensus developed for increasing the number of policy pages by making WP:ATT policy. This poll can present two options: (1) use WP:ATT as a merge and demote the original pages or (2) demote WP:ATT, i.e. turn down the proposal to merge the pages. Or, the poll can present a larger number of options. It seems a good idea to present a larger number of options, including having WP:ATT as policy while the other pages remain policy. If this larger number of options is presented, then having the first question be about whether WP:ATT seems to me a good way to organize the whole thing -- it seems to fit in well with the other questions and make everything clear. Other versions of the first question that have been presented are too ambiguous.</dd>
<dd>I oppose vague wording. I oppose the wording "agree in principle with" and the wording "intended" as being too vague. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 00:55, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>SlimVirgin: I see you've reinserted the words "in principle". I oppose these words because they're vague. Maybe you could help me understand why you want these words there. If the question is "Do you agree in principle with the merger(s) implemented at Wikipedia:Attribution?" and a consensus is formed around "yes", then what exactly would happen? And if a consensus is formed around "no" for that question, then what exactly would happen? Please reply with your understanding of what would happen.

<dd>For example, we may end up with strong consensus on the merge, and strong consensus on option 3 of Q3, or any other combination.

<p><i>ATT is policy, and that's not going to change. V and NOR are policy, and that's not going to change.</i> My understanding was that Jimbo had called for wider discussion of the entire issue; statements like these seem premature. V and NOR were gone from the map last week, so anything can change. Hopefully broader discussion with more varied input will be encouraged this time 'round. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 21:10, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Question 1 should be removed or reworded. "In principle" looks like weasel wording to me, and I don't see the point of such vague formulation, expect for creating an <u>appearance</u> of community support for the ATT.

<p>What's this about options to have pages become "inactive"? Isn't that against the usual wiki way of doing things? Where are the options to have pages become guidelines? I think demoting one or the other set of pages to guideline status would probably be better than making them "inactive".

<dd>I disagree with SlimVirgin again, for two reasons: first of all, the pages do not say the same thing. You admit this whenever you refuse to revert back to the original wording. Secondly, two pages can say the same thing and one can be marked as policy and one not. For example, I could create a user page with an exact copy of one of the policy pages except for the policy tag. There is nothing logically impossible in doing so. It may even be useful, since one of the pages may later change so they are no longer saying the same thing. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 00:22, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it actually quite likely that if WP:ATT were made "canonical policy" (which sounds redundant to me) that the others would in fact become guidelines, since they will "will remain as explanatory pages", which by definition means they won't be saying the same things as WP:ATT, or they wouldn't actually be explanatory. The pages must all certainly <i>agree</i>, but not conflicting isn't the same thing as "all saying the same thing". — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 02:39, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is one question we could be asking; it is not the only question of interest. That's why we have question 2: to see what older policies should be folded into WP:ATT. I'm getting tired of this; I am tempted to support having Jossi poll his original vague question, watch it get shot down, and see what he does then. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 03:40, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is not about me, Pmanderson, or about what I will do "then". Seems that we have a stalemate on what the poll should be asking. My point is that I did not ask for this poll, Jimbo did. And he asked to gauge the level of consensus for the merger performed at ATT. Should we ask something else than that? Q2 and Q3 gives people the chance to vote for compromises about the future of ATT. Killing ATT outright will mean that 2,000 edits and 5 months of discussions by 300 editors count for nothing in Wikipedia. If that is the case, I want to know it, and I am sure others that invested all that time and effort will want to know as well. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 04:15, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's not necessarily true, you know. If the drafting of ATT is really superior to that of the other policy pages in their current form, it can be used, even if the decision is not to have the ATT page. I don't think people should be deciding how many pages we have on the basis of "all that good work will be lost if we don't decide in such and such a way". It need not be if the work is really that good. Good drafting work need never go to waste. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 07:08, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, if Jossi's changed his mind then I've become a minority and won't revert. Supposing you have three political parties and a survey asks whether you'd prefer a majority or minority for one of them (six options). You wouldn't actually need to ask prior to that "which party do you favour"—but you would ask. You want the simple data first. The questions <i>overlap</i> but aren't <i>redundant.</i> And save the silliness about forcing people to extremes; it's a matter of deriving general level data before moving to more complex responses. As with 3, there's a possibility that 2 will give us indecisive information and we'll have missed the chance to ask 1. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 15:34, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But, I think for the third time now, it's not just gathering data but how it's interpreted afterwards. My guess at this moment is that all will receive consensus (unless Jimbo makes a pronouncement that tilts toward No on one of them and people flock to his position). But suppose, for instance, that all deviate from 50-50 by +/- 2%. Someone could well argue that "I take this as a lack of consensus for ATT itself." But it might not actually be reflective of that. It might reflect people who do favour ATT in principle but are saying no to one or two of the originals being merged, or reflect those who favour ATT as a condensed summary (a terrible idea IMO, but it has been raised). We won't know. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 15:58, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem is that you're treating this as a majority vote to determine which single option is the most popular and immediately act on it. It isn't. It's a non-binding poll to gauge the community's opinions. If 28% of people vote to deactivate <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> and the remaining 72% are divided evenly between the other three options (24% each), that doesn't mean that the deactivation option "wins" and WP:ATT is rejected. It means that most of the community supports its existence in some form (and we continue discussing the best way to implement it). Of course, with the approval voting setup in place, people can select multiple options and rank them in order of preference. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 17:37, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Semantics aside, you clearly wish to obtain an immediate majority opinion, even if none actually exists. Again, your fear of "plurality outcomes" is unfounded. This is <i><b>not</b></i> an election in which the option with the most votes "wins" and all others "lose." This is a non-binding poll to gauge the community's opinions. If most users support <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>'s existence in some form, it won't be deactivated simply because they don't yet agree on one form in particular. Discussion will continue, and we'll work toward consensus. There is no valid reason to polarize the community by forcing everyone to adopt an extreme position. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 19:43, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"You clearly wish to obtain an immediate majority opinion"—on the basic question of whether ATT should exist, yes, I do. So what? I particularly want to be able to present a clear majority opinion to Jimbo on whether people find utility in ATT. It's not a position I need to apologize for. I know it's not an election.

<dd>No! That's what "in principle" is for; that's what the plural bracket (merger(s)) is for; that's what the instructions we could easily write could be used for. We can explicitly state "you do not have to support the merger in its entirety." <b>Do you believe ATT should exist?</b> or something like it. There's nothing extreme about it. Are you going to vote for the Liberals or Conservatives? ("Surely an extreme question! Let's not ask"). I'm still baffled.</dd>

<dd>1. You're still missing the point. (By "in its entirety," I'm <i>not</i> referring to the question of which pages to include.) "Yes" means "Wikipedia:Attribution should replace the merged pages."

<dd>It may well (not) establish it partially and arguably, as noted in the link to Jossi's talk. There is a very good chance that there will be strong consensus on all three, but there is a not insignificant chance that a super-majority approving of ATT in principle will appear as small majorities or even minorities on individual parts of the current Q1. If I were confident aggregates would be properly worked out I would be less concerned. But this is Wikipedia. There is no polling department; there are no market research professionals who parse our polls. And none of our damn polls ever achieve anything because too much is asked in poorly conceived questions. If the three options on the current Q1 come in at 60, 50, and 40% we'll be right back where we started. Nothing achieved; nothing decided. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 20:32, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sure. Jimbo challenged the <i>change in policy structure</i>, not ATT itself, as it contains within it <i>existing</i> policies of V and NOR whose status as policies are <i>not</i> in dispute (thank god). In his compromise, he agreed that ATT remain "canonical," and V and NOR are "explanatory". Then he suggested to open a wide discussion on the merits of ATT, followed by this poll. What is happening is that a drama has unfortunately unfolded with some people actually challenging V and NOR in the confusion (!!!). A nightmare, or close to it, IMO. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 21:24, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I very much support a straw poll. In the meantime, after an excellent discussion with SlimVirgin, we hammered out a compromise until we can have a fuller discussion. What the pages say now is that WP:ATT is canonical, and WP:V and WP:NOR exist as separate pages to more fully describe those. My big beef with this merger is that we often need to send people to a page like WP:NOR which explains in a rich and persuasive way what the policy is about and why it is a good idea. This involves sometimes saying things which overlap with parts of WP:V. (They are not the same idea!) The combined page provides a handy way to keep policy consistent and have a tight presentation of what policy actually is. The separate pages can be more detailed and understandable.--Jimbo Wales 21:35, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree with SMcCandlish here. I like the wording "Which pages, if any, should Wikipedia:Attribution comprise?" I have just reverted to it; Jossi had changed it to contain a statement which not everyone agrees with (I don't) and which made it considerably longer; maybe I missed it but I didn't see discussion on this page of that new wording. The "if any" part, plus the options currently given in question 2, allow the option of demoting WP:ATT, so I don't understand SMcCandlish's objection. I'm very happy to come back to look at this poll after being away about 24 hours and seeing it improved even further from yesterday. Short, clear, concise and to the point.

<dd>As said below and as said by Jimbo, and as stated in the headers of WP:V and WP:NOR, WP:ATT is currently canonical policy. The poll question needs to acknowledge that fact, and not describe ATT as a future merger. The merger is done.

<p>The issue which you are not addressing is that fact that WP:ATT <i>already</i> comprises V and NOR and partially RS, and that ATT is as of now canonical policy. That is a fact.

<dd>Wait! Something is missing! Possibly this is what SMcCandlish was getting at. We need to allow the option that certain pages will be merged, but that the current version of WP:ATT is not the merged version of them, but something else is.</dd>
<dd>If there is a convention that changes to policy can't be made without consensus, then the original policies should be the starting point -- not the current wording of WP:ATT, which was made without consultation from those who would participate if merge tags were to be displayed on the policy pages for a reasonable length of time. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 00:04, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I added a question that allows the above-mentioned option: <i>"Do you support the current wording of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> as the starting version of the merged policies?"</i>, and tsjtrf has deleted it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAttribution%2FPoll&amp;diff=117883454&amp;oldid=117875034" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAttribution%2FPoll&amp;diff=117883454&amp;oldid=117875034" rel="nofollow">here</a> with edit summary <i>:Your question is just plain inaccurate: the current WP:ATT is not the /beginning/ of anything, it's as finished a product as anything wiki ever will be</i>" but without addressing my above comment here on the talk page. Please discuss here before making changes. I disagree with tjstrf's statement in the edit summary. None of us can predict the future. WP:ATT was created without consultation from the people who would have had the opportunity to participate if there had been merge tags on the policy pages for which merges were proposed, therefore it is not a finished product but needs the input of those people to be incorporated; there are also other procedural allegations and many people do not agree that there is or ever was consensus for it. The wording of my question may not be perfect, but please fix the wording rather than deleting the question altogether, if I or anyone addes it back in, or else explain why that option should not be presented.</dd>
<dd>The intention is to allow voters an option which does not exist in the other questions: the option of voting in favour of merging certain pages but without certifying WP:ATT as being the merged version of the pages -- some other document or a (possibly major) modification of WP:ATT might be developed instead for that purpose. If you disagree with my wording, please find another wording of the question which allows that option. My question can also be considered a partial revert back to Henrygb's question about changing the wording of "verifiability, not truth", which does something similar although mine is more general.</dd>
<dd>Some issues that need to be worked out, either in this poll or in another process, are: Is there support for changing the word "verifiability" to "attribution", for example in the name of the policy? Is there support for having the words "not whether it is true" present without being balanced by the presence of a positive word with "truth" in its meaning such as "verifiability"?</dd>

<dd>If there is support for carrying out a merge process, then anyone who will come and start editing the merged policy after merge tags are placed on the policy pages for a reasonable length of time needs to be allowed to edit on the understanding that WP:V, WP:NOR and WP:RS are the original pages so that changing back to wording on those pages is a simple revert and quite acceptable and does not require broad consensus first, since there has already been broad consensus for the original policies. In other words, voting in favour of merge should not necessarily lead to the current wording of WP:ATT (or even, perhaps, its name) becoming policy, nor to the wording currently in the other pages necessarily being dropped rather than used to form a merged version. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 14:13, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only reason this issue is not being discussed on the community discussion page is because that thread was moved off the page -- an action some users opposed. I'm not the only one to raise the issue about the attempt to change longstanding policy wording -- see <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_Archive_13_67a7.html#It_doesn.27t_look_to_me_as_if_there_was_a_consensus." title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Archive 13">Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Archive 13#It doesn't look to me as if there was a consensus.</a> My posts on all this could have been far fewer and we could all have saved tons of time if users who support the new wording would engage in discussion with me aimed at achieving mutual understanding, and of achieving persuasion one way or the other or compromise or a better solution, and of achieving consensus. Part of the whole point of this poll is whether to accept the new <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> -- which suggests perhaps accepting some or all of its wording. This issue about the new "not whether it is true" wording was definitely part of the discussion a month or so ago; a number of objections were raised on this issue and pretty much ignored when "consensus" was declared, so I don't understand what you mean when you say it was not the issue on the talk page a month ago -- it was an issue there. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 23:23, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"<i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth</i>" has been changed to "<i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is attributable to a reliable published source, not whether it is true</i>." This was apparently to remove an ambiguity.

<dd><b>Support</b> such a poll question. This change in wording is of fundamental importance to the meaning and purpose of Wikipedia in my opinion. It has generated a large amount of debate but much more debate is needed in order to make progress in gaining understanding, persuasion or compromise, and consensus. A poll question on this part of the wording would be helpful. At the moment, if anyone wants to comment on the issue itself, please keep the debate in one place; I believe currently it's at <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_bbd5.html#Role_of_truth" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution">Wikipedia talk:Attribution#Role of truth</a>. Comments specifically about whether to have such a poll question are appropriate here, I believe. In my opinion, this poll is indeed the correct forum. The poll is about whether WP:ATT is to be accepted as a merger of WP:V and other pages. This change in policy wording is part of what might be accepted as part of the result of this poll; for example, if WP:ATT is accepted as it now stands as a merged version of the other pages, then in effect that wording change would be being accepted. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 21:26, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

&lt;&lt;&lt;(outdent) The merge, if it occurs, will necessarily involve a change in wording, unless the merge is done by copying two pages verbatim onto one and then letting wiki editors go at the result. Any particular implementation of the merge will involve a particular implementation of wording. That's why there are questions on the community discussion like whether the current WP:ATT is an accurate summary of the other pages. This particular bit of wording has generated a lot of discussion and objection; is there any other bit of wording as contentious as it at the moment? Not all bits of wording need questions. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 23:23, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Since Jossi can have one, I want one too! Heh. So, here's <i>my</i> personal interpretation of Jimbo's compromise: He has agreed to permit the proponents of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> to continue to <i>assert</i> (i.e. let <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> <i>say</i>) that it is policy, while he also ensured that the competing documents have been restored to the state in which they also make a (much longer-standing) assertion, and expects that at least for now WP:ATT will be an <i>attempt</i> to be a centralized place for these policy matters with the individual pages remaining more in-depth explorations of them. I find it exceedingly unlikely that the <i>withering</i> criticism he's personally directed at WP:ATT (in his official role, not just as a random Wikipedian) to have dissipated; he's simply leaving it up to the community to sort it out. He directly stated that WP:ATT <i>does not</i> have consensus (direct quote is "made without any consensus at all"), and never retracted that summation (cf. also this poll to <i>determine</i> what consensus actually is).</dd>
<dd>By <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPOLICY_ce11.html" title="WP:POLICY">definition</a>, it can't <i>really</i> be policy without either consensus or Jimbo's official seal of approval. Given that Jimbo labeled WP:ATT "a really bad idea", "a big mistake", "needs to be reverted immdiately because it is just wrong", "bad policy all around", "not the right way to make policy", "confusion", not "logical" not "sensibl[e], a usurper of the other policypages' "rightful place", a "radical change", "a monumentally bad idea", and not "coherent", the Jimbo seal of approval is <i>obviously</i> absent. All Jimbo has compromised on is <i>permitting the label</i> (for reasons he has not elucidated; I have my theories about what those might be), and Jossi and others have completely mistaken this temporary permissiveness for the seal of approval they are seeking, and have used this interpretation to mold the debate and the language of the poll.</dd>
<dd>I doubt I'm alone in this interpretation. I think what Jossi and a few others are missing is that absent a direct confirmation from Jimbo personally that The Jossi Interpretation is correct, it is <a href="../../../j/i/m/WP%7EJIMBOSAID_3445.html" title="WP:JIMBOSAID">not any more authoritative than anyone else's</a>, and that strident insistence upon any particular interpretation being what the poll text represents is inappropriate. I notice, below, that Jossi's taking a few days off, so this is really directed to the rest of the "ATT Cabal"&#160;;-) who've been using the same interpretation, just much less vociferously.</dd>

<dd>You are not alone in this interpretation. Jimbo has made it clear 1. he no longer thinks <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> is a good idea, and 2. he has also (but separately) concluded that it lacks consensus. Yet people here keep claiming that it remains policy just because Jimbo has said he won't declare it dead if, after broad discussion which is to include a poll, it can demonstrate that it has <i>built</i> consensus. Since several of those who have been working most diligently on it believed that it was policy until Jimbo declared that it is missing some essential elements of a WP policy, clearly he and they not only disagree on the value of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, but also on what would constitute a consensus for it. If "consensus" meant no more to Jimbo than establishing that those who have put thought and sweat into it for months believe that it is good as is, he would have accepted that verdict already. Clearly, consensus means fresh eyes need to be drawn to the project <i>and</i> they must give it a thumbs up for him to be convinced. All of that has to be straightened out and, I believe, can be -- but not as long as people find it too hard to accept that (<a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> as written, and the consensus claimed for it, have been rejected. I understand their frustration and resistance, but we can't move very far forward until it is understood that the task is once again developing a policy rather than protecting one. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 11:19, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would people please stop trying to screw up the questions? It begs the question to ask "should ATT replace x, y or z," because it didn't really "replace" anything; it's just another way of writing NOR and V, and so yes there's a sense in which it replaced them, but to use that word suggests it's a different thing. And the question "which of the following should it comprise," apart from being poor English, misses the point about it being V and NOR, and replacing RS, which is too complex to explain in one question.</p>
<p>Can we please keep it simple? Question 1: do you agree with the merge in principle? Question 2: if you agree with the merge, which of the following pages would you like to see kept as <b>inactive</b> for historical purposes? V, NOR, RS. Question 3: if you agree with the merge, which of the following would you like to see kept as <b>active</b> as explanatory additions to <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>?</p>
<p>That's all you need. If the answer to Question 1 is mostly No, the main polices are V and NOR again, and we simply take the policy tag off ATT.

<dd>Question 1 is ill-formed, and unacceptably vague. It will, judging from the community discussion, not even register the support for <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, since it will be opposed from several different positions; some of them will take it as endorsement of the <i>process</i> that got us here. I don't really mind that process; others do. If it's still around when I return to this, I will attempt to refine it. I regret reversion to it, as uncollegial. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 03:07, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. By restoring this question, SlimVirgin, you just unilaterally bypassed a great deal of discussion in which you didn't participate (and evidently haven't read). As noted above, it's redundant and polarizing.</dd>
<dd>2. Please explain how "Which pages, if any, should <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> comprise?" is poor English. The only poor English that I see is your continual use of the word "merge" as a noun. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 03:25, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, why did you revert to older wording for the last question (without acknowledgment or explanation)? —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 03:29, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>And further I note the the "new" version doesn't even provide some options that used to be available. It reduces the possibilities to "no merge, death of ATT" (I think), "merge and death of the others", and "merge and keep but relegate to FAQs the others". That eliminated at least the "merge and keep the others as primary, relegate ATT to something like a FAQ" (maybe others; I haven't been tracking every edit). I think this would be a really radical change to the direction the poll's been going for a few days now. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 03:43, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The "in principle" question is quite clear, and the rest of the changes were what was making the poll too complex.

<dd>Concur stronglly with David Levy. I think the simplest thing to do is revert to back to before Slimvirgin belatedly wandered in - not because I think every single edit made since then is bad, but just to get back to what consensus <i>was</i> before the fight broke out, and then start from there again. I've seen this done several times with articles, and it has generally been pretty productive (though a few edits unrelated to the disputed stuff can get lost for a while in the shuffle). — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 06:15, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No one is saying that. We're saying that the question is redundant (because the last question asks exactly the same thing) and polarizing (because it forces everyone to adopt one of the two extreme positions instead of considering compromise). —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 07:01, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Because we did a merge which was very popular, and we asked for feedback and we got feedback, and it was uniformly positive, overwhelmingly so in fact. I got more e-mails about that than about any other single issue since I arrived at Wikipedia. Therefore, we need to know "did we get that wrong?" We want people to answer that one question: do you agree with the merge <b>in principle</b>? People do know what that phrase means. You are trying to stop it because you don't want there to be a resounding yes, because <b>you</b> oppose the merge. And it's getting very tiresome that you're trying to stop people from answering one very simple question. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:17, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Okay, I'll bite: Why does Jimbo now consider 1. that the merger is "not the right way to make policy", and is a "radical change", and that "many editors did not know about ATT", after he has been supporting <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> "in principle" for months? 2. that in order to survive ATT needs first, broader and more vigorous discussion, and second, a wider consensus? <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 12:48, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>2. I don't oppose the merger. I support a compromise, and I'm actually worried that others who wish to compromise will be compelled to vote "no."</dd>
<dd>3.

<dd>No, we <i>don't</i> need a simple yes or no. "Yes" means "Wikipedia:Attribution should supersede the merged pages." No means "Wikipedia:Attribution should be retired." In addition to these possible outcomes, two compromises have been proposed. <b>The last question asks exactly the same thing and allows respondents to select any of these four options.</b> The current question 1 needlessly complicates the poll and discourages compromise. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 07:01, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You described my English as "poor," and I merely want an explanation of how this is so. In what way is the sentence linguistically incorrect? For example, your sentence "I can't explain why, it just is." includes a comma in place of a semicolon. As another example, you wrote "we did a merge which was very popular." Correct English would have been "we did a <b>merger that</b> was very popular." ("Merge" is a verb, and this is a restrictive relative clause.) I take grammar very seriously, so the claim that I've erred (when I see nothing wrong) is troublesome. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 08:04, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it would be better in general to confine discussions of grammar to problems with the wording on an article or project page, and not to contributions of editors on talk pages. However, it's worth pointing out that "which" is perfectly correct as a restrictive relative pronoun in British English. I'm not so familiar with American English. <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._W._Fowler_264e.html" title="H. W. Fowler">Fowler</a> wrote that "it would be idle to pretend that" keeping "which" for non-restrictive rel. clauses and "that" for non-restrictive rel. clauses was "the practice either of most or of the best writers." And, as I mentioned above, "merger" is listed in the OED as a noun, although it's certainly more common as a verb. In any case, saying that a particular wording is "poor English" doesn't necessarily mean there's a grammatical error. It could be a question of style. Is it elegant? Squabbles like this one are making the whole page unreadable. It's almost impossible to get involved in the discussion now. I wouldn't even know where to begin. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElinorD_4da6.html" title="User:ElinorD">ElinorD</a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EElinorD_6fce.html" title="User talk:ElinorD">(talk)</a> 10:45, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I feel compelled to ask 3 short questions (they are <i>rhetorical and for your consideration, not solicitious of a reply</i> here, though my talk page is always open): 1) How much time did you spend researching that to dig up quotes and citations instead of figuring out which topics on this page were informative or interesting for you? 2) Why did you just post two replies, one lengthy, to a long-dead (at least one day) mini-dispute, between two other parties, that you already think is distracting, with the seeming intent of re-opening it for further off-topic discussion? 3) Doesn't it seem ironic to you to to complain of grammar argumentation, only to largely defend the original grammar critic, by engaging in a rambling grammar lecture? I really don't see the rationale. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 11:20, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You (ElinorD) have missed my point entirely. SlimVirgin referred to my writing as "poor English," and I'm asking her to explain why. I'm mindful of the fact that many differences exist among the various English varieties. Just last night, I <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Attribution/Poll&amp;diff=117858896" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Attribution/Poll&amp;diff=117858896" rel="nofollow">informed someone</a></span> (on this very page) that "judgements" is a correct spelling.</dd>
<dd>As this is an international website, it's a good idea to use English words and phrases that appeal to as broad an audience as possible. (It often is feasible to replace Americanisms and Britishisms with mutually accepted alternatives.) I cited some specific examples of why SlimVirgin's grammar would be perceived as poor to a speaker of American English. Her elaboration on the claim that <i>my</i> English is poor was "I can't explain why, it just is." (Note the use of a comma in lieu of a semicolon.) —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 16:12, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(outdent) I for one will certainly be put in a vote-<b>No</b> position if the compromise options are eliminated or skewed against. SV, please consider that any number of parties initially opposed to ATT based on the same kinds of concerns Jimbo has expressed might be transitioning to a compromise position. If they don't have faith that their position is being represented properly, or that people are being led away from it by the poll itself, they will almost all simply revert back to "no merge". I know you don't like the compromise positions as much but either would be leverage to do what you actually want to after more consensus later. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 08:22, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Above, someone writes about the first Q, "Again, I don't see it as merely repetitive. I see it as polarizing and counterproductive." As I seeit, the first question is <i>the</i> question in that one cannot know how to vote on any of the following questions unless one has first made a decision about this. I frankly am not sure what the word "polarizing" means in this context. Several months ago people worked on merging severalpolicies into ATT, and Jimbo has recently called this whole endeavor into question. There are - ultimately - only two positions possible: we do creat a new policy page that incorporates without changing existing policies, or we do not. Finding out whether people are evenly split on this, closely divided, or that there is an overwhelming majority one way or the other seems very practical. I certainly do not see how<i>asking the question</i> could <i>increase</i> any strife about the matter. I just donotsee howit can becounterproductive. On the contrary, we need to make a decision on this question before we can proceed to the rest.<a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 13:12, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, just see any number of David Levy's responses to SV on topic. I would add that the "polarizing" issue is potentially worse than even D.L. says: it not only shunts <i>everyone</i> into either an all-yes or all-no position right at the outset (which could easily skew their more detailed votes later, as in "well, I've already said 'no', so I'd better go for 'no' on everything to agree with myself"), when a large number, quite possibly a majority, will actually hold a compromise position. WP:ATT proponents will likely get a higher-than-realistic "yes" count from Q1, giving them a misleading statistic they can quote out-of-context. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 21:14, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, there are <i><b>not</b></i> only two positions possible; that's precisely the false message that question 1 sends. Two compromises have been proposed. Question 3 <b>asks exactly the same thing</b>, but it allows respondents to select any of the four options (and even to select more than one and rate them in order of preference). "The original pages become inactive. <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> serves as a unified policy on their subjects." <b>means exactly the same thing as "yes."</b> "<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> becomes inactive. (Parts of it that reflect consensus are integrated into the original pages.)" <b>means exactly the same thing as "no."</b> The <i>only</i> difference is that two compromise options (reflecting real positions that some users hold) are available.</dd>
<dd>Question 1 needlessly forces people to adopt an all-or-nothing position (thereby precluding compromise). It distorts the data (perhaps creating the <i>appearance</i> of agreement) by pushing everyone with moderate viewpoints into one of two extreme camps. There might be consensus for a middle-of-the-road compromise, and question 1 serves only to discourage such thinking and obfuscate potentially viable solutions.</dd>
<dd>People need to understand that this is <i>not</i> a majority vote. It's a non-binding poll created to gauge the community's opinions (whatever they may be) for the purpose of furthering discussion, <i>not</i> an attempt to lump everyone together in one of two groups for the sake of expedience. If 28% of people vote to deactivate WP:ATT and the remaining 72% are divided evenly between the other three options (24% each), that doesn't mean that the deactivation option "wins" and WP:ATT is rejected. It means that most of the community supports its existence in some form (and we continue discussing the best way to implement it). Question 1's inclusion will result in the collection of <i>less</i> useful data, not more. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 17:07, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The present wording of Question 1 is hopelessly vague; this point has been made in <a href="#Wording_of_the_first_question" title="">#Wording of the first question</a>, and elsewhere. It is fairly common to view one's own writing with "Of course it's clear; I know exactly what I mean"; but this is one of the things the Wiki process exists to correct.
<ul>
<li>If this wording has been defended, by anyone, with more than <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>, I do not see the post; a diff would be welcome.</li>

</li>
<li>I deprecate any discussion of the process before Jimbo reverted the redirects. I think more highly of it than Jimbo appears to; but any question which can be read as endorsing or deprecating that process should be avoided. It is enough to note that it provoked several respectable complaints, and could stand improvement next time. (Does any one disagree?)</li>
<li>Some editors may be too busy to read the discussion here; but it is undesirable for such editors to begin with a massive reversion, with massive collateral damage. Reinsertion of Question 1 (no matter which form) would have been far less disruptive.</li>
<li>I deplore the personal attacks on David Levy in this section.

<dd>POV thoughts here, you asked to put a link to <i>"rationale for the new policy page"</i> but you called it <i>"Summary of the objectives of the merger: User:SlimVirgin/Attribution"</i> and then neglected to mention in the objections <i>"Jimbo said "Quite the opposite of "so much for consensus". This radical change was made without any consensus at all. If people really want this, then they need to make a serious effort to get consensus, not just declare victory and make the changes. --Jimbo Wales 16:00, 20 March 2007 (UTC)" so as I see it you still have to get consensus for the move"</i> and you started with a clearly POV statement "Wikipedia needs one policy page that explains the need to use sources, with one key concept that editors will easily understand — that of attribution." assuming that POV of those in favor of the move is correct. I realize I am mixing both the rationale for the move and the need for a reattempt for consensus or here.

<dd>I think it is fine to link to the document at her user-space, assuming proponents of the merger will endorse the summary. I will add this to the instructions, with a place-holder for the people who object to put one user-space summary too. I would encourage Coppertwig to be the one who does this. If you guys can't agree, then you could fork it, but it would really be good, if you could create one summary document. The benefit of keeping the summary in user space is precisely that it can't be deliberately weakened by someone else. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 09:00, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Works for me, but would suggest that (should Coppertwig accept the responsibility) he/she also directly invite other editors with oppose rationales expressed around here to edit it; I do not believe that Coppertwig's counter-issues are the full gamut of the counter-issues.

There could be additional ones anyway, since there are more than the two bare "yes!" and "no!" positions, such as two basic compromise positions as well (see <a href="#Keep_it_simple" title="">#Keep it simple</a> for discussion of how they will be represented in the poll), and differences of opinion on whether to include <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> in the merge, and so on. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 09:22, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let us have a little organizational strategy meeting here. Our opportunity is to construct a very clear and concise page that summarizes why the current <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">Attribution policy page</a> is a really bad idea. First, our authority structure matters greatly. That is, we would not be here doing this very important work if our Great Man did not tell us that we had to do this work. I certainly would not be here doing this work because I saw no opportunity for having any positive effect; I would be observing the Wikipedia that I care much about go down the very wrong policy path with the current <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution&amp;oldid=117436694" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution&amp;oldid=117436694" rel="nofollow">Attribution policy page</a>. So, for this segment of the work, we need a neutral admin as our authority structure to host our page on which we summarize the fundamental flaws of the current <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution&amp;oldid=117436694" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution&amp;oldid=117436694" rel="nofollow">Attribution policy page</a>, where the fatal flaws seem to be 1) incoherent statement of Wikipedia policy and a 2) huge change from the previous policies of Verifiability to a ReliableSource with NoOriginalResearch. You may have other ideas of what the fatal flaws are in the current <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution&amp;oldid=117436694" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution&amp;oldid=117436694" rel="nofollow">Attribution policy page</a>. The point of such a summary page would be to get <i>your</i> ideas stated clearly, but it might be best to narrow the items to three or four key and clear points. Is there a neutral admin who would volunteer to merely host and administer in UserSpace a page on which we could construct several clear statements of the fatal flaws in the current <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution&amp;oldid=117436694" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution&amp;oldid=117436694" rel="nofollow">Attribution policy page</a>. Any admin that is on the line about the so-called "merger" would be ideal, in my opinion. But maybe someone has a better idea.

<dd>Wow, I'm honoured by Merzul's nomination and by Rednblu's kind words in another section. Other users may wish to nominate other possible moderators at this point. I'm willing to act as moderator if that is desired and if I'm satisfied with the arrangements. I would try to set aside my personal bias to help produce a document that sets out the anti-merge positions in a balanced and concise way. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 22:22, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually the idea of a moderator is strange. To moderate what? SlimVirgin did not ask any moderation to write her summary of the ATT rationale.

<dd>I think he means the term rather informally. SlimVirgin generally appears to represent the largely unified pro-merge position; I don't see anyone who is for the merge saying they don't think their view is represented. The anti- or why-merge positions are several, and distinct, so more than one person is likely to want input in it. If the people actually writing the document want someone to informally moderate them, that is their business. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 20:32, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm genuinely interested in a summary of your case, but instead of more discussion here, I would really like to see one succinct and coherent document, like the one produced by SlimVirgin.

<dd>I'm not moderating or mediating between pro-merge and anti-merge sides of the debate. Rather, I expect to create a user page within a few hours (perhaps with title "User:Coppertwig/Stability" -- open to suggestions) and invite certain other users (i.e. those against the merge or against the way it's being done in one way or another, even those whose views I disagree with) to edit the page, under certain restrictions such as 3RR. I have a right to create a user page and to allow others to edit it. I expect it will be quite suitable for linking from the Poll page under "Other statements". I will probably reserve the right to place restrictions on users editing the page, at my discretion. I may create other user pages as well, and there may be links from the main user page to those as well as perhaps to other user pages others may create. I'm open to suggestions about these details from users who are against the merge in one way or another. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 21:00, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks. I appreciate your attempt to get clear titles. And thanks for getting us to think about the final page name early. I speak only for myself. I have absolutely no opposition to attribution. I don't think anybody here has <i>any</i> opposition to attribution. So it would be wrong to label this "Statements from all sides" page as any form of attribution opposition. "Stability of policy" is a working and accurate name because, in contrast, the current <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">Attribution policy page</a> is a humongous inversion of the prior Verifiability, Reliable source, and No original research policies. Perhaps, you can help us think of a better name for the "Stability of policy" page. Let's think about it. There is plenty of time. This whole process with take months. Meanwhile, we will work on the content of that page. I have been plowing through the four months of vociferous arguments against this so-called "merger," and it will take all of us a while to get three or four clear and obvious statements. --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> 00:06, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sounds good. You are correct in deducing that my goal here is to ensure equal representation.

<p>(&lt;&lt;&lt;outdent) On reviewing various policies and guidelines I have the impression that essays are written by a single user or by all users, not by limited groups of users. For this and other reasons I've decided the user page will be edited by myself only; but input is welcome from all users on the talk page of the user page. When it's finished I plan to move it to policy space, as was done with SlimVirgin's essay.

<dd>Agreed. I believe that Jimbo used or was quoted as using the word, but it doesn't mean it is a <i>designation</i> like "Policy", "Guideline", "Essay", "Rejected" or "Historical". The wording already installed on all these pages makes it clear that ATT (for now) has canonicity per the Jimbo compromise, so the word itself needn't be bandied about. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 00:11, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In my view, main question here is Question 3, and we should give it its due weight by placing it first. However, I don't understand this formulation from it: "Wikipedia:Attribution becomes inactive. <i>(Elements that reflect consensus are integrated into the original pages.)</i>" There shouldn't be anything in ATT which isn't already in the original pages.

<p>Looking at Jimbo Wales's comments on <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_bbd5.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution">Wikipedia_talk:Attribution</a> I can't find where he commended "very good work done by people laboring on ATT". Also, why there is no mention of his opinion that "Verifiability and No Original Research are conceptually distinct", "very different concepts" and that "radical reductionists who see them as really being the same thing are, in my view, badly mistaken"? I think that it is important to present his views correctly and in full form, especially because there is an option in the poll to make the original pages inactive. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 16:38, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I very much support a straw poll. In the meantime, after an excellent discussion with SlimVirgin, we hammered out a compromise until we can have a fuller discussion. What the pages say now is that WP:ATT is canonical, and WP:V and WP:NOR exist as separate pages to more fully describe those. My big beef with this merger is that we often need to send people to a page like WP:NOR which explains in a rich and persuasive way what the policy is about and why it is a good idea. This involves sometimes saying things which overlap with parts of WP:V. (They are not the same idea!) The combined page provides a handy way to keep policy consistent and have a tight presentation of what policy actually is. The separate pages can be more detailed and understandable.--Jimbo Wales 21:35, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would argue that WP:ATT is more maintainable, but at the price of being a significantly <b>worse</b> nomenclature. While policies like WP:V and WP:NOR are interrelated (as all of reality is interrelated), they are significantly different ideas and radical reductionists who see them as really being the same thing are, in my view, badly mistaken. When I say that something is original research, and when I say that something is unverifiable, I mean different things by those statements, as I am focusing on a different kind of deviation from good editing. WP:V and WP:NOR serve a valuable function in focusing on different sorts of things which come up. Reducing all policy to one thing is just not going to be helpful, since not everything is the same thing.--Jimbo Wales 05:41, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not polarizing anything. I believe you are misusing that word. I am pointing out that the personal interpretation you keep bringing up again and again and again, in overflowing detail, and which you are trying hard to infuse the poll and the entire debate with, is simply one interpretation, the one most favorable to you and to ATT. Also, the fact that some (not all, BTW) of what I quoted predated later messages by Jimbo is immaterial, as he did not retract or contradict any of it, he simply changed his decision about what to do for the time being and moderated his tone a little.</dd>

I don't feel a need to belabor the points any further. The fact that you characterized me as "polarizing" is especially ironic to me, given that my principal issues (see <a href="#Keep_it_simple" title="">#Keep it simple</a>) with the Jossi/Slimvirgin/Jayjg direction of the poll wording and layout is precisely that it is polarizing.&#160;:-) But I'm not particularly offended, really. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 22:50, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Agreed. I'm sure we'll both have lots to say about each other's behavior if we still feel strongly about it at that point, which hopefully actually won't be the case. I think this will require as much effort on your part as mine (cf. accusatory terms like "disruption" and "polarizing" directed <a href="../../../a/p/r/WP%7EAPR_8814.html" title="WP:APR">at me personally</a> rather than criticism of my edits or positions on their own merits or perceived lack thereof). For my part, I will attempt to engage you in refutory debate a lot less, if you think that would help. I'm not sure what if anything else with regard to you specfically that you want. My 4-days-running issues with templates and protections are drawing to a close, and my focus is now on the poll and the community discussion, which is I believe what you want. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 22:50, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The wording on the third question is horrible. The way it is phrased, the first two choices are YES options and the last two are NO options. It, however, is theoretically possible to vote Yes on 1 and some of 2 and then support an option that contradicts your voting pattern (and there will probably be at least one troll that will do so). One might be able to phrase them into two options, which then makes the choice dependent on the consensus of the previous two.</p>
<p>The sub-description of Question 3 also makes no sense ("You can vote for any of these options or mark them as your first choice, second choice, etc."). If you support the first two you cannot support the last two at all and vice versa (thus the "etc." in the ranking makes no sense). If it was narrowed down to two options, then it would be a clear yes/no issue.</p>
<p>Another problem that arises is if the answer to question 1 is YES, but 2 gives no majoraties at all due to no consensus on <i>what</i> to merge. Then the vote would be to merge, but nothing would actually be merged, conflicting the first decision. Similarly, if a consensus is achieved on 1 and 2 and it is close, it is theoretically possible for those people to be split on the first two choices in question 3 and for the people against to be united on one choice. In that case, one poll would lead to the first two poll decisions would be overridden.</p>
<p>Either each question needs to go one at a time, which would take a while, or it needs to be reworded. Otherwise, the decision would have to pass all of the 3 questions (eliminating the need for Question 1) in order to actually be passed, meaning that if the consensus in the poll wasn't achieved in ONE place, the whole thing fails. — <b><a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPious7_ac66.html" title="User:Pious7"><font color="blue">Pious7</font></a></b><sub><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPious7_77f7.html" title="User talk:Pious7"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sub><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pious7_ebff.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pious7"><font color="purple">Contribs</font></a></sup> 17:38, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1. Yes, people could provide conflicting responses to questions 1 and 3, which is another good reason to eliminate the 100% redundant question 1.</dd>
<dd>2. On the contrary, the instructions for question 3 make perfect sense. I happen to support the second and third options (which are <i>not</i>, as claimed above, diametrically opposed). This is <i><b>not</b></i> "a clear yes/no issue," and there is no logic in pretending that it is one.</dd>
<dd>3. You're over-thinking this poll's ramifications. Again, it is <i><b>not</b></i> a majority vote. It will have no binding outcome. You're correct, however, that question 1 will provide no data on what to merge (or, for that matter, what function the new page should serve) and that it's entirely needless. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 18:15, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I don't like those words because I find them vague and ambiguous. SlimVirgin says the meaning is clear. SlimVirgin, the meaning is not clear to me, so please tell me what the meaning is. I think people may vote "yes" meaning "yes, I want to merge the pages but not with the particular wording currently in WP:ATT", and their vote may later be misinterpreted as support for "yes, the current version of WP:ATT or minor modifications to it should be accepted as policy." Which meaning is the correct one? I do not see broad support on this page for use of the words "in principle". Are there other words with the same meaning that are more clear (to those of us who find "in principle" unclear) that can be used instead?</p>

Please give examples of how question 1 would affect the actual outcome (i.e. what would happen) or explain why you want to include a question that doesn't affect the outcome, before re-inserting "in principle" if I or anyone deletes it again. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 13:48, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The essay on meta is highly relevant. The words "You do not have to support the merger in its entirety to vote yes" seek to get the appearance of total support from anyone who even partially agrees. People who partially agree should pick an option about partially agreeing, not vote as if they agree completely. Why do you object to additional options like "mostly agree", "partially agree", and "mostly disagree"?

<dd>Jimbo <i>has asked us for a poll.</i> I realize how fond people are of quoting from, or just saying the words "polling is evil," but it's something of a moot point right now.</dd>
<dd>This whole thing has become so damn repetitive, I hesitate to post another long explanation, but here goes. Polling research questions can be broadly divided into three groups: open ends, scales, and either/or. (These can be further divided: on some open ends, the interviewer will literally try to transpose everything said to paper or screen, while on others they'll have a non-read list that they try to slot things into). Either/or includes Yes/No and Agree/Disagree questions, of course. The arguments presented here that either/or questions are somehow wrong, "polarizing", unusual, or out-of-keeping with polling practice are <i><b>plainly wrong.</b></i> Polls routinely do this: "Please indicate whether you agree or disagree with the following statements..." It gives you clear data and you proceed from there to work out the nuances.</dd>
<dd>What happens on Wiki polls is that poorly designed scales are used, which become open ends post-hoc. Four or five choices are offered; these get refactored into eight or ten choices; people stomp around yelling "polling is evil"; people post first, second, third, and mu, choices etc. And nothing is achieved. There is a chance this will happen to question 2, and an even better chance that this will happen to question 3. If the basic question 1 is not asked we'll all have wasted our time. If you don't like the instruction wording, suggest an alternate. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 15:46, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that the proposed "scale" of responses to question 1 is highly impractical, but the fact remains that question 1 will <i>not</i> supply any useful data. If a respondent answers "yes," it will tell us nothing about the extent to which he/she approves of the merger (covered by question 2). If a respondent answers "no," it's possible that he/she might support a compromise (covered by question 3). Question 1 covers absolutely no ground not covered by the other questions. It will accomplish nothing other than cluttering the page, discouraging compromise, and generating misleading statistics.</dd>
<dd>Your concern that people might dilute the poll by throwing in a bunch of additional choices (including "polling is evil") is valid, but that's just as likely to occur with question 1 (as we've witnessed). —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 16:12, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Great post, Marskell. I think you've captured the issue perfectly. Let's have a clear, actionable poll here, not some nonsensical poll with 1,000 options that every types "1st choice", "2nd choice", "13th choice", after which no-one can possibly know what was decided or agreed on, or where consensus lies. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 16:30, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see any rational explanation. The merger was a merger; there is no "compromise" position, either you favor some sort of merger or you don't. The decision is precisely binary. And question 1 is the primary question; if the answer to that is no, all subsequent questions are redundant, so we should get the most important question (and the one which was of concern to Jimbo) answered first. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 17:29, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How can you claim that there is "no compromise position"? Two potential compromises are listed in the poll.</dd>
<dd>Is your point that both compromises would still be considered a "merger"? If so, I see where you're coming from, but that doesn't fit everyone's interpretation. To me (and several other posters), a "merger" implies that the original pages are superseded, so the question asks whether we should carry out that plan. If someone advocates a moderate outcome, he/she might vote "no" (because he/she <i>doesn't</i> "support the merger in principle"), thereby voting down <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> in its entirety before any sort of compromise can even be discussed.</dd>

<p>(outdent) I think that the 'in principle' question is crucial, and is arguably the only really important question in this poll, as it most closely reflects Jimbo's goal in having the poll.

<dd>Puppy concurs, per Crum375 - 'in principle' is quite clear, as SlimVirgin states - I don't want to be rude, but I find the concern that it might be misunderstood or not understood to be tenuous at best. Perhaps if someone doesn't understand that concept perhaps their English is insufficient for editing the EN Wikipedia? One may certainly agree in principle, with minor reservations or concerns, and this is precisely what we are attempting to determine with this poll. I fail to see how removing the only unilaterally relevant question is remotely helpful in moving forward. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 17:18, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd say "in principle" seems useful...without it, there's no way to interpret a "no". Without it, a "yes I like the merge, but I think it needs an extra comma" and "I hate everything about the merge" are both "no". The point is whether people think a merge is useful or not. "In principle" achieves this. Without it, we might as well just vote up or down on the current language. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 17:21, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

That is about 2/3 agreement, which should not be described as a "yes", or a "no", but rather a "mostly". What about middle positions supporting certain pages being merged, but all pages being kept active, with certain pages being definitive/canonical. These middle positions do not fall under "yes" or "no", as merging often implies replacing as well. — <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armed Blowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>) 17:30, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is dealt with in subsequent questions. If one does not agree with any sort of merger, which was Jimbo's primary concern, then we need to get that sorted out right away. If one does agree with some sort of merger, then the details can be worked out.

<dd>I don't think I understand how more options will prevent you from doing that. People who completely disagree would still be able to vote "no".

<dd>As it's already been explained <i>many times</i> a) what can go wrong with scales and how badly Wiki does them; b) why there is nothing extreme about a yes/no question ("Do you believe ATT should stay as is or be deleted?" is extreme—asking whether you agree with it in principle <i>is just the opposite</i>); c) how Q1 <i>asks what Jimbo has requested we ask</i>; d) how the existence of Q2 and Q3 to unpack various options answers the concerns...I see little point in continuing to debate this with Armedblowfish. Sorry Armedblowfish, but I think you're "accidentally trolling"—disagreeing for the sake of it and not hearing the half-dozen people who have already answered your concerns. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 18:03, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree fully with Jay. We should <i>only</i> be asking question 1 in this poll. Once we've ascertained whether there is in principle support for the merge, then we can bicker over what form it should take. The other questions are going to be moot if there is no support for a merge anyway. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 03:02, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Say a straw poll opens, and UserX decides he wants to vote for an option not listed, so he adds it and votes for it. Is it allowable to move or remove UserX's opinion?</p>
<p>The only relevant guidance I can find on this is in <a href="../../../s/t/r/Wikipedia%7EStraw_polls_a7e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Straw polls">Wikipedia:Straw polls</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_ff02.html" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks">Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7ERefactoring_talk_pages_ad80.html" title="Wikipedia:Refactoring talk pages">Wikipedia:Refactoring talk pages</a>, and of course <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Polling_is_evil" class="extiw" title="m:Polling_is_evil">m:Polling is evil</a>. (All essays.)</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/t/r/Wikipedia%7EStraw_polls_a7e2.html#Creating_a_survey" title="Wikipedia:Straw polls">Wikipedia:Straw polls#Creating_a_survey</a> says, "Once started, the questions and wording in the survey should not change. However, if someone feels that the existing survey is seriously flawed, this is typically an indication Step 2 was not completed properly." Step 2 is "Consensus <b>must</b> be reached about the nature of the survey before it starts. Allow about a week for this process." (By that standard, we might never have a straw poll....) A new option would not count as changing the question, but it would count as a new wording. So, apparently it would not be desirable for a new option to be added during the poll. Contrarily, <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Polling_is_evil#Polling_encourages_false_dichotomy" class="extiw" title="m:Polling_is_evil">m:Polling is evil#Polling_encourages_false_dichotomy</a> suggest adding additional choices, though it does not specify whether this should happen before or after the poll is open.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/e/m/Wikipedia%7ERemove_personal_attacks_ff02.html#When_to_refactor.3F" title="Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks">Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks#When_to_refactor.3F</a> says, "It might be better to not refactor if there is any kind of voting going on. Tampering with comments that are attached to votes may be perceived as in some way tampering with the vote itself. There is also the possibility that refactoring will make disreputable users think that it's ok to change someone’s comments and so abuse this policy. Of course bad edits by people abusing the policy may easily be reverted." At the top, it also says <i>"The remove personal attacks guideline (and the application thereof) is controversial. It has often been abused by malefactors, and may not have community consensus. <b>It should, at most, be interpreted strictly and used sparingly.</b>"</i> - <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_AI_83d5.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/AI">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/AI</a> (emphasis original).</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7ERefactoring_talk_pages_ad80.html" title="Wikipedia:Refactoring talk pages">Wikipedia:Refactoring talk pages</a> stresses that it is important to preserve the original intent when refactoring.</p>
<p>Sorry, I don't mean to wikilawyer. However, if new options cannot be removed once the poll is open and people have voted for them, I don't see the point of removing them now.</p>

<dd>I imagine the poll once launched will be watched like a hawk by... many, many people, as it will be linked with an announcement (I hope for the duration) in the Watchlist header. Any shenanigans will be undone probably in a race or personal attacks removed (NPA still applies to polls, I'd hope!!). Once it goes live it will have been a week plus so the vote shouldn't be changed with more options, and no one can say they "didn't know" since the watchlist header is pretty obvious to let everyone know. - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 01:12, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To avoid any confusion, I was assuming that UserX did not make any personal attacks, simply added a new option to express his opinion. (RPA just happened to mention a situation involving polls, and personal attacks are probably a more extreme situation than new options....) So are you saying that just personal attacks should be removed, or new options as well? — <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armed Blowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>) 01:30, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I noted that this isn't an article not because it excuses people from 3RR but because more than three partial reverts per day doesn't matter as much in Wikipedia space, especially when everybody is working in good faith towards the same goal.

<p>I've protected this page. The amount of edit warring going on by a lot of people who should know better is quite frankly ridiculous. This is a discussion the community needs to have, and I hope this can be worked out shortly.

<dd>Nonetheless it's a pity you left the page protected in its state <b>after</b> the balancing statement (see section above) had been removed. I asked for pro &amp; anti statements, as a confused latecomer to the debate, two days ago (section:statements needed from all sides, above) and the need for these seemed to be widely recognised - I had not seen any comments against having these until Jossi's interventions today. Given the current heated climate, I suggest you unprotect long enough to either remove the link to Slim Virgin's statement or to add one to Coppertwig's page, to avoid the appearance of partiality. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbod_859e.html" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> 03:06, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What is so special about "Coppertwig's page"? He can make his comments in the community discussion page as have done all others. The page you refer to is <i>not</i> SlimVirgin's page. It is an essay that anyone can read, and edit, in which the rationale for ATT is succinctly expressed. "Coppertwig's page" is his personal page in which he is stating his views, and in which he has imposed special rules about who can edit, and who cannot edit. There are not <i>two sides</i>: That is a disruptive, divisive and polarizing viewpoint that contravenes all what I know Wikipedia to be, and it is highly disruptive. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 03:28, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Question 1 is overly polarising. Some views people hold are more like "mostly yes", "partially" and "mostly no". Forcing people to vote for extreme conditions other than the ones they actually hold is misleading and will not help guage consensus.</li>
<li>Although the above can be fixed by adding more options, no one seems to like this compromise. People who vote for middle options may do so for different reasons. So, while no longer misleading, since people who hold different views will be grouped together, and this won't help gauge consensus either.</li>
<li>Questions 2 (with a "conditional yes" option added) and 3 together will allow people to describe the responses of "yes" and "no" to question 1, as well as many other more moderate choices. As far as I know, allowing people to accurately and precisely express their opinions is the only way to guage consensus.</li>

<dd>We already had this discussion elsewhere. In my opinion, question 1, asking (paraphrased) 'do you support the ATT merger <i>in principle'</i>, is the clearest and simplest way to find out the community's sentiments about the situation and to address Jimbo's request. Everything else is redundant and confusing, in my view. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 12:59, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Blueboar, Coppertwig, Jossi, Pious7, SMcCandlish, Vision Thing and WAS 4.250 have objected to question 1 in some manner. I'm not certain that this is a complete list (and added a couple of usernames from Armedblowfish's reply that I'd overlooked). Where's the consensus?</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, most of question 1's supporters have provided no indication that they've even read the arguments against it. On the surface, it <i>does</i> appear to be a logical and elegantly straightforward question to ask, so their attitude is understandable. My frustration comes from the fact that most of them are countering <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">arguments that aren't being raised</a> (such as the one about people being confused by question 1's wording and the one about people not realizing that "supporting the merger in principle" doesn't mean supporting the exact text that currently exists) or not addressing the arguments at all (and providing no indication that they're even familiar with them). I'm <i>still</i> waiting for someone to explain what pertinent information question 1 will solicit that question 3 will not solicit. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 14:57, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jossi agrees with Q1 at last check, and Coppertwig is a troll; as for WAS' edits today, I have no idea where they came from and found them unhelpful as they arrived without a peep. All I've seen, in the main, is Armedblowfish and SMc flooding this page with repetition (this exact thread, for instance) and your support of their position.</dd>
<dd>Your argument about redundancy has been addressed: a) that there is over-lap is not in-itself a bad thing—polls do it all the time; b) it is possible that a robust consensus for Q1 will appear as a marginal consensus on Q2; c) <b>Q1 most closely resembles the question Jimbo has asked to present</b>; d) there is a good chance that Q3 will be refactored to the point of being useless. Don't tell me you haven't heard these arguments, because they've been repeatedly posted. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 15:13, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Redundancy is okay, if it's not harmful, which I would argue that question 1 as currently worded is. As for b, if that majority is reached by forcing people to adopt extreme positions other than the ones the actually agree with and lumping together votes of people who don't actually agree with each other on the issues, I would not consider that a consensus. It would be bad if it appeared there was a consensus when there was not. As for Jimbo, he can comment in this thread himself if he wants to. As for Q3, you said you would start a new thread on that eventually, so I'll wait. — <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armed Blowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>) 15:29, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You keep quoting the word "extreme" out of context. No one is claiming that question 1 is extreme, nor is it being used as a derogatory term. We're referring to the two non-compromise options as "extreme," by which we mean "farthest from the center or middle" (<i>not</i> that they're unreasonable or bad).</dd>
<dd>I'm disheartened by your desire to "take this page live" despite a clear lack of consensus. I'm not revert-warring or pushing for <i>my</i> preferred version to go "live," so can't we attempt to arrive at some sort of mutually acceptable compromise? I've attempted to reword question 1 for fairness (without adding additional options), and I'd be more than happy to try again with your assistance. Can we please cooperate instead of fighting? —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 16:06, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. When did Jossi indicate a second position reversal? Jossi, is that true?</dd>
<dd>2. I can't divine everyone's motives, but referring to anyone as a "troll" is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">not helpful</a>, nor is ignoring other editors entirely (and claiming that only Armedblowfish and I object to the question).</dd>
<dd>3. I'm not arguing that the redundancy itself is bad. My point is that if question 1 were asking something not asked by one of the other questions, it might be useful enough to justify its flaws. But it <i>doesn't</i> ask anything not asked by question 3. It merely asks exactly the same question with fewer choices (thereby disallowing compromise).</dd>
<dd>4. Question 2 isn't the one to which question 1 is redundant. Question 3 is.</dd>
<dd>5. From what I've read, Jimbo requested that we gauge the community's opinions regarding the appropriateness of the merger and the fate of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. Where did he indicate that we should limit the community to two diametric choices?</dd>
<dd>6. Yes, I read your argument about question 3 being refactored to the point of being useless, and I pointed out that the same thing could just as easily happen to question 1 (and already has). —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 16:06, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I will respond to one, as representative. "Where did he indicate that we should limit the community to diametric choices?" They are not diametric—"keep as is or delete," are diametric—and your concern only makes sense <b>if Q2 and Q3 do not exist.</b> How many times do we need to go round this circle? I want to take this live not to freeze at my preferred—this is not my preferred: I think Q3 is badly constructed.

<dd>Can we please not quibble over terminology? My point is that "yes" means "<a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> replaces the older pages" and "no" means "the older pages remain active and <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> is retired." That's many editors' interpretation, at least. I (and others) want to remove the question, but I'm offering to work with you on revising its wording instead.

<p>Is it only me, or is all this snowballing out of all proportion? What is going on? Why the drama, the polarization, the intensity? Can we all for a moment think what is best for the project rather than what is best for one's opinion? What this discussion and poll was designed to be is to gauge opinion. It is not a vote. By looking at the community discussion page, one can see that there is little consensus for <i>anything</i>... The core policies of Wikipedia, that is, NOR, V, NPOV '<i>will not change</i>, and that is a given. All what is being discussed is if there is merit in having one page to represent these policies. What concerns me most is certain actions and comments that are diminishing or attempting to challenge our long-standing content policies, or to create divisiveness and polarizing the community. Let's not allow that from continuing to escalate. It is not good for the project, is disruptive and totally unwarranted. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 15:43, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I really want to Endorse this process, including this level of discussion and this evolving straw poll methodology, which I hope will continue and evolve further into better processes for the future. So perhaps I should more accurately put an <b>Endorse</b> line under each of the five options here. But I will enter my Endorse line here once for each of the 5 options. I put it here under this option because, in my opinion, this option accurately labels quite well many of the categories under which the editors can sort their comments without having to interject very many of their own Qn line headers. --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> 22:06, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In response to Armedblowfish's edit summary question about what the above Q/A was removed: Please see the edit summary.&#160;:-) Long version: Pmanderson/Septentrionalis refactored his original text to make the question from Jossi and the response to it moot (and in fact confusing if one didn't pay very close attention). I refactored the entire thing out as useless to later readers, and suggest that it still is. If you agree can you please unrevert, and remove this response in the process?

<p>A bit late, but this is a simple attempt to first get an answer to what at least I want to know: should we deprecate V and NOR in favour of a single policy. <s>It is perhaps a bit confusing that question 2 depends on the first answer,</s> but the results will be more clear, and I think it is important to distinguish objections to the merger and to the actual wording of ATT. Finally, since <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> isn't a crucial issue here, what should be done with it can perhaps be decided after we know what to do with V and NOR.</p>

<dd>And in case somebody wonders why I didn't post this incredibly brilliant suggestion earlier&#160;:), then rest assured I have followed the debate here quite carefully, and so this is mostly based on what has been said here, it's a standing on the shoulders of giants kind of thing &lt;-- that was a sucking up to get some more votes kind of thing.

<p>Do we need to prevent editors who support a merger from voting on what happens if there isn't one? They still have valid opinions. (And conversely, those who oppose a merger may still care <i>which</i> merger passes.) We could make Merzul's Q2, "If there is a merger..." and so on. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 00:52, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know, my brain doesn't work right now, so I trust your judgement. Please go ahead and make that change. Then there are three (in principle) independent questions, and its no longer hierarchical.

<dd>Adjusted. We can tweak the name; it only appears on the two links and the header on this page.

<p>Option 1 - yes/no/neutral</p>
<dl>
<dd>Most people don't vote neutral - it says "I don't care". Yes says "I endorse what was done". A certain proportion of people who support some of the goals of the merge, but not all, will vote "No". That will inflate the no votes, biasing the poll to reject the move.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Option 2 - Yes (supercession, non-supercession)/no/neutral</p>
<dl>
<dd>This just splits the yes votes. In addition, it makes people focus on supercession, which some people will see as radical. Again, it pushed people toward voting "No".</dd>

<p>Option 3 - Yes (supercession, non-supercession)/no (active/inactive)/neutral</p>
<dl>
<dd>This one shares the problems of the first two (making the choices too stark), but it also pushes "no" voters away from no, because it makes them think of shutting down the page.</dd>

<p>If words to the effect of "poll to change policy" come up, people are going to come here on edge. There will be a lot of information at the top of the page, and even more links. Most people are going to skim past them to the point where they get to vote. So, with very little knowledge, they will be faced with up/down questions. People are going to vote on their gut rather than their head.</p>
<p>If we want to guage opinion in a reasonable manner, we need to ask a series of questions that assume ignorance. That's the first thing. The options must be presented in a "friendly" manner, and we need to rely on the questions to educate <i>without</i> biasing things one way or another.</p>
<p>The page starts off with a very terse "familiarise yourself with the debate" (<i>Go and do your homework!</i>) The first one is fairly clear, but has far too many words. The only thing that jumps out at me is the quote on the right about "everything must be attributable". The main point is squeezed into a box. The text is too squeezed - my eye slips past it, I got back, it slips past it again. No good. And that's all I see on one screen (never assume anyone scrolls). So many of the people who are diligent enough to click through won't read the discussion. The "Jimbo's comments" (yeah, who is this Jimbo again?) Too many words, diffs, all I get out of it is the headline <b>This merger is a really bad idea</b>). Finally a pointer to a 329 kb debate. Mmmm..no.</p>
<p>So, with little explanation, BAM! Do you support <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>? How the heck do I know - I'm just here to do my civic duty by voting, I'm not here to spend a month sorting through a debate.</p>
<p>Q1 needs to spoonfeed far more. <i><b><a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a></b> proposes that the current <b><a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a></b> and <b><a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a></b> policy with the <b><a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a></b> guideline be <b>merged</b> into a single policy page.

<p><b>B</b> Support some form of a merger, but not the current proposal</p>

<p>Voting is evil as an option is meaningless since Jimbo asked for this, and since it's going to be the most public poll for policy since... what, someone said 3rr? It will stand... I don't know how much more leading the whole thing can be after that header basically lays it all out repeatedly. The purpose of the poll also isn't to endorse or not endorse ATT, or the merger, or anything. It's to gauge concensus on it. The problem with having a million options and even somewhat spoon-fed or leading options is that <i>someone</i> will have a problem with it. You want them in... so that the policy isn't biased against ATT. Someone wants a 7th, 8th, 9th option for whatever reason. This is the problem--everyone wanted a specific thing, and the debate has been going on for days with no forward action and only backward action. Having very simple, stripped down questions is the only fair way as the poll should not lead people in <i>any</i> way. All the pro/con stuff (in fact, mainly <i>pro</i>) is all up top in the header. Our job isn't to ensure that ATT goes as policy solo, goes in as policy with 4 pages total, goes away altogether, or anything. It's to give people the options, as Jimbo asked. My suggestion that everyone seemed to like was to give everyone the MOST COMMON LIKELY OPTIONs, based on what people here were saying, and a place to put in their own feedback at the bottom.</p>
<p>If the policy sinks or swims (I hope it swims fully myself) it does. If it ends up only 80-100 of us support it and ten times as many don't... well, c'est la vie. Thats the wiki way. I think we should go with the variants on the original compromise that everyone seemed relatively fine with, and not fork more and more and more each time <i>one person</i> disagrees however... loudly.

<dd>Re: "meaningless since Jimbo asked for this" — I don't quite buy that, because Jimbo isn't a god&#160;:-). He's important, and has some trumping authority, but it is OK for the community to disagree with him, and he knows this and often acknowledges this (I saw on the mailing list the other day a comment something like -paraphrase not quote! - <i>If the community every comes to a consensus to remove me from my position of authority, I hope they understand the consequences and really think it through</i>. I don't think we'll be offending him or making a mistake if we collectively tell him he's made a mistake on this point or that.

<dd>For the timebeing, let's move it back 24 hrs: live at 00:00 UTC on March 29. There is never going to be consensus in the sense of unanimity, and there will always be something unresolved. I think 3 is problematic, for instance, as it holds the second option equal to the others when no one is really talking about it; I actually think of all the questions, that should be the open end. But interminable arguing is not much fun. Given that there is consensus for something like question 1, perhaps someone could suggest other alternate wording in the thread below. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 18:54, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I seem to think we've established that Question #3 is quite fine, as no one is screaming about it or editing like mad on it and it's options now. Question #2 seems to be very stable, which leaves just question #1. The point of question #1 honestly DOES seem to be: <i>"Yay or nay overall?"</i> There is nothing wrong with asking that in an absolute sense like that, depending on the option that Question 2 <i>actually</i> represents. Question 1 may be all that some people feel the need to answer. Myself, I support the full merger. So, for me, I would simply say "Yay" on #1, and "Yay" on all three options under #2. Done, and done. Now: consider, what honestly is the point of the in-principle? I support the ATT idea, but I suspect that the in-principle is being included as a way out for the ATT developers... in case the poll for some reason shows the overwhelming majority <i>doesn't</i> care for merger, to perhaps come back around later with another idea. I think this is unneeded and couching the poll quietly in favor of the <i>idea</i> of ATT, if not the specific policy <i>itself</i>. Simply not right--and this is speaking <i>as</i> an ATT supporter!</p>

<p>Yes, I know that means having instructions in there. So <i>what?</i> That's a simple, straightforward, can't-be-confused or misintepreted question. If people support a more complex solution of a partial merger, that is what Question #2 is for. If they support none-of-the-above, well, they have ample oppurtunity to make that clear between #1 and #2 and #3. The status of pages desired at conclusion of the poll? Question 3.</p>
<p><i>"This a good idea? Or not entirely? OK, then look at #2. What about what to do with the policy pages after? Look at #3."</i> Simple, linear... in fact, I'd wager that this simple change... will make the poll completely NPOV while not endorsing ANY side of the debate in any way. It's a straight: What do YOU think? scenario then, favoring via the questions neither endorsing, nor the idea, nor much of anything beyond what people enter... as answers.</p>
<p>If everyone is confident in the strength of their policies, and policy arguments, <i>no one</i> should have any problem with the idea of this, I'd imagine... - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 18:19, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(edit conflict) But if someone supports a more complex solution, they shouldn't have to skip any questions entirely. Unless you want to group anything other than full support under "no", which would be the opposite problem as grouping anything other than full opposition under "yes". Or can we add more options along with this wording change? That question is more clear, at least. — <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armed Blowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>) 18:40, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am trying something similar, I think. Let's keep going. I am digging through the four months of arguments to get a "Statements from all sides" page. And the basic question seems to be something like the following: "Do you think there is a need to simplify into one page the policy on Verifiability to a Reliable source with No original research?" I do not have a concrete suggestion yet. --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> 18:42, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Don't need something that complex, Red. Replying to both: They skip nothing. I just edited my idea so that #1 is YAY, NAY, and PARTIAL, GOTO #2. Look up.

<dd>What attack? I see the apparent "compromise" as advocating four pages, which is insane (or horrible or stupid, or whatever you like). AB is describing "one or two policy pages"—I don't understand. The people arguing for one are arguing for a merge in its entirety. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 19:48, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I am discussing it in a civil manner. An attack is calling you stupid, not an opinion of yours stupid. I have friends who follow astrology, and I think astrology is the stupidest idea going. How about, "the idea is very very bad because it means I and 300+ other people have wasted a good portion of their editing time for the last six months in order to make wiki-life <i>harder,</i> rather than <i>easier.</i>" Is that an attack? No. So come on, now. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 19:58, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It looks as if we are nearing an acceptable compromise version... good work folks. I know it was not easy, and you have my thanks if no one else's.</p>
<p>Once we do have a final version, the next step is to determine when to open the poll and when to close it. Given that part of Jimbo's concern about ATT was that the merger might have taken place without proper notice and community involvement, I think it is <i>vital</i> that we now advertize this poll at every step. Just as we put all sorts of notices about the discussion page everywhere we could think of (including on the watch lists)... we should do the same with the poll. In fact, I think we should start with a notice that says: "The Poll will open on &lt;opening day&gt; at &lt;time&gt; and last for &lt;number&gt; days." Post this at least 24 hours ahead of time... then when the poll does open, again post notices to say "The poll is now OPEN for voting, and will close on &lt;closing day&gt; at &lt;time&gt;".</p>
<p>The one thing we definitely don't want is for Jimbo to come back to us saying lots of people complained that the poll opened and closed without their knowing about it. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 19:11, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Armed Blowfish, I think your mockup leaves out the most important part... The whole point of this poll is so that we (and more importantly Jimbo) can find out IF this merger has community support. That <i>has to be</i> a binary yes/no question (or at most, a tri-part yes/no/partial question). I understand that you think we need a range of options to cover all bases, but we <i>have to</i> ask that basic question or we don't address Jimbo's main concern. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 19:54, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Notwithstanding Rendblu's (edit conflict!) comment above (the "current" poll text has rarely lasted more than a few minutes...), I tend to agree with David Levy's earlier comment that waiting until April 2 would be wise. If this is "advertised" as much as I think it will be, it would be a top-10 April Fool's Day vandalism target. We've all (I think) agreed that it's really important to limit people's effective ability to rant and add comment-on-comment-on-comment on the poll to make it actually possible to parse it and determine the outcome. I think this rationale applies even more strongly to avoiding the utter bollocks monkeywrenching edits that would (I predict) absolutely certainly occur on 2007-04-01, some of them carefully crafted to not look like vandalism. (A secondary effect of course is that legitimate but poorly phrased votes could be deleted as apparent vandalism). A few extra days isn't going to kill anyone. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 21:05, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not a matter of "like"; I'm coming at it from a usability angle. A long time ago smilies (of the basic sort; there are literally hundreds of variants now, with their own nuances) could mean any number of things, but since the rise of IM, they generally equate to "JK!" or "LOL!". I think the <i>wording</i> can convey what you want to. The wording job you did on the merge template at <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> for example conveyed that very well (note that I kept it but removed the ASCII-smile in the proposed variant).

<dd>Well, Jimmy's concern was that unless people had the three relevant policy pages and the handful of places it was posted on their watchlist, they would have no idea this was coming. Even admins didn't know... so... the roll back by him and request for a poll. I had pitched the idea to do a Watchlist notice, which everyone liked, except for so far an extremely small but vocal minority. The thinking was that this way, <i>no</i> one can say they aren't informed. The poll <i>especially</i> when live will need to be advertised thus, so that regular editors can all contribute, and again, so... no one is left out. Or else next month or next year someone will say, "WTF? WHEN DID ATT HAPPEN?!" and so on. Having it 'in your face' for a week is a small price to pay for getting the job done right... - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 00:58, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On the poll page, could we put the questions, as well as the comments section, on different subpages? We could then subst those into the poll page.

<dd>Subsections works great. But how many people do you expect to have participating, over how many days, and how many sections do you have? Will there be any surges early on or late?

If someone feels that voting is evil, then they should not participate in this optional poll that has no power anyway. <a href="../../../y/a/a/User%7EYaanch_f0c4.html" title="User:Yaanch">Yaanch</a><sup><a href="../../../y/a/a/User_talk%7EYaanch_a9d9.html" title="User talk:Yaanch">Speak!</a></sup> 01:24, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Having taken a break from this page, I have a modest proposal: Three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Q1: Short Version (above)</li>
<li>Q2: Which of these <i>four</i> pages do you think should be combined
<ul>
<li>WP:ATT, WP:V, WP:NOR, WP:RS
<dl>
<dd>With a note: <i>If WP:ATT is included in the combination, the combined page will start out as WP:ATT. If it is not, the combination will have to be written</i></dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Q1:Verbose version, without the Yesses and Noes, which are in the first question.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unless this is immediately shot down, I will probably do a draft to see what it looks like, in which case I will add a version link. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 02:44, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Bingo! Yes. I see it. Good eye! New breakthrough! This poll structure acknowledges the actual relationship of the four independent slices of the policy problem. No wonder none of the prior poll structures worked for us unless we just gave up! Without acknowledging the actual four independent slices of the policy problem, we can <i>never</i> reach a working consensus. I was not even close to seeing this! Congratulations!

Q2 (above, not on the project page) is an effort to measure the strength of this; but I've taken it out for now.</li>
<li>If there were a merger to an as yet unwritten page, <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> can be merged into it or not. Whether <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> can be merged to <i>itself</i> or not is a purely verbal question, which I thought this draft avoided.

<dd>...but my point is this new draft is basically going to be the same end result as the above ones. It's not substantially new or different. All the above ones are basically... the archetypical questions. We've already gone over that we can't conceivably offer something for everyone as everyone has an agenda. And we can't keep adding an infinite number of alternate options to the straw poll of the straw poll or else we'll have a straw poll to determine if more options should be added to the pre-poll straw poll and so on.

<dd>Well, it looks like concensus is turning out different than I expected up on the poll-poll.

<p>Scenario: Two thirds vote for some sort of merge with one third wanting to merge Verifiability and No original research and one third wanting to merge Verifiability and Reliable sources so there is a majority for a merge but only Verifiability has a majority wanting <i>it</i> merged so ATT becomes just a copy of Verifiability.

<dd>Ditto. This is farcical. We can't decide policy by a poll. We should be asking only if people support the merge. If you get into issues of whether they want this or that to be merged, what if we end up with yes, they want NOR to be merged, but not the other two? We're begging for meaningless results with this question, because only one of us (so far as I know) has professional polling experience, and he has been driven up the wall by this conversation, unsurprisingly. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:39, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've been hawking the idea of the straw poll-poll to finally sort out the Q1 concensus for going on two days with quite a LOT of posts along the way on other topics, and not one person has bucked going with that to get some final resolution on the Q1 matter. As many people have seen/posted my idea to let it run out the 25 hours, then go to 4/1/07 if concensus wasn't still clear, I took it... as endorsement of the idea as no one is opposed to it. It seems the fairest way. If my preferred option (#3) isn't the one to go live, thats life, and I'll live happily with the concensus.

I put up over 24 hours ago that we should go with those given time frames... and the limit of five (endorsed by Jossi for the no-new-options) and no one opposed it. The five themselves pretty much cover every possible angle. Maybe we just declare that at this point, after all the other stuff, it's been narrowed down to this? That seems fair. It went from a zillion ideas to a 'lot', to five, to one, and live, with people to input all along the way.

<p>Marskell suggests, on my talk page, that we combine Option 1 with an open-ended question 3, presumably of some such form as "How should <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> be related to the pages merged into it?"

"Do not add additional options here," sounds like preventing people who hold different opinions from voting, unless you have an "other" section for votes. I don't think that's enforceable, once the poll is live and people have added votes to those additional options, which is why the "short version" and "medium version" would be unlikely to last long if they went live. — <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armed Blowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>) 21:26, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regarding disallowing additional, it was un-wiki of Jimbo to ask for this to begin with (we aren't a democracy right?); if we're going to give the man good answers, I think we should deliberately remove refactoring. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 21:28, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To AB specifically, there'd be an open option. You can type what you like there, and we should, organically, allow it be refactored. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 21:30, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To reply to AB, I'm thinking of the yes/no, which has clear (or at least the clearest) approval now as first, and a true open end as second. "Do you support ATT?" Followed by "What arrangement do you prefer?" The second would have no options at all. We'd be tight on avoiding refactoring (i.e., adding, changing, splitting, removing options) on the first, but be open to it on the second. If clear patterns emerge ("I see a lot of users favour an arrangement of this sort, so I'm going to make a headline to group them...") we'd let it happen. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 21:50, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you really want it to be yes/no, try "Do you support ATT <i>being policy</i>? That would split the line down the middle between the two middlish options. It would be grouping people with different opinions together, though, so I'm not sure how useful that would be statistically.</dd>
<dd>Also, there are advantages to a 1st/2nd/3rd/etc. choice system, such as allowing people some say as to what happens if their first choice is not chosen. This is part of the reason I still support Question 3 over the verbose version. You could make that pseudo-open-ended by adding an "other" option. However, a purely open-ended question would be acceptable, I guess. Why don't you add a mockup for it to the poll at the top of the page?</dd>

<p>Why are we having question 2? If this is just a poll about yes/no support to the merger, it shouldn't be included, and if this is also a poll about future look of policy pages, then we should also include question 3. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 22:11, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Question 2 has been argued over the least. I think it good. Q1 (not the current Q1, but the one supported at the top of the page) will provide the broad "do we keep going/do we stop" answer—Q2 will tell us which pages to keep going with. Or, to loop back to an old point, Q2's specifics will be important if we have broad consensus on the general Q1. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 22:21, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are assuming that broad consensus on Question 1 will be in support of the merger. However, if majority of answers are going to be <i>no</i>, then Question 2 will be useless. So practically, by allowing only Question 2, poll is showing a bias toward support of the merge. There should be also a question which deals with situation of majority <i>no</i> vote (i.e. should we keep WP:ATT as a summary or scrap it altogether). <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 22:31, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not assuming anything and don't want to speculate.

There is an answer "No, and the new page should become inactive." and "No, but the new page should remain active as an explanatory summary.".

<dd>The problem with a "yes"/"no" question is that there's no way to determine <i>how</i> respondents actually feel.

Would a "no" voter actually prefer a compromise (but doesn't want to lose the original project pages)? It's impossible to know, and it's downright dangerous to create a setup in which respondents aren't even <b>offered</b> the opportunity to compromise unless they respond a certain way to the first question. To view compromise as a "plan B" worth considering only if consensus for one of the extreme options isn't reached is to miss the point entirely.

<dd>I do not think you understood what I meant. You see, WP:ATT was designed under the principles that we need <i>less</i> policy pages, not <i>more</i>. It took two policies and one guideline and merged them into one easy-to-read page in which the different nuances of the original policies could be seen in the context of each other. A compromise option that will end up with the original policies <i>and</i> ATT is bad for the project as it will be <i>more</i> messy than before. I have been monitoring V, RS and NOR for almost a year now, and I can tell you that I do not look forward to have to monitor another page. So, if the community does not want ATT, that is fine with me. I am not going to propose an option that will take us to a a worst position than before ATT was put together.

<dd>Yes/No are wonderful devices. Do you support the war in Iraq? yes/no; do you support an independent Palestinian state? yes/no; Do you like chocolate cake? yes/no; do you prefer Mac OS X instead of Windows? yes/no. All these will produce results about these specifics, as the variations that you can have within each answer are as many as there are people. Just thing of how many variations you can have under the question about the Palestinian state: literally hundreds. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 23:04, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Do you support an independent Palestinian state?" is perhaps the <i>least</i> meaningful poll question I've ever heard of. Different responders will hear it as being "Do you support the (present position of the) Palestinian Authority." to "Do you support what Hamas promises?" to beyond. Depending on how they hear it, people of the same substantive position will disagree.

<dd>Exactly, that is what I meant. We were asked to design a poll to find out how the community feels about ATT <i>as currently designed</i>, not about <i>which</i> future form of ATT the community wants, as that is a future outcome and no one is going to stop an editor for improving ATT if it remains as a policy. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 23:16, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Right, and this is in keeping with what Jimbo said. He said he had no problem (or no issue) with the content of ATT. His interest is only whether the merge is supported. The exact contents of ATT will develop in the same way the contents of V and NOR would have developed, or any other policy. The question here is simply: do people want those policies to be expressed on one page or on three pages. For the life of me, I can't understand why some people are determined to complicate this. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:20, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I am skeptical that we will have consensus by 2 April, although it might be possible. I don't think we should have a strict closing time, as there may still be ongoing discussion and voting in seven days.

<p>Two concerns: 1) Do we not run the risk here of having some people say yes to NOR, no to V, no to RS (or whatever combination), so that we end up with a nonsensical result? 2) Do we not also run the risk of some people saying no to including RS, simply because they dislike RS and want it to disappear entirely (which is a common position)?

<dd>We may... In that case, whoever closes the poll will need to make a recommendation on how to proceed.

<dd>I think we should leave the questions as they are now, to gauge the community's sentiments, per Jimbo's request. If ATT is favored in principle, we should then decide on the proper disposition and/or incorporation of RS, regardless of whether it gets a lots of 'merge' votes or not. As it is, RS was already largely included in V, and hence in ATT, so it's really just a matter of amplification and examples. It would not make sense to leave RS as a separate independent guideline alongside ATT, since there will be constant overlaps and contradictions, exactly what ATT was intended to prevent. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:43, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The objections to having four active pages (<b>not</b> all policy), as I understand them, seem to involve the time involved in maintaining the additional pages.</p>
<p>So, how about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>If people bother to maintain the additional page(s), which may include consensus-building attempts to provide further guidance or updating the page(s) to reflect new consensus reached on the canonical page(s), they may remain active.</li>
<li>If there are no consensus building attempts on the additional pages or at least time spent updating them to reflect new consensus reached on the canonical page(s), they will become inactive, with the possibility to become active again if people decide to maintain them.</li>
</ul>
<p>To me, this seems to make more sense in the flexible wiki scheme of things anyways.</p>

<dd>I don't understand what this means. We don't want four policies pages and four talk pages about essentially the same things. Bad enough that we have three, but if the community votes for that, so be it. They can maintain them. But no one could conceivably want one additional page and talk page saying the same thing. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:04, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>2. As I noted previously, we wouldn't need to have four talk pages. <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_bbd5.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution">Wikipedia talk:Attribution</a> could serve as the talk page for all of the project pages (with the other talk pages becoming redirects). —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 01:12, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree it would be bad to have four talk pages. I was thinking more along the lines of substing the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WT%7EV_c6a9.html" title="WT:V">WT:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WT%7ENOR_8bfe.html" title="WT:NOR">WT:NOR</a> talk pages into <a href="../../../a/t/t/WT%7EATT_dab9.html" title="WT:ATT">WT:ATT</a>, since <a href="../../../a/t/t/WT%7EATT_dab9.html" title="WT:ATT">WT:ATT</a> was so high traffic.

However, I think <a href="../../../r/s/_/WT%7ERS_bc01.html" title="WT:RS">WT:RS</a> should be its own talk page, considering <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> issue as well as a <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> issue, in my opinion. — <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armed Blowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>) 01:18, 29 March 2007 (UTC), 01:19, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>People of various viewpoints have continually justified their positions by quoting Jimbo and interpreting his comments to mean that this poll should be conducted in a particular way.

<dd>I'm sorry, but I cannot see that we are doing this for "Jimbo." There have been a lot of very concerned Wikipedians for the last four months who keep saying very loudly (emphasis removed) in various ways that there is a huge mismatch between reality and how some groups of Wikipedia editors handle reality. And the only reason that "Jimbo" came down on our heads is that we were not listening to each other enough to do a good job of making whatever policy shifts that are involved in the move to <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. I use "Jimbo" instead of Jimbo because in any modern organization there has to be a big difference between "Jimbo" the role and Jimbo the person. It was "Jimbo" the role that came down on our heads -- because we were not doing a good enough job of listening to each other. And we are not doing this for "Jimbo." "Jimbo" had to tell us to listen more to each other because we were not listening to each other. Why on earth would you ask "Jimbo" for more direction? "Jimbo" cannot tell you better direction than he has already given us. --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> 02:14, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The message in its entirety:
<dl>
<dd><i>Hello again, Jimbo! I must bring to your attention an issue of great concern. Per your request, we've been attempting to assemble a straw poll through which the community can express its opinions regarding the Wikipedia:Attribution page and the merger behind it. Unfortunately, a great deal of disagreement has arisen as to what structure the poll should take. Believe it or not, a poll in underway to determine the setup of the poll:<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Attribution/Poll#Pre_straw_poll_straw_poll_for_Q1" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Attribution/Poll#Pre_straw_poll_straw_poll_for_Q1" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Attribution/Poll#Pre_straw_poll_straw_poll_for_Q1</a><br />
The main point of contention is whether or not to include any sort of compromise as an option. I personally favor such a compromise (in which the original pages would remain active to supplement the new one), but some proponents of Wikipedia:Attribution insist that this is an all-or-nothing proposition (we must either retire the old pages or reject the new one) and refuse to allow any options into the main poll question other than those two. They have argued that a compromise would be "insane" and "stupid," so we must suppress these options to prevent the community from making a big mistake (in other words, protect it from itself). Some have cited your name and claimed that a simple "yes or no" (no room for compromise) response is what you've requested.<br />
I believe that withholding the ability to compromise (thereby forcing everyone to adopt an extreme position) defies the spirit of consensus-building and cooperation on which Wikipedia is based.<br />
I hope that you'll weigh in on this issue, as it appears highly unlikely that we'll be able to reach any sort of resolution on our own. Thank you!</i></dd>

IAR goes both ways - so unless he says otherwise, since no one else is as bitterly opposing things as you... try not to antagonize. AGF on your part.

<dd>Slim, we're not deciding policy, on this talk page... we're just trying (honestly) to simply build the poll that Jimbo <i>asked</i> for. If people are opposed to Jimbo's request for the poll, why not take it up with him directly? Put it to his talk page. As for when/if the requested poll runs... isn't it the same as anything? If a huge number of people suddenly descended on some aspect of the Wikipedia site and decided something was a certain way, and they were established users (lets say, a poll saying "Such and such is now policy, or isn't")... well, why wouldn't it be? Because a couple of people opposed it? Or am I misunderstanding--are you and WAS opposed to this one stupid poll to figure out Q1, or the WHOLE thing that Jimbo asked for? And who decides core content policies if not the community? Only senior admins? I'm confused as to what exactly people ARE upset about... since you're all being needlessly vague. If people want to buck Jimbo, why not just do it? If you guys could give me verbose answers, it'd be helpful... I almost feel like some people are worried that suddenly giving a huge number of people a voice in one concentrated place is a <i>bad thing</i>. I don't see how it would be. - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 06:51, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Denny, content policies shouldn't be decided by poll because they're complex, and people need to have read and understood them, as well as read and understood the other policies they interact with. Hundreds of editors were involved in developing ATT over a period of five months. The only reason I was persuaded that it was time for the page to go live is that I saw lots of editors had already started linking to ATT to support their edits. It was a real vote of confidence, entirely spontaneous. If that's not consensus, then I don't know what is. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:59, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(&lt;---)Making policy by voting is not how wikipedia got to where it is. Doing stuff just cuz one of the co-founders said so is not how wikipedia got to where it is. Voting on the wording of voting is not how wikipedia got to where it is. This is a bad precendent and is a monster (look up the word) and it should be aborted.

<p>Back to the original point of this section: I concur that we need to ask whether the merged pages should remain as explanatory pages or not. This could be in the form of a third question, if people think asking only yes/no questions is advisable. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 08:45, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But my question remains: where are people talking about it? The word "supplement" occurs once on the Community discussion; "condensed summary" occurs twice; "explanatory" occurs twice. We have apx. five dozen people there arguing for the merge in general and at best half that arguing against. Where are the tens of editors arguing for a supplement? Why should we give equal weight to an option no one is seriously arguing for? Jimbo suggested it on the 21st, but (to paraphrase Chief Wiggum) "Jimbo says a lot of things." He also said he'd defer to editor's consensus and I don't even see consensus that the idea should be seriously entertained. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 09:17, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Right here <b>on this very page</b>, numerous editors have advocated such a setup. But if you believe that it has little support within the community, what are you worried about? If you're correct, it would be shot down in the poll proper.</dd>
<dd>After seeing proponents of a binary question argue that we must have one because this is what Jimbo wants, your "Jimbo says a lot of things" argument is amusing. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 16:24, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see that there is a poll about what questions should be in the poll. Regretfuly, this all-or-nothing <i>latter</i> does not currently give the option to support WP:ATT while still retaining WP:V, WP:RS, and WP:NOR. What a mess.

<p>I have come to this page for the first time although I have been following the merger discussion. Three points:</p>
<p>I think the [edit] link beside each question is a technical artefact and contributors are expected to click "Please voice your opinion" or the [edit] beside each answer. However, this does not come across clearly.</p>
<p>At present, on the poll page itself, although there are remarks about what good work was done and by so many people, there is no hint (or links to any hint) about why some people (even Jimbo) might have thought otherwise. Are not even pro-merger editors concerned that this may seem unbalanced and so cause dissent?</p>
<p>"Any claim to that effect is a misreading or miswriting of it" is unhappily worded and seems POV. I realise what is meant is "Any claim to that effect follows from either misreading <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> or from the new policy being wrongly written".

<dd>We have a week or two to work on ATT itself, and possibly a number of substantial issues will be solved by then.

<p>NOTE: I <i>like</i> ATT, and have been saying again and again I will be supporting it. That out of the way... I do not understant where/why/how people are saying or keep asking me... to not restrict a given requested option in the <i>idea</i> of the Q1 poll! I've been trying to NOT own the page, and have just been trying to help... centralize stuff since no one else was. Nearly everything someone has asked me to change I did, with the exception of adding more poll options myself since people seemed against that collectively. We've got basically all the options right there IN the straw poll between Options 1-5! If there is a lot of people asking for another given variant, go ahead and add it.</p>
<p>My constantly saying "Lets not add more options beyond the five everytime someone asks for it," was based on comments from others across this page and the archives who said (paraphrasing), "We can't craft a new set of questions for each <i>individual</i> persons' tastes," or else we'd have a dozen plus options or more. NOTE: I only drew up Q1, Q2, and Q3. Others did, and when lots of people supported them, I just dropped them right into the poll no questions asked. If there is support from more than one person, go ahead and add the extra question to the Q1 poll, add it in. But the next random guy to appear on the page, saying, "MY VERSION NEEDS TO BE UP THERE," with no support, shouldn't get in there per se, or else this stupid little sub process to just gain concensus on the wording of ONE question will be never done.</p>
<p>Jimbo asked for a poll... I haven't (I don't think) been advocating anything about policy here either way. I've been just trying to help get the poll itself done. If you guys honestly think that there is support to not do the poll, then send <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_Poll_410f.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution/Poll">Wikipedia:Attribution/Poll</a> to MfD. - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 13:21, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Late reply. I got sick of reading the fighting here that was going nowhere over Q1. I came up with the Top 3 questions. People then came up with Q4, and Q5, which seemed popular and supported. I added them to the straw poll. For 2+ days, NO ONE objected to that idea. Because it was WORKING to make concensus. I don't care if it's not the "Wikipedia way". IAR, lets make common sense precedent. Everyone (again, one screaming voice doesn't mean there is no concensus) seemed fine with it. No one shot it down. People started insisting or suggesting MORE options to the poll--ones that got derided politely by others, or just not cared for. We said, "Lets not add new <i>brilliant</i> ideas" as the Top 5 are basically every possible scenario that someone might want. If that means someone DOESN'T want ATT, or DOESN'T want to deprecate the old policies, so what? Will of the people decides how wikipedia runs, not 5-10 total adminstrators. Anyway, if you WANT to add another option to this straw poll, then post your idea in a new section of this page. Make a mock up like I did for those five. Format it like that. See if people care for it--if it's just you vs the world, why include it? If people are saying, Hey, this rocks, good idea, then go up and it to the ongoing poll that 98%+ of the people on this page (i.e., <i>concensus</i>) didn't object to or supported for 48+ hours as it was making the only progress in a week. - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 13:46, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

Also, if our convictions are that strong in the policies we support, and believe that they are best, why are we afraid of letting our peers fully getting a chance to voice their own on it?

I can <b>only</b> see opposition to the poll Jimbo asked for if someone thought that their peers collectively would shoot it down, and <i>didn't want to give that chance</i>.

<dd>Lets say the poll goes live on 4/2/07. Hypothetically. For 7 days it runs. It's on EVERYONES watchlist, and lets say a total of 1,000 people in 7 days weigh in. If 700 or 800 of 1000 users say, "I endorse the ATT merger," then any concern Jimbo has on the merger is mute and null and void. Anyone ever challenging ATT from that week forward has no leg to stand on. However, if 700 or 800 of 1000 users say, "No way, no merger, ATT bad," then ATT will (correctly in that case) end up getting tagged as rejected by the community. That is what I mean. The community decides this stuff together. Not any subsection of editors or admins, in the end. My concern is that some people are not wanting to give the communit a chance to do either. - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 14:11, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, thats fine, but this is what Jimbo asked for: a poll to see what people thought. If 800 or 1000 people say, though, that they want something, why would it have no value?

<dd>But 700/300 does not automagically mean consensus. Say, in your example above, 300 people say that they strongly oppose with reasoning behind them, and 700 people just write <b>Support</b>... consensus has not necessarily been acheived. We do not just look at things as a vote. Just because something has the support of 70% of opinions expressed, does not = consensus. They way you present it, the 300 opposing people are "of no value". If 300 people on this project ever objected to something, that should show you that there is not widespread support for that thing... <i>even if</i> another 700 said they approved. 70% at RfA (for example), where the opposing 30% might account for 10 people, is <i>vastly</i> different than 70% where <i>300</i> people oppose.

<p>Sorry for suggesting this on the eve of 4/2, but it would be great if each poll option had a link to an "Arguments in favor/Arguments against" page containing two sections of concise statements about why proponents prefer or oppose a given option. I'm not sure if it's workable, but it would be very helpful to interested editors like me who haven't had time to read the whole WP:ATT discussion.

<p>By providing editors a choice into the future of the old trio, beyond simply scrapping them or scrapping ATT, both can coexist, as Jimbo's comrpromise <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ANo_original_research&amp;diff=116625360&amp;oldid=116621222" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ANo_original_research&amp;diff=116625360&amp;oldid=116621222" rel="nofollow">illustrates</a> (as either primary or 2ndry).

<dd>Jimbo's compromise was, a compromise to keep things cool until we had a chance to discuss. I do not mind that ATT is marked as historical and we go back to the pre-ATT era, and I am one of the editors that participated in its formulation, if that is what the community wants. But having<i>yet another page to maintain</i> with canonical and detail pages?

<dd>Sure. But can you give an explanation for 900K of discussions about the content of the poll? My guess: we are making this something that is not. The best we have going so far is the community discussion, were editors are expressing their opinions unencumbered. This&#160;!vote is not the place to express opinion, but a way to gauge support or lack of support in principle for having a simpler page that explains the concepts of V, NOR and RS and their interrelations, to assist newbies in understanding the principles behind these, and give experienced editors one page to refer to others when these issues are brought to bear in talk page discussions. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 15:28, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

All I did was gauge concens as it stood 48 hours ago, reorganize the page, and kicked everyone in the ass to work on building concensus. If the page shifted dramatically in a day, so what? If it's not what YOU want, that is meaningless. If majority concensus isn't YOUR taste, well, convince them by talking to them. My only original contributions have been Q1-3, and the notification stuff, and trying to get people to move forward in general.

<dd>2.

<p>The present wording is none of the options in the Poll poll. It has been strongly opposed on this talk page, and I will vote against it as evidence of bad faith. I request that it be replaced either by Option 1, preferably with the open-ended question Marskell suggests, or by Option 4. These have the most net support, and the most support. (There's a case for Option 3, as amended; there is no case for this.) If more support materializes in the next few days, we can reconsider. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 17:35, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Interesting, is it not? Apparently, the wording of this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution/Poll&amp;oldid=118780209" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution/Poll&amp;oldid=118780209" rel="nofollow">poll</a> is being determined by the same political dynamic that determined the 1) wording of <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, 2) the cover story that this was a "merger," and 3) the inversion of the concept of <i>consensus</i> all done over the vociferous protest of over half of the participating Wikipedians. Whether or not this particular political dynamic brings success to Wikipedia, we shall see. But prominent scholars have concluded that <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federalist_No._10_e2c3.html#The_question_of_faction" title="Federalist No. 10">this particular political dynamic</a> produces decisions that destroy the enterprise. --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> 18:49, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I completely agree with you. I <b>strongly oppose</b> the way current poll is worded, and how the matter is generally handled. I'm sick and tired that people who are responsible for this mess with ATT in the first place are pressuring other editors to bow "for the good of Wikipedia".

<dd>Exactly. I 101% support ATT, but the abusive manhandling of wanting to force people into a scenario where its "Yes ATT?" or "Another yes ATT?" is disingenous.

<p>It does not matter to most people how the policy is organised, but rather what is said. I am in favor of a merger, provided the merged text represents my own view of what the policy will say. I am not in favor of a merger if the merged text will move in a direction I do not want to go. Each of us probably has their own idea of what the actual policy ought to be , and each is different. For example, if the eventual combination will make it easier to keep stubs, I want to combine them. If it is likely to make it harder, I would prefer to keep everything as it is. (and so on for a number of other criteria.) I interpret most of the recent argument as making as assumption about the final policy.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Apparently the hope of those revising the policy is to move slightly in an inclusionist direction, and those who are strongly opposed to that do not want a change, aand do not want to take the first step towards a change by approving the merger even in principle.</dd>

That essay actually shows that attribution is a deeply needed policy! Take the example where they quote SlimVirgin saying "Verifiable, not truth" is an important phrase that is "punchy and immediately ends conflict". This is used in a section where the importance of truth is discussed. I'm willing to bet my life that SlimVirgin meant the "not truth" part is what immediately ends conflicts. Sure, it is <i>verifiable</i> that SlimVirgin made such a statement, but is it honest scholarly attribution to use a persons statement out of context to argue the opposite? Anyway, the essay goes on to say things like "WP:ATT inverts the "directly referenced for the point" doctrine of WP:RS", and yet there is a section in WP:ATT that says "Material added to articles must be directly and explicitly supported by the cited sources."

<p>I wish I had time to read all of this, I really do. I think it's an important topic, but I just can't get through it all. I do want to offer this suggestion, or endorse it if somebody else has already proposed it: Start with one of poll forms with the most options, then conduct runoff ballots until one option emerges with consensus. As their preferred options drop off, reasonable editors should choose the remaining option that is most closely aligned with their preference.

<dd>That's a good idea. I had the opposite idea: start with the simplest issue ("WP:ATT is (1) policy; (2) a proposal; (3) rejected"), then poll a few days after close with ("In light of poll #1, WP:OR/V/RS is (1) policy; (2) guideline; (3) historical").

<p>I think links to the five options, until we decide on them, should be on the poll page until we decide on one (at which point they will of course be removed). I have been part of this discussion, and I have difficulty finding those pages; others will have more.</p>

<dd>I have, to the best of my recollection, abided by 1RR on this page; I have consistently tried for novel text after a problem has become evident, and I have discussed the problem here. Nor have I declined to read the discussion, and I trust I have not been abusive.

<dd> :)) Yes. Nice question. And I would like to celebrate the real beauty in your question, which I just realized, and that real beauty in your question "What of the others do you propose?" it seems to me is that it is addressed to everyone reading this -- not just to me. So I will merely serve temporarily to hold the floor for someone else to answer. And if all of the inventive people here could just keep people asking that question instead of defending the first answer that pops into our heads, we just might come up with the next worthwhile step in dealing with this very real problem of <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federalist_No._10_e2c3.html#The_question_of_faction" title="Federalist No. 10">faction</a> here.
