<p>This is great, but is it necessary to have so many footnotes, or even footnotes at all? It makes it look like an essay.

Any fact coming directly from any of the listed references (Livius, Polibius, etc.) shouldn't need footnoting, since these it is silently assumed that most information in the article comes from these sources. Furthermore, it makes the article look overly "messy" in my opinion. I would say to only footnotes when quoting sources otherwise not used (such as note nr. 7) or when sources are contradictory or exceptional in their remarks. … <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeronimo_378d.html" title="User:Jeronimo">Jeronimo</a> 06:33, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<li>I agree that the text would look cleaner without the footnotes. But I'm opposed to removing most of the footnotes. I think the "messy" look is far outweighed by the value of the information contained in the footnotes. (for example, I can't tell you how many times i've referred to the text mentioned in these footnotes when editing other parts of this as well as several other articles.) Yes, without the footnotes, the reader would still know that the article was based on the sources listed in the "references" section, but they wouldn't know <i>which</i> part of the article was based on <i>which</i> part of <i>which</i> sources. These texts comprise a couple of thousand or so pages, and believe me, it's not particularly easy (for me at least) to find the text upon which a given statement in the article is based. I think there is a strong analogy here with regard to links. I also find links visually distracting, but this is, of course, more than compensated for by the information they provide. I think that one of the reasons, the footnotes look "messy", is because they are so uncommon on Wikipedia (but I don't think they should be), and I think, just as in the case of links, one can, with familiarity, train one's eyes to ignore them. I believe that Wikipedia is weak in the the area of source citation. And I think we should <i>encourage</i> citation of sources (the more detailed the better&#160;;-) rather than <i>discourage</i> it. If the consensus is that a "featured article" shouldn't have so many footnotes, then I'd vote to keep the footnotes and have it be an "unfeatured article"&#160;;-).

</li>
<li>As to footnotes, I want to say two things. 1) I believe strongly that we should have as much detail in footnoting as possible -- see the recently started <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check_47bc.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check">fact-checking project</a> for a discussion of why highly granular references are useful. 2) A well-footnoted article is more beautiful to me than its counterpart; like a little stamp of guaranteed information density. There will eventually be better footnote support, allowing users to jump directly to them, to show/hide them, etc. I would hate to see the work that went into these lavish footnotes undone for the sake of temporary aesthetic. <a href="../../../s/j/_/User%7ESj_7824.html" title="User:Sj">+sj</a><a href="../../../s/j/_/User_talk%7ESj_d037.html" title="User talk:Sj"><font color="#FF6996">+</font></a> 06:25, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Re footnotes: I agree (now) that these should not be removed because they look ugly, they should only be removed if they are unnecessary, and I currently think many of these are unnecessary. Personally, I think that we only need footnotes when: 1) directly quoting somebody 2) when listing somebody's opinion on the article's subject 3) when the fact mentioned is disputed by other sources.</li>

<dd>For example, it seems to me that "Attalus was the son of Attalus and Antiochis" needs no footnote, just like there is no source for the information on who his brother was. However, the sentence "According to Pausanias "the greatest of his achievements" was the defeat of the Galatian Gauls" should get one.</dd>
<dd>If there is a problem with the fact that the references works are very large (thousands of pages), mention the page numbers or chapters that were used to narrow it a bit down. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeronimo_378d.html" title="User:Jeronimo">Jeronimo</a> 12:25, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<dd>I agree, that "Attalus was the son of Attalus and Antiochis" doesn't <i>need</i> to be footnoted, but I still find it <i>useful</i> to have the footnote. Every statement in this article is a summarization and/or an interpretation of someone else's words. I think it is useful to let the reader know whose words, and where they were written, so they can judge for themselves if the summaries and interpretations are accurate.

<dd>As I said above on the talk page, a footnote like that makes it read more like an essay than an article. It would be out of place in an essay too, since it's not disputed or controversial, it's not the opinion of some author or another, like Jeronimo said. If this was an essay, you might be expected to prove an argument, with footnotes as a backup, but this is not meant to be original research. In an encyclopedia article you're just giving a biography, not making an argument about some aspect of his life. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 05:50, 14 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it is your opinion that it reads like an essay and I respect it. However, the solution is to have MediaWiki updated to allow for a footnote markup language, I suggest &lt;&lt;brackets&gt;&gt; around text that autonumbers the footnotes and quote them. The footnotes can be a preference that can be turned off and on. This way everyone is happy, people who want it will turn it on, those who are not will not. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShaunMacPherson_703f.html" title="User:ShaunMacPherson">ShaunMacPherson</a> 03:49, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem isn't the footnotes, its that Wikipedia does not give the option to hide them. If someone wants more information about the varacity of a certain fact they should have the ability to 'turn on' footnotes and observe. If they do not want footnotes, because it can interfere with the flow of reading, then they can leave it off.</dd>

<p>Adam, I don't know what you mean by "makes it look like an essay". Could you elaborate? I'd really like to understand your objection.

<dd>I'm trying to find a way to articulate my objection...it's not that it has the structure of an essay, but the footnotes make it resemble one, and seem to suggest that there are statements or contentions or arguments that you want to prove. I see in the first three footnotes, for example, that each ancient author says something slightly different, like he reigned 43 or 44 years, but...so what? Are you trying to prove it one way or the other? It's like it'a almost too much information for an encyclopedia. I'd give the sources at the end, so people can read them for themselves. I think my objection is something like "this is not an encyclopedia article" but I know I'm not explaining myself properly. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Bishop_face.html" title="User:Adam Bishop">Adam Bishop</a> 18:06, 15 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I may interject - The problem is this isnt a 'normal' encyclopedia since there are not 'experts' who verify the relability of the data. It could very well be in truth that Wikipedia is more accurate, but this is *not* the perception. The way to counter the percpetion that wikipedia is inaccurate is to have fact checking that is visible, transparent and available for viewing.</dd>

<dd>Most encyclopedias articles are not footnoted like this one is, the footnotes <i>are</i> particularly dense here. So that probably accounts for why it doesn't "resemble" one. But because such heavily footnoted articles are uncommon doesn't mean they're bad. I suspect that one of the reasons that footnotes are rare is for reasons of space, which doesn't apply here. But whatever the reason, we need not follow fashion. To quote the Bard, who has Henry V say to Kate, after she has refused a kiss on the grounds that it's not the fashion in France for maids to kiss before marriage:
<dl>
<dd><i>O Kate! nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak list of a country’s fashion: we are the makers of manners, Kate</i></dd>

<dd>No I'm not trying to prove anything. The footnote is there so the reader can tell where these "facts" come from, and that while the article "declares" that he was born in 269 BC and died in 197 BC, there is a small controversy about this (by the way, a controversial fact is one of the few times above where Jeronamo <i>does</i> support footnotes) .

<dd>Nothing in an encyclopedia is new information. Everything in it is available elsewhere. So why encyclopedias at all? The point of an encyclopedia is not to provide new information but to provide an easier way to access old information. Source citation is just another step in that direction. It makes it easier to access the information contained in the sources. Sure we could just say to the reader, "well if you wonder where this fact comes from just read these five books, each around 500 pages long, and in some paragraph on some page in one of them you'll find it." Piece-a-cake no?&#160;;-) I think citing sources, is a value-added resource for the reader. It let's them know where to go to verify a fact, to check an interpretation, to investigate the reliability of a source, to read more on an aspect of the subject etc. It's for the readers convenience.</dd>

<li>No need to be sorry, I think your comments are constructive&#160;;-) His relationship to the previous ruler Eumenes I (he was also his adoptive son - which I've now added) as well as him being the first king of Pergamon, are in my opinion fairly important. Do you think these facts should come later in the article? I've added some content regarding the significance of his victory over the Gauls, do you think this is sufficient? I'm hesitant to add much more content which would essentially duplicate what comes almost immediately below. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> 20:08, Oct 13, 2004 (UTC)

<li>I don't know if they need to come later. I just don't know what is important and why and the intro certainly doesn't tell me. It should. Any good intro needs to be a summary of the most important points of the subject with an eye towards why they are important. That neccessarily will duplicate some information. Nothing wrong with that. Having the overview eases the reader in, then the details in the article are more comprehensive. And yes the significance of beating the Gauls is helpful. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 03:13, Oct 14, 2004 (UTC)

<li>Object. Good article, needs a few changes to get my support though. <s>1) As Taxman indicated, the lead section is inadequate. Instead of telling why Attalus I was so important, it adds unimportant facts about who his mother may have been. The lead section should give a short summary of the article, and introduce the subject of the article. See <a href="../../../l/e/a/Wikipedia%7ELead_section_3c3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">Wikipedia:Lead section</a>. 2) It is hard to understand the article, or even the lead section, without some context. This doesn't take a lot of work or text. E.g. "ruler of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Pergamon.html" title="Pergamon">Pergamon</a>, a Greek city state in present-day <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>" makes the article much more readable. Adding such context is necessary for the entire article.</s> 3) I don't think it is necessary to footnote each and every fact mentioned in the article. Any fact coming directly from any of the listed references (Livius, Polibius, etc.) shouldn't need footnoting, since these it is silently assumed that most information in the article comes from these sources. Furthermore, it makes the article look overly "messy" in my opinion. I would say to only footnotes when quoting sources otherwise not used (such as note nr. 7) or when sources are contradictory or exceptional in their remarks. <s>4) The article, after mentioning his relatives in the opening, immediately starts with Attalus's victory over the Galatian Gauls. I would like to see some more about his early life, or how he became king (he was not the son of his predecessor). I can image there's little information about his childhood, but I would expect something available aobut how he succeeded Eumenes I. If there's nothing known about that either, I think mentioning that is also useful. 5) I don't mind using direct quotations in articles, but the entire "Wife and sons" section consists of quotations. I personally prefer more of Wikipedia's own prose here. (This is not part of my objection.) 6) Another image would be nice as well (Again, not part of my objection).</s> <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeronimo_378d.html" title="User:Jeronimo">Jeronimo</a> 06:33, 12 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<li>I've rewritten the lead section and added an "Early life" section <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> 18:43, Oct 12, 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree that the text would look cleaner without the footnotes. But I'm opposed to removing most of the footnotes. I think the "messy" look is far outweighed by the value of the information contained in the footnotes. (for example, I can't tell you how many times i've referred to the text mentioned in these footnotes when editing other parts of this as well as several other articles.) Yes, without the footnotes, the reader would still know that the article was based on the sources listed in the "references" section, but they wouldn't know <i>which</i> part of the article was based on <i>which</i> part of <i>which</i> sources. These texts comprise a couple of thousand or so pages, and believe me, it's not particularly easy (for me at least) to find the text upon which a given statement in the article is based. I think there is a strong analogy here with regard to links. I also find links visually distracting, but this is, of course, more than compensated for by the information they provide. I think that one of the reasons, the footnotes look "messy", is because they are so uncommon on Wikipedia (but I don't think they should be), and I think, just as in the case of links, one can, with familiarity, train one's eyes to ignore them. I believe that Wikipedia is weak in the the area of source citation. And I think we should <i>encourage</i> citation of sources (the more detailed the better&#160;;-) rather than <i>discourage</i> it. If the consensus is that a "featured article" shouldn't have so many footnotes, then I'd vote to keep the footnotes and have it be an "unfeatured article"&#160;;-).

<li>As to footnotes, I want to say two things. 1) I believe strongly that we should have as much detail in footnoting as possible -- see the recently started <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check_47bc.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check">fact-checking project</a> for a discussion of why highly granular references are useful. 2) A well-footnoted article is more beautiful to me than its counterpart; like a little stamp of guaranteed information density. There will eventually be better footnote support, allowing users to jump directly to them, to show/hide them, etc. I would hate to see the work that went into these lavish footnotes undone for the sake of temporary aesthetic. <a href="../../../s/j/_/User%7ESj_7824.html" title="User:Sj">+sj</a><a href="../../../s/j/_/User_talk%7ESj_d037.html" title="User talk:Sj"><font color="#FF6996">+</font></a> 06:25, 13 Oct 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Re footnotes: I agree (now) that these should not be removed because they look ugly, they should only be removed if they are unnecessary, and I currently think many of these are unnecessary. Personally, I think that we only need footnotes when: 1) directly quoting somebody 2) when listing somebody's opinion on the article's subject 3) when the fact mentioned is disputed by other sources.</li>

<dd>For example, it seems to me that "Attalus was the son of Attalus and Antiochis" needs no footnote, just like there is no source for the information on who his brother was. However, the sentence "According to Pausanias "the greatest of his achievements" was the defeat of the Galatian Gauls" should get one.</dd>

<dd>I agree, that "Attalus was the son of Attalus and Antiochis" doesn't <i>need</i> to be footnoted, but I still find it <i>useful</i> to have the footnote. Every statement in this article is a summarization and/or an interpretation of someone else's words. I think it is useful to let the reader know whose words, and where they were written, so they can judge for themselves if the summaries and interpretations are accurate.

<li>Ok the lead section still needs some work. The sentence "He was the second cousin and the adoptive son of Eumenes I2, whom he succeeded, and was the first of the Attalid dynasty to assume the title of king" seems like it could be removed since the second part is now repeated later in the intro and the first does not seem all that important (and is covered later in the article). 2). There are a number of one sentence paragraph, which need to be expanded or merged with another paragraph. 3.) Overall the article has the typical ancient Greek POV that the Greeks were good and everyone else was bad. An example is "Galatians had posed a problem for Pergamon, indeed for all of Asia Minor." So the conquests of Attalus are glorious, but the other side is a problem for everyone? The section headings of defeat and conquests promote this too. 4.) Overall the writing is very difficult to follow, but because it is mostly due to apparently correct, albeit complicated sentence structure, I will not object only on a basis such as that. Specifically the Early life section though, has too many clauses in each sentence and would not lose anything if it were simplified a bit. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 16:09, Oct 15, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>1) As I said above, his relationship to the previous ruler of Pergamon, and his kingship are of considerable importance. He became important because he was king, and he became king because of his relationship to Eumenes. <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> and <i>The Oxford Classical Dictionary</i> seem to agree. Both, include this information in their first two sentences in their articles about him. These facts are part of the "definition" of who he is. They answer the question: "Which Attalus was that?" (there were more than one); answer: "The successor to Eumenes I" or "You know, the first king of Pergamon"; response: "Oh yeah that guy." Yes the relationship to Eumenes is mentioned again in the "Early life" section, but as you said above "Any good intro needs to be a summary of the most important points of the subject with an eye towards why they are important. That neccessarily will <i>duplicate</i> some information" I agree the repetition of the phrase 'the title of "king"' (I've changed this slightly) in the first paragraph and second paragraphs, was not good. But the reason for mentioning his kingship in the second paragraph was to explain how he gained the title, and to answer, in part, your question: "… what was so important about the victory over the Gauls".</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Some good points, but the intro still doesn't say who Eumenes is or why he is important to anyone that doesn't already know. But if it is that standard, fine. In general just because two sources do it one way does not mean it can't be improved to say why this guy is important.
<dl>
<dd>But the intro <i>does</i> say who Eumenes I is and why he is important, specifically it says that Attalus I "was the second cousin and the adoptive son of <a href="../../../e/u/m/Eumenes_I_abe4.html" title="Eumenes I">Eumenes I</a>, <i>whom he succeeded</i>,". Thus Eumenes is identified as the predecessor to Attalus as ruler of Pergamon, which is also why he was important. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> 16:16, Oct 16, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>A large body of Gauls, induced either by want of room or desire for plunder … marched …into the country of the Dardani … Fighting with those who opposed their progress and exacting tribute from those who asked for peace …they went further into Asia. Out of the 20,000 men not more than 10,000 were carrying arms, yet so great was the terror they inspired in all the nations west of the Taurus, that those who had no experience of them, as well as those who had come into contact with them, the most remote as well as their next neighbours, all alike submitted to them. They levied tribute on the whole of Asia west of the Taurus, but fixed their own settlement on both sides of the Halys. Such was the terror of their name and the growth of their numbers that at last even the kings of Syria did not dare to refuse the payment of tribute.</i></dd>

<dd>The Gauls <i>were</i> a "problem" for Pergamon (as I am sure Pergamon was a problem for the Gauls). This statement is not meant to (nor as far as I can tell does it) indicate that the Pergamene were in any way superior to the Gauls. Would you please offer alternative, less POV wording for "Galatians had posed a problem for Pergamon, indeed for all of Asia Minor." As for the section titles "Defeat of the Gauls" and "Conquests in Seleucid Asia Minor" the first is meant to describe the event whereby Attalus met the Gauls in battle and won, the second is meant to describe the expansion of territory, (not at the expense of the Gauls by the way) in that part of Asia Minor previously controlled by the Seleucid empire. Why are these headings POV? Can you think of better ones? <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> 01:52, Oct 16, 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well I couldn't think of much better titles right away or I would have changed them. Conquest connotes ideas like valor and superiority. Defeat is fine, it is more factual. I can't even figure out what is going on and follow who is who in the Conquests section, so I don't know what a better title there is. I think I fixed a bit of the "Gaul problem", by noting what made them a problem closer to the sentence in question. Don't forget Livy was a Roman and Rome had been sacked by the Gauls, so he is hardly unbiased himself. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> 04:35, Oct 16, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think the word "conquests" is anymore POV, than "defeat". Webster: <i>Conquest: 1. The act or process of conquering, or acquiring by force; 2. That which is conquered; possession gained by force, physical or moral.</i> In the section heading "Conquests in Seleucid Asia Minor", the word is being used in <i>both</i> the above senses (which I rather like). I don't think that "conquest" connotes a "valorous superiority" any more than it connotes a "brutal subjugation". Rather it's the action <i>itself</i> which is POV laden. In any victory or defeat, there are the victorious and the vanquished and they each will naturally enough have their own POV. Of course the word then inherits the POV, but it inherits both a positive <i>and</i> a negative one. In my opinion, the POVs are symmetric, and thus (more or less) balance out. To rule out the use of such words as "conquest" and "defeat" as too POV, is to impoverish the language.</dd>

<dd>Having said all that, if nevertheless "conquests" must go, then I propose: "Hostile takeovers in Seleucid Asia Minor". Just kidding&#160;;-) this came to mind as i was considering the phrase "territorial acquisitions" as a possible alternative to "conquests". Seriously though, if you can't abide "conquests" how about "Territorial expansion in Seleucid Asia Minor"? It's less concise, dryer, more boring and contains (unfortunately) only the first meaning of "conquest" given above - but it probably <i>is</i> less POV.</dd>

<dd>Yes, of course, Livy is biased, but the collective scholarly judgment would be, I think, that he's not so biased as to fabricate that the Gauls were extracting tribute and plundering throughout Cis-Tauric Asia Minor. But anything's possible&#160;;-), (Jeronimo: that's one of the reasons for citing the source of this in the footnotes&#160;;-).

<li>Support: Livy is biased, and the view you hit in some historians is that Atalus was a toady of Rome who was really out to take Macedonia out of the picture and balance against Antiochus. At any rate, it's great to see a Hellenistic topic nominated, and this is a well researched article. Quarrels over minor wording are somewhat beside the point. This is a good balance to some of the contemporary events (which should be there, but as part of a mix) in the FA's. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:20, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>I recently made some changes to experiment with a new idea of mine called abbreviated references. The idea is that each reference is associated with an abbreviation — in this case I used last names — and then the footnotes section uses these and links to the line of the page giving all the details of the reference. This makes references easier to update, footnotes easier to add, and makes the footnotes section neater.

<dd>Having only the last name of the author (along with a date of publication say, if there are more than one work by the author in the in the "References" section) is typical for footnotes. The reason for this is primarily for reasons of space, and the convenience of the writer and/or editor. Since space is not much of an issue for us, I chose to repeat the full reference in the footnotes to maximize reader convenience, over editor convenience. Although I suppose it does, as you say, look "neater", and in any case it isn't much more (or less) convenient either way. However I don't like the look of the "References" section now. It looks <i>unusual</i> to say the least. In this case, since the bolded "abbreviation" is the same as the last name, it adds no information, and is confusing.

I try to exclude links to sites with content that promotes violence, or racism. This website is mainly about Hellenic culture and science with increasing emphasis of modern Hellas." I think this sense applies to Wikipedia, and I am tagging the image as PD-art (I believe this image would, if agreed that it is not subject to copyright by the creator given his statement above, belong to the public domain.)</dd>

<p>Hi Angr. I'm not completely content with your edit at <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attalus_I_0ff7.html" title="Attalus I">Attalus I</a>, I think it interrupts the flow there, and I'm not sure what information it is trying to convey. Is it trying to imply that calling the Galatians "Gauls" is a misnomer? My understanding is that the Galatians were Celtic speaking immigrant Gauls from <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrace.html" title="Thrace">Thrace</a>, who were part of the great Celtic/Gualish Eastward migration. Am I wrong about this? <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 19:07, September 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is the term "Gaul" is rather vague. Today it's usually understood to mean speakers of Gaulish, i.e. the Celts of what is now France, Switzerland, and northern Italy, but the Greeks and Romans called the Galatians Gauls too. It's clear the Galatians were Celts and that they moved from Thrace to Asia Minor during the historical period, but no one really knows how closely related they were to the Gauls of Gaul. Their language is way too sparsely attested to say whether it was particularly closely related to Gaulish. I think it's important to mention that the Galatians were called Gauls in the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attalus_I_0ff7.html" title="Attalus I">Attalus I</a> article because of the reference to the <a href="../../../d/y/i/Dying_Gaul_87d9.html" title="Dying Gaul">Dying Gaul</a> (always known as such even though he's apparently actually a Galatian) and because section 2 of the article is called "Defeat of the Gauls" and makes reference to "Galatian Gauls" and even simply "Gauls" in the quote. I wouldn't say calling the Galatians "Gauls" is definitely a misnomer, but it might be; we just don't know enough about the ethnolinguistic groupings among the Continental Celts to be sure. The Greeks and Romans considered them Gauls, and maybe they were right, but maybe they weren't. If you think my edit disrupts the flow, maybe you can change that sentence back to what you had, but then add a sentence in section 2 explaining that the people in question were the Galatians but that contemporary sources called them Gauls. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 19:23, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Angr: Thanks for your cogent explanation. I now think I understand and agree with the point you are making. I think the best way to handle this might be, as you suggest, to remove the explanation of the distinction from the lead and into the section "Defeat of the Gauls" (renaming it the "Defeat of the Galatians"). I would propose replacing the first sentence there with something like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>According to <a href="../../../p/a/u/Pausanias_%28geographer%29.html" title="Pausanias (geographer)">Pausanias</a> "the greatest of his achievements" was the defeat of the "<a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauls.html" title="Gauls">Gauls</a>". Pausanias was referring to the Galatians, immigrant Celts from <a href="../../../t/h/r/Thrace.html" title="Thrace">Thrace</a>, who had recently settled in <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galatia.html" title="Galatia">Galatia</a> in central <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia_Minor_99e3.html" title="Asia Minor">Asia Minor</a>, and whom the Romans and Greeks called <a href="../../../g/a/u/Gauls.html" title="Gauls">Gauls</a>, associating them with the Celts of what is now <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switzerland.html" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, and northern <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>What do you think? I think that the slight confusion that might be created by the mention of the "Dying Gaul" in the lead, doesn't really warrant an explanation there. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 19:53, September 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That looks pretty good. It might be worth pointing out that the Greek word here translated "Gauls" is <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">Γαλάται</span>. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 20:03, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hmmm. Having been prompted by your mention, to look at the original Greek, I'm now wondering if the translation of "Galatas" as "Gauls" is really correct in the first place? And what does it really mean to say that the Greeks called the Galatians Gauls? <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 20:34, September 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, Liddell and Scott say that <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">Γαλάται</span> is just a later word for <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">Κέλτοι</span>, implying the Greeks would have called the inhabitants of Gaul <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">Γαλάται</span> as well. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 20:45, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok I will go ahead and make the above changes, adding in the Greek word, as you suggested. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 21:01, September 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The following sentence makes it seem (or it did to me at first reading) as if the elder Attalus was the son of incestuous gay procreation:</p>
