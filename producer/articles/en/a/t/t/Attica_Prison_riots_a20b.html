	    <p>The <b>Attica Prison riots</b> were general <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison.html" title="Prison">prison</a> uprisings that began at the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attica_Correctional_Facility_5c56.html" title="Attica Correctional Facility">Attica Correctional Facility</a> in <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attica_%28town%29%2C_New_York_5b9f.html" title="Attica (town), New York">Attica, New York</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_9.html" title="September 9">September 9</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a>. In the end, at least thirty-nine people were killed.</p>
<p>The prisoners had demanded better living conditions, showers, education, and vocational training, as well as less censorship of their mail and visitors. At the time, inmates were given one bucket of water a week as a "shower" and one roll of toilet paper a month.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The original request was sent in a letter before any physical action. Then, responding to rumors of the impending torture of another prisoner, the prisoners revolted, taking prison guards as hostages.</p>

<p>At approximately 8:20 A.M. on Thursday, September 9, 1971, as 5 Company lined up for roll-call, they learned that one of their companions was to remain in his cell,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> prompting rumors that he was to be tortured after being isolated for an incident with another prisoner.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> A small group of 5 Company prisoners protested that they, too, would be locked up, and began walking back towards their cells. The remainder of 5 Company continued towards breakfast. As the protesting group walked past the isolated inmate, they were able to free him from his cell. They then rejoined the rest of 5 Company and proceeded on their way. A short time later, when command staff discovered what had occurred, a correctional officer walked down A Tunnel to investigate. He was assaulted and the riot began.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Inmates quickly gained control of a large portion of the prison, assaulting guards with pipes, chains and baseball bats. One officer would later die from injuries received at the hands of the inmates.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Inmates took forty-two officers and civilians hostage and aired a list of grievances, demanding their needs be met before their surrender.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> In a facility designed to hold 1,200 inmates and actually housing 2,225,<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> theirs was a substantial list. They felt that they had been illegally denied certain rights and conditions to which they were entitled, illustrated by such practices as being allowed only one shower per week and one roll of toilet paper per person per month.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The prisoners negotiated with a team of observers that they had requested, including <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Wicker_bedc.html" title="Tom Wicker">Tom Wicker</a>, an editor of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a>, James Ingram of the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_Chronicle_ff50.html" title="Michigan Chronicle">Michigan Chronicle</a>, state representative <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Eve_5508.html" title="Arthur Eve">Arthur Eve</a> and other elected officials.</p>
<p>The situation may have been further complicated by then-Governor <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Rockefeller_e416.html" title="Nelson Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a>’s refusal to come to the scene of the riot and meet with the inmates,<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> although later evaluations of the incident would postulate that his absence from the scene actually prevented the situation from deteriorating.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> Negotiations broke down and Rockefeller ultimately ordered the State Police to retake the facility.</p>
<p>At 9:46 A.M. on Monday, September 13, 1971 tear gas was dropped into the yard and State Troopers opened fire. By the time the facility was retaken, ten hostages and twenty-nine inmates had been killed by the Troopers.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> The final death toll from the riot also included the officer fatally injured at the start of the riot and four inmates killed when "inmate justice" was administered.<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> The New York State Special Commission on Attica wrote, "With the exception of Indian massacres in the late 19th century, the State Police assault which ended the four-day prison uprising was the bloodiest one-day encounter between Americans since the Civil War."<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>Media reports claimed that inmate hostage-takers slit the throats of many of their hostages, reports that contradicted official medical evidence. Newspaper headlines made statements such as "I Saw Slit Throats," implying that prisoners had cut the hostages' throats when the armed raid occurred. These "reports" were later found to be fictitious.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Attica riots were notable in that they directed national media attention to the condition of prisons in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> during the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> and early <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a>.</p>
<p>The State of New York settled a wrongful death lawsuit with the families of the slain inmates 27 years after the riot. The State of New York recognized the families of the slain prison employees in the Fall of 2004 with a 12 million dollar financial settlement.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Attica_Prison_riots_a20b.html" title="Edit section: Racial issues">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Racial issues</span></h2>
<p>Many people attribute the riot to the racial issues inside of the prison at the time. Of 2,225 inmates (in a facility built for 1,200), 54% of the inmates were <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> and 9% <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rican_ff02.html" title="Puerto Rican">Puerto Rican</a>; however, all of the 383 correctional officers were white. From reports on the prison conditions, the guards were openly racist and assaulted the prisoners with their batons, which they dubbed "Nigger Sticks." During this time period "black militancy" was at its peak and several prisons had their black <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militant.html" title="Militant">militants</a> transferred to Attica. At the same time <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Jackson_%28Black_Panther%29_3c9a.html" title="George Jackson (Black Panther)">George Jackson</a>, a member of the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Panther_Party_31db.html" title="Black Panther Party">Black Panther Party</a>, died at the hands of white prison guards only a few days before the riot in the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Quentin_af9b.html" title="San Quentin">San Quentin</a> State Prison in <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, adding to the racial tension. The aftermath of the riot called for prison reform, especially in the treatment of minority inmates who were becoming a majority in several state correctional facilities across America.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>One of the leaders of the uprising, Cleveland "Jomo" Davis was later pardoned by New York Governor <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Carey_fa68.html" title="Hugh Carey">Hugh Carey</a>. On April 2, 1978 Davis was accused of having fatally shot and killed New York City Police Officers Christie O. Masone and Norman R. Cerullo in Brooklyn, New York, possibly in retaliation for his Attica role, but Davis was found not guilty. <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Attica_Prison_riots_a20b.html" title="Edit section: Cultural references">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cultural references</span></h2>
<p>In the 1975 film <i><a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_Day_Afternoon_afb2.html" title="Dog Day Afternoon">Dog Day Afternoon</a>,</i> <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Pacino_b483.html" title="Al Pacino">Al Pacino</a>'s character, Sonny, who is holding eight bank employees hostage, starts a chant of "Attica! Attica!" at the massed police outside, invoking the excessive police force used in response to the Attica riots. Many more pop culture references stem from this scene than from the riots themselves. For example, in the 1977 film <i><a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Night_Fever_8bd0.html" title="Saturday Night Fever">Saturday Night Fever</a></i> <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Manero_de7e.html" title="Tony Manero">Tony Manero</a>, played by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Travolta_d5f5.html" title="John Travolta">John Travolta</a>, repeats Pacino's "Attica! Attica!" line. See <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dog_Day_Afternoon_afb2.html#References_in_popular_culture" title="Dog Day Afternoon">Dog Day Afternoon in popular culture</a> for many more examples.</p>
<p>Three TV movies of the riot have been produced: 1980's <i>Attica</i>, with <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Grizzard_8bd9.html" title="George Grizzard">George Grizzard</a>, 1994's <i>Against the Wall</i>, with <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_L._Jackson_663e.html" title="Samuel L. Jackson">Samuel L. Jackson</a>, and 2001's <i>The Killing Yard</i>, with <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Alda_35e3.html" title="Alan Alda">Alan Alda</a>.</p>
<p>In the television show <i><a href="../../../o/z/_/Oz_%28TV_series%29_f2b2.html" title="Oz (TV series)">Oz</a></i>, racial tension and poor living conditions cause the prison inmates to riot in the episode "A Game of Checkers." The event echoes the real life situation in Attica, and several characters reference the Attica uprisings when discussing how they should work to diffuse the riot. The manager of the rioting cell block <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_McManus_100a.html" title="Tim McManus">Tim McManus</a> reveals to one of the inmates that his father had been a guard at Attica and missed one of Tim's birthday parties when he was called to deal with the riot.</p>
<p>The incident is directly referenced in at least two songs: <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a>'s "Attica State" on his <i><a href="../../../s/o/m/Some_Time_In_New_York_City_c150.html" title="Some Time In New York City">Some Time In New York City</a></i> album, and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Paxton_4560.html" title="Tom Paxton">Tom Paxton</a>'s "The Hostage," which was told from the perspective of one of the prison guards. The Paxton song was made famous by <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judy_Collins_b7d3.html" title="Judy Collins">Judy Collins</a>, who included it on her <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a> album <i><a href="../../../t/r/u/True_Stories_and_Other_Dreams_34ff.html" title="True Stories and Other Dreams">True Stories and Other Dreams</a></i>. The Attica riots were also said to have inspired both the <a href="../../../1/0/c/10cc.html" title="10cc">10cc</a> song "<a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubber_Bullets_6cbe.html" title="Rubber Bullets">Rubber Bullets</a>" and the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Mingus_778b.html" title="Charles Mingus">Charles Mingus</a> composition "<a href="../../../c/h/a/Changes_One_%28Mingus%29_e5c1.html" title="Changes One (Mingus)">Remember Rockefeller at Attica</a>."</p>
<p>The 1972 album <i><a href="../../../a/t/t/Attica_Blues_%28album%29_2cbb.html" title="Attica Blues (album)">Attica Blues</a></i> by jazz saxophonist <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archie_Shepp_6452.html" title="Archie Shepp">Archie Shepp</a> and its title track are a direct reference to the incident.</p>
<p>Composer <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederic_Rzewski_e7a3.html" title="Frederic Rzewski">Frederic Rzewski</a> wrote two pieces, "Coming Together"/"Attica" (1972), that set excerpts from a letter by Sam Melville, one of the prisoners killed in the riots.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_Ginsberg_6113.html" title="Allen Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a> states "They wanted Attica" in his poem 'Hadda be playing the jukebox' which was later performed as a song by <a href="../../../r/a/g/Rage_Against_the_Machine_f104.html" title="Rage Against the Machine">Rage Against the Machine</a>, and sang by <a href="../../../z/a/c/Zack_De_La_Rocha_a203.html" title="Zack De La Rocha">Zack De La Rocha</a>.</p>
<p>Nas also refers to Attica in his song entitled, "If I Ruled the World" featuring Lauryn Hill. He says: "I'd open every cell in Attica and send them to Africa."</p>
