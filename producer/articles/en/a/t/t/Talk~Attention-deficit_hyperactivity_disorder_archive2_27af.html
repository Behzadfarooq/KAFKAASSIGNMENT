<h2><span class="mw-headline">Feature Article?</span></h2>
<p>I think this article has FA potential. Anybody else? <a href="../../../2A/k/a/User%7E_Kat__e754.html" title="User:*Kat*">*Kat*</a> 03:45, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You know, I think it does have FA potential, if only because it is so representative of ADHD. If you really want to know what its like to to have ADHD, read the whole thing (I don't think I got past the second paragraph) or read the talk page&#160;:) (<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreerick_31e5.html" title="User:Freerick">Patrick</a> 15:57, 17 May 2006 (UTC))</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree. This and related articles such as <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-ADHD_a194.html" title="Anti-ADHD">Anti-ADHD</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methylphenidate.html" title="Methylphenidate">Methylphenidate</a> are just a jumble of competing ideas. There are sentences that have been edited so much that they are either self-contradictory or meaningless. There are also far too many unsubstantiated, vague and sweeping claims. Trying to sort it out would be a thankless waste of time because whatever good was been done would be undone within days by the same people who created the current mess.</p>
<p>To get a clearer picture of why this is going on it is worth reading Andrew Lakoff<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>. Not only does he provide a well researched history of ADHD but he provides one of the few reasoned arguments for why people hold such strong views about it.</p>
<p>There is much valuable and reliable information in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder.html" title="Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder">Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> would make a good feature article to warn people of what can go wrong.<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanWills_4aed.html" title="User:IanWills">IanWills</a>IanWills</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Amen Classification System / Should not be a FA</span></h2>
<p>I created the page on Amen classification and linked it to ADHD page adhoc. <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/amen_classification" class="external free" title="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/amen_classification" rel="nofollow">http://wikipedia.org/wiki/amen_classification</a> I expected that it would be evolved and information added to it, which did happen. Now I am quite annoyed that someone has deleted the link and sentence to the Amen classification.</p>
<p>Sure the Amen classification has not been formalised, but it should at least be referred to in the ADHD article that the classification exists and that it is an alternative to the DSM. There is the section "Formal Definitions", what about "Informal definitions?" or something along those lines?</p>
<p>Please in the future, evolve things, do not delete things.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>I'm afraid that I can't agree that this article should be nominated for a Featured Article in its current form.</p>
<p>In the Diagnosis section it currently reads that: "In recent times the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Amen_classification.html" title="Amen classification">Amen classification</a> has subclassified the DSM-IV classification and this led to improved diagnostic accuracy, which leads to better selection of medication and treatment. In nearly all developed nations (including the US and UK), doctors are required to conduct a SPECT scan in order to correctly treat the brain's chemical deficiencies. Without this scan, incorrect treatment can do damage to the brain." At the very least this needs citation as the <a href="../../../d/s/m/DSM-IV_1fd8.html" title="DSM-IV">DSM-IV</a> is, to my knowledge, the guide most widely used for psychatric treatment by U.S. doctors.</p>
<p>It also turns out that under the Testing for ADHD - Other Forms of Testing section the article currently reads that "Neurometrics, PET scans, FMRI, or SPECT scans have been used to provide a more objective diagnosis. These are not typically suitable for very young children, and may unnecessarily expose the patient to harmful radiation. Because the etiology of the disorder is unknown, and a complete neurological definition of this disorder is lacking, a majority of clinicians doubt the current predictive power of these objective tests to detect ADHD to be used to direct clinical treatment. Currently, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry recommend against using these neuro-imaging methods for clinical diagnosis of individuals who may have ADHD...An October 2005 meta-analysis by Alan Zametkin, M.D., with the NIMH entitled "The ADHD Report", concluded that these diagnostic methods lack adequate scientific research on accuracy and specificity to be used as a primary diagnostic tool." These statements are cited and directly contradict those in the Diagnosis section mentioned.</p>
<p>What little research I've done leads me to believe that the Amen system does not belong under the diagnosis section as its reliability has not been scientifically proven. If it is kept it in the article, I recommend that it be moved from the Diagnosis section to either the Other Forms of Testing or Alternative Treatments section.</p>
<p>Finally, I feel it is relevant to mention that Dr. Daniel Amen <a href="http://www.amenclinic.com/da/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amenclinic.com/da/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> has set up a set of clinics using his methods, which currently charge $3,250 for a comprehensive evaluation.<a href="http://www.amenclinic.com/ac/patients.php#cost" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amenclinic.com/ac/patients.php#cost" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Some basic research should be done before leading everyone to believe that the Amen system is widely accepted in the medical community.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reorganize</span></h2>
<p>I know that it's probably not reasonable to expect this article to be structured or organized in a meaningful way; if you just skim over the headings it's obvious that this is the product of the collective efforts of a large number of people with ADHD. I know we can't organize things, so <b>maybe someone who doesn't have ADHD could come up with a new structure</b> for the article (detailed), and the community can then submit the information. I can't think of anything else right now to improve this; the article is becoming way too long, not to mention the talk page. Does anyone have any other suggestions on how we can bring order to this?

<dd>I'm sure it wasn't your intention, but please don't be insulting. It's not appropriate to imply that ADHD sufferers are incapable or incompetent as Wikipedia editors, or that editing should be restricted to those without the condition. Wikipedia is the free encyclopedia that <i>anyone</i> can edit, remember. Best wishes, <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 20:13, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You got me wrong, I'm not saying that people with ADHD are incompetent, <b>I would be insulting <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreerick_31e5.html" title="User:Freerick">myself</a>!</b> I realize that there are some things that I have difficulty with as a person who has ADHD, such as time management, organization, data management, etc, so I cope with those difficulties by joining forces with others who happen to be <i>extremely</i> organized, for example; that way, the aspects of my personality that need improvement don't inhibit my most appreciated features. <i>Therefore</i> I am suggesting that contributors with ADHD join forces with others in the same way.

<dd>Hmm, I see. Personally, my opinion of those editors I've seen who have ADHD is that they tend to make quite good editors. ADHD is primarily a difference in the quantity of things one's attention focuses on, and the degree. A distributed project such as Wikipedia is excellent at including both those who excel best at focusing on a sole article, and those whose preferred focus is to watch many articles and tweak in small ways. That's what I love about this project: as long as someone is willing to be civil and take constructive criticism well, they can always find some way to help here. &#160;:) <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 11:08, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I took a machette to this article a little over a year ago. Can't believe that it has gotten so messy again! I think still think it has FA potential, but I gotta agree, now is not the time. Maybe I'll clean it up again this summer. --<a href="../../../2A/k/a/User%7E_Kat__e754.html" title="User:*Kat*">*Kat*</a> 08:16, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, I'm glad someone agrees that the article requires cleaning, it's not meant as an insult, look at my <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreerick_31e5.html" title="User:Freerick">user page</a>; I do agree is <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKaseryn_505f.html" title="User:Kaseryn">Kaseryn</a> that ADHD people combined probably have the largest number of edits on Wikipedia. This site is like a playground for peole like us, there is always something new to read or some project to start. Granted, I can say I haven't finished very many projects but I've started a lot, even in the last two weeks alone. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, I happen to know things about a lot of different topics that other people have never heard of, especially things that I'm currently interested in. Cleaning up this article is an enormous task, especially if it is done in a manner that keeps it from getting messy again. It will take the combined effort of many to accomplish this. We should start by archiving some of the stuff on the talk page so we have some room to talk, this is insanely long; secondly, we should look through the article and find items that can be moved to different articles, as well as things that are not relevant.(<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreerick_31e5.html" title="User:Freerick">Patrick</a> 17:44, 16 May 2006 (UTC))

<dd>I agree both that it needs cleanup, and that it needs someone who very much DOES NOT have ADHD/ADD. I have it myself, and lord only knows, I can't mentally deal with all the citation-tracking, sourcing and organization this thing needs!</dd>

<dd>I can, however, state that since I last checked this article (which I think was a couple of weeks or more, but less than a month... can't recall exactly, but I believe it was less than a month. I think.), it HAS vastly improved, mostly due, I believe, to Kat's spring cleaning. That little sad (in that it showed how bad the article was at the time), yet amusingly ironic "this article needs attention" note has gone away, and I don't think I'd argue, at this point, since though there is still some sourcing needing to be done, it's no worse off at the moment I think than a number of other articles, including my pet project <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_fiction.html" title="Fan fiction">Fan fiction</a>, or it's related article <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Sue_e6e3.html" title="Mary Sue">Mary Sue</a>; in fact, I could swear it has more sourcing/citation done by far than the fan fiction article. Of course, as an article on a medical diagnosis, it <i>needs</i> far more cites, but this is a very heartening development! I look forward to the day (however far away it may be at this point) where it becomes a Featured Article candidate in the vein of <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger%27s_Syndrome_18a6.html" title="Asperger's Syndrome">Asperger's Syndrome</a>.&#160;:) <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERuna27_e274.html" title="User:Runa27">Runa27</a> 08:04, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Comparative Behavior</span></h2>
<p>"teenage pregnancy (30–35%)" If the section is stating that the proportion of people with ADHD are involved in a teenage pregnancy 30-35% more than those without ADHD (as in if 3% of teens are involved in a pregnancy 38% of teens with ADHD are involved in a pregnancy), then that is simple not true. If the section is claiming that people with ADHD are 30-35% more likely than people without ADHD to be involved in a teenage pregnancy then that is an extremely misleading statistic, probably making a difference of only 1% more teen pregnancies. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_conway_bcc_10d2.html" title="User:William conway bcc">William conway bcc</a> 20:05, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The data is certainly questionable, but it leads to an interesting obvservation: if ADHD is indeed inheritable <i>and</i> if the statistic is in fact accurate, then, in a few generations, we can expect <i>the vast majority</i> of people to have ADHD, because of the increased number of offspring from parents with ADHD. Even if the statistic is grossly overestimated and only lies at 1% of (unwanted) pregnancies above the norm, as you suggested, we can <i>still</i> expect to see the vast majority of pepole to have ADHD several generations in the future. Therefore if there are <i>any</i> more pregnancies from ADHD parents, compared to non-ADHD parents, almost <i>everyone</i> will eventually have ADHD. Therefore, the "disorder", or whatever it will be classified as, will effectively disappear, and people who <i>don't</i> have the ADHD gene will probably undergo some sort of treatment to compensate for their "difficulty to multitask" or perhaps "obsessive behavior", "over-organization", "rigid personality", "lack of spontaneity", etc. (<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreerick_31e5.html" title="User:Freerick">Patrick</a> 13:17, 15 May 2006 (UTC))

<dd>An interesting speculation, but it doesn't hold up. For one thing, even if ADHD sufferers account for an increasingly larger slice of the teenage-parent pie, that says nothing about the much larger portion of society who do not have teen pregnancies, nor about the established fact that the children of teenaged parents have statistically lower life expectancy (due to poor parenting and poverty, typically). A combination of distinct minority status and relatively lower life expectancy do not seem to indicate a trait that is going to make much headway in the gene pool. This is only addressing our culture, as well; there are still many cultures in the world where teen marriage and pregnancy is common or the norm, in which case ADHD won't make a noticeable difference. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 04:25, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see what you mean; it's one thing that there may be an increased number of teen pregnancies among ADHD teens, however, most people carry ADHD into adulthood; there is no cure and it doesn't just go away by itself. If you're going forget to use protection, or simply choose not to use it, and believe me, this is far more likely to happen to people with ADHD (see impulsivity, forgetfulness, etc) this behavior will likely continue into adulthood. What makes matters worse, from an evolutionary standpoint, is that ADHD people tend to associate with other ADHD people; therefore this can really lead to an ADHD "epidemic" generations down the line, even if it is just because ADHD people have a tendency to find each other, even in adulthood.(<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreerick_31e5.html" title="User:Freerick">Patrick</a> 17:54, 16 May 2006 (UTC))

<dd>First of all the point you made about the spreading of an epidemic is flawed. If any of the statistics about ADHD are true then yes people with ADHD would have a higher birth rate. BUT if any of the other statistics about higher rates of STDs and job related injuries are true then people with ADHD would also die quicker, which would cancel out the higher birth rate. Secondly, this article states that 30% to 70% of those with ADHD continue to have the disorder in adulthood, which is not necessarily a majority.

<dd>This is often combined with problems inhibiting responding to distracting events that often draw the person off-task. Those with ADHD also have difficulties re-engaging the previous task once they have been distracted. The hyperactivity is typically most evident in early to middle childhood and declines significantly with age. By adulthood, it is most evident in a feeling of restlessness or inner or subjective hyperactivity as well as a need to be busy or engaged in physical activities. The impulsiveness or poor inhibition persists throughout childhood into adulthood and may be manifest verbally (excessive talking, interrupting others, blurting out answers before questions are finished, saying what's on your mind without regard to its consequences, etc.) or physically, as in doing things on impulse or a dare. Those with ADHD are often more involved in risk-taking activities and, as a consequence, suffer 2–4 times the rate of accidental injuries as do unaffected children or adults.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> A newly identified subset of children now classified as having ADHD are called the Predominantly Inattentive Type and may often appear to be day dreamy, spacey, confused, in a fog, staring frequently, slow moving, sluggish and hypo-active. Researchers call these children Sluggish Cognitive Tempo but this is not a commonly used diagnostic label.

<dd><b>From Causes</b></dd>
<dd>It has been demonstrated that children who have at least one parent diagnosed with ADHD are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD. Studies show that a parent with ADHD is eight times more likely to have a child with ADHD than a parent who does not. A child with ADHD is seven times more likely to have a sibling with the disorder than a child who does not have ADHD. The concordance between identical twins if one has the disorder is 78%.&lt;<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>&gt;</dd>

<dd>Careful assessment must include indices of IQ scores and adaptive functioning screens. This is essential since many children and adolescents are incorrectly diagnosed as having ADHD or ADD when, in fact, their principal problems are a direct result of Borderline Intellectual Functioning (IQ 70-85) and impaired adaptive skills. Kaplan &amp; Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, 8th Ed., 2005, devotes Chapter 26.3 to a detailed review with clinical illustrations and proposed treatments (Ninivaggi 1999, 2005).This precludes the use of psychostimulant medications, which often complicate the clinical presentation.</dd>

<dd><b>From Positive Aspects</b></dd>
<dd>Some argue that ADHD does not necessarily slow down a person's learning process. However, all longitudinal studies of ADHD children followed to adulthood find them, on the aggregate, to be significantly less educated than control groups of children followed over the same period of time, (see Weiss and Hechtman, 1993, Hyperactive Children Grown Up, new York: Guilford, guilford.com). Some argue this is due to an educational system which focus on organization and long lectures that handicap ADHD individuals, which may lead one with ADHD to receive less formal education despite possessing high intellect. Clearly certain individuals have benefited greatly from ADHD. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Flatley_b0cb.html" title="Michael Flatley">Michael Flatley</a>, originator of <i><a href="../../../r/i/v/Riverdance.html" title="Riverdance">Riverdance</a></i>, was diagnosed with ADHD during his childhood in Chicago. He was also a golden glove boxer. He has also repeatedly walked out on situations where people in charge tried to tell him what to do.</dd>
</dl>
<p>To see ADHD positively may seem somewhat problematic to anxious parents but it is at least a perspective that should be kept in mind. With or without <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperfocus.html" title="Hyperfocus">hyperfocus</a>, a common manifestation, ADD/ADHD in combination with successful <a href="../../../c/o/p/Coping_skill.html" title="Coping skill">coping skills</a> may be utilized to achieve remarkable accomplishments in some people.

<dd>Among the individuals often listed is comedian <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Williams_a8f4.html" title="Robin Williams">Robin Williams</a>, whose spontaneous humor, hyperactive manner, and other noted behavior (not all constructive) have combined to earn the him the label "<a href="../../../p/o/s/Poster_child.html" title="Poster child">Poster child</a> for AD(H)D." Notwithstanding inspirational value, cited by critics is the fact that Williams' personal medical records are not public information, so including him and many others found on such lists falls below reasonable criteria for validity. (More to the point, the public behavior of Robin Williams does not resemble ADHD. The pressured speech, punning, and flight of ideas found in mania are a closer fit, but the above considerations apply.)</dd>

<p>Not sure what I want to do with this yet, so I'm sticking it here until I decide. <s>Most</s> Some of this <s>will</s> might be reincorporated in some form.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some experts theorize that ADHD is under-diagnosed in girls, since their symptoms tend to be less dramatic than those in boys and thus draw less attention from parents and teachers. This may be due to a lower likelihood of aggressive and antisocial behavior in girls and possibly a higher incidence of the inattentive type of ADHD among girls. Even girls with hyperactivity, however, are under-detected because their hyperactivity might manifest in non-physical ways, such as excessive talking.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Others (e.g. Singh <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup>) explain the difference as being due to a lower tolerance of the normal range of boys' behavior that has developed in the past fifty years. That is, they claim that many boys are diagnosed with ADHD who do not, in fact, meet the diagnostic criteria but have attracted attention for other reasons. More rigorous <a href="#diagnosis" title="">diagnosis</a> would lower the incidence in boys to that of girls.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Speculation exists to explain the higher diagnostic quota in the U.S. One theory suggests that due to the high-risk traits of ADHD-affected people, it can be suggested that there was a higher prevalence for ADHD in the immigrants heading for America in former centuries than in the general population. No evidence exists at the moment to support such a popular idea. And it is becoming increasingly evident that ADHD can be found in equally high rates of countries with far less migratory patterns, such as in Japan and China.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another explanation put forward by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Narcotics_Control_Board_87dd.html" title="International Narcotics Control Board">International Narcotics Control Board</a> is that the increased incidence in the U.S. can, in part, be explained by the fact that the U.S. permits direct marketing of ADHD drugs to the general public whereas most other countries do not.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is also possible that social and other factors may underlie ethnic and gender differences. For example, obstacles to ADHD treatment are higher in the African-American and female populations<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>. Cultural factors also inhibit treatment being sought.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since most explanations of the disorder are expressed in biological terms (see <a href="#Possible_causes" title="">#Possible causes</a>) the incidence should not vary between communities or countries when adjusted for possible factors such as smoking during pregnancy. However some research has, found that such differences do exist. Jensen et al <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> studied children in four U.S. communities finding that only 12.5% of children diagnosed with ADHD had been treated with stimulants but that the incidence of diagnosis, while averaging 5.1% (roughly the <a href="../../../d/s/m/DSM-IV_1fd8.html" title="DSM-IV">DSM-IV</a> prediction) varied from 9.4% in Atlanta, Georgia to 1.6% in Puerto Rico. They also found that the incidence was higher in urban than rural communities and higher in more affluent than less affluent.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yet another theory, links the statistical difference mainly to a higher problem awareness and competence in the U.S. due to the longer research and public acquaintance with ADHD. Although all of these theories have some support, many are debated. At present most research focuses on broadly medical issues with very little probing possible social and economic explanations of the observed differences.</dd>

<p>Thank you for asking for my input. I can see you and others have done a lot of work on this difficult subject.</p>
<p>I do have a few comments:</p>
<p>In your paragraph on nutrition as a treatment, the sentence remains:</p>
<pre>
 Granted, according to a recent meta-analysis, there is little scientific 
 evidence for the effectiveness of the Feingold diet in treating ADHD specifically
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, I do not have the full text of this report. However, in Schnoll's meta review, the abstract itself states:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is multidetermined and complex, requiring a multifaceted treatment approach. Nutritional management is one aspect that has been relatively neglected to date. Nutritional factors such as food additives, refined sugars, food sensitivities/allergies, and fatty acid deficiencies have all been linked to ADHD. <b>There is increasing evidence that many children with behavioral problems are sensitive to one or more food components that can negatively impact their behavior.</b> Individual response is an important factor for determining the proper approach in treating children with ADHD. <b>In general, diet modification plays a major role in the management of ADHD and should be considered as part of the treatment protocol.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Increasing evidence" is not the same as "little evidence" .....</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I wrote to Dr. Schnoll for her comment, and she answered, "The comment that the studies conducted did not eliminate all the foods listed on the Feingold diet was correct, but more importantly, the amounts of food dye and additives that were tested did not even come close to what children consume in a typical diet."</li>
</ul>
<p>May I suggest, as wording: According to a recent meta-analysis, there has been little scientific evidence for the effectiveness of the Feingold diet in treating ADHD specifically, but this could be because most of the research has focused only on food dyes, in amounts far below what children consume in a typical diet, and the diet eliminates much more than that.</p>

<li>It can also be argued that this is not necessarily genetic but caused by vaccine damage since vaccines are given in infancy, before the brain has matured. Dr. Mary Megson in her presentation to Congress which you can see <a href="http://www.diet-studies.com/megson.html" class="external text" title="http://www.diet-studies.com/megson.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> claims that ADHD is a type of vaccine damage ....she talks also about children whose moms have night blindness, indicating a G-protein problem, which she says is a risk factor for autism or ADHD resulting from vaccines -- in other words, maybe our genetic research should be aimed at identifying those children at risk for sensitivity to additives or vulnerability to vaccine damage (or both), rather than continuing to give one-size-fits-all treatment to babies and blaming "genetics" for the damage done. When we talk about genetics here, we forget one thing -- there is no way to have an epidemic of a genetic disorder, unless we have done something in the environment to impact a (previously harmless) genetic variance. .... well, this is not encyclopedic, just ranting, but maybe there is something in there you can use.</li>

 solution. Thus far, no reputable research has appeared to support either 
 of these claims, except in cases of malnutrition.
</pre>
<p>Thus, in a couple of sentences, this paragraph denigrates B6, zinc, and vitamins. Not only does it say that there is NO REPUTABLE RESEARCH but the tone is negative and biased - sounds like the Quackbusters have been here.</p>
<pre>
B6 (and other vitamins):
</pre>
<ul>
<li>First, about B6, there is actually quite a bit of research. Dr. Rimland once told me that there were 18 consecutive studies showing that B6+Mg was helpful, and there were no studies showing it was harmful. I cannot document that, at the moment, but I will get back to you on it later. Meanwhile, you can see what he wrote about <a href="http://www.autism.org/vitaminb6.html" class="external text" title="http://www.autism.org/vitaminb6.html" rel="nofollow">B6 for autism</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is the Harding 2003 study on vitamin supplements working as well as Ritalin. See it <a href="http://www.diet-studies.com/adhd.html#Harding2003" class="external text" title="http://www.diet-studies.com/adhd.html#Harding2003" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Remember that B6 is a cofactor in the making of neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and orepinephrine ...

Zinc
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Back in 1979, <a href="http://www.diet-studies.com/adhd.html#Brenner77" class="external text" title="http://www.diet-studies.com/adhd.html#Brenner77" rel="nofollow">Brenner</a> reported that kids with ADHD had different trace minerals.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you go to MedLine and do a search for "zinc adhd" you will find 16 studies and reviews in prestigious journals. It is certainly not right to say there has been <i>no reputable research</i>
<ul>
<li>See the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16190793&amp;query_hl=14&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" class="external text" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16190793&amp;query_hl=14&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" rel="nofollow">Arnold 2005 review</a> in which he says "Numerous controlled studies report cross-sectional evidence of lower zinc tissue levels (serum, red cells, hair, urine, nails) in children who have ADHD, compared to normal controls and population norms."</li>

<p>Other alternatives such as Ginko biloba .... again, it says there is NO RESEARCH. Since I have found research in a quick search of MedLine, I don't think we can say that.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Views on Parenting</span></h3>
<p>I noticed that the views on parenting section was left, dispite the fact that the entire section does not cite its sources. I suggest that the section be deleted two weeks from now (June 16, 2006) unless there are any objection to allow it to remain longer. 4.249.84.35 05:45, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>I object!</i> I suggest that it remain because it represents the logic behind another perspective that many feel is crucial to a fair presentation of the issues. The contents of the citation mentioned in that section covers many of these criticisms. Limiting such discussion to an anti ADHD page, even if mentioned in this article, fails to do justice to this point of view. Although I recognize that this section (written mainly by me, Simon Sobo, MD) strays from the predominant point of view in my profession I strongly feel that it is a valid perspective that is being dismissed a little too easily. It is almost impossible to have this point of view represented in the major journals, but as I note elsewhere, I am not a nut and have the support of many in the profession who feel similarly. The contents of the section repeatedly emphasize that it is controversial, and make no attempt to falsify information. Citations have an important purpose in allowing readers to track down sources to make sure the information being presented is not false, but they are not an end in themselves. The issue is the transparency of how information is arrived at and is generally a good thing, but it also can contribute to group think, so that information can be screened by "experts". I know that sounds awfully paranoid, but we are talking about an issue here that involves billions upon billions of dollars spent on care, so objectivity is truly a problem.</dd>

<dd><b>Keep</b> This may be the one and only time where Dr. Sobo and I are in agreement, but I too believe the section is necessary to the article's balance. I even support most of what he has written, although I don't agree with a word of it (but lets not argue about that here). However I do object to his use of quotation marks. I find their usage insulting, and I do not believe that their use is in accordance with a neutral point of view. I also do not like how it refers to the rest of the article. Dr. Sobo, this is an encyclopedia, and encyclopedia articles do not refer to themselves. <a href="../../../2A/k/a/User%7E_Kat__e754.html" title="User:*Kat*">*Kat*</a> 10:13, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Or perhaps this editorial about journal objectivity in the NEJM by then editor Marcia Angell will be helpful <a href="http://www.mindfully.org/Health/Academic-Medicine-Sale18may00.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.mindfully.org/Health/Academic-Medicine-Sale18may00.htm" rel="nofollow">Is Academic Medicine for Sale</a>. It is noteworthy that Dr. Angell felt so strongly about this issue that she went on to write a book about this subject. She has since been repeatedly portrayed as some kind of nut in order to discredit her point of view. One has to wonder how the editor of the NEJM could ever be characterized this way, except she has dared to take on the powers that be. In my article there are also references to an article by the editor of the Lancet along similar lines.</p>
<p>So yes when there are billions of dollars involved objectivity becomes difficult to maintain and "experts" are not always what they seem.</p>
<p>I believe the user offering to delete the section on parenting is innocent of foul motives and is simply trying to be "scholarly". But why is the insistence on citations and the desire to delete this section being pursued by a person who is invisible. This user name thing was explained to me on the talk page but I still don't get it. Exactly what does the above user know about ADHD and why is this so important to him/her.

<p>I will try to find a better way to express my utter disgust for the use of that word and the attempt to imtimidate and impress most doctors. They are busy people trying to do a good job and when someone teaches at a good school and is presented as an "expert" they often fall into line. If you could only see the literally pounds of verbiage that comes to my office each week trying to sell a diagnosis and pharmaceutical treatments all in the name of "experts" recommendations. It is truly a wizard of oz phenomenon. Now mind you there are good meds out there and the drugs companies lately need defending, because the pendulum has swung too far, but I can't stand the lack of integrity of these professors and the group think that so many in my profession have fallen in to. See my reference to Marci Angell above as confirmation of this particular rant.</p>

They pay enormous amounts of money to professors, control journals, conferences and deluge doctors with mailings of free journals that constantly refer to experts. Since the professors hold prestigious positions in very fine universities this doesn't seem at first that preposterous but it is. I keep adding references to the article about how little is known (the NIH consensus statement, Castellanos statements, the absurd Zametkin pictures of the brain.) and about the distortions (see the reference to Dr. Pelham,Dr Angell's book, and the editor of Lancet rant in the New York Review of Books If I can find the Wall Street Journal article which documented the % of continuing education funds paid for by drug companies that will highlight my point All of it is presented as "science" or "evidence based medicine" etc . But good scientists talk about what we don't know and where the controversies are, not "hear this I am an expert" That is why I am comparing it to The Wizard of Oz, and trying to expose "experts" for what they are</p>
<p>AS for referring people to my article in a more dignified encyclopedia style fashion I am open to suggestions, but frankly I am taking on an awful lot of powerful people who have their views regularly confirmed, circulated and reinforced by repetition. So if the purpose of this article is to inform I feel stylistic considerations should be secondary. Once again, however, if there is a good editor out there who can help me accomplish my purpose to inform the public and slow down the run away freight train which ADHD treatment has become please don't be shy and show me what you can do.</p>

<dd>Nonetheless, the author misses on the evident problems of persistent mid- to long-term focus when there are no immediate rewards in the activities themselves, the high propability of social failures, and the fact that even with rewarding activities focus is not under control of the person affected by ADHD.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Lets not have another intra-article arguement. If the rest of the article doesn't make this point, then the point can't be made.--<a href="../../../2A/k/a/User%7E_Kat__e754.html" title="User:*Kat*">*Kat*</a> 06:58, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../s/s/0/User%7ESs06470_d20e.html" title="User:Ss06470">Ss06470</a> 11:11, 5 June 2006 (UTC) While it is true that <i>often</i>, even with rewarding activities, focus is not under the control of the person affected by ADHD. But the problem with this observation is that it assumes that offering a reward will do the trick. There is no question kids with ADHD may start out wanting to concentrate especially, say, if a reward is offered, but they may fail when they get into their customary difficulties when challenged (by the burden of the work required of them). Nevertheless, I would argue that reward is somehow involved in their difficulties, specifically a difficulty dealing with not fun, frustrating tasks Here is a short quote from my article on this subject.</p>
<p><i>Chances are if you ask one of these children how they do with video games most will tell you they have no problem. Hour after hour they can sit totally attentive, totally focused, totally absorbed by these games. This should not be the case if there is a biological interference with concentration. Very often these kids are said to have eye-hand coordination problems (supporting the argument for a biological basis) as illustrated by their sloppy penmanship and also psychological testing shows this to be the case. But video games require an amazing amount of dexterity. Why is there no impairment here?</i></p>
<p><i>I treated a teen-ager who told me that he could not read without his medication. His eyes glazed over, he could go over a page a hundred times and nothing would be absorbed. During summer vacation he stopped his meds, except when he had to read something for school. I asked if he ever read anything else, something not required for school. He told me he didn’t but then remembered one exception. He loved mountain biking. Each month when his mountain biking magazine arrived he tore through it, reading every word, cover to cover. He did not require medication to do this.''</i></p>
<p>Many of the children I have spoken to do okay in one school subject and not another. Sometimes they are simply gifted in this area, so that it comes very easily year after year. But many of them do well in one subject one year and another subject the next year depending on how charismatic the teacher is.</p>
<p>While the successful teacher does not offer rewards per se, his/her gift is a reward. This may come from an entertaining style, but also some teachers manage to engage their students (including ADHD students) with the relevance of their subject so that it is no longer boring or as much of an unpleasant task</p>
<p>Finally Castellanos' (then head of ADHD research at the NIMH) Frontline speculations on how stimulants work is worth noting. “ <i>It used to be said that dopamine (which stimulants cause to be enhanced) was the reward chemical--that if something was rewarding, then you would release dopamine. It turns out to be more complicated than that. It's not just whether something's going to feel good, or be rewarded; it's more if there's a possibility that something would feel good.</i> If an animal knows that they're going to be rewarded when they correctly do a task, then dopamine is no longer involved. But when the animal thinks that maybe this is the way to solve the task, dopamine is leading the way, saying, "This, try this, try this."</p>

Exactly why should that make you sick? Some of my ADHD patients never come back when they hear my point of view, but many are relieved to learn that their brain may not be physically broken after all. Some tell me that they think of their special ed classmates as "retards" and hated being told they were born with ADHD. They simply refused to accept it. I can't imagine a worse verdict, particularly as a child, than if I had been told told that something was wrong with my brain. That I was born that way. The diminished expectations that I would challenge myself with, not to mention my teachers and partents not expecting too much would easily become a self fulfilling prophecy. I can't tell you how many times at moments of uncertainty I started to wonder if I had what it takes to be a doctor. That is even after being a Phi Bete student? What if I had been told I had ADHD? I realize it would be very cruel to tell some one with MS in a wheel chair to get out of the chair and play baseball like everyone else. So if ADHD <i>is biological</i> what I am arguing could be comparable. But even then, you will discover those who refuse to be held back by their impairments often do better than those who find it comforting. It is not my call, but a patient's and I would not think less of a person if they can't muster that stubborness. But I would hope for it for their sake. Anyway, with ADHD the issue is a little more subtle. The bottom line is that I think it is crucial, if I am right, to not go away and allow the biological people to spread their certainties based on the facts (which is that we do not know the answer to this important question.) I do appreciate that you are fair minded enough to consider the importance of a point of view that you don't agree with. At least that is a beginning.</p>

<dd>I would like to also respectfully point out that we helped establish an entirely separate article (and include in this article a reference link to it) for the express purpose to be sure that there is plenty of room for discussion for those who have the "it doesn't even exist" belief to express themselves, present supporting information, and in general be heard. So, I feel that tagging the article itself as having a POV or neutrality problem would be wrong. I truly believe that the issue is that we do not all agree about the subject, not that there is an unfairness in presentation(s). There is so much to be learned on this subject that any credible information deserves to be presented; that way, our readers can form their own conclusions about the subject itself. <a href="../../../v/a/o/User%7EVaoverland_3ef2.html" title="User:Vaoverland">Vaoverland</a> 03:21, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>ss06470 I've taken the liberty of changing the description of Zametkins brain image. It incorrectly stated that the subjects were children.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Parental Role</span></h2>
<p>I have multiple problems with this section. This section does not cite its sources. This section is in violation of NPOV, including the parts which mention that the section is "According to one point of view”. This point of view is not significant enough to include in the article if it cannot be cited. Only two points of view are significant regardless; the view of the majority (or at least plurality) and the view of the relevant medical community. I greatly suspect that this section is the result of original research. Contradictory statements are made in the two paragraphs in this section; arguments should be made on the talk page, rather than in the text of the article. Finally this section refers to the ADHD article itself, something which should never happen. The second paragraph attacks the request for citations in first paragraph! All (in my opinion), or at least parts of this section, should be deleted. I suggest that the uncited information should be deleted after 2 weeks unless there are objects, and that the rest of the section should be fixed as soon as possible. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_conway_bcc_10d2.html" title="User:William conway bcc">William conway bcc</a> 00:10, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

There is no question that the style could be improved but the content is important. By the way, I have no illusion that my position, and the position of many similar minded people is a minority position among professionals, and all major organizations are lined up behind the biological model, but before you delete this I think you should address the content concerns raised by the article. Yes it is in opposition to mainstream thinking but the logic and questions being raised are powerful ones. That this should be cut and the crazy (sorry scientology people, food additive people , etc etc) stuff left is extraordinary but not surprising.

If you have objections to the current section please let me know and I will try to work with you for improvement</p>
<dl>
<dd>The section has been improved, but the first six lines still need citations. The claim is made that evidence shows this or that. If evidence does show that “parents of ADHD children experience more stress and depression, give more commands, spend less leisure time with their children, and vacillate between lax and harsh punishment” then this should not be difficult to cite. Also most of my objection was to sentences such as “although it has not been scientifically proven to the satisfaction of people who have been declared to be experts in the field,” I suggest this be rewritten as; although it has not been scientifically proven to the point of satisfaction. There are other <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_words_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words">problems like this</a> that I am concerned about. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_conway_bcc_10d2.html" title="User:William conway bcc">William conway bcc</a> 03:49, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The key issue is that there are people who claim to be speaking about what is scientific known when, in fact, that isn't the case at all. Some adhere to strict protocols but then make wild generalizations about very iffy data. I have tried to demonstrate some of the fallacies with the Zametkin picture of the brain which has been used again and again as a picture that proves the issue is biological yet all it shows is that ADHD patients were not using the part of the brain that is involved in concentrating on a task. Gee what a surprise. Castellanos conclusions about the smaller cerebellum in ADHD children seems to be valid. He is convinced the problem is biological but he is honest about how little is known and I respect him. The smaller cerebellum could easily be the result of using the brain differently which ADHD people clearly do but that does not mean the problem is biological (see the discussion in the article) So as I state repeatedly science does not have the answers, despite claims to the contrary, and the love affair doctors have for scientific approaches. I have the same love of science, but I respect true scientists who are clear about what is known and not known. So if the answers are by no means clarified by science, I think other approaches to explain the syndrome are valid and should not be dismissed too easily, especially because they represent the common sense view of parents and educators for centures. If you have kids you know they have to be taught early and repeatedly to stay on task, do their homework, remember to bring it home, put up with boring subjects and teachers, sit still, get on line when asked to do so, wait their turn and so on through the list of ADHD symptoms. It doesn't come naturally. Could there be certain kids who are not able to integrate the pressures placed on them into purposive behavior because there is something wrong bioloically. Definitely some of them. Could there be biological factors that are not well understood but neverhtheless there. Probably. But we are leaping ahead without any scientific basis if we claim millions upon millions of children are born with ADHD. So to stress that parental roles are an important factor but is not supported by science puts a criticism there that is uncalled for.</p>
<p>What we are witnessing is a pendulum swing in the paradigm. When I began in psychiatry 35 years ago no one dared criticize Freud. Now no one dares to claim parents play a key role. The only environmental issues allowed in the discussion are toxins, fetal trauma, vitamins, food additives, etc. The extreme turn around is absurd, more like an ideological war than reasonable inquiry. Psychoanalysts once controlled academia (and they were no more open minded). Biological psychiatrists were on the out. When they gained control it was psychoanalysts turn to be out of a job, and their point of view, in essence, banned.</p>
<p>To repeat I welcome true scientific understanding when it will come, but I have no respect for "science" as a blinder that excludes important points of view, and somehow claims that it is the only true way to view phenomena when the science simply isn't there Please see the difficulites one researcher had from the journals when he suggested that pediatricians should do more than hand out pills.<a href="http://www.alternet.org/drugreporter/20594/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alternet.org/drugreporter/20594/" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>(See "it was like a whitewash") His innocent little statement that they cut would have completely undermined drug companies focused advertising that tells pediatrians to hand out Ritaline to ttheir patients and not to worry. They are treating by scientific principles. Also note my comments about the lack of objectivity in "experts" point of view scattered throughout the article and discussions. I keep harping on that term "experts" because it is an intellectually inappropriate self description when the facts of the matter are that modesty should be more appropriate when ignorance is the true state of affairs for everyone. That, plus doctors are relentlessly bombarded by the opinion of "experts" and this has the effect of intimidating the average doctor. (malpractice fears for missing the diagnosis are high-some of the mailings directly imply there will be malpractice implications) The whitewash article gives you a taste of how serious drug companies are about getting their point of view across. Also see the discussion of the the editor of the NEJM editorial <a href="http://www.mindfully.org/Health/Academic-Medicine-Sale18may00.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.mindfully.org/Health/Academic-Medicine-Sale18may00.htm" rel="nofollow">Is Academic Medicine for Sale</a> With literally billions of dollars involved in these issues, this one time where conspiracy theories are appropriate. Also see the discussion of the the editor of the NEJM editorial (Is academic medicine for sale). In other discussions I have reference similar comments by the editor of Lancet (the British eqivalent of NEJM) It is also noteworthy that Dr Angell felt so strongly about this issue that she went on to write a book about it, following which she was often portrayed as some kind of nut. It may also interest you that, as background to my involvement, I might add that I defend drug companies <a href="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/330/7481/7" class="external autonumber" title="http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/eletters/330/7481/7" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>when I feel they are getting a bum wrap (like lately)Moreover, I have been asked to write for phony organizations supported by scientolgists and also to write for Peter Breggin who I feel is far too critical of medications. I have turned both down. I am not a saint and I am sure I am wrong about some of my observations but it is pretty amazing how difficult it is to maintain an independent voice. I am, for instance eventually going to give up on this site since unfortunately, I don't have the time to keep reinstating a fair discussion of the issues. But I hope my discussions have given you a taste of the ferocious forces involved and the difficulty of getting unbiased information out to the public.</p>

<p>Dear Simon, I wonder if you've read my book 'Naughty Boys: Anti-Social Behaviour, ADHD and the Role of Culture'? Your thoughts on the subject are not too far away from mine. I really enjoyed your article, particularly the weaving together of personal narrative and academic enquiry. Would you be willing to put together an abbreviated version (max. 10,000 words) of your article as a chapter for a book that myself and Jonathan Leo are putting together- trying to bring together a cross-section of critiques of ADHD from differing perspectives? I think in paticular a focus on the movement from religious morality to 'fun' morality and the relevance of Freudian theories of instinct would be most welcome (we need someone who is capable of providing some relevant exploration of psychodynamic aspects of the development of attention/impulsivity). In case you might be intrested, I have also attached our stylistic guidelines (Although we are asking for chapters by the end of august, obviously we would be happy to give you more time as this is a relatively late request). Our proposal has been accepted for publication be Palgrave-MacMillan. Look forward to hearing from you. Best wishes,</p>

For reference, my diagnosis with ADD was made AFTER I first started wearing glasses, not before. If you're looking for a link between vision imparment(sp?) and ADD though I think there's something there, kind of. Were it not for a friend of mine having recently gotten glasses at the time -- and me and the other friends doing the typical "oo, what's the world look like with those things on" kid thing -- I never would have figured out that my vision was getting worse.

<dd>Though ADHD is classified as a serious disorder, some people have a different perspective and note the positive aspects. They argue that ADHD children tend to look at situations in a different manner, and that those with ADD tend to look beyond the norm. "While the A students are learning the details of photosynthesis, the ADHD kids are staring out the window and pondering if it still works on a cloudy day" (Underwood). Some children might be uneasy about getting into a situation. One positive side of impulsive behavior is the ability to try new things without trepidation. This can be a strength and a weakness: "Impulsivity isn't always bad. Instead of dithering over a decision, they're willing to take risks" (Underwood).</dd>

<dd>I must disagree with your assessment of the inclusion of third-party quotations as they relate to fair-use policy: if you could point me to a Wikipedia policy page which states that quotations are limited in length, I would greatly appreciate that; it is my understanding that Wikipedia policy does allow for quotations to be included in articles, properly cited, I'm sure we are in agreement on this. The length of a properly cited quotation, however, is, to my knowledge not limited by policy or statute, rather, the intent of the writer who included the material, as well as the substance, novelty and authorship of the quoted source are taken into consideration when making decisions regarding fair use issues.</dd>
<dd>I believe that the quotation in question here does not violate fair use or other policies based on its length, rather the quote is not cited properly (no quotation marks, no links, no lead-in with reference to original author, etc), on the other hand, the site from which it is quoted also fails to properly cite the source of the material (no author is mentioned, no links or other references are provided). Unless any given work (in any medium) is a <i>new creation / inventive</i> (such as lyrics to a new song) and not simply a statement of already known facts (such as a mathematical formula, the speed of light, the diameter of the earth, or the definition of the term '<a href="../../../s/o/n/Song.html" title="Song">song</a> <a href="../../../l/y/r/Lyrics.html" title="Lyrics">lyrics</a>'), it does not qualify for copyright protection under applicable law (see <a href="../../../o/b/v/Obviousness.html" title="Obviousness">obviousness</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_copyright_law_7d4d.html" title="United States copyright law">United States copyright law</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a>).</dd>
<dd>Fortunately, however, we are <i>in agreement</i>, that the source material is of questionable <a href="../../../v/e/r/Veracity.html" title="Veracity">veracity</a> to begin with, making the fair use discussion but a moot point; I recommend summarizing the material and avoiding this reference due to lack of credibility.

<p><i>Because most of the medications used to treat ADHD are Schedule II under the U.S. DEA schedule system, and are considered powerful stimulants with a potential for diversion and abuse, there is controversy surrounding prescribing these drugs for children and adolescents. However, research studying ADHD sufferers who either receive treatment with stimulants or go untreated has indicated that those treated with stimulants are in fact much less likely to abuse any substance than ADHD sufferers who are not treated with stimulants.[24]</i></p>

<p>I don't see any connection between Dr. Heinrich Hoffman, Struwwelpeter and ADHD; and I don't think Dr. Hoffman's intention was anything more serious than to write an amusing children's story.--House of Usher 17:02, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>1845. ADHD was first alluded to by Dr. Heinrich Hoffmann, a physician who wrote books on medicine and psychiatry, Dr. Hoffman was also a poet who became interested in writing for children when he couldn't find suitable materials to read to his 3-year-old son. The result was a book of poems, complete with illustrations, about children and their characteristics. "Die Geschichte vom Zappel-Philipp" (The Story of Fidgety Philip) in Der Struwwelpeter was a description of a little boy who could be interpreted as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. <a href="http://www.fln.vcu.edu/struwwel/philipp_e.html" class="external free" title="http://www.fln.vcu.edu/struwwel/philipp_e.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fln.vcu.edu/struwwel/philipp_e.html</a> Alternatively, it may be seen as merely a moral fable to amuse young children at the same time as encouraging them to behave properly.</i></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Regarding biomedical analysis of ADD/ADHD</span></h2>
<p>The article does a good job in mentioning that the disease cannot be identified from any biological tests, and that subjective tests are used instead. However, it needs to make the connection with the fact that drugs are typically applied as a solution. That is, without being able to identify the disease from a chemical test, we are nevertheless applying a chemical solution. This is highly illogical -- in the realm of physics if I applied an electromagnetic solution to something that I couldn't demonstrate as having electric and magnetic components, then you would chalk me up as incompetent. Likewise, the prescription of drugs to solve ADHD is a glaring indicator that scientific method is not being strictly adhered to in this case.</p>

<p>I am removing the following text: <i>If, as some theorists claim, ADHD is not a single biological condition, but an inability to "get with the program" from whatever cause, then the outlook for these children is obviously variable. It often is linked with conduct disorder and may be the beginning of a life of irresponsibility and possibly crime. It may also be the beginning of a creative career that creates its own "program." Many children with ADHD flounder until they find something they love to do, or are inspired by a figure who teaches them the skills that are needed. And some never get there.</i></p>
<p>Removal of such a large portion of text deserves the following explanation. The first sentence is not related to positive aspects of ADHD. The second sentence describes a negative aspect. The third sentence is reliant of the first two sentences. The fourth sentence describes ways in which the disadvantages of ADHD can be overcome rather than a positive aspect. The fourth sentence is also not ADHD specific. The fifth sentence is reliant on the fourth sentence. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_conway_bcc_10d2.html" title="User:William conway bcc">William conway bcc</a> 01:27, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Another interesting example of great success with ADHD is <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Flatley_b0cb.html" title="Michael Flatley">Michael Flatley</a>, the man with the "Feet of Flames". Creator of <i>River Dance</i>, winner at 17 of the all-Ireland flute championship, and once a golden glove competitor, while growing up in Chicago Flatley was an ADHD-diagnosed Irish punk and charmer. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ss06470/ADHD.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/ss06470/ADHD.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Repeats</span></h2>
<p>This just goes to show that I'm not going insane (no pun or shades of malodorous meaning with that)... but the third paragraph in the Skepticism sub-section and the second in the Parental role are, but for a couple of words, the same. That probably shout be cleaned up or both redefined as from my reading the said idea (that it's the natural order of bored kids) could fit under both. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesk_Jockey_746d.html" title="User:Desk Jockey">Desk Jockey</a> 04:05, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It seems as though this repetition of information is probably an error. If you read the two sub-sections you can see that in the second paragraph of the Parental role section the first sentence speaks about the possibility that certain parenting methods may cause ADHD but then the second goes on to talk about ADHD being seen as a "natural" way for children to behave when they are stuck in a situation that doesn't engage them. There is conceptual confusion with this, so a rewrite or deletion of this paragraph altogether seems required. (Cf1 11:22, 29 August 2006 (UTC)) --69.37.244.31 11:14, 8 September 2006 (UTC) Here we go again! It is saying that the natural way for children to behave resembles the symptoms of ADHD unless parents can successfully guide them to different behavior. The conceptual confusions is yours and indicates to me that you probably don't have children. You might take a look at the abstract of my article to get a bit more focused.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggested additions--under control and cited!</span></h2>
<p>As with alcoholism, drug abuse, and other neurological spectrum disorders from bi-polar to Asperger's, I would suggest a section with citations on the likely and under-counseled effects of ADHD: on the family dimension--non-ADHD spouses and children and/or siblings; the high recorded incidence in prison populations; in divorce; in adoptive children (from impulsive accidental parent(s)); and the cumulative generational effect (ADHD parent(s) trying to raise ADHD kids, or in denial, or alerted to their own adult diagnosis vi the children), not to mention a stand-alone section on the co-morbid overlap and resulting difficulty in diagnosing and treating when presenting alongside with bi-polar, anxiety, depression, Tourette's, epilepsy, OCD, etc.</p>
<p>A mention of the national organizations and journals would be helpful.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There already are several references to the journals. I'm pretty sure that there are links to the organizations in the external links and references sections.--<a href="../../../2A/k/a/User%7E_Kat__e754.html" title="User:*Kat*">*Kat*</a> 11:15, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Also, helpful: a note re: the booming research and the percentage of medical doctors, specialists, neurologists, psychiatrists, and mental health counselors of all stripes who are "behind" on the ADHD research overall, the impact, the pharmacology, and misapplied or mistaken mainstream treatments--and as a reason for the few but highly publicized cases of misdiagnosis, or over- or mis-prescribing versus the thousands who go untreated.</p>
<p>"Controversies" should include not only a note re: alleged the financial boon of pharma companies as a spur to diagnosis, but on the other side the scattered anti-ADHD voices--potentially born of the undiagnosed or in-denial overcompensating ADHD superego, especially in males-- of those with ADHD with a personal bent to avoid or disprove the mainstream research, appealing to no-drug solution and miracle treatments without scientific backing. While speculative, this tendency is by definition and observation within the predictable reaction of those who feel threatened rather than relieved, non-empirical leftovers of the mental health treatment stigma.</p>

<dd>You make a valid point, but given this article's prior instability, I believe (strongly recommend in fact) that we work out the wording on a talk page or somewhere out of site. --<a href="../../../2A/k/a/User%7E_Kat__e754.html" title="User:*Kat*">*Kat*</a> 11:15, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
