<h2><span class="mw-headline">Loss of convenience links</span></h2>
<p>I notice that the section of the old WP:RS about convenience links (accessible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources&amp;oldid=112031857#Convenience_links" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources&amp;oldid=112031857#Convenience_links" rel="nofollow">here</a>) is not a part of the new policy. Is this intentional, or an oversight? It occurs to me that we should say something, either here or at WP:CITE, about the distinction between a source and a convenient link to it (or a reprint), and whether the latter should be included. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakew_2ade.html" title="User:Jakew">Jakew</a> 15:57, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Inflation adjusted numbers--Original Research or Reasonable Calculation?</span></h2>
<p>I recently listed in an article dollar amounts spanning several decades. I then also listed the inflation adjusted (or constant dollar) amounts with them and cited the inflation calculator used. That edit was removed (without discussion beyond saying "<b>WP:OR</b>". I understood the implied objection.</p>
<p>But after thinking about it and then reading the new Attribution policy section it sounds like this addition of constant dollar figures falls under, "straightforward mathematical calculations or logical deductions based on fully attributed data that neither change the significance of the data".</p>
<p>It seems that in the case of 'inflation adjusted figures', this calculation is more encyclopedic than not. The only problem I see is the possible inability to corroborate the adjustments, hence the inclusion of the calculator as a source as well.</p>

<dd>There are many ways to calculate historic prices, and which method to pick is a matter for experts. I don't see that this falls into the obvious deduction category. Even calculating meaningful present-day exchange rates is problematic. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 17:46, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even if FX isn't an issue, and for many articles it wouldn't be, what inflation measure to use is an issue itself. In the US, we have at least the following measures: Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), Chained Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U), The national CPI-U is published for 99 data segments: ranging from "All Items" down to "Personal computers and peripheral equipment" or "Tobacco and smoking products". All of these are available in both seasonally adjusted and non-adjusted series. The main public release has about 44 different geographic subdivisions of the CPI-U (some are published every other month). The BLS' generate your own data <a href="http://data.bls.gov/PDQ/outside.jsp?survey=cu" class="external text" title="http://data.bls.gov/PDQ/outside.jsp?survey=cu" rel="nofollow">tool</a> limits output to only 200 data series at a time, as they offer the cross product of 44 geographical segments * ~373 what bought segments * 2 seasonal adjusted/not segments = ~ 32,800 inflation data segments for the CPI-U. Add the other series they publish, and you are up to around 100,000 different inflation measures for the U.S. (The monthly press release covers a lot fewer of these, only about 99 of the what bought segments (full country only) and 30 of the geographic regions (all items only). The popular press usually mentions only CPI-U, all items, national and CPI-U, all items except food and energy, national.)</dd>
<dd>Similarly, Australia publishes data series for all eight of its capital cities, with segmentation into at least 13 purchasing groups - and that is just the press release, so they probably are publishing on the general order of 1,000 - 10,000 inflation measures for Australia. I don't know how many series the UK goverment publishes, but the one I use for work is named RPI<b>02</b> - so I know there is more than one. I've seen for work multiple series for France, but don't have them bookmarked.</dd>
<dd>Picking the inflation series to use is the original research. Even for an article specific to a single country, there are too many possible series to have a definite right answer. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 18:38, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not so sure... I don't think it is OR to use an accepted model for calculating constant dollars. To me this fits the "calculation" exception. As long as you specify which model was used, ("according to the Consummer Price Index" or some such statement) It <i>is</i> simple calculation after all... you just plug one number into the formula and get another number out the other end. To be completely NPOV, I suppose you could give the constant dollar prices per several of the more common methods... but I still don't see it as being OR. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 18:49, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The various indices are valid for various kind of purchases. I know that in the USA there are indices for producers, consumers, and wages, at the very least. Determining the appropriate index is original research. Now, if a reliable source determined which index was appropriate, but only did the calculation for selected years, I'd accept the argument that an editor could calculate constant dollars for years that fall within the years given in the reliable source. I wouldn't accept years outside the range given in the reliable source, because there could have been a change in how the index is compiled, or what alternative indices existed. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 19:04, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would think that it would be acceptable to state something such as "The building cost $2 million to build in 1979", as this would be verifiable fact?

<p>OK, for example in the Widget Prices article I want to put the average price of a widget in 1970 was $100 ($433.81 in <a href="http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl" class="external text" title="http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl" rel="nofollow">2000 constant dollars</a>) and the average cost in 2000 was $450. Obviously trying to keep the example short and simple...the link (if you hate clicking links like I do) is the CPI calculator from the US Dept of Labor.

<dd>I would love to show you the context but it was the victim of some nasty edit warring and I do not have the time to sort through edit histories for it. The context was on the Global Warming Controversy article in a pair of sections that are sometimes there and sometimes not, Funding of Skeptics and Funding of Supporters. One section had figures mostly from about 1995 to 2000. The other section had no figures. I began adding some which were from 1975 to the present and with those added the figures in constant dollars with the link to the calculator (wasn't DoL, I think it was statistical abstract or similar). I then added the constant dollar figures to those that were already there. They were all reverted within about 15 minutes and after pressing for an explanation they provided only a link to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Like I said, there is some pretty nasty edit warring there and has been for a few years. -- <a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_aboutme_96fb.html" title="User:Mnyakko/aboutme">Tony of Race to the Right</a> 02:46, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My view on this is that it ought to be ok to state inflation adjusted numbers so long as the original cost is stated, and if anybody a disputes the quanity a "reference" is made which states the method used to calculate the estimated cost. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 02:46, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Is this really policy?</span></h2>
<p>It looks very much as if this policy is a particular synthesis of a lot of individual Wikipedia working practices, though excludes many others. Looking through the archives, it looks to me as if there is a lack of consensus on a lot of the points (I personally am particularly concerned about the relevance of "truth" or accuracy, and the difference between "attributable" or "verifiable" and "attributed" or "sourced"), and that the statement that this is Wikipedia policy would fall foul of <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> itself. Indeed "Editors often make the mistake of thinking that if A is published by a reliable source, and B is published by a reliable source, then A and B can be joined together in an article in order to advance position C" applies precisely to what seems to have happened here. To me that makes it a <a href="../../../e/s/s/Wikipedia%7EEssay_1471.html" title="Wikipedia:Essay">Wikipedia:Essay</a> not a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicy_66bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Policy">Wikipedia:Policy</a>. --<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 20:10, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Most of the discussion was about a few types of issues: 1) do we make changes at the same time, and if so what - answer: no substantive changes, 2) how to merge the existing policies without changing the meaning, and 3) can we also merge in the guideline <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> - answer: nothing unique to that page here, put relevant bits in the FAQ. There was a lot of the discussion because changing policy documents isn't done lightly or quickly and a lot of time was spent making sure the actual policy was properly worded. In any role of life, some things become "magic words" and are very hard to change, even for the better. An example is the "verifiability, not truth" formulation from "Wikipedia:Verifiability", which has been replaced by a new formulation that means the same thing, but people object nonetheless because they are used to the old wording, poor as it was. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 20:39, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Verifiability, not truth" was a bad formulation anyway, since it was a self-contradiction that meant "Truth, not truth".

<dd>Henrygb - Something you have to remember is that consensus does not mean the same thing as unanimity. None of our policies have unanimous support, and there are always people who disagree with what it says. The two previous policy pages (WP:V and WP:NOR) from which this policy emerged had those who disagreed with individual provisions. So will this policy page. However, the vast majority of Wikipedians approve of this policy. That is called consensus.</dd>
<dd>I am confused by your statement that this policy does not follow itself... This isn't an article, so it doesn't have to. This policy applies to <i>Articles</i>, it does not apply to policy/guidleine pages. Nor does it apply to talk pages, user pages or the Village Pump. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 21:11, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

This new page is part of that drift - indeed it makes the change more explicit.

<dd>There's no drift, it's your interpretation that is wrong. "the goal of Wikipedia is to become a complete and accurate encyclopedia" does not have to equate with your assertion that "statements in articles should be verifiable (in the sense of checkable that they were true)". It would appear the policy draws a different meaning, stating that where an editor takes issue with an edit they should "check the sources. If you can confirm the statement using them, leave it in". This would suggest that it is not truth, as you assert, that was the goal, but accuracy. Accurate summary of source material, not positions which individual editors held to be true, a position the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy would appear to dictate editors should not do. That would be my reading of how that policy was written. Looking at it, I'd also note that is not how the Verifiability page started, there's over 18 months more of history before the edit you picked. Surreptitiously 01:19, 7 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Rather than argue over which version is the first, perhaps it would be neater to address the other point I made. That your interpretation of what accuracy means is in this instance incorrect. In this instance it refers to the representing of the source accurately, as seen by the quote I reproduced above. I would also note that asserting a statement as truth is in violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, which states <b>None of the views should be given undue weight or asserted as being the truth</b>.

<dd>I hope that the new, shorter document that people have worked on so hard will succeed (with some changes) in replacing the two other documents. There has to be a proper process for changing policy. There was an RfC, but it pointed to this page which stated that no policy was being changed -- they were simply being merged, and any actual changes would be done later. So, busy people may not have looked closely at the edits. In order to make significant changes to policy, there needs to be an RfC that leads to a policy discussion, not to a statement that no policy is being changed.</dd>
<dd>To change policy, there has to be more than just someone saying "there was consensus". There has to be an actual record of consensus. Consensus can exist when there is disagreement, if those who disagree waive their opposition.

<dd>I don't see where any rules were tightened or changed. Some of the wording was revised, but the intent and meaning behind what is said is exactly as it was under WP:V, WP:NOR and WP:RS.</dd>
<dd>What I think is happening here is that the merger has drawn <i>attention</i> to what these policies said all along... and some people are discovering that they disagree with some of the policy points. The entire "verifiability" vs. "attribution" as they relate to "truth" issue is a case in point. It is clear that what WP:V <i>meant</i> was that Wikipedia demanded that a statement be verifiable as to who said it, and that they did indeed say it. Verifiability in context of WP:V did not mean that a given statement was true... only that it had to be verifiable that it was stated by it's source, and that the statement accurately reflects what the source said. With the merger, the word "verifiablilty" was changed to "attributability" (or something along those lines) ... but the intent and meaning of the policy point is the same.</dd>
<dd>Something else to consider, in this current discussion, is that there have always been editors who did not like WP:V and WP:NOR to begin with... since those were longstanding policies, however, with long standing consensus they had little chance of changing them to fit their desires. With the merger, they are seeing a chance to do so... by claiming that this "NEW" policy does not have consensus. I reject that argument. Since this policy does indeed contain all of the policy points of the previous two, with the same intent and meaning that they had, the consensus they enjoyed carries over into this one. In short, nothing <i>has</i> changed... except perhaps peoples awairness of what the policies have said all along. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 15:04, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict). Agreed. The requirements Coppertwig proposes for documenting consensus go far beyond the mere existence of consensus, which is all that is required here. There is no "proper process" to document consensus as far as I can tell. As with every other WP page, editors show they have waived their opposition when they don't make substantial changes and when the question "are there any serious objections" doesn't generate any. That appears to be the case here. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 15:08, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(in response to Blueboar, re. drawing attention to policy) I think the issue is a little more fundamental than that. I think a large part of the problems we're seeing with people not liking WP:ATT stems from them misunderstanding WP:V. As I see it, a huge number of people have seen 'verifiability, not truth' as requiring both verifiability *and* truth, usually because they somehow feel that something can't be verifiable if it isn't true. But that's not how WP:V defined verifiability, and that use of a word to mean something slightly different from what it normally means seems to have mislead a lot of people into thinking the policy said something different from what it actually said. And this is one of the reasons I think this version is so great -- it is easier to understand, and we're just seeing the natural fallout of that now. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 15:14, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The fact that you are seeing fallout suggests that there is not a consensus now, and perhaps there was not before while verifiability was having its meaning changed away from the earlier and natural "capable of being checked to be true". I personally have no doubt that what is said now is not the same as what was being said in 2003 or 2005, and there are unanswered questions in the 11 archive talk pages here plus 17 at <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EVerifiability_44f5.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Verifiability">Wikipedia talk:Verifiability</a>; to me that is a common symptom of a suggested policy failing to achieve consensus. To give an example of my understanding of verifiability, I don't think anyone seriously doubts that the British won the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Trafalgar_eb4d.html" title="Battle of Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a> and so I think it does not need attribution (it is easily checked); there is less clarity over whether the British won the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Corunna_8c7e.html" title="Battle of Corunna">Battle of Corunna</a> (though fewer questions about the details of the battle) and here sourcing of statements is more helpful. --<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 19:33, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Two things. This page puts the source before the content and explicitly says "<b>any unsourced material may be removed</b>"; it makes no mention of the accuracy of the content, instead concentrating on the nature of the source. Secondly, I can find a secondary source challenging it (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 978-2258038400</a> in French) <i>"Curieuse «victoire», qui se traduisit par la morte de l'amiral de la flotte anglaise, Nelson, fauché par une balle tirée du</i> Redoutable<i>. Il faut avoir l'outrecuidance de nos amis d'Outre-Manche pour se vanter d'un tel désastre"</i>, roughly "Curious 'victory', which resulted in the death of Nelson, the admiral of the English fleet, mown down by a ball fired from the <i>Redoutable</i>. You need to have the impertinence of our friends across the Channel to praise yourselves for such a disaster", but this simply undermines the source, without affecting the validity of the statement that the British won.--<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 09:16, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which is exactly the same thing that Verifiability said -- right up at the top, "Editors adding new material should cite a reliable source, or it may be challenged or removed by any editor." The fact that sources contradict each other is irrelevant, it just means that you can "verify" (by the meaning described at Verifiability) things that aren't actually true. This doesn't help your point -- it just illustrates that sometimes it is hard to know what is true. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 10:00, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

We're not changing policy" and "Are there any major objections to classifying Wikipedia:Verifiability as no longer policy?" How long did people wait to see whether there were major objections? Were people given adequate time to inform themselves by reading through the archived discussions before beginning to express their objections? Who decided which objections were "major"? I have a major objection. Changing the whole purpose of the encyclopedia from trying to provide information that conforms to reality as much as possible, to a purpose of merely collecting published stuff regardless of whether it's typos and misstatements, is a major, fundamental change and requires further discussion. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 13:47, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Comment on secondary sources</span></h2>
<p>The policy states that "Secondary sources are documents or people that summarize other material, usually primary source material." - I am only going to comment on this statement. As an academic myself, I would dispute that secondary sources "summarize" primary sources. In fact, the more scholars summarize, the worse a book or article is because they are not presenting their own interpretation of the texts or historical events (this is primarily a problem in the humanities). The aim of secondary sources in the humanities is to provide an interpretation of events or of a set of texts (or both). SparkNotes and things of that ilk try to "summarize." <a href="../../../a/w/a/User%7EAwadewit_79ba.html" title="User:Awadewit">Awadewit</a> 00:56, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>(edit conflict) Because it is usually difficult to get something published on paper without a fair amount of editorial oversight, offline sources are often more reliable than online ones. (This is not always the case, see <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_publishers.html" title="Vanity publishers">vanity publishers</a>. Also some online sources can have perfectly good editorial oversight.) It can be frustrating for other users who are unable to look at the offline source and check your work, but so long as the source is reliable, they should <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">trust</a> you. However, since offline sources can be hard for others to check, I would recommend using <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cite.php" class="extiw" title="m:Cite.php">inline references</a> to make it as unambiguous as possible which information is based on the offline sources. Also try to provide the ISBN to make it easier for others to find the book. — <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armed Blowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>) 02:40, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would just like to note that most truly scholarly material in the humanities is going to be offline or inaccessible to the general public. Unfortunately, the databases that cover the major humanities journals are available only to those who have access to research libraries that subscribe to them (they are very expensive) and the most important work done in the humanities is almost always published in book form. If you want an excellent article on Jane Austen or Charles Dickens, for example, do not demand online sources. In my own editing on wikipedia, I have tried to follow the inline citation idea Armed Blowfish mentioned above, but it can get silly. See <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Wollstonecraft_e830.html" title="Mary Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft</a> and <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Laetitia_Barbauld_9649.html" title="Anna Laetitia Barbauld">Anna Laetitia Barbauld</a>. I also prefer offline sources since online sources can disappear and change (i.e. the information you cited may disappear from the page). Asking readers to dig up a cached version of the page is, in my opinion, irresponsible. <a href="../../../a/w/a/User%7EAwadewit_79ba.html" title="User:Awadewit">Awadewit</a> 03:27, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK hold on though, (I just found out about this discussion) we're not talking about "scholarly material" here, but allegations that Hitchens is an alcoholic and speculation that it's "getting the better of him". As this is sloat's replacement for poorly sources blogged insults which clearly violated BLP, it's reasonable to demand checkable citations to insure it's compliant. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmon_3172.html" title="User:Armon">&lt;&lt;-armon-&gt;&gt;</a> 02:36, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The idea of having a wikipedian ask another editor to review and add material that he/she came up with is not a way around NOR, but a work around to prevent Conflict of Interest. For example, an author may have published something that he/she feels is relevant to an article. Since there could be COI problems if he/she adds it him/herself, it is better for him/her to ask someone else to do so.

<dd>Thanks for the clarification. Now that you mention it, I remember the COI issue more clearly. So I guess what I did was pointless, I could just add the underlying sources to the article itself since they are all published by third-party reliable sources. I collected them all in one spot, but I suppose the act of collecting and presenting the information in a certain set format with interpretive clauses, would itself be considered OR. It's just a little annoying doing that work and then essentially having to do *part* of it all over to post each underlying citation here&#160;;) Thanks for your guys input. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 07:03, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm a little confused by this policy. Say wikipedia were lucky enough to have X, one of the foremost scholars on Y, contributing to an article on Y. Could they not cite their own scholarly works on Y, along with other scholars' works? In my field, English literature, scholars often cite their own work in this way (especially if they are writing a book that includes ideas from a previously published article). I just want to be sure I understand the policy so that when I become the foremost scholar on something, I'll know what to do.&#160;:) Seriously, we shouldn't discourage scholars from quoting their own works, particularly if they are significant. <a href="../../../a/w/a/User%7EAwadewit_79ba.html" title="User:Awadewit">Awadewit</a> 15:09, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We are usually unable to confirm that the self-proclaimed expert has the credentials he claims if he does not give his real life name on his user page. We just went through the embarrasment of a "noted theologian, PhD, professor of theology, and former department head" who in editing fell back on his credentials to argue others into submission, and who turned out to be an imposter with respect to the credentials.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Peer review</span></h2>
<p>Is "peer review" always a guarantee that a source is reliable? Should any source be automatically declared Reliable because it is peer reviewed, and should articles published in peer reviewed journals be given credibility based on the peer review? Along the same lines, is there any way of verifying that a publication that claims peer review actually does it, or what degree of scrutiny and rigor is used in a particular publication's peer review?</p>
<p>An association can publish a journal and say that it is peer reviewed - do we always accept that claim? A couple specific examples are things like the <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal_of_Scientific_Exploration_be24.html" title="Journal of Scientific Exploration">Journal of Scientific Exploration</a> and journal of the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_for_Psychical_Research_b637.html" title="Society for Psychical Research">Society for Psychical Research</a>. There is concern that "peer reviewed" is being used to give an inappropriate impression of scientific credibility at fringe topics such as <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_voice_phenomenon.html" title="Electronic voice phenomenon">Electronic voice phenomenon</a>. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 17:53, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Obviously peer review does not guarantee reliability in the usual sense of the word. Neither does it mean the source qualifies as a "reliable source" in the Wikipedia sense. An individual judgment must be made as to what is a "reliable source", based on the situation at hand. The phrase "peer review" is also vague and can refer to a range of kinds of review. Some journals consider that they are reviewing for plausibility. Some journals demand correctness and require referees to give a submission extensive checking. This should be kept in mind when considering whether "peer review" suffices to make something a reliable source in a specific context.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, as you pobably intend to point out, peer review can be a chimera when the association does not adhere to high standards. A paper published in the Journal of the American Mathematical Society can be expected to adhere to higher standards than one appearing in a small, "local" journal. Not only because the AMS is a very respected mathematical society, but this is their "flagship" journal, known to use rigorous refereeing. It also depends on the standards of the field. In pure mathematics, quality of refereeing (correctness) is highly correlated to the prestige a journal has (the other important factor is the importance of the results they publish). Even a very prestigious journal will take a hit in its prestige if they are found to publish a seriously wrong paper. This does not appear to be the case in all scientific disciplines. In some subjects, I get the impression that for even some good journals, if a wrong paper is published; the blame goes almost completely to the author(s), not the editors or referees.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I expect this is why the policy basically says to "use your head" so as not to be blinded by the use of buzz-words like "peer review". --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 18:15, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point of all of this is that <i>someone</i> other than the author stands behind the theory or ideas being presented.

<dd>The purpose of peer review is to reflect that the material has been prepared in a manner complying with the methods and beliefs of the organization or community conducting the peer review. Its value is only as good as the organization, and is not an assurance that it is true. There are are topics where people disagree on basic questions such as what way of thinking or inquiry one uses to arrive at truth; on those issues, the key point is to accurately describe each organization conducting the peer review to avoid misrepresentation. The Catholic church conducts peer review on Catholic theology to determine whether it reflects a genuinely Catholic point of view and arrives at truth using Catholic methods. Whether one believes it true or not depends on whether one accepts the assumptions underlying Catholicism. It is a nonetheless a kind of peer review, whether one believes in the outcome or not. Similarly, a newspaper assures the material has been reviewed by journalists and editors, whose methods sometimes aren't perfect either. --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 20:40, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Wjhonson, when you start posting to old/mothballed/historical pages, it creates a disruption because editors must now monitor multiple pages referring to the same topic, and because newcomers may mistakenly be attracted into a thread on an old page, not realizing it is obsolete.

<dd>Look, it's disruptive because it's causing <i>this</i> disruption, and there's no need for it. The problem with keeping the old talk page active is that new editors may see the discussion, not realize the policy has moved, and then things will be discussed there rather than here, meaning other editors have to monitor both pages, and on and on with yet more pointless time-wasting.

<dd>I find that argument circular. You punch me in the face, I complain, but somehow I should accept getting punched in the face. My complaint "don't punch me in the face" is disruptive. If the comments had been left alone, as they should have been, this discussion would never have started. If anything is disruptive it's what occurred to *start* this, which is the wiping out of the Talk page comments. That is disruptive to the smooth editing of the project. If those editors who wish to force us to not talk on that page i.e. censor us or suppress us would leave us alone instead, they would show that they are not being disruptive. If you could explain how a person would *not* see it as antagonistic I'd appreciate it. But I'm not about to accept that those of us who wish to not have our comments wiped are being disruptive as opposed to the few who wish to wipe the talk comments of other people who are merely exercising their right to post comments on talk pages. Do not wipe the talk page comments of others unless you can point to a policy that those comments are violating. That's a pretty basic, civil request.

<p>I find the use of pumpwords like "disruption" and "point" to be grossly counter-productive. They are words used to beat editors, not to assist them. I agree with the above, that there should be no restrictions to posting to talk pages unless they are used to violate policy. Whether that's common sense, isn't relevant. What's happening is censorship, not assistance. Repression, not expression. Wikipedia should never be the place where that sort of thing occurs.

<dd>(conflict) Yes it was done. The talk page for this policy was advertised in numerous locations, including on the talk page of Verifiability on multiple occasions, with the clear suggestion that it was a proposal to replace V. Objections were discussed and the vast majority of those who had objections were happy to drop them once minor changes to the phrasing of this policy were made to accomodate their views. This process lasted several months, during which time anybody was free to comment. The question about major objections was merely the last step of the process, one final check before going live, once we were already nearly certain that consensus had been achieved. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 14:11, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Independent Sources, means not duplications? Or does it mean more than that?</span></h2>
<p>Where is the reference in wikipedia that sources have to be independent of each other? I'm sure it is somewhere, but with the changes that have been happening I can't quite see what has happened to it. I'm looking through WP:ATT but can't find any reference to independence of sources. I'm presuming they can not all be a repeat of each other. For instance if <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Associated_Press_b0ed.html" title="Australian Associated Press">Australian Associated Press</a> gives a press report about an incidence which is then published in a hundred newspapers unchanged we can not solely use that as a basis for an article when no other sources exist? At least I'll presume that is what is meant by independence, or am I missing something? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 04:58, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sources don't have to be independent of each other in the sense that the previous guideline (WP:RS) said, but they also shouldn't be duplicates.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Independent of the Subject</span></h2>
<p>Another related question I'd like to have confirmed that I'm thinking clearly about this, is to do with <i>sources independent of the subject</i>. I pressume by that it is meant sources that are <i>not</i> written by the subject. For instance I could <i>not</i> write an article about a physics professor if the only information about him had been written by himself. But if there existed several sources published about him which had been written by physics professors other than himself then that would be enough to write an article with. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 05:08, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yup, already knew very well all of what you just said. You seem to be repeating back what I said. Trying to get confirmation/clarification on what "independent of the subject" means. I'll re-state it. The other physics professors are all independent of the subject, right? The fact that they do physics as well makes no differences, because the word <i>subject</i> is refering to is obviously the subject of the article which is the professor. Not subject area of physics. Of course for the article about physics we would like to have references from people who are not doing physics, as well as those who are doing physics. But that is completely different from the main example I'm concentrating on, because it is a subject area not an individual person. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 07:03, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There is no reason for an article ion a general subject we should have sources from people who do not know the subject. There's no reason to have references for the physics article from other sciences. What there is need for is, that for a given controversial theory, there must be references (and probably quotes) from both supports of the theory and their opponents. For the article English, we have sources talking about the language, and they dont have to be in French or German to provide a theoretical "outside" view.
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I do realise referring to the physics article wasn't an ideal example, because nobody is going to dispute that we should have an article about physics. I just have physics and maths on my brain a lot, so it is the first example that came to mind. But if in a crazy alternative universe where we <i>are</i> disputing if the physics article should stay then we would like to see sources from people other than physicists. (all hypothetical, so replace words as need be) Anyway, this was merely a tangent to my main question to do with biographical articles. In which anybody other than the person themself would be independent of the subject (excluding I'm sure a few rare exceptions, they always exist. Guess an example would be if only close family members had written about the person). <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathmo_539b.html" title="User:Mathmo">Mathmo</a> <sup><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMathmo_a100.html" title="User talk:Mathmo">Talk</a></sup> 09:20, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The wording keeps getting changed back to "in articles about themselves", but this isn't the actual criteria. This wording is both too broad and too restrictive for neutrality. Questionable sources should not be used for concrete statements of fact, but they should be used for statements about themselves or their authors. In other words, you can't say "the earth is flat", and use someone's blog as a reference for it, but you can say "blog writer x says the world is flat" and use the blog as a reference.

<dd>I don't see a problem with using a term and then defining it in the next sentence. This is fairly standard practice and helps the document flow better. I'm also not sure why you're picking solely on primary sources when the exact same arrangement is also used for secondary sources, 'original research', 'reliable sources', 'questionable source', and 'self-published source'. I do agree with you that the reference to 'edits' is perhaps wrong, and should probably be changed to 'articles'. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 12:43, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have not yet altered secondary sources etc., because incremental changes are better than large changes. You may think that it helps the document flow better, but the structure of this pivotal policy document should be close to a well written legal document, and in those definitions always come first to avoid ambiguity in the text. After all the reason for combing WP:V etc into one was to clarify things which were already there but in several documents and it helps if this document should be constructed in such a way as to reduce ambiguity still further. One way to do this is to make sure that it is structured logically.</p>
<p>Also I have problems with "<i>The Bible cannot be used as a source for the claim that Jesus advocated eye removal (Matthew 18:9, Mark 9:47) for his followers, because theologians differ as to how these passages should be interpreted.</i>" Why pick out the Bible for consideration why not the <a href="../../../k/o/r/Koran.html" title="Koran">Koran</a> or any other religious book? The current wording implys that the Bible holds a special position inside Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 13:04, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The bible is the most widely distributed primary source material in the English language. This is the English Wikipedia. The Koran is not generally translated into English, so few of the English-speaking readers of this web site will be familiar with its content. The reasoning behing this choice is obvious.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also disagree that the structure of a wikipedia policy should mimic that of a legal document. Most people find reading legal documents difficult and tedious; wikipedia is not a beurocracy and we want to encourage people to understand the policies rather than needing lawyers to interpret them for them. The policy should therefore follow the structure of documents designed to inform, i.e. educational texts. The style of using a word then explaining its meaning is common in such texts. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 14:17, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

If this needs to be mentioned it should be in the FAQ not in this policy article.</p>
<p>How do you know that most people find reading a legal document difficult and tedious? I think it depends on the document. In the past when solicitors were paid by the word I would have agreed with you, but modern contracts drawn up with a consideration for <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plain_English_df29.html" title="Plain English">plain English</a> are much easier to understand. I put it to you that if this article is structured in such a way as to minimise inconsistencies, it is less likely to misunderstood. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 16:34, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>And I suggest that if we introduce the reason why the reader of the policy should care about a concept before describing the meaning of the concept, it is more likely to be read. What precise ambiguity is introduced by using the phrase "primary source" in the sentence before it is defined?</dd>

<p>One comment -- generally speaking, when writing about research or scholarly work, particularly recently published research that's reported in news media, given a choice between citing the original scholarly publication and citing a newspaper or other popular media account of it, citing the actual work should be prefered, and one should basically always cite the actual work where possible. Newspaper accounts on new studies etc. can sometimes distort and create a sort of telephone effect, citing the actual work both makes clear what the work is and enables some future expert to tell if it's been reliably described. In these cases, suggest that primary sources should be preferec to secondary ones even though the newspaper accounts will be in plainer English and easier to understand. One can always cite both.

<dd>Getting back to the Bible example: the reference is to Jesus saying that if your eye or hand causes you to commit a sin, it's better to remove it than go to hell (paraphrasing for clarity here). Check out Mark 9:42-47 for the full context.</dd>

<dd>But the reason this is a good example has nothing to do with "Western" or "Christian" preference for the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>. It's rather a matter of interpretation. Traditionally, Christians have seen Jesus as using vivid physical to make a point.

<dd>(unindenting) I'd say it depends. If by "original research" we are talking about an experiment, I'd say no: if you have come up with a rigorous experiment that contradicts received opinion, the best thing to do would be to see how you can get your results published in the appropriate periodical. If by "original research" we are talking about a secondary source that claims that source X had a given passage in it, &amp; you have read source X &amp; found that it does <i>not</i> -- I'd say that is possible grounds to remove that use of the secondary source. I'd try to find one or more Wikipedians who know the subject, show them your findings, &amp; solicit their input first, though; there may be good reasons why this happened. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 23:59, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think Llywrch is addressing the issue. Sometimes editors reading about "original research" get it confused with "source-based research". Original research must assert a new fact, doing research to find that person X asserted a new fact is not itself "original research", but rather "source-based research". So perhaps the original poster can give us the specific example in this case? <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 00:48, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Netscott, I added a new "policy section" template to the NOR and RS sections in line with your concerns.

<dd>I think that adding a tag per section could get confusing, and create a bad precedent. The main problem I see, which SV noted above, is that putting the tag on one section necessitates doing it for all, which would create clutter and confusion, since we also have one for the entire page. I think we need to assume some minimal competence and intelligence on the part of our newer editors - it doesn't require a rocket scientist to scroll up to the top and get some context. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 02:44, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well the section tag would need better wording, mainly that each section represents a part of an entire policy page. I was thinking of coming up with some slimline templates for such a purpose in line with what I am talking about here. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott"><span title="Leave me a message.">→</span></a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span style="background: white; color: grey" title="Go to my userpage.">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 02:48, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My concerns are precedent, confusion and clutter. I can see how once we have these sections tagged as 'policy', every section of every policy would require one, or else we would have inconsistency and confusion. Also, we already have way too many templates - this is very disorienting to newer (and some older) editors. I think we need less, not more, templates. I still think that one 'policy' template at the top certifies the entire page - adding section tags diminishes the role of the main one, IMO. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 02:53, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, smaller and less intrusive is better clutter-wise, but it may not address the precedent and confusion side, as we would need it for every single policy section site-wide to be consistent.

<dd>At my resolution, the 28-pixel size is unreadable and the 40-pixel size is barely readable.

<dd>I find this "seal" pretty loathesome. I'm not sure why. It looks kind of like some sort of "Kid Safe!" seal on bin of PlayDoh or something, and I think it sends the wrong underlying message whatever it would look like - that some far-away body of comptrollers in an ivory tower has declared something inviolate and sealed it forever and with regal authority (look into the origin of "seal" in this context and you'll see why that implication is present). WP policy doesn't actually work that way. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 23:49, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The green check mark may be familiar to long standing Wikipedians, and graphically only says "check", not "official seal". Here is a version of the seal that has not text, that could be used in the sho7rcut boxes:</p>

<dd>To me, a "seal" is just another arbitrary symbol. I don't see how it better conveys the "policy" concept, and I see no valid reason to abandon the setup (green checkmark for policy, blue checkmark for guideline, red X for rejected/historical page) that's been in use since December 2005 and copied by various Wikimedia sites in different languages. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 03:36, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A "seal" as a "seal of approval" could be a more effective way to denote official policy, while a check mark says very little. In any case, I was just trying to improve on the long-standing version, and if it can be improved then why not? (I can easily create different color versions for guidelines and for policies) Let's see what other editors think.

<dd>Save for the fact that the green check is already established a seal does make sense in that it is essentially a worldwide recognized symbol that I would argue almost all cultures are familiar with. That said the blue symbol here seems a bit kid like (techno anime)... not serious enough... imho... but I'm liking what I'm seeing in terms of a symbol in the shortcuts area... that is essentially what I was thinking of... something unmistakable about a section being policy.

<dd>I agree that this particular seal seems kid-like. (No offense intended. I wouldn't be able to create an SVG anywhere near as good.)

That it symbolizes an error in Finland and Sweden is of greater concern, but there might be countries in which a seal has little or different meaning.

<dd>I'm not sure how it was decided that check marks would the symbols used for guidelines and policies. Obviously the check mark is readily recognized in English speaking countries.

<dd>No offense, but I see no benefit to the use of a bulky icon (with completely redundant text) that increases the template's minimum size for many users (myself included). —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 17:51, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even at 62px, the icon's text is extremely difficult to read on my screen. I don't know what settings you're working at, Jossi, but please try to be considerate of those of us with high resolutions. Mine is 1400x1050 on a 15" LCD.</dd>
<dd>And again, I strongly object to the use of text in this icon. It's completely redundant and creates unnecessary work for wikis written in other languages.</dd>
<dd>I believe that you're working on a solution to a nonexistent problem (the false premise that a checkmark is "US-centric"). Given that readers of 26 different languages (not counting English) decided to use the green checkmark, its cultural significance clearly isn't anywhere near as narrow as you've claimed. I see no need or benefit to starting over.</dd>
<dd>Additionally, the widespread misconception that guidelines are "ranked lower" than policies would be reinforced by the use of such colors as gold and silver (or copper, bronze, et cetera). I deliberately selected a pair of colors lacking such a connotation.</dd>
<dd>Having given this some thought, I also believe that the connotation carried by the seal imagery itself is inappropriate. Another widespread misconception is that our rules are sacrosanct laws that must always be followed to the letter. To me, this new icon seems indicative of such a situation, while the checkmarks convey the reality that these are mostly consensus-based checklists of concepts determined to be appropriate via use and discussion (descriptive, not prescriptive). —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 17:51, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>sorry, that wasn't clear. I think the Gold Seal itself is better than the blue. The current gold seal with the darker lettering doesn't work quite well. make that lettering white (and shadowed) but with the same current wrapping/curved appearance could work. What I was thinking really could be nice however could be the gold seal image with the larger, bolder centered text with shadows you have on the latter of the two blue seals. - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 19:32, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Much improved there Jossi, the seal with fewer points is much clearer. While I like the lettering in the image I'm going to have to agree with David Levy. Universality is important. In response to to David's concerns about policies being considered moreso like flexible guidelines I don't see that changing with the seal imagery. The core fundamentals of policies hardly change and I think it is in the interest of the project that policies be taken a bit more seriously particularly if we want the project to be taken more and more seriously.

<dd>My concern is <i>not</i> that policies are taken too seriously. On the contrary, it's that guidelines aren't taken seriously enough. It's common for people to argue that they're entitled to disregard any guideline with which they disagree (because "it's only a guideline"). While it's true that guidelines sometimes have more wiggle room than policies do, they generally should be followed unless there's <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">a good reason not to</a>. That's why I selected a pair of colors that doesn't reinforce the notion that guidelines carry no official weight. Gold and silver (or any other "lower" color) would be counterproductive. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 00:35, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What you're suggesting is taking your own interpretation of a reliable source that isn't explicitly backed up by the words of the source. It may look like cheese, but it requires an expert to interpret it and publish explicit results in a reliable source before we could cite it.

<p>(unindent) I don't understand your point. Nobody has pointed to any reliable sources that say the moon <i>is</i> made of cheese. There are plenty of reliable sources that document the actual composition of the moon. There is no difficulty writing an <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html" title="Moon">encyclopedia article on this subject</a> based on <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon.html#_note-W06" title="Moon">reliable sources</a>.

(Contrast this with the addition of material being objected to elsewhere, which should simply be removed for now pending further discussion, because it didn't achieve consensus before being added.) I hope this is a helpful clarification. I'm trying to show some paths for more cooperative editing and less bickering. If I get shot a couple of times in the crossfire, that's OK.

<p><a name="Synthesis_section" id="Synthesis_section"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Synthesis section</span></h2>
<p>The plagiarism example on synthesis remains very difficult to follow. I've mentioned this before, but giving more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole background to the case is complicated and not explained. What does "copying references" mean? The reader is left guessing as to what the case is about.</li>
<li>The claim that "The whole point of this paragraph is the conclusion that, given the Chicago Manual of Style's definition of plagiarism, Jones did not commit it." does not follow from the text quoted in the example. The paragraph cites a definition of plagiarism, and makes no comment on whether or not Jones committed it or not.</li>
<li>The example is supposed to be illustrating synthesis, i.e. putting together two sourced ideas A and B to come up with an unsourced conclusion, C. None of the conclusions in this passage appear to rely on more than one source. In particular:
<ul>
<li>The conclusion, "If Jones's claim that he always consulted the original sources is false, this would be contrary to the practice recommended in the Chicago Manual of Style..." does appears to rely on one source only - the Chicago Manual of Style. It is not at all obvious how this is meant to be illustrating synthesis.</li>
<li>Similarly, the conclusion "The Chicago Manual of Style does not call violating this rule "plagiarism."" appears to rely on one source only - again the CMS. So this is not synthesis either.</li>
<li>The third line "instead, plagiarism is defined as using a source's information, ideas, words, or structure without citing them.". Again, this is based on ideas from the CMS only - there is no hint of a synthesis with other ideas or other sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From my understanding of the original case, I think that the real dispute was over the interpretation of the CMS (or rather, the Harvard student writing manual, which was the source actually referenced). Smith interpreted it one way, Jones the other. Because Wikipedia does not take one interpretation of the "truth", each interpretation needs "Smith says..." or "Jones says..." before it, and an appropriate reference. This is a very straightforward and well accepted application of the attribution policy, and has nothing to do with synthesis. I propose that the example is removed, and preferably replaced with an example that is easier to follow and actually addresses synthesis. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEnchanter_c99f.html" title="User:Enchanter">Enchanter</a> 23:01, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>See also discussion at <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_Archive_12_e0d7.html#Proposed_new_example_of_synthesis" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Archive 12">Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Archive 12#Proposed new example of synthesis</a>. I agree with you that a simpler example would be better (or a simpler example, plus a link to this complex one elsewhere). I think, though, that one of the points being made in this example is that Wikipedians should not put two sentences next to each other to make a point if the point is Original Research. Maybe in the original, Smith and Jones didn't refer to the Chicago Manual of Style (CMS), but argued using other definitions. By putting the mention of the CMS in the same paragraph, the Wikipedian editor made it look highly relevant -- practically almost drew a conclusion for the reader. That's what's being deprecated. Maybe if the text introducing this paragraph were better written it would go over better. It could prepare the reader for what's coming. It could say "Note how, by putting two sentences together in the following paragraph, the writer strongly implies something." Instead of saying "now comes the synthesis" when actually there's no synthesis in the first sentence of what comes next -- or in fact anywhere within the paragraph. The synthesis to me comes at the very end of the paragraph, when the reader has taken in all the information and suddenly jumps to a conclusion. There are also other complexities which are not needed here. The simplest example that demonstrates synthesis should suffice. I give some hypothetical examples in the discussion at the link I give above.</dd>
<dd>Here's another example: Suppose one Source A says "In this town, men often walk around shirtless on the street in the summertime, but women always wear tops." Suppose source B says, "Jane, a resident of this town, was interviewed on the street in this town during a march of the Topless Freedom Society." A Wikipedia article should not say, based only on these two sources, "Jane was wearing a top during the interview." A similar example might be constructed using a Barefoot Freedom Society. However, this example doesn't illustrate juxtaposing two sentences to make a point.</dd>
<dd>Here's yet another example: Suppose source A says "Any liquid colder than 0 degrees C can be used for this purpose." and source B reports, in a different context, that liquid nitrogen is normally stored at -196 degrees C. Based only on these sources, a Wikipedia article should not juxtapose sentences to say: "Any liquid colder than 0 degrees C can be used for this purpose. Liquid nitrogen is normally at -196 degrees C." because this implies that liquid nitrogen would be suitable for the purpose. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 01:41, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>For the examples, it would be nice to find something that looks more like it could actually be from an encyclopedia article. Coming up with good examples can be surprisingly hard!</dd>
<dd>Your interpretation of the case as being that the CMS is being introduced when it is not relevant makes sense, but does not appear to be the issue in the real life case - both Smith and Jones had discussed the definitions of plagiarism in the CMS. And in any case, the example is meant to be illustrating synthesis, not the introduction of irrelevant sources. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEnchanter_c99f.html" title="User:Enchanter">Enchanter</a> 09:09, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>I've now removed the plagiarism example, for the reasons given above. Finding an alternative example would be possible, but maybe isn't that important - none of the other sections of the policy are illustrated with examples, and the explanation of synthesis is reasonably clear without an example. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEnchanter_c99f.html" title="User:Enchanter">Enchanter</a> 21:42, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Don't remove material, please, and especially not long-standing stuff like this. You'd need a clear consensus to remove it. It serves to illustrate a point that a lot of editors just don't get at first, and it's a real example, which is perhaps why it seems confusing. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup>
<dl>
<dd>Could you address the concerns raised above? I understand that, as the person who originally inserted that example, that you find it easy to follow. However, I personally find it very hard to follow, and similar concerns have been raised repeatedly by other users. Firstly, the example is hard to follow for the casual reader, because it is based on a complicated case. And secondly, if you follow the logic carefully, it still does not make sense. The goal of a policy page should be to explain policy clearly and simply, so that readers understand the policy. I don't think the current example achieves this at all</dd>
<dd>Similarly, the fact that it is based on a real case may be of interest to you, but for new readers of the policy page who are here to find out about Wikipedia policy it does not matter at all whether the example is real or made up. What matters is whether it helps them to understand the policy, and it's here that the example fails. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEnchanter_c99f.html" title="User:Enchanter">Enchanter</a> 22:03, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>To reiterate, in my view the example currently does not make sense - it's ambiguous and hard to follow for the casual reader, and does not logically hang together if you follow it through carefully. I again propose that it is removed - we shouldn't keep a bad example in the policy page merely because it has been there a long time. Does anyone have any specific comments or objections? <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEnchanter_c99f.html" title="User:Enchanter">Enchanter</a> 23:29, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Strongly concur with Enchanter that the example is pointlessly longwinded and decidedly nonhelpful for the reasons in his/her analysis. If editors are going to editwar to preserve it just because they want an example there then they need to markedly improve the example or (more likely) replace it with one that is actually more useful. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 16:27, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The example is bollixed in another way: With a minor edit it would <i>not</i> be OR at all. Simply noting the cited facts from which the editor drew the "forbidden" conclusion and allowing the reader to come to that rather obvious conclusion on their own is actually good editing. All it takes is a minor rewording to get rid of constructions like "if" and "since". Meanwhile, this example appearing in the policy misleads editors into thinking they can't do something that simple to repair a passage like this!

<dd>I think it would be <i>ideal</i> if a better, replacement example were installed, but I do not think at all that the lack of one should hold up removing one this misleading, complicated and confusing. With regard to some of the earlier discussion, I think that the eventual replacement would be <i>better</i> as a made-up one that <i>only</i> addresses the issue at hand.

<dd>I find it a bit too informal and chatty. It's almost like using second person pronouns in an academic essay: it sticks out a bit. I'd prefer something like: "The following example from a Wikipedia article shows that . . . ." well, whatever it shows!

<dd>ElinorD, Jayjg, please could you explain in more detail why you think this is a good example?

<p>Slimvirgin, I again ask, please could you give your specific response to the issues raised above? You have reverted the article after I have specifically asked on the talk page whether anyone had any objections to the change, and given people several days to respond. I asked you specifically, twice, to explain your reasons for supporting the policy as it is, and I also left a message on your talk page two days ago. You haven't responded to any of that, and have reverted again without discussion.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I noticed that too. Randomly reverting things without justification seems to be a pattern around here. The flaws in the example have been identified, have not be convincingly argued away, and are agreed up on as flaws by more than one editor.

<dd>Predictably, someone reverted my revert with an edit summary of "this has been part of the NOR policy for a long time..." as if that means anything.

<p>You have asked that I ensure there is a consensus. A fundamental way of establishing consensus is to ask if there are any objections before making a change, so that people can give their specific thoughts and we can work together to an outcome that satisfies everyone. If you fail to raise these objections at this appropriate time, and revert later, the consensus process breaks down. We need to address concerns carefully, with reasoned arguments and discussion, to make the policy pages as good as they can be. At the moment you are not engaging in the consensus building process, and simply reverting a change that you don't like without explaining why. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEnchanter_c99f.html" title="User:Enchanter">Enchanter</a> 01:06, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The plagiarism synthesis example has been in the NOR policy, now incorporated into ATT, for a long time. It is an important part of the NOR aspect of ATT, as it helps elucidate a concept that unfortunately many editors routinely miss. It belongs in the main text, not in the FAQ, as it is critical to the understanding of the 'no synthesis' principle. Given its importance, the only way to remove this example or even replace it with another, would be to attain a clear and wide consensus, that should include the main contributors to this policy page. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 02:50, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'd like to make the following points in response
<ul>
<li>To attempt to establish a consensus I had asked here on the talk page, repeatedly, if anyone had any objections to the change or alternative suggestions. Building a consensus requires that everyone involved is willing to discuss issues in detail, at the appropriate time - not simply revert changes that they don't like.</li>
<li>On this being a long standing example - this example has indeed been on the NOR page for just under a year. However, for this page, drafting began in October, and the example was only added in February, not long before the policy went live (Previously it had been on the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_FAQ_f2c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution/FAQ">Wikipedia:Attribution/FAQ</a>, which I think is a more appropriate location for an example).</li>
<li>You say that the example is necessary to clarify the policy. As I have said above, I find the policy pretty clear, but the example is confusing, hard to follow, and does not hang together logically even if you follow it through carefully, for reasons I have given in more detail above. At the moment, you are asserting that the example is clear. It may be clear to you, but it is not clear to me, and when I have repeatedly asked for it to be explained, I have had no response. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEnchanter_c99f.html" title="User:Enchanter">Enchanter</a> 18:03, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just a note: It really seems unnecessary to using language like "please stop trying to weaken the policy" to characterized others' edits. Yes the language in question is contentious, but that doesn't mean that any editor participating here really is "trying to weaken the policy". That's the fallacy <i><a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a></i>. If someone feels that removing the example (even when it is being contemplated what example to have in the FAQ - maybe this example, maybe a different one; i.e. the discussion really seems to have relocated) will <i>have the effect of</i> weakening the policy, this point can be made without imputing bad faith motives to other editors. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 23:55, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Role of truth</span></h2>
<p>This is a continuation of an ongoing discussion, the earlier part of which has been archived at <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_Archive_12_e0d7.html#Role_of_truth" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Archive 12">Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Archive 12#Role of truth</a>.</p>
<p>As I said before, although I'm OK with the change from "verifiability" to "attributable", I worry about the change to "not whether it is true" without a word such as "verifiability" to counterbalance it. I think it would be closer to the original meaning of "verifiability, not truth" to simply delete "not whether it is true" or to insert "merely".</p>
<p>I gave one example earlier of a situation where I think the new policy would produce undesirable results; I'm waiting for those who favour the words "not whether it is true" to comment on that situation.</p>
<p>Here's another hypothetical situation where the "not whether it is true" wording wouldn't be good: Suppose several publications have been reviewed by publishing houses in the normal way, but that the authors and reviewers all come from the same religion, ethnic group or political group, and three publications, of the type normally considered reliable by Wikipedia standards, all state that at a certain time and place a UFO landed and aliens came out and shook hands with people. Suppose no other publication mentioned the incident -- it isn't considered important by other publications. Now suppose someone insists that a Wikipedia article state, "A UFO landed and ...". And suppose other Wikipedians argue that it either shouldn't mention it at all, or should use a prose attribution. The first Wikipedian could use this policy, with its "not whether it is true" wording, to support keeping the statement in as an assertion by a Wikipedia article, without a prose attribution. The user could challenge others to find a publication that denies it, saying that only if such a publication is found must a prose attribution be added. ("prose attribution" means inserting something like "Fun and Games Magazine states that ...")</p>
<p>Here's another example. Suppose three sources report a person's birth date as 1901 and one source reports it as 1801, and many sources report the person doing things in the 1900's and no sources report the person doing anything in the 1800's. Someone could use the "not whether it is true" provision to insist that the 1801 date be mentioned with approximately equal weight (or precisely one-third the weight) as the 1901 birth date. Thus the article would not say "J. Smith was born in 1901," but would say "According to several sources J. Smith was born in 1901, while another source reports the birth date as 1801." People could argue that it's ridiculous to include the 1801 date, but they could be overruled by this policy which states that whether something is true is not the issue.</p>
<p>Here's another example. Now, normally, when someone says something, it is assumed that the person is asserting it, and if it isn't true and the person knows that, the person can be accused of lying (or fraud, or perjury). But if the person says "What follows is fiction." then that doesn't apply. Well, the wording "not whether it is true" could be taken as a grand "What follows is fiction" applying to all of Wikipedia. Someone might take up the hobby of scouring books for typos and misstatements and whenever they find one, inserting it into Wikipedia. The "not whether it is true" wording can be understood to be encouraging this behaviour. If the pattern of the person's edits is noticed and the person is accused of disruptive behaviour and of wilfully writing false material into Wikipedia, the person could point to this policy and argue that the person has a right to continue doing the same sorts of edits on the grounds that it is not the purpose of Wikipedia to present true information, and that others should leave the attributed misstatements in the articles. The person could claim that the person is helping to write the encyclopedia according to its stated purpose.</p>
<p>In reply to SlimVirgin: I don't understand the phrase "do truth". Perhaps you would be willing to explain what you mean in different terms. Re your second comment: Either the new wording means the same as the old or it does not; you can't have it both ways.</p>
<p>In reply to BlueBoar: Of course Wikipedia does not care: Wikipedia is a thing, not a sentient being. It's not capable of caring about anything. But Wikipedians do care about the truth, often passionately enough to engage in edit wars about it. I suppose by "accuracy" you mean accurate representation of what is in the sources as opposed to conformity to reality. I think the dictionary definition of "accuracy" is conformity to reality, so you might do well to explain what you mean when you use the word that way -- I'm still not quite sure that's what you mean. As I see it, we should care about conformity of assertions in Wikipedia to reality as high a percentage of the time as feasible, and requiring attribution is simply a method of achieving both high conformity to reality and less time spent on edit wars. What do you think the purpose is of trying to write an encyclopedia that conforms to other publications and not necessarily to reality? The purpose of writing an encyclopedia that conforms to reality as much as possible is to make a useful reference that people can get useful information from.</p>
<p>In reply to Crum375: I don't think there's a platonic version of the policy somewhere of which the wording on the policy page is merely an approximation. I think the wording on the policy page is the policy itself. If different people had different interpretations of "verifiability", then it's not the place of one Wikipedian to say that one of the interpretations is right and another wrong, (or that one is "true" and one is "false") especially when large numbers of Wikipedians had the same interpretation. If the words meant one thing to large numbers of Wikipedians, we can't assume there was a consensus supporting a different meaning.</p>
<p>In reply to Jakew: Why do you say we're not in a position to determine whether a statement is true or not? Wikipedians come from many walks of life; probably many are the authors of material used as reliable sources by Wikipedia. Do you mean we sometimes are not in that position, or that we can never determine whether a statement is true? Can we determine whether the following are true?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"We're not in a position to determine whether a statement is true or not."</i></dd>
<dd><i>"This book contains this statement on page 53."</i></dd>
<dd><i>"There was consensus in favour of the new policy."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I think we often are able to determine whether a statement is true, at least with a high degree of certainty. The problem is that sometimes people disagree about what is or is not true, and requiring attributions is a good way to resolve those disagreements, since attributions are often more objective than other things people might bring into an argument (e.g. personal experience); people tend to agree more about what the sources say than about whether what the sources say is true. So that's fine to require attributions. But it doesn't follow from that that we have to claim we never know what's true or that we have to change the whole purpose of the encyclopedia.</p>
<p>In reply to Mackan79: Excellent point. Without the word "verifiability", there's no more need to say "not truth" than to say "not whether it is relevant, interesting, important" etc.</p>
<p>Would those who support the wording "not whether it is true" please provide an example of a real or hypothetical situation (such as a content dispute) where you believe that wording would be helpful? Please explain why those particular words would be helpful, not just the change from "verifiability" to "attributable".</p>
<p>I note that no one has specifically addressed some of the specific suggestions I made for addressing my concern. For example, no one has objected to my suggestion to insert "Not all attributable statements are worthy of inclusion." If there are no objections, I will soon edit this sentence into the policy. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 00:03, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Coppertwig, as for what I mean by "accuracy" ... I mean that we should report what the sources say accurately. This means we should examine the entire source to be sure that it does indeed say what we claim it says. We should also examine a source to make sure that <i>it</i> states the facts accurately. If it misquotes someone, or takes a quote out of context, then we have good grounds for determining that the source is unreliable. These are issues that must be hashed out on the talk page of each article.</dd>
<dd>Lets take your 1901 vs 1801 example... if there is <i>honest</i> debate as to these dates, then yes, we <i>do</i> need to report that one source says the person was born in 1801 while two sources state he was born in 1901. In reality, if there was a range of 100 years between the reported date of someone's birth, the editors would know that there was probably something wrong with one of these dates and hash it out on the talk page of the article... some common sense would probably come into play. For example, if the source that says the person was born in 1801 later states that he died in 1978, at the age of 77, then it is fair to assume that the 1801 date was a typo. There would quickly be a consensus that the article should disregard the first date as unreliable. But, let's take a more realistic situation: say two sources say a medieval King was born in 1355, but another source says he was born in 1353... we should indeed report the fact that the date of his birth is debated, and give both dates. Wouldn't you agree?</dd>
<dd>As for your UFO story... (assuming it met the criteria of <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">WP:FRINGE</a> which usually covers such claims) if the landing of a UFO is reported in a reliable source then, yes, according to this Policy we would indeed have to say "A UFO landed..." In reality, since UFO sightings are rarely if ever reported in reliable sources (they tend to be the stuff of the marginal press) it would be proper to attribute the statement as "According to a report in UFO Magazine <cite>a UFO landed..." This is a statement that accurately relfects the facts and fits with the parameters of this Policy. It is not up to us to determine if a UFO actually <i>did</i> land... only that this was reported.</cite></dd>
<dd>As for "What follows is fiction"... if the statement is relevant to the article, then yes, we <i>should</i> report that the author made the statement and note that he stated that is was fiction. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 13:12, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thank you so much for replying. I agree completely about how we ought to be reporting birth dates and hashing out on the talk page whether a birth date given in a source seems to be a mere typo. In other words, we need to concern ourselves with whether the material presented in the sources seems to be plausible and to accurately conform to reality as far as we can reasonably tell. This is why I would like to delete "not whether it is true" from the Policy. It seems to me that the policy, with the "not whether it is true" wording, could be used to avoid any discussion of whether 1801 is a typo and to insist that 1801 be mentioned in the article regardless of whether it could possibly be true.</dd>
<dd>I agree that the policy as currently written could be interpreted as requiring Wikipedia articles to state things like "A UFO landed ..." if the sources, of a type normally considered reliable, say so. I see that as an undesirable aspect of the policy as currently written. What do you think? Do you think it's productive for Wikipedia to report that sort of thing, and if so, why?</dd>
<dd>I think you missed my point about "what follows is fiction". I was not talking about an author of a source saying that. My point is that the "not whether it is true" wording in this policy in effect states that all of Wikipedia can be taken as being fiction, and in so stating, it frees Wikipedian editors to insert known falsehoods. I see this as a major flaw in the policy as currently written.</dd>
<dd>What if several books printed in a certain country state that the leader of that country physically shook hands with God, and those books are the type of source normally considered reliable sources by Wikipedia and have no other surprising information, and there are no published sources stating that the leader did not shake hands with God. Should Wikipedia report "The leader of this country has physically shaken hands with God."? I don't think so. At most it should be, "Several books state that ...". In other words, Wikipedians do need to concern themselves with whether the statements made in Wikipedia articles seem to be true as far as the Wikipedians can tell using their common sense. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 22:20, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would think that a claim that the leader shook hands with God would be a significant part in an article on him. We should indeed report that these sources say he physically met with God... Chances are, if such a claim were included in three reliable sources, then the leader is tied into his countries religious practices and belief due to this claim. Wouldn't that be worth mentioning? Have you never tried to edit an article on a religious topic? See: <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> as just one example. You might not agree that what the islamic texts say is "true"... but could you really see not mentioning what they say in the article? In fact, going back to your example, if you didn't include the claim that the leader physically met with God, you would have a hoast of editors from his country, his followers, yelling at you for violating NPOV. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 00:30, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is important that anyone who disagrees with the proposed change be willing to discuss their objections here. SlimVirgin and Crum375 have reverted the proposed sentence, against the consensus on this talk page, but have not articulated here any reason for preferring the version without that sentence. We still haven't heard here, if I remember right, from anyone who supports the new, unqualified "not whether it is true" wording an example of a situation in which they think that wording would have a beneficial effect in comparison to not having those words.</dd>
<dd>Please do not revert the new sentence without expressing clearly here the reasons for opposing it. We're still in the process of trying to find a wording that consensus can be built around after the new, unqualified "not whether it is true" wording was proposed. We need everyone involved to state their opinion clearly so that we can search for a wording that everyone is reasonably satisfied with. Reasons have been stated for including the sentence "Not everything which is attributable is worhty of inclusion." No reasons have been stated here for not including this sentence.</dd>
<dd>I'm sorry, but I'm not willing to interpret silence as objection. If people have objections, they need to communicate not only the fact that they have an objection, but also the reasoning behind the objection, so that a discussion can continue from their in search of a wording that everyone can live with. I've noticed that some changes have been made recently to the policy without my having commented in advance, so I don't think taking silence as objection is the norm. We also need to consider the silence of those who used WP:Verifiability for many months, without seeing any merge tag on it, only a notice that it was policy. If such people are now reverting the new wording in various ways it should not be surprising. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 23:29, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In reply to BlueBoar: I was imagining that the statements that the leader physically shook hands with God would be a minor part of each of the books, somewhat more prominent, but not much more prominent, than inserting "may he live forever" after someone's name. In any case, a clear distinction needs to be made between Wikipedia mentioning something with a prose attribution, and a Wikipedia article stating that something occurrred; that is, between "Three books say that the leader shook hands with God" and "The leader shook hands with God." My question to you is: Should the Wikipedia article state "The leader shook hands with God."?</dd>

Updates were given as the object reportedly got closer. It was reported as being pulled by flying reindeer, and with a man in a red suit at the back. The date was Dec. 24. If several reliable news services make similar reports, and if no news service reports "There is actually no flying object pulled by reindeer as reported by other news services tonight", then should a Wikipedia article state "A flying object pulled by flying reindeer was seen in the sky."? (Note, I am asking whether a Wikipedian article should state this, not merely whether it should mention it.) Or, should Wikipedian editors pay some attention to whether the material being reported by the news service actually seems to be true? --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 23:44, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

(In the middle of the 3rd paragraph, after "written from a neutral point of view.") Please reply if you support adding this sentence, and please reply if you are against it, and explain why.

<dd>The whole verifiability/attributability vs. truth things make sense if you distinguish between fact (i.e. undisputed) vs. opinion (disputed), or better yet the varying degrees of disputedness, and point people in the direction of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. The main point is, it is not Wikipedia's place to judge what is true and what is not. Trying to do so can lead to very ugly content disputes.

<dd>I contend that it often is the place of Wikipedians to judge what is likely or apparently true and what is likely false or contentious. An article in Wikipedia should not say "God really exists." but it can say "Acquinas argued that God really exists." On the other hand, an article in Wikipedia can easily say "P. Jones was born in the year 1901", but it would probably be awkward and inappropriate for the article to say "A recent biography reports P. Jones's year of birth as 1901." In most Wikipedia articles that I've seen, most information is presented in the form of ordinary sentences without prose attribution. To do this requires judgement on the part of Wikipedian editors about the likely truth value of the information.</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia needn't report whose account is being used for P. Jones' year of birth only if there is no notable dispute about it. If there is a dispute, then Wikipedia would have to report whose version of events was being supplied, just as it has to regarding the existance of God or any other notably disputed fact or claim. Only a small percentage of the world's claims are ever disputed, particularly when it comes to mundane details, so most of the time there's no need to worry about mentioning the attribution in the article's text (as distinct from its footnotes or sources). --<a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShirahadasha_34b9.html" title="User:Shirahadasha">Shirahadasha</a> 16:47, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I expect uglier content disputes with the "not whether it is true" wording. The reason is that if the policy flies in the face of common sense, some editors will passionately follow the policy while other passionately follow common sense, leading to edit wars. It's better to have a clear, sensible, easily followed policy such as simply requiring attribution without saying anything about truth. I don't see how that would lead to any more edit wars than any other policy. When Wikipedians disagree about whether something is true or not, they simply put in a prose attribution, making the assertion in the Wikipedia article trivially true (i.e. it's true that the source said that.) --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 01:17, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedians can judge whether some things are true without having to argue about whether God really exists.

<dd>I think there was an excellent example above somewhere, it must've got archived but it was a great example. Generally, if something is contentious at all, it's best to state with a prose attribution, if not, we can simply state it. "Abraham Lincoln was the sixteenth President of the United States.<sup>[1]</sup>" is fine, but "Scholar X states that Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus was constitutionally permissible under wartime power based on the <i>Smith v. Doe</i> decision.<sup>[1]</sup> However, Scholar Y disagrees, citing the Was Not Either clause, as well as the <i>Whoever vs. Someone</i> case.<sup>[2]</sup>." <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 01:59, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with Seraphimblade's procedure, which is the one I normally follow. If a remark is bland "Britney Spears was born in Dallas" we can cite it without explicit attribution and merely include a source like "The Life of Britney Spears by xyz" under "References". However if a remark is likely to be seen as contentious "Britney Spears was abducted by aliens three times" then we should attribute it explicitely to a particular source.

<dd>I think it is good to talk about how sources affect neutrality, but I think <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> has a lot to say about that example. Suppose, for example, Britney Spears said that <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banana_pie.html" title="Banana pie">banana pie</a> was the best kind of pie. Now, on the <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pie.html" title="Pie">pie</a> article, for example, suppose they are writing a section about the best and worst kinds of pie. Britney Spears is not an expert on pies: including her opinion on the pie article would be giving her <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUNDUE_5fa0.html" title="WP:UNDUE">undue weight</a> on the subject of pies. However, Britney Spears is an expert on her own opinions, so we can include her opinion about banana pie on the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britney_Spears_3573.html" title="Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a> article. See <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue_weight</a>.</dd>
<dd>However, even in the Britney Spears article, we cannot say that banana pie is the best kind of pie: we must attribute this disputed opinion per <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Attributing_and_substantiating_biased_statements" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Attributing_and_substantiating_biased_statements</a>. Also, when we are discussing the best kinds of pie in the pie article, even better than saying "X thinks banana pie is the best kind of pie" is stating why X believes that.

<dd>The common thread in the complaints is that one cannot declare truth to be irrelevant to decisions about what factoids stay and go in WP -- on the grounds that people turn to an encyclopedia because they seek truth, and they count on its editors to hold truth as the ultimate standard for entries. Because editors fully realize that "truth" is a slippery slope, what those concerned have called for here is not the blanket right to appeal to truth, but guidelines and examples clarifying when it may be an appropriate consideration (e.g. undersourced but undisputed statements may be deleted on sight under <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>, whose wording and tenor emphasize this deletability in a way that was not usually applied under the previous policies).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The response given to this point is invariably, "attribution being the closest encylopedic proxy for truth achievable, it is also WP's goal and standard <i>in lieu</i> of truth, therefore: 1. We don't believe <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EAttribution_c243.html" title="WP:Attribution">WP:Attribution</a> will permit known untruths to enter WP or known truths to be removed, but to the extent it may, this will be trivial and speedily corrected; and 2. Since our <i>intent</i> was to change nothing in previous policy, this new iteration <i>cannot</i> encourage any more negative or unintended results than the predecessor policies -- so if you think it does, you just don't understand what we've done here." Henceforth the objections raised, no matter how elaborated or documented, are deemed answered and rebutted. They haven't been.

I also have not yet heard a response to my answer to these complaints, that all of them applied equally to the previous policies that <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> has replaced. Except <a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">User:Henrygb</a>'s suggestion that verifiability hasn't had consensus for over a year now, which I'm pretty sure is wrong -- WP:V has been cited by a large number of wikipedia users scattered across hundreds of talk pages, afd debates, and other debates during this period, and nobody has challenged it until now. So: people who oppose this, can you point out a real, practical problem that this policy has but which the previous one didn't. Because nobody has done so yet. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 13:41, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that WP:V did have consensus. But there were several different reasonable interpretations of what it meant. I mistakenly spent a long time last fall discussing these differing interpretations in the context of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>. For the time being, in order to have consensus, WP:ATT has to be a "big tent" policy that can accomodate both:
<ul>
<li>editors who feel that the ultimate goal is truth, but accept that true but unattributable material can be removed</li>
<li>editors who feel that the ultimate goal is to have every statement backed up by a reliable source and feel that truth is irrelevant</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Of course these are not the only two possible viewpoints. My point is that neither of these two groups would be able to get consensus for rewriting WP:V or WP:ATT to explicitly reflect their interpretation. This is fine, because WP uses consensus to interpret its policies, not a pseudo-legal system, and there is no bar for <a href="../../../w/i/k/WP%7EWIKILAWYER_ef72.html" title="WP:WIKILAWYER">wikilawyers</a>. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 14:43, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The expected difference <i>in impact</i> between the old policies, <i>as practiced</i>, and the new one, <i>as promulgated</i>, has been stated repeatedly. For example, I pointed out the potential fallout on Feb 8th, "Again, it's acknowledged that these aren't new policies. But the point and effect of refining and re-iterating them is to <i>emphasize</i> their applicability and to legitimate <i>all</i> intolerance of undersourced content". At the "practical" level, the difference may be seen (and was cited upthread) in a recent edit-war that grew out of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> being cited -- atypically -- for deletion of truthful content, "I've been here for four years, and I've never run into anyone demanding sources for utterly uncontroversial statements the way that you are. If we are obsessive about this kind of thing, wikipedia will never grow, and it is completely counterproductive to revert unsourced statements of what is essentially common knowledge. And I think my understanding of this is a lot closer to the way wikipedia actually works than yours is, which is based on a completely non-existent perfect world idea of what wikipedia should be. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 05:39, 11 March 2007 (UTC)"</dd>

But in fact, under <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, the tacit implementation of that dictum has usually been to overlook or (increasingly) to tag, rather than to <i>delete</i>, such material. <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> implicitly revokes that tacit understanding by 1. failing to incorporate it explicitly <i>instead of</i> blanket authorization for immediate deletion, and 2. by the apparently growing desire, bordering on impatience, among some editors (evident during this process) to enforce the official policy literally and maximally, henceforth if not retro-actively. The result, I predict -- and keep calling attention to -- is the kind of edit-warring mentioned in the case above, where old-school editors butt heads with those of the new regime.</dd>

Some areas where I've argued against the "consensus":</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the Dershowitz (Smith/Jones) example as an example of NOR</li>
<li>Including false information (see above)</li>
<li>Not allowing the popular culture exception</li>
<li>Not allowing wikis as sources even when the objections (self-published sources, can change at any time, hard to determine who really wrote it) don't apply</li>
</ul>
<p>Consensus? Not in the least.</p>
<p>By the way, "W:V has consensus, because it's been cited a lot" is not valid. It could very well be that some parts, which are cited, have consensus, and other parts don't. It could also be that people are reluctant to argue against a policy and may not be sophisticated enough to know they should point out the policy has no consensus. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 14:49, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have always seen the proposals from this ed. to be eminently sensible, but this one needs rethought. How can it be sourced that I was born in Philadelphia without violating privacy. or that another person is heterosexual? or that a third has worked in the past as a railroad engineer? Or that someone else is a member of the Lutheran Church? All factual questions. For people in article space, there is a bio from which documentation can be taken. But most of us are not of that much importance yet. If someone does want to write an article about one of us, then it has to be sourced. I might claim a degree i music from somewhere, but the documentation would at best prove there is someone with my name who has a degree in music. All this has been discussed. For N individuals, such material can be found without COI. But not the eds. (I do know a few eds. who edit under their real name and have bios in here.

<p>There seems to be confusion about what it says. Here it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Editors should not make claims about their professional expertise or academic qualifications anywhere on the site, including on their user pages, without supplying reliable, third-party source material in support of it. The source must be independent of the subject and should include the subject's real name. If the material has been published, the publisher must be a reliable, non-vanity press. If not published, the source material must be provided by a trusted source such as a university; for example, a degree certificate from an accredited body uploaded onto the site and displayed on a user subpage would satisfy this provision. Any such claims on user or other pages that are not attributed to a trusted source may be removed by any editor, although editors should use their common sense and be sensitive in their approach when considering whether to do so.</p>

<p>I agree that the proposal is problematic for the reasons stated above by others. Slimvirgin when you say "professional expertise" that is a very broad statement. How do I prove that I've been an auto mechanic for five years? How do I prove that I have a business, out-of-my-home, decorating birthday cakes? "Professional expertise" is a bit broad.

<dd>I see three basic problems with the proposal to offer verification for claims of professional expertise.
<ol>
<li>Some people may put information on their user pages in a way that makes information such as their home address accessible to a wide audience, without thinking through the possible adverse consequences.</li>
<li>As pointed out above, most of us can only prove that a person with a certain name has certain credentials; we can't make a verifiable link between the name of the professional and the Wikipedia user name.</li>
<li>The practice of providing professional credentials will suggest we are moving to do away with the requirement that articles be attributed to reliable published sources, and that it really isn't so bad to rely on the original research of a Wikipedian with suitable credentials. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 05:01, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just adding my voice to the opposition here. There are thousands of Wikipedia users who already have listings of academic qualifications on their user pages. See <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_by_degree_2c4c.html" title="Category:Wikipedians by degree">Category:Wikipedians by degree</a> for just some of them. Are we really going to require all of these users to provide evidence of these qualifications, despite the fact that in 99% of cases those qualifications are totally irrelevant, and nobody will treat the user differently because of them?

<dd>Leaving asside the issue of whether verification of claimed credentials is something we want to do ... We have long held that the policies that were merged into this one only aply to articles, and not to user pages, draft articles attached to a user's page, or an article's talk page. If verification of credentials is something we as a community want, it should be made a policy on it's own.

<dd>Sorry, but I oppose including anything about Wikipedian's credentials in this policy. If it needs to be covered in a policy at all, it should be in a separate policy. If there are differences in the standards of citation for the two sitations (articles versus Wikipedian credentials) then including both in the same policy could lead to confusion as someone might read the policy and think they had read something in one section when it was actually in a different section. If the standards are the same, then the credential policy (if any) can simply refer to the Attribution policy. There is little overlap between the two concepts therefore little or no benefit to including them on the same policy page. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 22:13, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No conflict... AI talks about <i>whether</i> we should have an article on a topic or not ... this policy comes into play <i>after</i> that decision has been made, and talks about what can and can not be included in that article. For example... AI says that we might choose to not have an article on "Hairstyles of US Presidents", even if there are several books on the subject of Presidential hairstyles. The topic may not be considered notable enough for an encyclopedia. However, if the decision is that we <i>should</i> have an article on Presidential hairstyles, then ATT states that we must avoid original research and back statements up with reliable sources. In other words, AI talks about whether to have an article, while ATT talks about what goes into the article if it is written. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 17:05, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, if there are enough reliable sources on Hairstyles of US Presidents, then we <i>should</i> have an article on it. Wikipedia does not determine what is important or worthy of being included in an encyclopedia -- that job is left to reliable sources independent of Wikipedia and the subject itself.</dd>
<dd>I think AI needs to be reworded here. Perhaps what they're driving at are trivial details that may be verifiable, yet have not been noticed by reliable sources. For example, "Peter Griffin farted 15 minutes, 23 seconds into Episode 6 of Season 3 of Family Guy" may be verifiable (by watching said episode), but no reliable source is going document that. <font color="#F06A0F">–</font><a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony"><span style="border:1px solid #F06A0F;background:white;color:#F06A0F">&#160;Þ&#160;</span></a> 01:37, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Blueboar that there's no contradiction. Nothing in WP:ATT says that every single verifiable piece of information must be included in Wikipedia.

<p>It is improper to copy a citation from an intermediate source without making clear that you saw only that intermediate source. For example, you might find some information on a web page which says it comes from a certain book. Unless you look at the book yourself to check that the information is there, your reference is really the web page, which is what you must cite. The credibility of your article rests on the credibility of the web page, as well as the book, and your article must make that clear.</p>

<dd>I disagree with Gerry's argument that subscription sites are equivalent to having to purchase a book or magazine ... for almost all books and magazines you have the choice to obtain them at a library for free, something you can not do for the information on subscription sites.

<dd>I think that to use an exclusive source which requires subscription would be problematic, as the verification cost for a reader could in principle be prohibitive.

<dd>Some readers will not be able to access to some sources no matter what we do. For example, young readers may not be allowed to go to the library, except on rare occasions, for safety reasons.

<dd>Just another opinion, seeing as this one seems to be debated: read the policy. Nowhere does it say that the source you are citing must be available without paying. It says it must be <i>published</i>, and must be <i>reliable</i>. These are the only criteria. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 19:19, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I second that opinion. The sources in the article in question are all freely publicly available from appropriate libraries: two newspaper articles and a court case. It is only <b>online access</b> that (might) require payment, and there is no requirement that sources be freely verifiable online. I have recently seen another article where someone claimed that only free online sources are acceptable... no way. The New York Times is a reliable published source even though its online archive is not free.</dd>
<dd>This is extremely relevant to science articles. We cite published journal articles that are freely available to the public at any research library (just pick up the bound journal off the shelf). Online access to these papers would require payment or subscription, however. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 19:26, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's difficult to follow this, as people keep conflating talk about the principle with talk about the particular case. If at <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_T._Reed_f500.html" title="John T. Reed">John T. Reed</a> a reference could be given to a source freely available in libraries, such as newspapers or magazines, then fine — my current question here would be irrelevant to that. (No reference of any sort has in fact been given, so the question is moot.)</p>
<p>If the only source given is one that requires a paid subscription, then (unless Wikipedia is willing to pay for such subscriptions) this essentially means that we have to take such citations on faith — and I don't see the difference in practice between that and saying that we take the claim itself on faith.</p>
<p>I should add that appearing on a private Website, available only to paying subscribers, is not the same as being published (i.e., it isn't being made public). A book might have to be paid for, but it is then open to anyone (not only libraries) to lend it to friends, etc. Moreover, it can usually be looked at in shops before or without purchase. None of these things is true of a paid-subscription-only Website, and I think that it shouldn't count as a verifiable, published source. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Talk</font></a>) 20:47, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm. Personally I think the payment part is a red-herring. I am old and losing my memory but last time it turned on verifiability, good faith and subjective nature of what was listed. For example there are plenty of out of print but not public domain books which are only available as scans on pay per view sites, or heavily advertised sites. We kind of have to accept them on quite a few bits of history. Equally a lot of newspaper archives become pay only once the article reaches a certain age. The claim about Reed's court case is in principle verifiable from newspaper etc. and there is no particular reason to doubt it. It is a purely factual description without any silly language. So it should probably go in with a fact tag asking for a proper reference. There are lots of local newspaper reports etc like <a href="http://www.eastbayexpress.com/2007-02-07/news/don-t-tread-on-me/3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eastbayexpress.com/2007-02-07/news/don-t-tread-on-me/3" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> which make it look to me like this should be easy to substantiate--<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 21:07, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not to cut in front but that seems like a valid issue on a community level -- i.e. access to the subscription sources through your local library, regional library, university research library, etc. are huge issues both in support of the services (usually protecting them from home-access), and to provide just such services to "researchers." Also remember that specialized and even private libraries do exist. Hell -- get the subscriptions and give it a go. In my little town that shall remain unnamed there are perfectly good Lexis-Nexus terminals sitting vacant 8 hours a day for months in the public Law Library near the courthouse, while a block away people queue up six and ten deep for a half hour slot on MySpace in the regular library. <a href="../../../x/g/e/User%7EXgenei_d0b4.html" title="User:Xgenei">Xgenei</a> 23:39, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tags</span></h2>
<p>I added the "tags" subsection, copying its text from {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitequote_5097.html" title="Template:Citequote">Citequote</a>}}. I did this without previous discussion, because I thought this change is hardly controversial. But I was mistaken.</p>
<p>SlimVirgin reverted it saying, "keep it simple". I have to respectfully disagree. Simplicity cannot have priority before the completeness of instructions. I was not aware of this diversity of the tags, and when seing them, I immediately appreciated their utility. I have no doubts that I am not alone in this, both ignorance and appreciation. IMFO such things must be kept in one place, and the policy is the natural place for it. I understand the concern of SlimVirgin (in fact, I am thinking along the same lines, see my another section below). But "simplicity" for complex things is achieved by the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverted_pyramid.html" title="Inverted pyramid">inverted pyramid</a> principle, rather than by merciless trimming.</p>
<p>Below is my suggestion for the "Tags" subsection:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you encounter a harmless statement that lacks attribution, you can tag it with the {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} template (shorter synonym: {{<a href="../../../c/n/_/Template%7ECn_09e7.html" title="Template:Cn">cn</a>}}), or move it to the article's talk page with a comment requesting attribution.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>{{<a href="../../../r/e/q/Template%7ERequest_quote_5f74.html" title="Template:Request quote">Request quote</a>}}, tagging a request for quoting inaccessible source, used for requesting a direct quote from the cited source for verification</li>
<li>{{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitequote_5097.html" title="Template:Citequote">Citequote</a>}}, for tagging quotations that are used without a citation</li>
<li>{{<a href="../../../v/e/r/Template%7EVerify_source_41f7.html" title="Template:Verify source">Verify source</a>}}, tagging a request for source verification, used for information that is doubtful or appears false.</li>
<li>{{<a href="../../../v/e/r/Template%7EVerify_credibility_5fa2.html" title="Template:Verify credibility">Verify credibility</a>}}, tagging a request for source verification, used for information that is doubtful or appears false.</li>

<li>{{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENot_verified_a8cc.html" title="Template:Not verified">Not verified</a>}}, popping up a box saying an article or section has not been verified and may not be reliable</li>

<dd>Also some of them have no method in place to resolve them. There is no "verification" process, so presumably every article qualifies for {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENot_verified_a8cc.html" title="Template:Not verified">not verified</a>}}; this would be true except that {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENot_verified_a8cc.html" title="Template:Not verified">not verified</a>}} is really a synonym for {{<a href="../../../u/n/r/Template%7EUnreferenced_31dd.html" title="Template:Unreferenced">unreferenced</a>}}.</dd>
<dd>The strangest one is {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitecheck_535c.html" title="Template:Citecheck">citecheck</a>}} - the description says that if you find the sources are <b>not</b> correctly cited, instead of moving the text to a talk page or deleting it you can use this tag - huh? The {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFailed_verification_33b7.html" title="Template:Failed verification">Failed verification</a>}} tag is similary self contradictory - why tag a bad citation instead of just replacing it with {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} or removing the unsourced claim? <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 20:10, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having pairs of subsections with synonymout sitles looks confusing to me (like, "No Original Research" and "Wikipedia does not publish original research or original thought")</p>

How to deal with various theories, books and websites centered on 9/11 is an issue that has plagued the various 9/11 related pages since at least 9/12.

<li><i>Nato's Secret Armies</i> was published by a well-known academic publisher, and can therefore be used as a reliable source in many situations</li>
<li><i>Reckless Gamble</i> was published by a little-known small press, but nonetheless an academic one that at least claims to perform reviews for accuracy; it could be used, cautiously, in some situations</li>
