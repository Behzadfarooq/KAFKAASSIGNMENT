<p><i><b>Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell; Isaac v.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_of_Canada_v._Lavell_0d0e.html" title="Edit section: Background to Mrs. Lavell">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background to Mrs. Lavell</span></h2>
<p>Mrs. Lavell,<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> a member of Wikwemikong Band of Indians, married David Lavell, a journalism student at Ryerson Institute in Toronto, on April 11, 1970. She was promptly delivered a notice from the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development indicating that due to her marriage to a person not registered as Indian, she would no longer be considered an Indian by law. On December 7, 1970, the Indian Registrar deleted her name from the Registry in accordance with Section 12(1)(b) of the <i>Indian Act</i>. Mrs. Lavell disputed her loss of status to the registrar, but without success.</p>
<p>At Mrs. Lavell's request for judicial review of the Registrar's decision, Mrs. Lavell's case was referred to Judge B.W. of the York County Court as per section 9(3) of the <i>Indian Act</i>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> Mrs. Lavell argued that Section 12(1)(b) of the <i>Indian Act</i> was inoperative due to an irreconcilable abridgement of her right to equality before the law, guaranteed by the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>. In particular, Mrs. Lavell asserted that the <i>Indian Act</i> discriminated against Indian women since only they lost their status as an Indian under the <i>Act</i>. Whereas Indian men could marry whomever they so desired without adverse legal consequence. The decision of registrar, she argued, must therefore be reversed.</p>
<p>In the case's proceedings, counsel for the Attorney General of Canada presented evidence to the court demonstrating that Mrs. Lavell had not lived on a single reserve for a period of nine years before her marriage and that she had only made a few "sporadic" visits to her family.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Furthermore, counsel argued that as far as the law was concerned, the <i>Indian Act</i> did not discriminate against Indian women. In defense of this proposition, counsel noted that the Supreme Court has rejected the 'similarly-situated doctrine' as the appropriate measure of a party's equality before the law.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> The appellant, Mrs. Lavell, therefore, counsel for the Attorney General argued, must be compared not to married Indian men, but to all married Canadian women in order to establish whether or not discrimination has in fact occurred by reason of sex.</p>
<p><a name="Judgment_of_Judge_B.W._Grossberg_as_persona_designata_.28York_County_Court.29" id="Judgment_of_Judge_B.W._Grossberg_as_persona_designata_.28York_County_Court.29"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_of_Canada_v._Lavell_0d0e.html" title="Edit section: Judgment of Judge B.W. Grossberg as persona designata (York County Court)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Judgment of Judge B.W. Grossberg as <i>persona designata</i> (York County Court)</span></h3>
<p>Grossberg affirmed and upheld the Registrar's decision, holding that the impugned Section of the <i>Indian Act</i> did not discriminate against the appellant on the basis of sex. Judge Grossberg noted that the <i>Indian Act</i> treated all married women equally, Indian or not:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The appellant entered into a voluntary marriage which gave her the status and all the rights enjoyed by all other Canadian married females. Her marriage also imposed on her the same obligations imposed on all other Canadian married females. . . <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Judge Grossberg also dismissed the appellant's arguments regarding the different distinctions between male and female Indians, stating that he had difficulty fathoming how such alleged inequalities within different groups of Canadian society are necessarily offensive to the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>. As a matter of fact, Judge Grossberg suggests that it is a laudable point in Canadian history that the appellant is no longer an Indian, since she now she enjoys the same rights and freedoms of all Canadians; a feat which he construes as consistent to the recommendations of the "Report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women in Canada".<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>To that end Section 12(1)(b) of the <i>Indian Act</i>, the Judge concludes, is not inoperative in the face of the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>.</p>
<p><a name="Judgment_of_the_Federal_Court_of_Appeal" id="Judgment_of_the_Federal_Court_of_Appeal"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_of_Canada_v._Lavell_0d0e.html" title="Edit section: Judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal</span></h3>
<p>Mrs. Lavell appealed Judge Grossberg's decision to the Federal Court of Appeal, arguing that Judge Grossberg erred in his determination that the impugned Section of the <i>Indian Act</i> was not in violation of the appellant's right to equality before the law.</p>
<p>Mr. Justice Thurlow, writing for a unanimous court, agreed, declaring the impugned section discriminatory on the basis of sex. Citing the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in <i><a href="../../../r/2E/_/R._v._Drybones_162d.html" title="R. v. Drybones">Drybones</a></i><sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup>, Justice Thurlow rejects the reasoning of Judge Grossland that since all women, Canadian and Indian, were being treated the same under the <i>Act</i> that there was no deprivation of the appellant's equality before the law. Rather, Justice Thurlow determines that in order for the <i>Indian Act</i> to respect the equality of the appellants, the law must treat Indian women by the same fashion as it treats Indian men: as equals. Section 12(1)(b) of the <i>Indian Act</i>, Justice Thurlow reasons, does not treat Indian women in such a manner:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is clear that both male Indians and female Indians have capacity to marry and that each has the capacity and the right to contract a marriage either with another Indian or with a person who is not an Indian. <i>The Indian Act</i>, however, which is a law made by the Parliament of Canada for Indians, prescribes a different result with respect to the rights of an Indian woman who marries a person other than an Indian, or an Indian of another band, from that which is to obtain when a male Indian marries a person other than an Indian, or an Indian who is a member of another band.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Justice Thurlow also notes that should a male Indian marry a non-Indian, not only will his legal status as an Indian remain unchanged, the <i>Indian Act</i> also provides that his wife may also be registered as an Indian.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Being of the opinion that the Court could not apply the <i>Indian Act</i> in the case at bar without infringing the appellant's rights under the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>, Justice Thurlow declares the impugned provision inopperative.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_of_Canada_v._Lavell_0d0e.html" title="Edit section: Background to Mrs. Bédard">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background to Mrs. Bédard</span></h2>
<p>Yvonne Bédard was born in the Six Nations Indian Reserve in Brantford as a member of the Iroquois Nation. On May, 1964, Mrs. Bédard married a non-Indian, begetting two children with him. Mrs. Bédard and her spouse lived together off the Reserve until June 23, 1970, when they separated. Mrs. Bédard returned with her two children to the Reserve to live in a house bequeathed to her by her mother, Carrie Williams. <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> Since Mrs Bédard had married a non-Indian, she was no longer listed in the Registry as an Indian. When she began to occupy the house on the reserve, the Six Nations Band Council passed a resolution ordering Mrs. Bédard to dispose of the property within the next six months, during which time she could live there. The Council latter adopted two additional resolutions allowing Mrs. Bédard to live in the house for another six months, and then another two months, but no longer than that. In order to act in accordance with the Council's resolutions, Mrs. Bédard eventually transferred ownership of the property to her brother (a registered member of the Band) who was granted a Certificate of Possession of the property on March 15, 1971, by the Minister of Indian Affairs as required by the <i>Indian Act</i>. <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> Mrs. Bédard and her children, with her brother's consent, remained to occupy the premises without rent. On September 15, 1971, the Six Nations Band Council passed Resolution 15, requesting the Brantford District Supervisor to serve notice to Mrs. Bédard that she shall quit the Reserve.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> Mrs. Bédard would later lose her status as an Indian shortly after taking the Six Nations Band Council to Court, slightly before she could deliver her <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statement_of_claim.html" title="Statement of claim">statement of claim</a> against the Council.<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>After the Six Nations Band Council passed Resolution 15, Mrs. Bédard immediately sought an <a href="../../../i/n/j/Injunction.html" title="Injunction">injunction</a> in court to enjoin her expulsion from the Reserve as well as an order setting aside Resolution 15, passed by the Band Council. The motion for an injunction was later withdrawn in court, with Mrs. Bédard's counsel agreeing that only a declaratory relief against the Six Nations Band Council would be sought.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p>Mrs. Bédard argued that the Band Council's resolution, authorizing that a request be made to the District Supervisor to expel her from the Reserve, and any action taken in accordance with such a request by the District Supervisor, as well as the removal of her name from the Band Registry because of her marriage to a non-Indian constituted discrimination on the basis of sex and race viz-à-viz her right to the "enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of law", guaranteed by Section 1(a) of the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup> Therefore, she asserts, it follows that the Band Council's actions are without force or effect.</p>
<p>The Band Council, the defendants in the case, argued, by contrary, that not every distinction is necessarily discriminatory. Only those distinctions which are adverse to the group with which they are being made can be categorized as discrimination as used in the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>. To that end, the defendant is given "some advantages elsewhere in the Act" with which do not apply to male Indians, and thus compensates for certain disadvantages she may experience.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_of_Canada_v._Lavell_0d0e.html" title="Edit section: Judgment of the Ontario Supreme Court">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Judgment of the Ontario Supreme Court</span></h3>
<p>Judge Osler, in his reasons for judgment, held that Section 12(1)(b) is inopperative by virtue of the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>. The judge rejects the reasoning of the defendant that such "disadvantages" produced by the <i>Indian Act</i> can be "compensated" for by other provisions which favor Indian women. The distinction made by the <i>Indian Act</i>, he asserts, whether the said distinction must be adverse or not to constitute discrimination, is clearly adverse towards the plaintiff to constitute discrimination:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>it is perfectly apparent that the loss of status as an Indian and the loss of the right to be registered and to occupy property upon a reserve is discrimination which is adverse to the interest of Indian women . . .<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>With respect to the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in <i>Re Lavell and Attorney General of Canada</i><sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup>, he holds that it is not binding as a matter of <i>stare decisis</i>. Judge Osler, however, holds it of persuasive value which, in light of the reasons given by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Drybones</i><sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup>, he finds correct as a matter of law. In particular, he agrees that since Indian women obtain a different result for marrying a non-Indian spouse, it is "plainly discrimination by reason of sex with respect to the rights of an individual to the enjoyment of property."<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

<p><a href="../../../j/u/d/Judge.html" title="Judge">Justice</a> <a href="../../../r/o/l/Roland_Ritchie_0ead.html" title="Roland Ritchie">Ritchie</a>, writing for the plurality (Fauteux C.J., Martland, Judson and [Roland Ritchie|Ritchie] JJ.), holds that the enfranchisement of Indian women for marrying a non-Indian, as devised under Section 12(1)(b) of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Act_6320.html" title="Indian Act">Indian Act</a>, does not constitute a denial of the respondent's right to equality before the law. Hence, Ritchie does not find that the impugned Section of the <i>Indian Act</i> is inoperative. In the course of making this decision, Justice Ritchie addresses numerous questions of law as follows.</p>
<p>Firstly, Ritchie holds that the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Bill_of_Rights_2c96.html" title="Canadian Bill of Rights">Canadian Bill of Rights</a> does not have the effect of rendering the entirety of <i>The Indian Act</i> inoperative because it deals solely with Indians (i.e. allegedly discrimination). Such a proposition, he argues, stands in contrast to the Court's jurisprudence and the very tenets of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_law.html" title="Common law">common law</a>, and dismisses it as a thinly veiled assault on the powers given exclusively to the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Canada_4c02.html" title="Parliament of Canada">Federal Parliament</a> by the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_Act%2C_1867_6da8.html" title="Constitution Act, 1867">Constitution</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To suggest that the provisions of the <i>Bill of Rights</i> have the effect of making the whole <i>Indian Act</i> inoperative as discriminatory is to assert that the <i>Bill</i> [of Rights] has rendered Parliament powerless to exercise the authority entrusted to it under the constitution of enacting legislation which treats Indians living on Reserves differently from other Canadians in relation to their property and civil rights.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ritchie argues that Parliament cannot properly exercise the powers vested in it, if it cannot define the qualifications required to be an Indian and to "use and benefit of Crown lands reserved for Indians". Also, citing the preamble to the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> (which describes Parliament's intention to enact a <i>Bill of Rights</i> "which shall reflect the respect of Parliament for its constitutional authority"), it would appear, Ritchie asserts, that the <i>Bill</i> does not purport to "amend or alter the terms of the <i>British North America Act</i>".<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup> Morover, Ritchie also notes that the majority in <a href="../../../r/2E/_/R._v._Drybones_162d.html" title="R. v. Drybones">Drybones</a> clearly disavowed of an approach that would render an entire Act inoperative because of a violation, which held instead that only the offending provision should be construed as inoperative.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>
<p>Secondly, <a href="../../../r/o/l/Roland_Ritchie_0ead.html" title="Roland Ritchie">Ritchie</a> also holds that <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Canada_4c02.html" title="Parliament of Canada">Parliament</a> did not intend the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Bill_of_Rights_2c96.html" title="Canadian Bill of Rights">Canadian Bill of Rights</a> to fundamentally change or alter any constitutional scheme such as those contained in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Act_6320.html" title="Indian Act">Indian Act</a> and, in particular, those provisions which constitute a "necessary structure . . . for the internal administration of the life of Indians on Reserves and their entitlement to the use and benefit of Crown lands"?<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup> It is a widely accepted convention, he argues, that an Act, in which Parliament exercises its constitutional functions, can only be changed or amended "by plain statutory language expressly enacted for the [that] purpose."<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[27]</a></sup> With respect to this case, he contends that Parliament did not intend to amend the <i>Indian Act</i> with the "use of broad general language directed at the statutory proclamation of the fundamental rights and freedoms enjoyed by all Canadians . . .<sup id="_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#_note-27" title="">[28]</a></sup> Citing the case of <i>Barker</i> v. <i>Edger</i><sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[29]</a></sup> with approval and applying the <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judicial_Committee_of_the_Privy_Council_3f7d.html" title="Judicial Committee of the Privy Council">Privy Council's</a> reasoning in that case, Ritchie concludes that the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>, likewise, does not and cannot amend the <i>Indian Act</i>. For good measure, Ritchie also notes that Justice Pigeon came to similar conclusion in <i>Drybones</i>.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[30]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Justice Ritchie also disagreed with the respondent's interpretation of Justice <a href="../../../b/o/r/Bora_Laskin_ea92.html" title="Bora Laskin">Laskin's</a> opinion in <i>Curr</i><sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[31]</a></sup> that a provision of a statute is inoperative purely on the basis of discrimination and that a violation of one of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by Section 1 of the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> need not be established. Ritchie contends that Justice Laskin merely stated in his majority opinion that the rights guaranteed in paragraphs (a) to (f) (of Section 1) are guaranteed "irrespective of race, national origin, colour or sex." In other words, Secton 1 rights are universal, which he argues is supported by the locution of the French version of the <i>Bill of Rights</i>.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[32]</a></sup> Furthermore, Ritchie holds that the notion that the <i>Bill of Rights</i> prohibits <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrimination.html" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a> alone does not comport with the purposes of the <i>Bill of Rights</i>, which are to guarantee that the rights and freedoms that are 'recognized and declared.' The right to be free of discrimination, he remarks, is not one of them per se.<sup id="_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#_note-32" title="">[33]</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, Justice Ritchie holds that the question of law that is applicable in the present case should be</p>
<blockquote>
<p>. . . confined to deciding whether the Parliament of Canada in defining the prerequisites of Indian Status so as not to include women of Indian birth who have chosen to marry non-Indians, enacted a law which cannot be sensibly construed and applied without abrogating, abriding or infringing the rights of such women to equality before the law.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[34]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To that end, Ritchie holds that the meaning of rights and freedoms in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Bill_of_Rights_2c96.html" title="Canadian Bill of Rights">Bill of Rights</a> is exactly the same meaning "which it bore in Canada at the time when the <i>Bill</i> was enacted, and it follows that the phrase 'equality before the law' is to be construed in light of the law existing in Canada at that time."<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[35]</a></sup> In Ritchie's opinion, 'equality before the law' cannot be construed as "the egalitarian concept exemplified by the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution . . . "<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[36]</a></sup> Instead, citing the preamble of the <i>Bill of Rights</i>, Ritchie contends that 'equality before the law' should be construed in the context of the <a href="../../../r/u/l/Rule_of_law.html" title="Rule of law">rule of law</a>. Drawing from the writings of <a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._V._Dicey_628d.html" title="A. V. Dicey">Dicey</a>, Ritchie remarks that 'equality before the law' is described as an aspect of the rule of law that "carries the meaning of equal subjection of all classes to the ordinary law of the land as administered by the ordinary courts." Ritchie also extends this interpretation of 'equality before the law' to the "application of the law by law enforcement authorities."<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>Applying, this interpretation of 'equality before the law', Ritchie notes that the impugned scheme has been in force and effect since 1869, that is for at least a hundred years.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[38]</a></sup> Furthermore, Ritchie argues that a "careful reading" of the <i>Indian Act</i> reveals that the section held inoperative in <a href="../../../r/2E/_/R._v._Drybones_162d.html" title="R. v. Drybones">Drybones</a> was criminal legislation "exclusively concerned with behaviour of Indians <i>off</i> a Reserve", whereas Section 12(1)(b) is legislation "enacted as a part of the plan devised by Parliament, under s. 91(24) [of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitution_Act%2C_1867_6da8.html" title="Constitution Act, 1867">British North America Act</a> for the regulation of the internal domestic life of Indians on Reserves."<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[39]</a></sup> <i>Drybones</i>, therefore, can be distinguished from this case, Ritchie argues, because the majority of the Court in <i>Drybones</i> held that the impugned section "could not be enforced without bring about inequality between one group of citizens and another and that this inequality was occasioned by reason of the race of the accused."<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[40]</a></sup> This case, Ritchie notes, does not involve the criminal law; therefore, Drybones "can . . . have no application to the present appeals . . ."</p>
<p>As such, Ritchie concludes that there is no denial of 'equality before the law,' since "no such inequality is necessarily entailed in the construction and application of s. 12(1)(b)".<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>

<p>Pigeon argues that the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Bill_of_Rights_2c96.html" title="Canadian Bill of Rights">Canadian Bill of Rights</a> need not have an invalidating effect, at all.

<p>The remaining four Justices dissented, rejecting the holding of the plurality that <i>R. v.

<h5><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_of_Canada_v._Lavell_0d0e.html" title="Edit section: Laskin">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Laskin</span></h5>
<p>Writing also for Justices Hall and Spence, Justice Laskin writes a strong dissent.</p>
<p>"It is," Justice Laskin writes, "impossible to distinguish <i>Drybones</i>." To which, he has "no disposition to reject."<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[44]</a></sup></p>
<p>Justice Laskin argues that <i>Drybones</i> decided two things. First, <i>Drybones</i> decided that the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> was "more than a mere interpretation statute whose terms would yield to a contrary intention." Rather, he states, it is the provisions of the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> that take precedence over the provisions of a conflicting federal statute.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[45]</a></sup> Secondly, Laskin states that <i>Drybones</i> decided that the accused had been denied equality before the law on the basis that it was a criminal offense for him to do something, purely on the basis of his race.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[46]</a></sup></p>
<p>Laskin contends that Justice Ritchie's own opinion in <i>Drybones</i>, the majority opinion, made it explicitly clear that a denial of a respondent's equality before the law was apparent because a distinction had been made solely on account of the respondent's race. In light of these reasons, Laskin asserts that it would be unprincipled for the Court to now construe <i>Drybones</i> as contingent solely on the basis that the impugned section of the <i>Indian Act</i> created a punishable criminal offense.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[47]</a></sup> "The gist of the judgment," Laskin writes, "lay in the legal disability imposed upon a person by reason of his race when other persons were under no similar restraint." Since the impugned Section of the <i>Indian Act</i> imposes disabilities and prescribes disqualifications for members of the female sex that are not imposed upon members of the male sex in the same circumstances, Laskin argues that if the reasoning in <i>Drybones</i> was actually applied to the appeals the Court would have no choice but to find a denial of the respondents' equality before the law.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, Laskin rejects the notion that a distinction on the basis of sex does not violate the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> where that distinction is applicable only among Indians. On the contrary, he writes, it is a notion "that compounds racial inequality even beyond the point that the <i>Drybones</i> case found unacceptable."<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[49]</a></sup> Indeed, Justice Laskin notes that "there is no absolute disqualification of an Indian woman from registrability on the Indian Register . . . by marrying outisde a Band unless the marriage is to a non-Indian."<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>Laskin also rejects the argument that "discrimination embodied in the <i>Indian Act</i> under s. 12(1)(b)" must be subject to a "reasonable classification test" (as adopted by the United States Supreme Court when dealing with similar violations under the Fifth Amendment) and that it is justified, as a reasonable classification, because the "paramount purpose of the [Indian] Act to preserve and protect the members of the race is promoted by the statutory preference for Indian men."<sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[51]</a></sup> Laskin declares that U.S. case law on the subject is "at best a marginal relevance" because of the limitations imposed on the judiciary by the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>. Even if such a test had been applied, Laskin contends that it is dubious that discrimination on the basis of sex could be justified as a 'reasonable classification' when "it has no biological or physiological rationale."<sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[52]</a></sup> Moreover, Laskin does not accept the argument that a reasonable classification test can be incorporated into the right of equality before the law, since that would be precluded by "the telling words of s. 1, 'without discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour, religion or sex."<sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[53]</a></sup> "In short," Laskin writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the proscribed s. 1 have a force either independent of the subsequently enumerated clauses (a) to (f) or, if they are found in any federal legislation, they offend those clauses because each must be read as if the prohibited forms of discrimination were recited therein as a part thereof."<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Laskin argues that this view is largely manifested by and contained in <i>Drybones</i> and <i>Curr</i>.<sup id="_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#_note-54" title="">[55]</a></sup></p>
<p>In addition, Laskin asserts that the position taken by the appellants has no historical basis and even if it did, "history cannot avail against the clear words of ss. 1 and 2 of the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>." Those sections, Laskin contends, makes it abundantly clear that the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> does not contain purely declaratory provisions. Rather, Laskin holds the <i>Bill</i> does not permit a violation of its provisions regardless of whether the impugned statute was enacted prior to or after the enactment of the <i>Bill of Rights</i>.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[56]</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, Laskin discards the argument that the discrimination in question is not offensive to the <i>Bill of Rights</i> simply because Parliament enacted the impugned section of the law under its constitutional authority as provided by the <i>British North America Act</i>. "The majority opinion in the <i>Drybones</i> case," Laskin notes, "dispels any attempt to rely on the grant of legislative power as a ground for escaping from the force of the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i>."<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[57]</a></sup> Laskin remarks that Section 3 of the <i>Bill of Rights</i> indeed affirms that its constitutional jurisdiction is not at issues when the <i>Bill of Rights</i> commands the Minister of Justice to evaluate every government bill to ensure consistency with the <i>Bill of Rights</i>.</p>
<p><a name="Abbott" id="Abbott"></a></p>
<h5><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_of_Canada_v._Lavell_0d0e.html" title="Edit section: Abbott">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Abbott</span></h5>
<p>Writing for himself in a dissenting opinion, Abbott indicates his agreement with Justice Laskin that <i>Drybones</i> cannot be distinguished from the two cases under appeal.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[58]</a></sup> "In that case," Abbott writes, "this Court rejected the contention that s. 1 of the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> provided merely a canon of construction for the interpretation of legislation existing when the <i>Bill</i> was passed."<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[59]</a></sup> Abbott declares that the plurality's interpretation of 'equality before the law' with respect to Dicey's writings, is therefore inappropriate. Abbott, furthermore, asserts that without giving effect to the words "without discrimination by reason of race, national origin, colour religion or sex" as used in section 1, the plurality has effectively deprived them of any significance as though they are "mere rhetorical window dressing."<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<p>Also, Justice Abbott takes the opportunity to comment on the effect of the <i>Bill of Rights</i>, stating famously:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my view the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> has substantially affected the doctrine of the supremacy of Parliament. Like any other statute it can of course be repealed or amended, or a particular law declared to be applicable notwithstanding the provisions of the Bill. In form the supremacy of Parliament in maintained but in practice I think that it has been substantially curtailed. In my opinion that result is undesirable, but that is a matter for consideration by Parliament not the courts.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, Justice Abbott holds that he would have dismissed the appeal in favor of the respondents.</p>

<p>The plurality's decision in this case was very controversial and would prove influential in the drafting of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms_50c7.html" title="Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a>, the successor of the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Bill_of_Rights_2c96.html" title="Canadian Bill of Rights">Canadian Bill of Rights</a>. Indeed, the Supreme Court's narrow and restrained interpretations of the <i>Canadian Bill of Rights</i> in cases like <i>Lavell</i> certainly reinforced the push for an entrenched bill of rights, like the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../s/e/c/Section_Fifteen_of_the_Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms_a297.html" title="Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms">Section 15</a> of the October 1980 draft version of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> guaranteed that</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In light of the plurality's decision of <i>Lavell</i>, in which Justice Ritchie held that "equality before the law" required only the equal administration of the law and did not concern the actual substance of the law, nor did it require equal laws per se; Section 15(1) was latter revised to include the concept of 'equality under the law,' indicating that the <i>Charter's</i> equality guarantees are sufficiently broad to include a requirement of substantive equality.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>

<p>The impact of Section 12(1)(b) of the <i>Indian Act</i>, upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Lavell</i>, continued to have devastating consequences for women. Indian women who would later marry a non-Indian would lose their status as well as the children of the marriage. Furthermore, disenfranchised Indian women were prohibited from</p>

<li>residing on their reserve</li>

<p>This was in stark contrast to Indian men who could marry whomever they desired with impunity. In fact, a non-Indian women that married an Indian man would gain Indian status.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The fundamental distinction between the present case and that of Drybones, however, appears to me to be that the impugned section in the latter case could not be enforce without denying equality of treatment in the administration and enforcement of the law before the ordinary courts of the land to a racial group, whereas no such inequality of treatment between Indian men and women flows as a necessary result of the application of s. 12(1)(b) of the <i>Indian Act</i>.</p>
