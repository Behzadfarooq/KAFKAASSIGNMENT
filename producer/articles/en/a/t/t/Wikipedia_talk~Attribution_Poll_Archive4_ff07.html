<p>Something's really uncooked here... this can't be the result of weeks of collaborating.. maybe people who've been working on this have spent to much time only focusing on it, because I don't think the outside editor is getting the full story.

<dd>Well, when I saw that the poll had started, I felt angry and cheated. What a waste of time! We had at least seven better options. I was even tempted to revert to stop it. But I looked at myself and I said, you know, I have just had the turf pulled out from under me by a dirty trick. So, of course, I am furious. But the only thing I am furious about is turf.

<dd>Under-developed is the impression it gave me. The links and basic idea were there, but the right things didn't seem to jump out. Links meant to give a background on the issue were easy to miss, the "oppose" "support" wasn't clear to me, since a user's response might not be so black and white. The potential for <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groupthink.html" title="Groupthink">groupthink</a> seemed to be much higher than a normal poll. I can just see people supporting one option that doesn't actually conflict with another, but will seem to conflict to a 3rd party.

<li>As someone who has not participated in the development of this poll (except to vote earlier today), closing a poll started by 20 editors seemed more extreme than reverting poll choice changes several times.

<dd>Concur with CMummert, on "led me to believe the poll was scheduled for 2 Apr." My recollection is that there was some talk about doing it very-nearly immediately, which back then was 28 March, I think. I and Pmanderson and at least one other person brought up the Fool's Day issue, and suggested 2 April. Then it was a dormant topic for a while, then a popular one within the last 24 hours with all plans pointing at 2 April. Then all of a sudden over what I believe was about 30 minutes of chat between 2 parties in favor of the "go now" idea the poll was launched, over objections being made during and immediately after this "go now" launch process by at least as many "wait"-favoring parties, so definitely no consensus to launch. I can't say that there was certainly concensus to wait until 2 April specifically, but I do believe that consensus was evolving in that direction. This is from memory, not diffs though. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 07:16, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The issue on the table is "Do we merge V and NOR" or not? If the answer is yes then there are additional issues: Do we merge RS? Do the merged policies get frozen or deleted? If frozen do we call them "explanations" or "historical" or "superceded"? Should the merged policy be called "Attribution" or something else? And <i>whatever</i> the outcome the exact wording of the merged policy can be further hashed out. <i>And</i> new policy initiatives can be proposed to modify whatever is the end result of the outcome of all of that. A poll to try to find a "final" authoritative stamped-as-approved solution is nonsense given that anyone can edit and anyone can initiate new policy proposals at any time in the future.

<dd>That's fine, if our hypothetically omniscient judges discount the comments appropriately. I guess I don't have that much faith. One minute it's "consensus", the next minute people are comparing, on this talk page, shear numbers of votes in each section. SMcCandlish, I didn't say we should tell people "not to say 'X'"—can I not bring up the point as food for thought on the talk page, where it belongs? If this process is consensus-driven, and those poll comments, unless elucidated, <i>appear</i> to provide no informed opinion on the matter, then presumably they hold less sway. By mentioning it on the talk page, I was hoping to suggest that this line of argumentation needs to be fleshed out, at the least. (As opposed to, say, replying to every comment on the poll page with <i>You're nutz0rs!!</i>) Per below, others are also concerned with this line of voting, though as usual, I'm stuck in my own section with no "me too"s. –<a href="../../../o/u/t/User%7EOutriggr_fee9.html" title="User:Outriggr"><font color="#112299">Outriggr</font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../o/u/t/User_talk%7EOutriggr_67e3.html" title="User talk:Outriggr"><i>§</i></a> 07:01, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Of course such comments should be considered, especially as they're entirely valid. To "Verify" something is "To substantiate or prove the truth of something." Therefore, the statement "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth" suggests that to be included, a fact must not <i>merely</i> be true, but must be <i>provably true</i>. Whereas to "Attribute" something is "To associate ownership or authorship with" it. So "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is attributable to a reliable published source, not whether it is true" can be more easily construed, or misconstrued, to mean that a statement need not necessarily be true, but merely attributed to a source that is generally regarded as reliable (according to standards of reliability that may have been weakened by omission of detail). Whether or not you choose to recognize such distinctions, you can't simply ignore the opinions of people who are sensitive to these subtleties. It should be recognized that even in the basic use of language "verifiable" represents a higher standard than "attributed," and that the omissions that have occurred while summarizing did not only economize on language, they have resulted in generally weakened standards. It should also be considered that many people who chose to highlight this particular point in their oppose comment probably have other grounds for opposing as well, and didn't always bother to repeat what was stated and restated in so many comments above theirs, such as "these are related but separate policies that are best described on separate pages," or "the combined article is more difficult to understand and explain to new users."<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 21:54, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>It should be recognized that even in the basic use of language "verifiable" represents a higher standard than "attributed," and that the omissions that have occurred while summarizing did not only economize on language, they have resulted in generally weakened standards.</i> Just wanted to replay that. And an even higher standard when you factor in <i>attributable but not necessarily attributed</i>; this change weakened our ability to enforce <i>verifiability</i> to <i>reliable sources</i>, as "experts" (a la Essjay controversy) can argue they don't need to cite what they consider common knowledge, ignoring that our readers should be able to <i>verify</i> where our text comes from. By the way, verify wasn't used in the dictionary sense you used it above; it mean verify that something was published in a reliable source, nothing to do with whether it was true. (From <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>: "Verifiable" in this context means that any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source.) It's the <i>attributable but not attributed</i> that really weakened policy, over <i>verifiable</i> to a reliable source <i>that any reader can check</i>, with the burden placed squarely on the editor wanting to add or retain the text. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 22:09, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As I watch ATT go down in flames, it makes me think about the real problem. A wiki is a wonderful invention, but it doesn't lend itself to consenus driven policy changes. The notice at the top of the watchlist is the best attempt I've seen at finding a way to deal with changes that effects 10's of thousands of users. We need to devolop a system that scales. If 1000's of user could have participated in creating ATT, there might be 1000's of supports. The solution may be software related, in which case we need to come up with something we can do in the meantime. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrine_Fisher_e4db.html" title="User:Peregrine Fisher">Peregrine Fisher</a> 07:31, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wiki's biggest problem is that many of its contributors do not adopt a consensus-based <i>scientific</i> approach - that is to say, accumulated factual contributions that together reflect a factual 'is' - but contrubute with an already-decided 'is' in mind in tailoring (choosing) the facts and explanations towards that conclusion. It's the same with articles - and rules.</dd>

<dd>Well, thats what human life is like. If nothing else, this will expose the policy creation/change process to many, many, many more people, and now has set precedent for any major changes to have to be ran by the entire community for review in some (very advertised) fashion.

<dd>Hopefully that won't happen. There has been a slight but increasing numeric lead on the support side, with most of the qualified opinions being some form of support as well. It's not much, but the poll has only been open for one day and by my vote-counting there is about a 55/45% split already. If this keeps up for the rest of the week, then the closer(s) will probably decide the consensus is for some form of partial or qualified merge rather than the dreaded <b>no consensus</b>. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 15:07, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm. Maybe 52/48%. And the little spike toward support is being clawed back. We're already close to 200 responses and I don't know how much it's going to deviate from ~50/50 from here on, given how close it's been to that with the sample so far. If you take the few opposes/neutrals that are only opposing one aspect and accepting the other as partial support you could tenuously argue for a minor support majority.</dd>

<p>Jimbo's objection to the merger originally was that it was done without enough publicity, correct? The consensus principle here has always held that people who don't talk are choosing to abide by the decisions made by those that do talk, because anything else would be impossible and require we notify every single user. But this has now been challenged by Jimbo, who is claiming that more must be done to publicize these things before we can claim to have assent from all the passive users. As an attempt to satisfy his wishes, we have now begun the use of watchlist announcements for policy changes. This has been both criticized as annoying and praised, but if one thing is for sure, it's that it has been highly effective in getting a large numeric turnout.</p>
<p>I believe that regardless of the outcome of this poll and discussion, the discovery that watchlist messages work may have a more transformative change on future policy working than the WP:A merger ever would have.</p>
<p>What if in the future we notify <i>everyone</i> via watchlist for 2 weeks/a month (timeframe negotiable) whenever there is a major change proposed. We wouldn't have to do this for every single <a href="../../../v/p/r/WP%7EVPR_1fd1.html" title="WP:VPR">WP:VPR</a> thread, of course, but once something has been hammered out to the working draft level at least, if it was a proposal that could have a real effect on the community, we would add it to the message. The message could come in the form of a show/hide box which hides by default, but which when expanded gives a brief overview of all the current major discussions, and maybe include links to RfA and the like if there was nothing major going on at the time. I believe people would get used to the box rather quickly, but to deal with the inevitable annoyance complaints it could be designed to be unobtrusive, and we could give clear directions on how to opt out using your monobook on the help page for the watchlist message feature.</p>
<p>If we adopted this, we could then avoid messy confirmation polls because everyone had been quite clearly informed of the discussion and those who didn't speak had quite clearly chosen not to do so. Would it be an increase in bureaucracy? Yes, it would. But a much smaller increase than that which will be required if we end up having to run these damned polls every time someone wants to change something. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> <small><a href="../../../t/j/s/User_talk%7ETjstrf_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Tjstrf">talk</a></small> 08:00, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>One general comment - the level of notification ought to be in proportion to the level of the change. If you are suggesting a minor change to a policy of limited interest, that's one thing, but this is a major change to Wikipedia's fundamental content policies. I don't consider myself to be uninvolved, but the first I heard of it was in the last week or two before it went live and the merger was already said to be a done deal. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 13:56, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure, but there is some needless rhetoric involved. The standard for attributability is not lower, I could argue that it is higher than "mere verifiability". You can verify as <a href="../../../t/r/u/True.html" title="True">true</a> the statement "Charles Darwin <i>wrote</i> that evolution of the eye is absurd to the highest degree", but that's a case of false attribution. My point is not that previous policies could not handle such cases, but I'm asking you to not completely trivialize <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. It doesn't talk about mere attribution, it talks about attribution to reliable sources. In the end, we both actually want the same thing, this whole debate has been unnecessarily polarized. If you rephrase, more of the ATT supporters will take the whole "role of truth" discussion seriously. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 19:42, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Yes, that's more like it. Attribution stresses the means instead of the goal, and in your view, I believe, loses the focus on information that has been verified by some experts as true in whatever sense their profession operationally defines truth to be, e.g. scientific peer review. Something along those lines. I personally still think your notion of verifiability is too sophisticated to work well on Wikipedia, and "attributability to reliable sources" is essentially trying to say the same thing, since reliable sources imply we rely on expert opinion. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 22:33, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok. But "attributability to reliable sources" leads to all kinds of misunderstandings, does it not? You and I might use it right. The editors of the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitation.html" title="Gravitation">gravitation</a> page <i>do</i> use it right. What is a reliable source for a quotation may not be a reliable source for whether the statement <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitation.html" title="Gravitation">"Gravitation is a phenomenon through which all objects attract each other"</a> has been Verified. I merely note that mere "attributability to reliable sources" is not enough to keep the junk attributions out of the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitation.html" title="Gravitation">gravitation</a> page. The editors need a solid standard for Verifiability, not Attribution, to maintain the quality of the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravitation.html" title="Gravitation">gravitation</a> page.

<dd>It is fair. To sum it up. We both want to guarantee that information comes from a source that "verifies it" according to the accepted practice of the field in question. That is essentially what you mean by verifiable information and that is exactly what I mean, when I say attributable to a <i>reliable</i> source. For me, a source is reliable whenever it satisfies your demands on verification. Thus, what is reliable depends on the context, and I'm putting all complications into the word "reliable", so your statement is fair. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 00:11, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It looks like this poll will not end with a clear endorsement of the merger. Unless many of the oppose votes are discounted based on their clear misunderstandings of the issues (e.g., all the people who think "verifiability=truth"), we'll be back at square one, more or less. And ironically, those confused oppose votes are exactly the target audience in some respect. I think it is especially important to at least do something to reform the problematic title and language of "verifiability".--<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagesoss_e992.html" title="User:Ragesoss">ragesoss</a> 16:30, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

I would say the <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> page demonstrates quite well the principle by using 1) "Verifiability" always and by using 2) "not truth" always.

<dd>I believe that the "truth people" are being misinterpreted here. After reading many, many of their comments in and out of the poll over the last 2 weeks, I believe that what they are saying is that WP:ATT effectively <i>encourages</i>, because of subtleties of its working, and/or its very name, the inclusion of "attributable" outright bullshit in WP, while WP:V did not. I'm not certain I entirely agree or disagree or will partially agree with this; I'm still thinking about it. I do not however believe that the position can be fairly characterized as crazy, misguided or stupid; it's simply a range of different viewpoints and set of interrelating concerns (and it <i>is</i> a range; they are not all saying quite the same things) that need to be aired, and heard, and discussed. The past treatment of these people (e.g. labelling them <a href="../../../d/e/_/WP%7EDE_3fff.html" title="WP:DE">disruptive</a> which is an outright accusation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">bad faith</a>, the filing of <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">AN/I</a> reports against them for trying to get their views even acknowleged as existing, just plain yelling at them <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">uncivilly</a> to shut up and go away, and so forth) has been troubling enough, but proposing to discount their poll votes on the basis of not agreeing with or understanding their points just blows me away.

<p>Right now, we have a "Support some merger, but not this one" subsection and a "Compromise/Neutral" subsection, with "other" apparently having gone poof! If we are going to break this up rather than lumping it all together, as it was originally, we should do it all the way, and have four subsections. However, since moving votes around can be a controversial issue, I suggest just adding new sections and encouraging people to move their votes into the new sections rather than the old lumped together ones. To make this more transitional, all should be subsections of the original lumped section, Neutral/qualified/compromise/other.

<p>A couple of editors seem to continue to comment on other persons' comments; in particular commenting on the "truth-vreifiability" issue in people's oppose votes. Is the warning about not starting a discussion on the poll page not strong enough? Could such "comments on the comments" be refactored out? It is not helpful to have the poll cluttered with such comments, nor is it appropriate for some editors to start such discussions on the poll page (there are plenty of other pages where that discussion in happenning). -- <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastordavid_9d78.html" title="User:Pastordavid">Pastordavid</a> 18:29, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The I started putting in to practice last night when the first of these appeared is to ask the editorializing user to refactor their own reply commentary back into their comment/!vote. (Just with the first person to do this; I don't know if he/she complied with the request or not). I figure if they don't do that after 1 day, it is fair game to refactor for them, by moving their reply comment to underneath their&#160;!vote, and noting that it was moved and if necessary who it was in response to. Another option might be moving them here to the talk page with subject headings like "Response to User:UserName's comments". I agree that they are messy, and they seem to really be focusing on bashing a particular viewpoint. When we vote in the real world, we don't allow poll gangs to hang outside the ballot room and beat people up for voting Green or whatever or to put up posters advertising why a certain candidate sucks. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 20:53, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Your repeated comments to tell people that their "votes" shouldn't "count" are inappropriate, and are generally based on the same false premise. You ignore the fact that, to be "verifiable," something must also be "true." The change in language from "verifiable" to "attributed" is a weakening of policy, and the new wording seems to be more open to untrue but attributed statements being included in Wikipedia. MANY people see it this way, for a very good reason. They recognize that the words "verifiable" and "attributed" are NOT synonyms. The choice of language is significant, and several details from the combined policies have been omitted, further obscuring the meaning of the policies.<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 22:11, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is not what "Verifiability" means - if you would just read the V policy page. Verifiability means that the view is included in Wikipedia not because it is true or because anyone thinks it is true, but because it reflects a point of view that can be verified i.e. attributed to an appropriate source. NOR means that editors should not present their own research and views but must instead rely on views of non-editors that come from appropriate sources.

I believe it is best to keep the policies on their own separate pages. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilippe_dffa.html" title="User:Philippe">Philippe</a> 01:27, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Agree</b>. It's already painfully clear that far too many WP editors have never bothered to fully read the relevant policy pages in the first place. Combining them into an omnibus will only increase the learning curve and serve no useful purpose. If the policy pages <i>do</i> wind up being merged, we should at least create sub-section link redirectors, such as WP:AOR linking directly to the Original Research section and WP:AV or WP:ARS linking directly to the verifiability / reliable sources section. Please don't make it even harder to explain fundamental WP policies to new users! <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 18:13, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your claim that the truth matters directly contradicts our <i>earlier</i> policy, verifiability, not truth.

<p><b>Comment</b> The comments by Slrubenstein replying directly to certain posts/editors above appear intimidatory and seem intended to force consensus by dumping on and hence discouraging less articulate editors from contributing their real concerns on these issues. I obviously dont want to strike them as I'm only a user myself and a fairly new one at that, but I think that in an open community poll someone replying with boilerplate text to a heap of posts should be taken into hand. Nothing against what has been said (although i disagree with it) but more the way in which it has been done. Just my thoughts. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielT5_5528.html" title="User:DanielT5">DanielT5</a> 18:35, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>No</b> on <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. <b>No</b> on any merger idea at this time. Verifiability, ReliableSource, and No personal research are very independent components of high quality Wikipedia pages such as <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>. That is, without a standard for "Verifiability" that is far higher than what <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">mere Attributability</a> requires, editors could not trim the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a> pages to follow faithfully just the facts, not the mere attributions, as established by ReliableSources. Similarly, without a standard for "Verifiability" that is far higher than mere "Attributability," editors cannot trim pages on living persons to exclude fully attributable personal attacks that are baseless, false, and unfair.

<dd>Given outright complaints of "intimidation" on the part of tendentious reply-commentators, I believe the refactoring is a very Good Thing. It isn't changing anyone's words, simply moving them. Which is nicer that simply deleting them, which would arguably also be a plausible response under the rules-of-order outlined in the poll's instructions. Since the refactoring began and notes were added about it, the number of such back-biting replies has dropped remarkably. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 02:25, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) The poster of the "intimidation" comment appears to have refactored away their own comment on that matter; I saw it ca. 3pm my time (it is now 8:31pm my time) to the best of my memory, possibly has late at 4pm my time, on the poll itself. Someone else objected as well, in different words (again on the poll around the same time; may or may not still be there, I'm not going to re-read the poll. Do your own research.&#160;;-), and there have been pretty broad discussions for days (see archives above) about doing precisely this refactoring. The model was that of RfC. This isn't news at all, and doesn't seem to be opposed by anyone but you and Jossi. The comments <i>were</i> getting out of hand; one editor was seemingly just going down the list and replying negatively to every&#160;!vote he/she didn't like. NB: I revise my previous statement: Since the refactoring, this reply-commenting hasn't just dropped remarkably, it has <i>stopped completely</i>. It was a good, and effective plan.

<p>There was a suggestion when the Brandt article was up for deletion the last time that we form a committee to close it. I wonder whether we should do that here. I would suggest five experienced admins: two who may be in favor of the merge; two against; and one who is neutral. They hold a discussion on a designated page, which others can see but can't edit. They reach a decision, and ask Jimbo to ratify it if people think that's necessary.

<dd>Close the voting on the advertized date... not sooner, not later. Even if the voting all but dies out, we do not want some editor to come back and complain that they didn't get a chance to vote, or for another editor to claim that the results are biased because one side or the other kept the voting going longer than was stated. I like the idea of forming a committee of Admins, representing the different view points, who then compile and interpret the results. Yes, lots of arguments are possible about the interpretation... but I have faith that consensus can be reached. The results, analysis and interpretation would then get sent to Jimbo with a recommendation for his OK. As a non-admin, I would like to be able to follow the discussion of the committee... but I agree that such a discussion should not be open to the general editing public (far too chaotic) I support a viewable, but not edit-able page for this discussion. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 16:24, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>When it closes on 4/6/07 00:00, we need to put a note up that says, "<b>Poll is closed. ANY changes or edits to this page will be reverted</b>," and then fully protect the page. Once 4/6/07 00:00 passes there is no need for a single person (including Jimbo) to be editing the poll. The only exception I could see would be if Jimbo himself asked us to reopen/extend the length. Nothing else. Any nonsense or political editing games after that need to be ruthlessly rv'd out to not mess with the community. - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 17:01, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We could have a fully protected page for <i>all</i> admins. Of course, I give myself an advantage as I suggest that, but the basic reason admins are made admins is because people trust them. Having a committee of four or six may be difficult. The very much involved or the totally uninvolved? What if it turns out more admins were supporting or opposing? Wouldn't the composition of the committee have to reflect that? It will be messy trying to work stuff like this out. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 17:28, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Beside Jimbo, I imagine many, many editors will very actively and justifiably object to any <i>one</i> person determining concensus. Whomever does it, it needs to be multiple people.

<li>I would strongly suggest that no editors with an interest in the outcome (either way) be party to the closure committee; by that, I mean no one who has taken a principal role in editing, promoting or advocating for the merged policy; nor any who has actively campaigned against it. By that token, for the sake of appearance of impartiality, I'd recommend that SlimVirgin not make nominations as to whom she believes should close/interpret the discussions-- as she is perhaps the strongest advocate for the pro-merger position.

<dd>Surely Jimbo needs to close this himself. If I were him, I wouldn't do it in a hurry, and I'd first ask for reports from some of the people I consider to have been most sensible on all sides of the debate including some who've been pretty neutral - half a dozen people or so - on what the problems are and what the possibilities are for future action. I'd definitely include SlimVirgin, Septentrionalis, and some of the leading opponents of the process, or of ATT itself. But I'd also be looking for people are just outstanding and experienced editors in various ways, even if they've been uninvolved, or scarcely involved. I'm thinking of folks like MONGO, Anville, Giano, Raoul, and many others, who surely have thought deeply about these policies in the past, and applied them well in creating great content. But if I were Jimbo, there's no way I'd let someone else close it. Still, I'm <i>not</i> ... so we'll see what view he actually takes. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 06:36, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, still opposed to any small group. If one is to be appointed, Jimbo should do it. And I don't know how it will work in a "locked room" on Wiki. It'll just create a situation ripe for wheel-warring. If you've got six admins, and a seventh shows up and says "I've been on vacation but I've got something to say" will that person be reverted? That would obviously be very bad. Agree this should not be decided on IRC or the mailing list—unless, again, Jimbo decides to make his announcements in those channels. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 07:53, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just throwing a wild idea out (can't hurt, right?): since Jimbo will obviously have the final word, he'll obviously be the final judge - but how about letting the ArbCom make the final recommendation?

<dd>This thread seems to mix up two topics: how to close, and the meaning of the poll. These are two separate issues. The poll closes at the end of April 6 - I imagine 23:59:59 UTC. At that time the page must be protected. The deadline for the poll was determined before the poll began; once the poll began, it is not right to change it. Now, topic two: what does it all mean? Let's wait until the poll has ended before we discuss the meaning. And by the way, even if Jimbo takes it upon himself to make any ultimate decision as to what it means, that can't stop anyone from weighing in. i am just suggesting we wait until it is over. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 09:11, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A poll is only a sampling of users, and hopefully users who seem to have a good understanding of what's going on. With that in mind, yes, we should exclude those who do not seem to understand what the poll is about, or what the concerns are. We have enough users with a good amount of edits to give an accurate count without having to include those with five or six edits. We're not a democracy, so we don't have to count everyone.

<p>V-man, while he may have stylized this as a comment is in fact providing his opinions here for this poll and he doesn't do it anywhere else. <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> for example who voted <i>and</i> replied to <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilippe_dffa.html" title="User:Philippe">Philippe's</a>.

<br />
He commented less than an hour later on the actual subject of the matter, ATT, and because his comment was indented per replying, wheras his previous comment was per voting, it was considered a comment and not a vote and therefore it was moved.<br />
<br />
This is a poll trying to get opinions from the community. V-man provided an opinion and because it was formatted differently, it was removed. He provided an opinion on the poll itself, and because it was formatted properly, it wasn't removed even though that comment probably didn't belong <i>there.</i><br />

<p>At this time, it looks like the community is closely divided over the merger. I imagine it will be a while before we sort out what this vote means, and how it will inform ongoing discussions about policy. Right now I want to call attention to a problem that this poll has highlighted, regardless of views about ATT. Rednblu, EdFitzgerald, Derex, Michael, terence, and JWolfe have justified their votes by insisting on the overriding importance of "truth." Of all the people who are voting this is a tiny minority which is why I say this problem is separate from the debate over ATT. But I find it very frightening for two reasons: first, the principle that representing different views - and the claim that the existence of such views is objective, and theirfore attributable or verifiable (meaning, one can find objective evidence that someone holds this view, e.g. a source) and <b>not</b> the "truth" is the concern of WIkipedia and the standard of inclusion of material in an article has been, in one form or another, <i>the</i> core principle of Wikipedia since its founding, and it has long been explained in different core policies. The fact that some active editors completely discount this principle is dangerous because the only things that hold together this incredibly heterogeneous and quasi-anarchic community is our agreement to work within these core policies. Second, this principle is enshrined in two longstanding policies <i>independent of ATT</i>: NPOV (our oldest policy) and Verifiability (which is several years old). To reject or question this principle is <i>not</i> to question ATT, it is to reject V and NPOV. It is disingenuous and dangerous to use a poll over ATT to reject V and NPOV. I ask fellow Wikipedians to take this problem seriously not because these views are shared by a large group of people - they are not, at least, based on this poll most people have other concerns that motivate their vote. Rather, it is a serious problem because it really gets to the very core of Wikipedia content policy. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 11:37, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is being discussed at <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_Role_of_truth_e9bd.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Role of truth">Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Role of truth</a>. Nobody disagrees about NPOV, and few about NOR. But whether verifiability is primarily about fact checking or solely about sourcing is a matter of dispute, and the emphasis of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> has been changed over the last two years (check the history). The question could have been raised explictly in this poll (see <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_Poll_Questions_aa05.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution/Poll/Questions">Wikipedia:Attribution/Poll/Questions</a>) but was not. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudiovideo_858d.html" title="User:Audiovideo">Audiovideo</a> 12:18, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To argue that "truth" should be the principle governing inclusion in Wikipedia articles implicitly but necessarily involves a rejection of VPOV and V (even if the meaning of V has changed over the years, it certainly was never changed to contradict the dictum, verifiability not truth, nor to contradict our NPOV policy). Whatever other discussion is going on, comments made on the poll page indicate that some people either do reject NPOV (by elevating "truth") or fundamentally misunderstand it - I leave it to others do decide which is more frightening! <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 12:33, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, it wasn't changed, and as Slrubenstein notes, the idea of attribution, or verifiability, as opposed to truth has been a cornerstone of NPOV and Wikipedia since its creation. That issue is a completely separate one from how many pages the policies should be on, which is what we're deciding here, and it's a great pity that some people tried to mix up the two issues. I hope they did it by accident, and not as a deliberate attempt to use the merge and poll as a Trojan horse to change the heart of the policy. They won't succeed no matter what they do, because the idea of finding reliable sources, rather than tracking down "the truth," is absolutely fundamental to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 12:34, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

You can't simply "remove votes that missed the point," as you seem to have a biased view as to what the "point" is, and it's your own perspective that tells you that certain people are advocating for a change on WP:V, rather than recognizing their claim that this merger is itself a change to WP:V.<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 23:36, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><s>Even though I am in favour of the Attribution merger, I feel the cause is lost. No one should count the neutral votes as in favour or against, however the comments are worded (if those people wanted to vote for or against, they would have done). The fact is that percentages for, against <i>and</i> neutral must be counted, so, technically, each neutral vote is a vote against consensus for the merge. Therefore I don't believe that the merger is likely to go ahead (I think we need 75%). As a supporter of the Attribution policy, I'm hoping, however, that it will be allowed to stand alongside the other pages: then I will happily use it, as I find it a convenient one-stop for all sourcing issues. I get the impression that most of the regular editors of V, OR, and RS support ATT, and so goodness knows who will have the stomach to go on keeping those three in shape (they need a lot of watching) in the future.

<p>I strongly oppose any move to flag or discount the views of users with low edit counts as has been suggested at several different points on this page. It's been mentioned above as a way of somehow tallying the results. I disagree with this on 3 principles and hope that others will see sense in my logic and offer thier support;</p>
<p>1. A user may have a low edit count because they, like me, submit artwork. It can take 20+ hours to draw artwork/maps etc. and only two edits (one to upload it and one to place it on a page) to actually add it to the pedia. Many of us could potentially lose our views to spellcheckers and vandalism reverters with high edit counts simply because their line of work involves heavier edit counts. Consider this as an example, a cartographer (map designer) could spend an average of 10 hours on a map. They may have only 50 edits (2 per map). That would mean they have contributed 250 hours of work to the pedia, yet their views would be flagged up to be taken with a pinch of salt. Also please consider people who do their work in a text editors and upload it in one go, they may only have 50 edits but if those 50 edits each equal one featured article their view hardly deserves to be flagged up as effectively 'inconsequential'.</p>
<p>2. Secondly this isn't a vote, its an opinion poll. Wikipedia isn't a bueracracy and if 499 people say merge but 500 say don't merge (as I expect is probably going to be the case one way or the other) the outcome is not going to be so straightforward and clear as to simply tally up the results, so to flag some peoples views would be senseless and a waste of time, because this isn't a voting process and enough experienced editors on either side of the river are going to add their opinions to make a consensus of opinion one way or the other apparent or (more likely) not apparent.</p>
<p>3. As with any WP opinion poll, everyone is entitled to an opinion. In an RfA non-admins can 'vote' for example, as they may have valuable points to add despite not being an admin themselves. It is especially poignagnt as the people most likely to encounter WP:ATT or WP:NOR, WP:V etc. are new editors, and so if they have an opinion on this new policy merge it should be heard just as loud as anyone else.</p>
<p>Thanks for considering this. I hope you will join my in stopping low edit counts being flagged. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedianProlific_7186.html" title="User:WikipedianProlific">WikipedianProlific</a><a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikipedianProlific_3841.html" title="User talk:WikipedianProlific"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 22:17, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We'll be making a note of new accounts, particularly any created since the poll was first discussed; that's standard practise in high-profile AfDs and RfAs.

<dd>I can't really see why even that would be nessessary. This isn't a high profile AfD or RfA, it could very easily have over 1,000 votes, probably 500 either way. Thats enough people to know that even though there may be one or two sockpuppets either way, its still an accurate potrayal of how editors feel. Equally, whats to say a user hasn't been making anon edits and suddenly felt the need to join up and add their opinion. I stand by the principle that no editor has the right to decide how much another editor has contributed in the confines of an opinion poll. After all its an opinion poll and everyone is entitled to an opinion.

<dd>SV is right, it is standard, and it must be done. Users can register new accounts to "stack the vote".

<dd>Of course there is. New editors rarely, if ever, have a good understanding of policy, and so are unable to comment on it in a meaningful way.

<dd>Jayjg sd: "New editors rarely, if ever, have a good understanding of policy, and so are unable to comment on it in a meaningful way." I understand the premise but take huge issue with this (and it is an oft recurring comment used to disregard 'newbies' outright). I believe the worst thing for the policies of any organization (including WP) is when the old-timers seize dominion of 'what the policies mean'. It is the oligarchs disenfranchising the people at the benefit of the oligarchs and claiming it is for the benefit of the whole society. The worst instructor/teacher/coach is the one that forgets what it was like to be new and discounts the experience of new people. That lost perspective creates the attitude that there is only one way to do thing...the way the edit-vets say to do it. Sadly obtuse in that logic with a harmful effect on WP.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In more areas than not I have witnessed edit-vets proclaiming the newbies' input should be disregarded since they "don't know the culture" or "understand the policies" (iow, only those here for a long time understand that the vets determine when policies are followed by the letter and when to follow the spirit. The answer is simple...the alpha-edit-vet determines which way and what part of a policy is applied). It is a class that newbies will forever be excluded from and that alone is an undermining of the WP philosophy. Worse, is Groupthink, Tunnelvision, Thinking Inside the Box and every other similar cliche about myopic "always been that way" thinking prevents issues from being presented, heard, learned about and addressed or corrected.</dd>

<dd>WP must evolve in its policies and it culture simply because of the growing scope and size of the community. It will crash if the heirarchy of edit-vet vs newbies continues to permeate in the aspects of WP. This vote alone has brought out the following attitudes: Weight newbies input very, very lightly (a little more stringent than standard), discount the view/opinion of the newbies, newbies can't comment on policies in a meaningful way (by whose standard?), newbies votes should not count at all...that is just this one issue. That exclusionist attitude is rampant (albeit more subtle usually) throughout. If you really like WP, its premise and its purpose then you should be down right offended by this attitude. Newbies have a new perspective that warrants an ear and honest consideration at the minimum.</dd>

<dd>Kim Bruning, if this is a vote then which side has a majority is important. If this is a discussion then letting the discussion run for seven days is important.

<dd>I didn't see Kim say any such thing. Anyway, this isn't a vote like one has for a ballot measure or election. It is a <a href="../../../s/t/r/WP%7ESTRAW_60a4.html" title="WP:STRAW">straw poll</a> to gauge relative support level (which has already been gauged quite well), and a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">request for comments</a>, which have already expressed adequately all that they are likely to express, and in the rough ratios they are likely to be expressed whether the poll is closed today or in a month. No one's going to keel over and die if the poll runs full-length, but why bother? Who is actually going to read 1000 comments, or would want to when they'll ultimately say the same thing as 350 comments? — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 04:03, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The whole point to this being a structured discussion and not just a poll or vote is that people can contribute more than just "yes" or "no" so what peope have to say over the next five days can be more than just yeses and noes but can provide actual insight and illumination into how we word policy. We want peple to speak their minds. I think it is terrible to suggest that the next five days can only be a carbon copy of the first two days. The point of discussion is to build on prior statements.

<dd>Whatever you say. I don't see anything novel or synchretic about what has been posted today vs. yesterday. The poll is <i>not</i> a discussion. The Community discussion page is a discussion.

<dd>In re "better for newcomers"/"better to cite specific page"--I think that needs to be more specific. What I noticed people saying was "better for newcomers"/"worse for newcomers", the specific reason being that it's better to site a specific page, it's easier to site a specific page, it's easier to pay attention to etc. And that this applied not only to newcomers, but especially to newcomers. I was personally, by the way one of the people who thought the opposite, that it was worse to have it in one page--for myself, for referencing others, for others (newcomers, whomever) understanding.</dd>

<dd>I think what you got with part of the table but didn't with part, and what you didn't entirely get at, is that there's a major break down, one opinion thinks it's easier to understand, <i>due</i> to x, y, and z and the other thinks it's harder <i>due</i> to x, y, and z. We may have been citing the particulars to support our statments, but the problem is that if you ask a person who supports it why it's good, and ask someone against it why it's bad, their statements, sans specifics are basically opposing statments straight down the line, issue for issue. Better/worse on each issue. I think a table breakdown is good, but it's slightly more complicated than the way you presented it here, and that doesn't get into the mud slinging. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 06:27, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

<p>One of my biggest beefs isn't in the chart: in addition to the argument over whether policy changed, we have the issue of <i>perception</i> of a policy change. In spite of the crafters' intent, <i>attributable but not attributed</i> can be misinterpreted by "experts" and others who want to avoid citing content. Further, I'm kinda glad the poll is still running, as I'm still learning from comments, such as the person who posted <a href="http://thoughtsfordeletion.blogspot.com/2007/03/chunky-or-smooth.html" class="external text" title="http://thoughtsfordeletion.blogspot.com/2007/03/chunky-or-smooth.html" rel="nofollow">this blog entry,</a> which sorta/kinda expresses similar concerns to mine. My most serious reservations are in the <i>emphasis</i> on the wording of <i>attributable but not attributed</i> over <i>verifiable</i>, because it can be misinterpreted. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 14:59, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's a very good blog post, indeed. He has really got all the facts right, and even likes the name attribution, but has a different view of the role of NOR. I think all ATT supporters should read his post, it is well argued. SandyGeorgia's biggest beef, however, is in my opinion slightly under-cooked&#160;:) "Experts" will need to provide attribution for anything that is <i>challenged or likely to be challenged</i> just like anyone else, saying "oh it is attributable, but not attributed", won't help them. Ironically, while they could <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a> that ATT says "attributable but not attributed", it is however a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_attribution.html" title="False attribution">false attribution</a> because the "expert" is <a href="../../../q/u/o/Quoting_out_of_context.html" title="Quoting out of context">quoting out of context</a>, something that happens a lot on Wikipedia.

<dd>Won't help them? Not so. The argument has been successfully used already. I advocate we keep the emphasis on the semantic difference of <i>verifiable</i>, which means we assume any reader can verify that our content is published by a reliable source, without opening the door to what can remain <i>unattributed</i>. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 18:31, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<p>I don't think that a closing committee can determine the outcome of this, it's officially for Jimbo to decide, since basically he was the one who wanted this poll. But, I <i>would</i> like to see a breakdown. The votes have to be gone through anyway, people commented in more than one place, etc, but I'd really like to know some things about the votes and opinions--how many people voting each way had had any prior involvement in the project for example.<br />
<br />
Unlike other users here, I don't particularly think that # of edits is, or # of recent edits, or # of recent article edits is a relevant qualifier or tells anything about the results, but I do think that other things are relevant when reading the results--not to discount votes, but to understand them. I'd like to see stats of the results in terms of how many users had made any contribution to ATT, or the other policy articles in question, or if they had major involvement with the creation of ATT, or whether they're an admin--these are just off the top of my head, but could create a list of relevant qualifiers, of things you'd want to know in terms of reading these statistics, and this closing comittee could go through, and look at the votes and provide these stats, and give us other helpful information, like what the biggest issues were.<br />
<br />
This was supposed to be a poll to find out how the general wiki community felt. For example, if the majority of the users for or against the poll had a major involvement with the article, that tells us something. If the number one thing users who voted against ATT mentioned was that they didn't like the poll, or thought there was no consensus in the article, then we know that they <i>might</i> be voting based on emotions and haven't really looked at the articles. In that case, an ATT proposal might fare much better down the line when everyone on both sides could agree that their was consensus and users weren't scared away from editing etc. If they mention things that they like or don't like specifically--then we have an idea of what to do. A lot of users proposed ideas, or made suggestions about where to go from here. Maybe there's some sort of consensus in that, or at least something for good talk page discussion to get moving forward.<br />
<br />
Just tagging the poll with the results and being done with it is foolish. There's a wealth of data there that hundreds of wiki users have gone to the trouble of providing, and given the enormous amount of time spent trying to get this article up as policy, and the time just spent trying to get this poll off the ground, it would be not only foolish to not take advantage of it, it would be a serious waste of everyone's time. What's the point in the community providing opinions if this is being treated like a raise-your-hands-and -tally vote? <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 06:45, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>I totally agree. Especially because, although the meaning of a "Support" vote is quite clear, the meaning of an "Oppose" vote is not. Does this mean the voter prefers the status quo? If so, <i>which</i> status quo? The status quo of six months ago when there wasn't any ATT page at all?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, I would love to see if votes by "newbies", votes by experienced editors who weren't involved in the ATT project, and votes by editors who <i>were</i> involved in the ATT project line up differently. As I mentioned elsewhere, I am bothered by the claim -- <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_Community_discussion_ecd9.html#History" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Community discussion">asserted here</a> -- that 300 editors worked on the ATT project. If that's true, why weren't there 300 Support votes on the first day? Either these 300 are mythical, or some of them turned against the project after working on it. I'd love to learn why. — <span style="font: small-caps 12px times;"><a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawrence_King_e04f.html" title="User:Lawrence King">Lawrence King</a></span> <sup style="font: small-caps 10px arial; color: #129dbc;">(<a href="../../../l/a/w/User_talk%7ELawrence_King_1619.html" title="User talk:Lawrence King"><span style="color: #129dbc;">talk</span></a>)</sup> 06:20, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are you kidding <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a>? I sometimes wonder why we have policies like <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> when I see any new user who manages to find their way to AIN crucified instantly--they must be something suspcious, how could they <i>know</i>?<br />
<br />
A new editor, makes a mistake, or gets a welcome message on their talk page and so they are pointed to WP:V, or WP:NOR and they find out about this poll. You think that new editors aren't capable of spending hours reading the old policy pages and the new policy pages and the poll page and voting? You think that they aren't capable of realizing that if this is one of the first things that they are pointed to, and it could be changed, they might want to pay attention? Or maybe, they became Wikipedians because they were outright curious. The click click disease. How are they any different from us? We came first, we came earlier and have some claim that they do not? <b>You can't judge an opinion on it's merit</b> anyway, it's an opinion. Why aren't we clammoring to throw out the opinions from the people who clearly didn't read the policies-who admitted as such, or who disregarded major things? Because we would have to drawn the line somewhere and we have no place to draw it, except at the cold hard facts of <i>when</i> a user created an account and how many edits they have. Even though you can see nothing of a user from those facts.<br />
<br />
We're commenting right and left about how such and such is or isn't easier for newbies to understand. Why don't we listen to them instead? Oh, because they can't possibly have a good understand of policy or comment on it in a meaningful way. <b>If that's true, then the whole arguement about what is and isn't easier for newbies to understand is bull</b>, because by definition, newbies can't understand, and they can't even comment meaningfully of what they do or don't understand.<br />
<br />
<b>This poll needs newbies</b>, because these are the policy pages we send newbies to. We send them to NOR and V and RS, and some editors have started sending them to ATT. During the time that this poll was and is going on, new users have been sent to these pages in droves and will continue to be. The more involved ones will end up here. We should be welcomming them, asking them, begging them for their opinions, instead of once again disregarding them as the lower class of Wikipedia. We cannot claim that these pages are for newbies, and be unwilling to listen to them. If we do, then these pages are not really <i>for</i> newbies, but for us, so that we can lecture and prescribe and prosthelytize without caring whether or not they understand or agree.</p>
<p>Also, this poll never says that users must have had a certain number of edits before the opening of the poll, or must be a -------- old. No requirements were placed beforehand, which means that discounting these opinions, especially since this is an OPINION POLL and NOT A VOTE, seems to me to be a serious violation of WP:BITE. New accounts that seem suspect in some other manner should be looked at in re various puppetries, but if they are not suspect for some other clearly definable reason, then punishing these accounts (for showing up here) in any way, including by ignoring their opinions here would be at least a violation of WP:BITE. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 08:18, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>Miss Mondegreen, even if you were correct that the NOR / V / RS / ATT pages were entirely "for newbies", it hardly follows that newbies should be voting on their content. Should college students vote on the content of college textbooks? I agree with you up to a point: it is very valuable for newbies to comment on whether these pages are <i>understandable</i> and <i>clear</i>. But that's not the same as having them alter their fundamental content. Should newbies be allowed to fundamentally alter the meaning of NPOV?</dd>
<dd>Moreover, I don't think it's really true that these pages are "for newbies". NPOV is a simple concept, although difficult to do in practice. But NOR is a very complicated concept. The article <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Masonic_Party_d281.html" title="Anti-Masonic Party">Anti-Masonic Party</a> contains the sentence "The highest elected office ever held by a member of the party was that of a governor." How did the editor know this? If he or she found it in a book, then it's attributable. But if he or she discovered this fact by perusing a list of elected officials in American history, <i>that would be original research</i>.</dd>
<dd>So I submit that the fact that OR can be found in a huge fraction of Wikipedia articles proves that the NOR policy confounds and confuses even the most senior Wikipedians. Ergo, the debate about merging NOR into ATT is not just a newbie-related issue. — <span style="font: small-caps 12px times;"><a href="../../../l/a/w/User%7ELawrence_King_e04f.html" title="User:Lawrence King">Lawrence King</a></span> <sup style="font: small-caps 10px arial; color: #129dbc;">(<a href="../../../l/a/w/User_talk%7ELawrence_King_1619.html" title="User talk:Lawrence King"><span style="color: #129dbc;">talk</span></a>)</sup> 08:40, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I didn't say that these pages were <i>just</i> for newbies. But I'm concerned that a large section of people's openions etc. have been focused on these pages in terms of newbie usability, which quite frankely newbies should be commenting on.<br />
<br /></dd>
<dd>While newbies may not be able to comment from experience about the details of policy, they are certainly capable of understanding it and arguing for or against something--only other users will take these comments with a grain of salt. Likewise, comments on how newbies will approach these pages should be taken with a very large grain of salt coming from non-newbies. I saw a lot of comments saying, "this will be better/worse for newbies", as though they had some data or insights on how newbies would deal, instead of speaking from their own experience. For the record, I commented on newbies being able to deal with ATT because I personally found ATT more confusing than the previous policies, and assumed that that wouldn't differ much with experience, especially less experience. I firmly believe that <b>we should talk about what we know, and not automatically assume that newbies don't.</b><br />
<br /></dd>
<dd>In re textbooks--students and professors do get consulted about textbooks. Students fill out professor evaluations. Think about all of the places where you are asked for or can offer your opinion. In re textbooks, professors can comment on their experience, and on differing student scores/student responses that they recieved, but past that, the student experience can be gotten from students, not teachers.<br />
<br /></dd>
<dd>Also, the difference between recently created accounts and older accounts isn't the difference between student and professor. The range of knowledge, experience and everything else between these editors doesn't fall along account creation lines, but life experience, IQ and a million other things.<br />
<br /></dd>
<dd><b>I'm <i>not</i> saying I have a problem with marking new editor comments as such</b>--it's simply an additional piece of information to have when looking at the poll. But I do have an issue if that is the only marking of new editor comments that is going to be done. For starters, I would personally find it much more helpful if all of the users who had been involved in ATT were marked--it's data that's harder for me to quickly check, and data that in my opinion means something.<br />
<br /></dd>
<dd><b>Only marking new editor votes/opinions <i>does</i> imply something about their validity, whereas if x, y, and z are marked, it becomes simply marking to provide additional data</b> (to be interpreted by user), and presenting data as ____ yes, _______ no, _______ new editors voted, _________ editors involved in the project voted, etc is really providing people additional data to help understand the overall results, especially in terms of participation. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 10:08, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

<dd>What will marking ATT contributors prove beyond the obvious fact that most of them are likely to support? We could just as easily mark people who didn't contribute in order to suggest they don't understand the page as well. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 10:16, 2 April 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, that's part of the point, to the extent of looking at percentages really. The poll is to get opinions from the community because the community wasn't involved in ATT. If the final numbers are 1000 voting either way, but 600 of the Yes votes had at least one ATT touch, and 100 of the No votes had at least one ATT touch, then the community that wasn't aware of ATT, that wasn't involved voted 400-900. To the extent of individual voting, we can see how people who were a part of the process perceived the process to have worked, and what they think of the end product.</dd>
<dd>If you mark everyone who did contribute, by default, you've marked everyone who hasn't, and if you need to have contributed to a page to understand it, then the page fails in entirety. 300 people is it contributed to the page, but that page would be used by the entire Wikipedia community. If only the 300 who contributed understand it, we need a different page for the rest of the community--those 300 can go on using it, that's fine, but the rest of the community needs something else. We write for readers, not writers. Keep that in mind.

<dd>You may be interested in reading my comment <a href="#breakdown.3F_--_in_re_the_closing_committee_idea" title="">#breakdown? -- in re the closing committee idea</a>. I think in particular the ATT breakdown of votes is really important--this opinion poll is to find out how the rest of the community feels. But, since vote tagging is going to be done, I think that only tagging newbie votes is WP:BITE, and I think that I'd gain a lot from being able to know if the person voting was a newbie or involved in ATT or an admin. I really don't understand the bizarre focus on newbies, especially here, at a poll so many newbies are going to find. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 11:22, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</b></dd>

There are plenty of people who are experienced with taking all this into account, but the thing to do now we've come so far is just let the data come in without any appearance of tampering with it. I suggest we go and edit some articles for a few days or do whatever we do in real life. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 11:12, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I certainly hope that the information won't disappear. Though at least a bit of it has. Does anyone else favor putting back in the two removed comments? That is, the two that we know of recently? As I pointed out before, I'm opposed to the merge, but don't favor removing comments that disagree with my view, because it doesn't seem to serve the interests of fair play.<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 12:01, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that we should be concerned about sockpuppets, and puppet votes should indeed be checked and removed no matter how they voted. However, we should not remove any thing based on suspicion... We must have <i>confirmation</i> that a vote is indeed a puppet vote before removal. As for Newbies ... I don't see any reason to deny them a voice in this. When the Poll is over, I would love to see some statistical data on the results - what percent for or against were new editors, old editors, admins, etc. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 12:56, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Guys, only thing that should be removed are comments threaded. We can flag new accounts... but nothing should be removed.

<p>There's also the issue of "sleeper accounts". I'm certain I saw an Oppose last night from an account that had six edits back in November, and then about 50 edits since the poll was announced. Hard to know how to interpret those, considering AGF. I thought it was red-linked at the time, but it may have changed, so I doubt I can find it again. Anyway, since the "poll" isn't a "vote" or "tally", I suppose it doesn't much matter; the comments have been instructive. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 15:04, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, that's normal. The database is not robust under simultaneous edits, so sometimes one gets overwritten by the next (the diff hides this because they both start with "Support").

<dd>That's interesting--I had the edit window open for awhile, but before I posted I hit refresh, copy/pasted in my comment, and then clicked save. The contents of the edit box didn't change when I hit refresh, and I didn't get an edit conflict message, so I assumed that by some random chance no one added a support in the 50 minutes between my vote and the one that appeared above mine. Is there another way to check other than looking at the history? Would purging (instead of refresh) do the trick?

<dd>I disagree I think that deleting right away gives the people the time to respond to the deletion if they are not sockpuppets. Also, the people involved have done a great job of using the watchlist to promote it so the big response is no surprise. On the central limit theorem, I have to ask (rhetorically) why scientific polling is used instead of straw polling? A weak convergence theorem should not take precedence over important variables in practical polling as opposed to theoretical polling. A possible variable being that angry disenters are more driven to action than content defendents and thus vote earlier. It should however take away systematic advantages if we keep this poll open long enough.--<a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJorfer_9f56.html" title="User:Jorfer">JEF</a> 23:06, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

How to teach people, and in particular those who don't know already, what encyclopedias in general find acceptable, and what Wikipedia specifically finds acceptable, as regards sources, verifiability, fact checking, etc. The real problem with Wikipedia is that minority views on how to write an encyclopedia can get a traction if not kept in check. A lot of people out there follow the herd. If they see things being done a particular way, they will copy it. Spreading good practice is great, but avoiding the spread of bad practice is just as important. The point raised a long way above about some active editors missing the point about "truth" and "verifiability" is a case in point. Somewhere along the line they got the wrong impression. The layout and structure of the policy pages, and more importantly the day-to-day interaction among editors, is a vital part of the enculturation process that makes sure we are all on the same page, and that we all 'get' the core policies. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 00:28, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Could not agree more, Carcharoth. This discussion has been an eye opener for me in that regard (and hope that for others as well). No matter how much we <i>assume</i> that our core policies are understood, the fact is that they aren't. So if anything, our policies need to be clarified in a active manner. Writing a policy and assuming that everybody understands it and applies it consistently is another matter altogether. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 00:33, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's to be expected, I'm afraid. Back when I joined Wikipedia in 2003 the community was small enough to get agreement on things like this without too much trouble. We're orders of magnitude bigger now but our governance hasn't kept pace. Imagine how difficult it would be to get any legislation through Congress if you had to consult 300 million people! I'm seriously thinking we need to delegate this sort of decision-making - elect a council (WikiParliament?) of experienced users to take such decisions on the community's behalf. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 02:18, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>These things are normally self-selecting, in that the people who are interested in a certain policy tend to edit it, which means they learn about it, which means they learn how to express it better, and so on. The thing that made this different is that Jimbo turned up and asked for a poll, and that means people who have literally no idea (no disrespect, but I'm sorry, it's true) have turned up with opinions. In a way it's good, because it does show what we've been saying all along — that people are confused by NOR and V, the latter in particular. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 02:22, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Self-selection only works up to a point, I think. It's actually still going on - nobody has been forced to vote on the poll because of Jimbo's intervention. The influx of new voters is due to people <i>becoming interested</i> in a policy they've taken for granted (and misunderstood!). The problem is that many people are voting on something that they don't understand or are doing so for political reasons. I've seen the same thing happen on many AfDs where people vote their POV rather than on the basis of actual policies. This is just a bigger example of the same thing. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 02:41, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>The real problem with Wikipedia is that minority views on how to write an encyclopedia can get a traction if not kept in check.</b> Agreed. Although it might not really be such real problem now, but it will stifle future development. I am convinced that such minority views already have traction (especially with regard to “notability”). I would blame confusion on the excessive number of creepy policies/guidelines. There are too many. But cutting back on the core policies is the wrong thing to do.

<dd>I think that "attributability" does have advantages over "verifiabiity", though I'm surprised that so many people find the idea of "verifiability" so hard. It's obviously a term of art, and I think I picked up its specialised meaning <i>fairly</i> quickly when I started here. If the merger fails, I still think we should explore moving to the "attributability" language, rather than the "verifiability" language. I am, however, less keen on having "verifiability"/"attributability" in the same policy as NOR. For that purpose, I think "attributability" is worse, and it's even worse when the whole policy is called "attribution" - it just tends to suggest that NOR is merely a special case of attributability, or the flipside of it, i.e. NOR is just to rule out people putting in stuff that is not attributable. That is <i>part</i> of NOR, and where it overlaps with attributability, or verifiability, or whatever. But NOR is a very powerful concept in its own right with a different basis from verifiability/attributability. It's the powerful idea that we're not here to put forward our own "picture" of the world, as experienced or theorised by us, whether or not all the facts on which our theory is based can be cited individually. That concept really has to be understood in its own right, and of course it will often be a matter of judgment - and there are places where it's more critical than others because of BLP concerns.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm wondering whether we couldn't get the best of both worlds by keeping the more concise, and in some ways more clear, language of current-form-ATT, but dividing it across two documents - a new-ATT document (to replace the Verifiability policy) and a separate NOR document (with appropriate cross-references, since the two ideas do work together and have some overlap). It may be no easier to get consensus on this than on current-form-ATT - in fact it may be totally unrealistic, politically - but can anyone else see an attraction in it? <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 05:28, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I see what you're saying, but most of the point of ATT was to get those ideas on one page, in part so that people would be more likely to find and read it, and in part because it was felt that, in showing the close relationship of attribution to the concept of original research, we would actually help to highlight the difference — unattributed = unsourced; but unattributable = original research. Your vocabulary of us not being allowed to project our own picture of the world is very powerful and clear, but I felt we could explain that on the same page — there must be a source for <i>that precise picture</i>, not just sources for its individual components. It's a concept that huge numbers of editors struggle with, including experienced ones. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 08:07, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I couldn't agree more with the sentiments in the last half of that. As for the first half, if I thought it would work that way, i.e. having just one page would help to highlight the difference, I'd be converted to supporting ATT strongly instead of being slightly iffy about it. Not that the change in my vote would make much difference. The way I see it, there is a lot of good work that's been done here, and a lot of good discussion has been triggered by Jimbo's actions (along with a lot of unhelpful statements and actions, of course, but that's life). ATT won't achieve consensus, but it will probably have some sort of majority support, maybe about 60:40 or more like 55:45. That should provide a mandate for thinking about what might sensibly be done with all the good work and comments so far. (All assuming no one is going to bite the bullet and declare ATT to be "home" with that sort of margin.) <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 09:35, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) There's a lot I agree with in that (Metamagician's post). I saw some comment or other in the poll saying something like "<b>Support</b>, but rename it 'Verification'". I thought to myself, there's a germ of an idea in there, off-base as it was phrased. If they were to be merged, just call it <i>Verifiability</i>, WP:V, and redir WP:NOR to the NOR section of it. The problem with "attribution"/"attributability" is that if I invent a new theory that the Earth is trapezoidal, you can in fact <i>attribute</i> that theory to me. But no one anywhere is going to publish jack-squat about it, so it isn't verifiable even as a theory, much less the truth. Yes, yes, I know that ATT redefines the word <i>attributable</i> in-context to (attempt to? some have doubts...) be the same as what WP means by "verifiable", but that's beside the point. If anything, the many, many editors who will not read any policy in-depth if at all will mistake "verifiability" for meaning "demonstrability of truth" (i.e. a <i>more</i> stringent standard than we are actually applying), while the same people will mistake "attributabilty" to mean "ability to pin an originator's name on it, whether they are notable or not, whether there is any proof of this attribution or not", i.e. a <i>less</i> stringent standard that we are actually calling for. I think the latter spells massive trouble. This has been gnawing at me for some time, but really came into focus just now with what Metamagician said. In the minds of the average personage, material that is OR is "attributable", but it's not "verifiable". So, I don't agree particular with Metamagician's disagreement that V can subsume NOR, and instead posit that ATT can't subsume NOR <i>with the intended effect</i>, because of its name and terminology. Keep RS as an agument to the new-V (V+NOR), a guideline suggesting that if your sources aren't established, notability isn't established either, and your material will encounter resistance. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 08:10, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, it's explained clearly that we mean attributable to a reliable, published source, not just to any old person. I'm not clear how you're using the word "verify." You don't mean "attributable," but you also (I'm assuming) don't mean "to confirm as true," because that's not what we're about. You mean something in between, but I'm not quite grasping it.</dd>
<dd>I did consider other names. <a href="../../../s/o/u/Wikipedia%7ESource_b4c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Source">Wikipedia:Source</a> was an option, as was <a href="../../../i/n/f/Wikipedia%7EInformation_quality_fb17.html" title="Wikipedia:Information quality">Wikipedia:Information quality</a> (which I liked because the shortcut could be <a href="../../../i/q/_/WP%7EIQ_1694.html" title="WP:IQ">WP:IQ</a>, which would be appropriate. It's not so much the title that's the issue, as the core concept, and verifiability just isn't right, because we don't in fact go around confirming things as true, except in the sense that it's true that A says X, but that's attribution. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 08:18, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm a bit befuddled by these questions, since what I said already answered them before they were asked. Hmm. The short version: I <i>don't</i> mean something in the middle, and am not talking about policy changes. ATT and V say the same thing (more or less). <i>I personally</i> don't mean anything by "verify". I'm not one of the "truth" camp; I'm simply observing the fact that they (along with the opposing "but my garage band is notable, since it was written up in the <i>Podunk Times</i> and my school newspaper!" and "my alien invasion theory is encyclopedic because the 50 copies of my self-published-at-Kinko's book says so" camps) exist, and factoring this into a psychological topography. My point was, given that we know that many active editors do not actually read and/or understand the policies, it is better to use a term that will be <i>misinterpreted narrowly</i> (verification - "Hmm, my neighbor's nutty theory hasn't actually be proven, maybe it's not 'verifiable'... [FUD]") than one that will be misinterpreted broadly (attribution - "this nutty theory can be "attributed" [not reliably, of course] to my neighbor, so it is good-to-go!") I'm talking about word meaning and interpretation, and their psychological effects on non-expert WP editors, not about what the policy really says or means.

<p>I have a theory (that anyone who knows anything about real-world polls can back) that the +/- order of the poll is skewing the results.

<dd>Those arguments don't wash. If you "shouldn't have to touch it", then <i>stop</i>. No one is forcing to you revert anything, and you said you'd unwatchlisted this anyway. The fact that I've voted has nothing to do with whether I can and should address bias in the poll. A simple change of order is an apples and oranges comparison to altering the header text of the survey. Let's not be silly. Is there a more plausible reason for not making the poll a fair shake? What is seemly about preserving an order that either <i>is</i> biasing the poll, or <i>doesn't matter at all</i>? — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 08:28, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Once the poll has started, there can't be any changes to the questions, the form, the order, or the timetable. It must just be left alone.

<dd><span id="snorkel">Says</span> who? Says what policy? I agree that the text of the questions can't change (or the early responses would be rendered non-responsive), and people's non-Y/N responses can't be refactored into 10 different iffy variants of "not Y/N", but I don't see anyone but you saying that the order can't change, and more than one have said that the timetable <i>should</i> change. You are not speaking for everyone here. Anyway, you are simply recycling the same "Every day there's something being discussed about changing the order, changing the headers, closing early, or whatever. It's unseemly." argument without adding anything new at all. Reiteration of an old argument does not make a proper response to an additional argument that refutes the old one.</dd>
<dd>Also, please keep in mind that this is not a&#160;!vote on a <i>proposal</i>, in which case keeping the Y vote at the top throughout might make sense (though I question even that).

<dd>Listen, there is <b>no</b> conversation here. Once a poll opens - and it doesn't matter what the pol is, this is a basic principle! - we do NOT screw with the format, wording, or process.

Just so we are clear about bias, I personally dislike <i>many</i> aspects about the wording and format of the poll. <i>It doesn't matter</i>. People have already voted.

<dd>Given that there is self-evidently a conversation here, and coming from someone who spent all day after the poll opened gnashing at other voters on the poll despite the poll saying not to do that, that doesn't really mean much. I'm <i>not</i> "screwing with" the format, the wording or the process. There was <i>not</i>, by the way (this is a total side issue) ample time for discussion before the process; a handful of activitistic editors sabotaged consensus-building by launching the poll early with wording that had no consensus at all (i.e. a text-book example of "screwing with the process"). Of course people have already voted. That's the point. Nothing is being changed mid-course, other than balancing something that is skewed, in a way that has <i>zero</i> effect on the poll's wording, introduction, tagging, heading names, voting format, instructions, notes, fonts, colors, etc. (its "format" in your terms), <i>zero</i> effect on votes already cast, <i>zero</i> effect on people's willingness to vote (unlike your "bash every vote I disagree with" spree), <i>zero effect</i> on its "wording". Oh, and believe me, I intend to ensure that the closers of this are well aware "once the poll closes" and we "discuss and debate the meaning of the results" that ATT proponent resistance was tooth-and-nail and (so far) unjustifiable with any rational explanation, to a minor twiddle that could not possibly have any result other than more fairness or <i>no effect</i> at all.

When I was corrected (by being refactored/comments mored to talk page) I did not revert or argue, because I understood that I was mistaken. That said, the issue I raised was and is of great importance to Wikipedia and needed to be raised. Now have we dispensed with your ad hominem comments? Can we return to the issue at hand?

It was not my intent to actually dismiss your arguments, just to say "get off the high horse"; I think you'll note I actually did address your arguments on their merits. I also realize you were speaking idiomatically, but the specific choice of wording ("conversation" rather than "real issue" or some other word or phrase) seemed intended to dissuage discussion. On to the issue at hand: I disagree with your definition of "format", then. "Simply shouldn't be done": I repeat my question for the third time: Says who? Says what policy? No one's even made an argument that there is a <i>loose tradition</i> to not balance polls by periodically inverting their voting order (in the real world this is of course handled by having polls and ballots printed in two batches of equal number, with opposite ordering). This is just your and SlimVirgin's personal opinion that things "shouldn't be screwed with", regardless what any reasons might be (I question the logical defensibility of that position). If you would, as you say, take this position about any poll, then I am skeptical that you understand how subtle bias in polls works. (NB: Since we've already had an "ad hominem" disagreement, I stress that I'm saying that you appear to me personally to be missing some information/experience/understanding in this area, not that you are stupid, intent on biasing the poll, or anthing else stronger that what I'm actually saying.

<dd>My first impression, when I came to the poll page, was that there is some implied bias in the wording (the background goes to lengths to describe how much work was put into the merger, by how many people, the fact that it's been given policy status, and it quotes JW as praising the "good work" that was done, without describing his reservations about the result). I also questioned the decision to put the Support comments and Support essay first in order, with the Oppose comments and Oppose essay following. I decided, never the less, to keep my hands off the page and its format, simply to avoid igniting a revert war. I think the idea to reverse the order is a fair one, but without wide support for such a decision, it will probably serve the process better to leave the page unedited, while vocally expressing your opposition to the chosen format.<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 09:40, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>SMc, I think the frustration that people are having is that you're looking for new topics to flood this talk page regarding. This is a non-issue, and post-hoc rearrangements are not a good idea.

<dd>What a highly unusual set of things to say. This is the first new topic I've added to this page since March 31 (4 days ago), which was <a href="#Fix_order_of_backgrounders" title="">#Fix order of backgrounders</a>, a totally neutral topic (and note that no one objected to "altering the format" then, even though the poll was well under way.) There is no "flood" of new topics here; this page, though a bit chatty, has a remarkable stability to it given the contentiousness of the issues. It doesn't even have a single post-poll-start archive page yet. If it were a non-issue, the response level thus far would not be 4-2 against, 1 neutral, and a long thread after only an hour or so. Of course the poll is slowing down; it's more than half over. The implication that the poll is <i>radically</i> slowing down (or perhaps that is just my inference from what you said, not your implication) is self-evidently false. The votes have been coming in, in droves (not in the last few of hours, but the vast majority of North America, which makes up the bulk of en.wikipedia editors, are fast asleep; it will pick up again in the morning on this side of the Pond). Let it finish? I've already conceded on that point, though I still think Kim Bruning is right that continuing is a waste of time; I really don't care though, and haven't commented further on that matter in over 24 hours. Why would we want the poll to shut up? Or do you mean me? If either of those were intended, I think that comment would be way out-of-line and pointlessly antagonistic. If you meant <i>us all</i> shut up, why? Others seem to think the topic immediately above this one is very good, and there are other active discussions on the page. Re: the post-hoc-rearrangements-are-bad idea, that is too categorical a statement. For the <i>fourth</i> time now, what authority, of any kind, says so, with regard to addressing bias in a poll, in a way that does not render any extant comments moot or otherwise @#$% with the poll's introduction, the wording of the questions, the wording of the categories, etc.? No one seems able or willing to address this incredibly simple question.</dd>

<dd>This thread is long because you're posting multiple 100 word responses to everything said. We don't need to make changes <i>in medias res</i>; it's bad methodology. And we certainly don't need to make a change on the supposition that people are so stupid they're going to choose support because it comes first on the page. Re bias in general, the whole idea of ATT was gravely handicapped because of Jimbo's intervention. Making a case for the merger is not tilting things—it's balancing them.</dd>

<dd>I did answer your question: the supposition that people are so stupid as to choose the first header they see is inane. There's a TOC on the page: it offers broad support and broad opposition as choices. You click the link. You hit edit. You scroll to the bottom. You post your comment. Easy. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 11:00, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Given that people are submitting <i>comments</i> rather than just votes (and any bare votes probably won't be counted much anyway), I guess I fail to see the problem. Even if someone <i>did</i> accidentally post a comment like "ATT is a terrible idea because..." under the support section, it would be obvious they intended to oppose and would be counted as such. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a></sup></small> 11:09, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Changing the order of the choices after the poll has started is simply bizarre. I've never seen that done anywhere. Even apart from the idea of changing, I've never seen a poll that had "no" before "yes". Think of the RfA votes, for example. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElinorD_4da6.html" title="User:ElinorD">ElinorD</a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EElinorD_6fce.html" title="User talk:ElinorD">(talk)</a> 13:14, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>There was a reason at the end of the discussion I was heck-bent to make the poll/survey just be, "Hey, what do YOU think?" with each person adding one new self-contained section with the new section function, and no one but that person being allowed to edit in each user's little box for the 7 days.&#160;;) Who actually added the support/oppose/etc breakdown after launch? - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 13:22, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Keeping support section first whole time is biasing poll.

<dd>The necessity of this StrawPoll has nothing to do with Jimbo. In my opinion, an empirical measure of "consensus," such as in this StrawPoll is crucial to avoid the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federalist_No._10_e2c3.html#The_question_of_faction" title="Federalist No. 10">destructiveness of faction</a>, as exemplified by the false claims of "consensus" for the so-called "merger" to <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. Such a StrawPoll may or may not have symbolic meaning in terms of <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justice.html#Justice_as_mutual_agreement" title="Justice">fairness, regularity, or stability</a>. We don't know how the community would assess "fairness" on closing this StrawPoll yet, do we? In any case, to be viewed as "legitimate" rather than "manipulated," it might be a good idea if the poll would remain open for the period of time it was announced and, in a sense, promised to be open. --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> 12:37, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The objective outcome of the poll is "no consensus", since we have &gt;<a href="../../../1/0/0/WP%7E100_d2fb.html" title="WP:100">WP:100</a> people supporting each and every possible position. (see elsewhere on this page). I was then told that this poll was not meant to be a decision making poll at all (as summarised above), so that's eliminated in at least 2 different ways. Note that there is no motive to manipulate a poll when there are no stakes involved. --<a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKim_Bruning_2d0e.html" title="User:Kim Bruning">Kim Bruning</a> 12:47, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The question of "consensus" may be settled, I would agree. And perhaps you are correct in your assessment that most of the community would look at an early closing as entirely legitimate and fair. This would be the time for everyone to speak up.

<p>When polling, it's customary to give half the polling population the questionaire with one option first and half with the other option first just in case that difference is not negligible. Believe it or not, people will vote based on order of questions.</p>
<p>Yes, this is an opinion poll, but not everyone who comes here will go and read all of the policies in question and both statements. Some users may rely on looking at other users votes--like looking at a talk page. When you get to the page, what you see in what order certainly affects your opinion--users have been commenting in reply or support or opposition of other users opinions and we know that they aren't reading all of the votes on the page. What a user sees has some effect. Whether it has any effect numerically, we don't know, and we won't know unless this poll is conducted properly.</p>
<p>No offence to the people at ATT, but the creation of ATT and the merge and this poll have been filled with controversy, and I don't understand why when this has come up, you aren't doing this simple thing to prevent additional controversy now. I read the replies and all I saw was mud-slinging and people saying that formatting shouldn't be changed post poll-start.</p>
<p>I'll be honest, I have problems with ATT and my biggest problem with this whole thing is how it's been done. You don't need to be a genuis to see that the background section on the poll page is POV, IMO, and this recent edit war is just another example of what I see as a major problem.</p>
<p>This issue--a legitimate one has been raised. No particular reason not to do it has been given in response. This is a chance for ATT editors to respond to the claims that they are pushing other editors out, and forcing their opinions by letting an edit that, unless they believe their votes come from people going "oooh, first" doesn't affect them. If ATT editors succeed in keeping this edit from going through, it's one more mark against ATT, the poll, and a mark against the poll results.</p>
<p>I think that the order of Yes and No, both sectionally and in re the essays should be switched. If you disagree, please say why--not just "leave it as is". I'm asking for a reason that we shouldn't do this, a reason important enough that it would take precedence over normal polling procedures.</p>
<p>There is a reason that we use control groups. It's so we know that the results we have are acurate. If we are going to purposefully avoid using one, we should have a good reason. I am very frustrated here--this isn't a big issue to me, but I'm annoyed at how the burden of proof for this edit taking place is somehow on the user(s) who want this edit to take place, when a user made an edit and provided a reason and now has editors who agree with the edit and the reasoning behind it, and while their are editors who disagree with the edit, no reasoning, other than "we shouldn't touch the page" has been provided. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 12:13, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>Edit conflict with Kim. But to respond to KB - it doesn't happen often, but any poll involving a policy is likely to be very long, so this is wroth discussing .... I suggest that this discussion be raised as a general point about how to run policy polls (I specify policy only because these are the polls that attract the largest number of voters; I wouldn't object to addressing all polls) and if it realy is as unobjectionable as some people think, we will henceforth have a new method for running polls. I just think in principle it is a bad idea to change "the rules" - any rules <i>once the polling has started.</i> To be clear, i am not objecting to your suggestion (or SMcCandish's) <i>in principle</i>. The only thing I object to is raising it now. If it had been raised prior to the poll, we could have discussed it and made a decision. And I won't object at all to you or McCandish raising this as a possible new standard of practice for all <i>future</i> polls. But we have talked this issue to death, we had a lot of talk prior to the poll. let this poll run. Wanna discuss better ways to poll? May I suggest that you and others work up a proposed guideline for polls? Perhaps others have good ideas. Let's learn from all sorts of mistakes that may have occured from the moment this particular poll was suggested until now. I am all for that. I just oppose instituting a new set of guidelines, procedures, anything, once a poll has started. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 12:35, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

My main quibble about the above is "if it had been raised prior to the poll". We hadn't even gotten to that point, or even agreed on what the poll should say, when it was oligilaterally (if I can make up a word) started prematurely. There hasn't been <i>any choice</i> but to bring it up after-the-fact. I understand the "once it has started" objection, I just think this is an unusal case to which that rationale, which I would normally support, may not apply. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 12:53, 3 April 2007 (UTC)

<p>I appreciate the comments, and for people mostly keeping a cool head, but my point remains--no one really has a reason <i>not</i> to do it.</p>
<p>The only things that were raised as objections are</p>
<ul>
<li>no precedent</li>
<li>wasn't raised before polls start</li>
<li>unnecessary</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I listed several reasons to do, only one of which had to with the actual affect on the outcome of the poll. The other issues have to do with pretending that there isn't serious conflict, and since this is a really minor issue and one which there's been no big reason not to do it--it's an easy issue to let go, an easy place to say, "we did x, y, and z, to make sure all was fair"</p>
<p>I'm worried that even the minor, easy issues where the only things that can be raised are quite frankly petty and irrelevant are being squashed.</p>
<p>One side had a content issue, was worried about the outcome of the poll, and the other side said, "well you should have said something earlier"--that's really troublesome.</p>
<p>Also, I wasn't aware about the poll before it started, because contrary to the wonderful description in the first paragraph on the poll page, this was not well publicized, and that's one of the big problems.</p>
<p>And, dividing things up by random sections for ease of use doesn't work well and makes no sense. These divisions work well, are the way polls are usually conducted, and give editors a chance to see what others are saying without wading through everything. This proposal isn't going through, and it's one of the least of the problems with this poll, but another problem wasn't necessary and something could have been done about it.</p>
<p>Just because it hasn't been done before, or things aren't going well anyway, doesn't mean we shouldn't do the best we can now. "I don't really think it's necessay"--"we didn't do it last time"--"there's no consensus anyway"--that's basically what most people were saying and that's a terrible attitude. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 00:27, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>And I want to AGF, but the insistence on changing the format NOW for being biased after he was the one HE instituted... it seems wrong with this wording. Why didn't he say, "Hey, I made a mistake, here, can we undo my mistake in formatting?" rather than, "Three of you stuck it up our Wiki butts with the poll formatting!" essentially. Its hurtful to me after all the hard work put in because it makes it out like we tried to do harm. The poll format <i>we</i> launched was literally: Hey, what do you think?

<dd>WThuh? (edit conflict x3; I mean Denny, not Marskell). I am either losing my mind, am asleep and dreaming, or have phase-shifted into another dimension. <i>The sectioning was Denny's idea, not mine</i>: <a href="#Restart_poll.2C_Watchlist_notification" title="">#Restart poll, Watchlist notification</a>. I <i>implemented</i> it (in terms that have largely stayed as is, so I guess they were pretty reasonable; I think the only change has been "/other" being added to the end of the neutral/etc. section by Pmanderson[?]) because someone (you, Denny) requested it be done, and I didn't mind taking the heat if someone wanted to angrily revert me. No more, no less. This is just <i>too</i> absurd, in the deepest senses of that word, for me to participate here any longer today. Well, OK, to quickly respond to the <i>Twilight Zone</i> question before backing away warily: I thought everyone would play fair. I put the <b>Support</b> section first at that time as a show of good faith, because the ATT proponents were being <a href="../../../p/a/n/WP%7EPANIC_b042.html" title="WP:PANIC">WP:PANICky</a> and were way too revert-happy. I never thought I'd meet armed resistance inverting it halfway(ish) through the poll to even things out. Goose, gander, and all 'at. Anyway, I'm outta here for a while. This bite-the-hand-that-feeds by DennyColt is a BJAODN candidate. PS: To SV: The fact that I installed the sections doesn't have anything to do with the issue of what order they are in at any given point in time. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 13:49, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>PS: Please stop it with the "change the format" stuff. This has nothing to do with formatting. Also you are engaging the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a>; I never said WP:ATT proponents chose the order of the sections; as Rednblu said, <i>I</i> did.

Don't put words in my mouth please. At least not so blatantly.

<dd>Denny suggested sections, but it was you who added support/oppose/neutral, which you're now complaining about. That's what we're finding confusing.

<dd>I really <i>am</i> in the Twilight Zone. "Random" headers? In a poll? What, like "Chicken" and "Snorkel" and "Mu"? READ THE ORIGINAL POST. <b>Denny</b> asked for the votes to be resorted into sections to avoid a free-for-all (i.e. to avoid, specifically, "retain[ing] the comments/votes in a mix".) <i>You</i> (SV) all along have advocated a Y/N simple poll. Numerous others wanted at least something other than Y/N. I compromised; you and Denny got what you wanted, people with compromise, neutral or qualified positions got (more or less) what they wanted. No one complained, other than much later after the fact someone wanted to make the not-Y/N section be umpteen sections and got reverted. Do you either of you two realize you are totally pantsing yourselves, repeatedly? Just stop, for everyone's sake. You've made a totally bogus accusation due to heat-of-the-moment short term memory loss. Own up, get over it, everyone will forgive you, and move on. And again, please actually read what I say; I am not "complaining about" the section names. I'm "complaining" about the fact that ATT proponents cannot tolerate the idea of two of the three sections trading places for a while to eliminate any chance of ordering being a bias. You ought to be embracing the idea. I really am signing off now.

<dd>Random section breaks as we do in DRV. People could still say yes or no or not sure, as they saw fit, but my idea was not to split those comments up into support/oppose sections. It was you who did that. And it is you who is now complaining about it. As I said above, this is what is confusing people.

This discussion is appalling.

People should not need to be watching the poll page like hawks, and I shouldn't feel like I'm going to have the wool pulled over my eyes unless I go through the diffs myself. In re Elinor--striking through isn't necessary, IMO as long as refactoring notes exist, which they don't anymore. Also, strikethroughs are very hard for some people to read. <b><a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiss_Mondegreen_925d.html" title="User:Miss Mondegreen">Miss Mondegreen</a> | <a href="../../../m/i/s/User_talk%7EMiss_Mondegreen_a6d2.html" title="User talk:Miss Mondegreen">Talk</a> &#160; 00:05, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</b></p>

<dd>I sometimes see an RfA or an admin noticeboard issue that I intend to comment on, but don't want to comment on it immediately. That would be because I want to plan out what I'm going to say, not because I don't know which "side" I'm on. In the case of an RfA, I look to see the closing date; in the case of an admin noticeboard, I know that a bot can archive it if nobody has commented in that section for twenty-four hours. Quite frankly, it's annoying if I find I've forgotten about the RfA, or if someone comes along and unexpectedly archives the admin noticeboard thread before I have had a chance to participate. There could be people now who fully intend to add their voices to this poll, but who have worked out how long they have left to do so, and are still planning how exactly they are going to express their support or opposition.

<p>This topic reminds me of the war on drugs. With the rate of growth of WP and the large amount of existing uncited material, catching reference-challenged wikipedians and slapping them with attribution tags will never solve the problem. Every attribution/verifiability/NOR tag is a speck on WP's credibility. These days it seems like most articles, particularly on popular culture, are preceded by a banner headline proclaiming the article's potential inaccuracy.</p>
<p>A prevention approach would be to make adding references really easy. Right now it's very confusing for the occasional editor. A reference-creation wizard would help. Reference creation should be more foolproof and, most of all, readily available and apparent. <a href="../../../h/_/b/User%7EH_Bruthzoo_d149.html" title="User:H Bruthzoo">H Bruthzoo</a></p>

<dd>Some sort of wizard would be a great idea... but I don't know if the system would support such a thing. Why not suggest it at the Village Pump tech page? I agree that we should make adding references as easy as possible for the editor. Unfortunately, I don't think the real problem is with the ease or difficulty of adding references. I think the real problem is that many editors don't understand that references are required. I think we need to find a better way to explain this requirement to editors, old and new. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 14:38, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is a very handy tool, bainer, thanks for that. As for educating newcomers and those who never did 'get it', one thing to remember is the high turnover rate. Wikipedia doesn't want to put too much effort into educating someone who leaves after a few months. A lot of the untidy and unreferenced content is added in by a mixture of specialists (maybe), anon editors, fanboys and fangirls, people adding something about where they went on holiday, the book they've just read, the TV program they just watched, and so forth. Whether this is good or bad is debatable. But then this untidy content is improved by various grades of wikignomes. The problem tends to be finding sources. For that you need someone who has at least rudimentary knowledge of the area (I still recoil in horror when I recall seeing someone add references to an article after doing a series of Google searches and finding, in some cases, frankly unreliable websites that just regurgitated the same old, wrong, stuff). The rudimentary knowledge is required to attribute to judge which sources to use and which sources are reliable. It might help to remember that Wikipedia articles are not intended to spring, like Athena, fully formed from the head of Zeus. It helps if they do, but we shouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater if they don't. What is really needed is for dedicated editors to make some inroads into the articles tagged as unsourced, while other help slow, or at least sort, the tide of unformed contributions coming in the other end. Like a sausage machine. A pulped mess in at one end, and nicely formed (and referenced) articles out the other end. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 15:41, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Policies sum up how we do things. They are descriptive. No one has invented anything or composed anything new. It's just what we already have in a more digestible form. And slightly more slanted to a particular set of views, of course. But nothing all that major. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 00:56, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The point of freezing this specific page is to allow first an evaluation by different people on data that is not in flux and secondly to <i>act</i> on this data and evaluations of it by structuring the relevant policy pages and their contents in a way that makes sense given the data and evaluations. Then we can discuss further how to better refine <i>that</i>. It really does never end. But we must close one chapter to begin the next.

<p>I kinda suspect that a nontrivial number of the "support" votes come from people who have only a vague understanding of the issues involved. They scroll down the poll page, see repeated (and <b>bolded</b>) assertions of "Not a policy change," and assume (quite logically, actually) that merging three into one is <a href="../../../k/i/s/WP%7EKISS_4f82.html" title="WP:KISS">WP:KISS</a>, since "nothing substantive has actually been changed."</p>
<p>I have also seen "support" voters opining that many "oppose" voters were in fact ill-informed&#160;;-).</p>
<p>I also saw a table above summarizing the reasons for support/oppose.</p>
<p>I propose two dueling essays for the enlightenment of the entire community. each should only be edited by a handful of people on either side of the issue: SandyGeorgia, SlimVirgin, etc. They should <b>not</b> be open to editing by others, to prevent chaotic sprawl. The essays should present very concise summaries of the reasons given in the table "is/is not a policy change" etc. The editors of each can consult with whomever they choose, <b>including especially the editors of the essay that is the counterpart to theirs.</b></p>
<p>With these in hand, we the hoi polloi&#160;:-) will be somewhat better informed.</p>

<p>I submit that this poll is flawed in its presentation (not in its intention), for at least two reasons:</p>
<dl>
<dd>(a) since there were 300 editors working on the merge and enough of them now feel they have a consensus on the new version to suggest it replace the prior separate pages (and have agreed to proceed with this poll), that means there is likely a large portion of those 300 editors who are ready to support the merge (I could be missing something here since I wasn't involved in the editing process, but I see it as a concern). It could happen that they present a weighted presence supporting the poll, while those who oppose the merge could be more likely to be editors who did not work on the merged article and are not invested in advance in the outcome of the poll. To properly assess the community understanding and attitude towards this merge, it seems it would be appropriate for the creators of the new article to recuse themselves from the poll. (Please understand that I appreciate the hard work that went into this. All of what I am saying here is with <i>assuming good faith</i>, it's just that once that much effort has been put into something, it's hard to let go of it, as a matter of human nature, much as the way double-blind studies are needed to overcome the placebo effect... in any case, thanks for your hard work that was certainly sincere).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(b) the introduction of the poll to me seems biased towards requesting support of the merge rather than asking if it's a good idea or not. This is shown by the mention of so much work going into the new version by so many sincere editors, creating a sympathetic atmosphere (ie, one might feel guilty not to support the merge after so many have worked so hard on it), and also, Jimbo's name is invoked and used to tell us that the work on ATT has been "very good." Even if not intended that way, a quote from a person perceived (perhaps subconsciously) as an authority figure or mentor by many cannot help but influence some editors' responses. This is especially significant because in other places (as linked by SandyGeorgia in her comments: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Attribution&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116717973" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Attribution&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116717973" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Attribution&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116717056" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Attribution&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=116717056" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>), Jimbo's comments imply that he maybe does not support this merge of policy pages. To fairly use Jimbo's name in the introduction of the poll, his balancing comments should also be included there, or else he should not be invoked, so as to avoid undue influence over the responses.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Thanks for reading my comments. I appreciate the hard work and community-building intentions of everyone who has contributed to the new ATT page and all related discussions and poll responses. This is truly an amazing new kind of social structure and I feel honored to be a part of the process . <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParzival418_18da.html" title="User:Parzival418">Parzival418</a> 07:54, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am very skeptical about the myth of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_300.html" title="The 300">The 300</a>. If it were accurate, then I would have expected that a huge portion of these editors would have voted <b>Support</b> very early on in this polling process. But as you can see from the <a href="#Day_by_day_process_.28just_something_interesting.29_RUNNING_COUNT_BY_DAY" title="">daily tallies</a>, this didn't happen: the early votes were not any more in support of this plan than the votes later on. So I suspect that there was a much smaller group of devoted ATT editors -- maybe only a few dozen.</dd>

<dd>The "300" figure refers to the number of editors who made comments on the Talk page, not to the ATT page itself. Were all of these comments supportive of the ATT project? Or did some of these 300 commenters oppose the project? or did some of them simply assume it was a 'fait accompli' and were simply discussing the details. Or, for all I know, the talk page degenerated into a number of flame wars unrelated to ATT. (Yes, I know this never happens on Wikipedia talk pages, but there's always a first time.)</dd>

<dd>All polls are flawed. Certainly the intro was weighted in favour of support, but quite a few editors are opposing "per Jimbo", which means that other comments by Jimbo have weighted the poll in the opposite direction.

Most people contributing on the talk page were trying to develop the proposal, I think. However, quite a few of those people haven't voted at all, which I presume means they aren't visiting Wikipedia at the moment or haven't noticed this poll. Consensus shifts all the time on Wikipedia, and groups of interested editors vary from month to month on any page, according to whether indivuals have time for Wikipedia or not. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 12:32, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As far as Jimmy Wales' influence, I think it biases people to vote No, not to vote Yes. His two famous (or infamous) quotes that led to this poll were clearly critical of the ATT project.</p>
<p>I find this very problematic, even though I myself voted No. My greatest fear is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the <b>Support</b> votes might have been cast by people who think of Wikipedia as an <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristocracy.html" title="Aristocracy">aristocracy</a>, where a small, "newbie-free" group of administrators can rewrite fundamental policies such as NOR and V and maybe even NPOV.</li>
<li>Some of the <b>Oppose</b> votes might have been cast by people who think of Wikipedia as a <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy.html" title="Monarchy">monarchy</a>, where a quick comment by Jimmy Wales can overturn five months of hard work by a dedicated bunch of editors.</li>
</ul>

<dd>First, the conspiratorial angle here and above is a little overboard. But your point about Jimbo is correct, and I think informed the way this was constructed. Jimbo severely, probably fatally, wounded ATT as soon as he posted criticism of it.

<p>It seems to me that a lot of the opposing votes aren't actually voting against having WP:ATT, but are voting against <i>not having</i> WP:V, WP:NOR and WP:RS. Also, a lot of them are voting 'per Jimbo', which seems to me to be the same position, as Jimbo hasn't stated his position on this page, but apparently agreed that WP:ATT is good in principal although he doesn't want to lose the original pages. A number of people in the third section also have taken this stance.</p>
<p>It strikes me that despite this poll not reaching a consensus (which to me it clearly will not), that the compromise situation (all pages are policy with WP:V et al expanding on the same principles applied at WP:ATT) would have consensus. Unfortunately, despite having been proposed in the early stages, this question wasn't asked.</p>
<p>I'd suggest that whoever ends up closing this thing keeps this possibility in mind when evaluating the oppose votes: sifting them into these two categories may cause a consensus to emerge that isn't obvious from the current categorisation. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 08:46, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This assumes people supporting the merger (1 page) would also support keeping ATT live without a merger (4 pages). These are opposed, not corresponding positions. Having four pages has always been the most radical (and terrible IMO) idea going—it's completely contrary to the intent of ATT and the many of the supports on the basis of KISS. At a minimum, ATT and V should not carry on live at the same time. That doesn't mean we can't work out a tally in that direction, of course. We should sift for a variety of positions—supporting some but not all of the merger etc. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 08:53, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my opinion, an "Attributable" page is very useful to explain the process to beginners. However, Attributability is only the beginning of the editor's duty. Not only must Wikipedia content be Attributable, it must also be Verifiable, as in "Verifiability, not truth." And I refrain from stating my own opinion at this time as to exactly what "Verifiability, not truth" must mean, because it is not my opinion that matters. What matters is that we somehow capture an <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operational_definition.html" title="Operational definition">operational definition</a> for Verifiability as it actually works in high quality Wikipedia pages such as <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truth.html" title="Truth">truth</a>, I would say. I and many others have several ideas how that might be done to simplify the various policy texts, but I would not want to shift the discussion in any particular direction at this point. --<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> 09:14, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm so used to the Attribution page now that I will be sorry if I can't quote it in the future (I loathe trying to explain "Verifiability" and "No Original Research", which have specialised Wikipedia meanings, in my opinion). But I'm scratching my head about how it could sensibly remain in operation alongside the others. And though you could interpret this poll to give leeway for ATT to remain, I've a feeling that were a further poll to be held (please, no) on "keep or scrap", the vote might go towards "scrap", even from some who voted "support" in the present poll—if only because a keep would leave the policy situation slightly eccentric. If you had two gloves and a muff, where would you wear the muff? On your head? <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 12:11, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
