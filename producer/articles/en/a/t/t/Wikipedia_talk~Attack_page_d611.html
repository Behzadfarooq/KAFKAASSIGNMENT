<blockquote>
<p>A Wikipedia article, page or image created for the sole purpose of disparaging its subject is an attack page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe <i>sole purpose of disparaging its subject</i> is poorly worded and is overly broad. I routinely create my own workspace pages (personal sandboxen) that I use to gather evidence or keep notes during a dispute or investigation. I have seen some administrators accused of keeping "attack pages", which seems to be a rather gratuitious use of the term.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the subject of the article is notable, but the existing page consists solely or primarily of personal attacks against that subject and there's no good revision to revert to, then the attack page should be blanked (or, if necessary, deleted) and an appropriate stub article should be written in its place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second part of this guideline seems like it is intended to be applied to the main namespace -- articles created to disparage a notable or non-notable subject. I propose that we delete <i><tt>, page or image</tt></i> from the first part of the guideline. This would narrow the charge of creating "attack pages" to the intended purpose as shown in the "what to do" part of the guideline.</p>
<p>Please note, I am being completely proactive here -- I have not been accused of any <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATTACK_3b8e.html" title="WP:ATTACK">WP:ATTACK</a>, I just can see how some people can use it with broad strokes. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 06:44, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, this has to apply to Images and User pages as well... Images can be used to deliberately attack the subject just as much as words. And a user page (talk sub-page, sandbox, etc.) that exists ONLY to attack someone or some group has to count as an attack page. They should be brought to admin attention and deleted. Now, as to a personal sandbox used to compile evidence or to keep notes during a dispute or investigation... to my mind such a page does not fit the criteria. It does not exist for the sole purpose of disparaging its subject. Granted, it can sometimes be a judgment call... Material that is compliled as "evidence" by one person, might be considered an attack by another. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 13:38, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thats exactly why we should narrow the context of "attack pages" -- to remove the ambiguity. What about changing it to "<i>Any article or image</i>" then? /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 15:53, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The intent was to avoid attack pages within userspace. I actually added this because <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> re-worded some <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSDs</a>, adding G10, which covered all attack pages. I think that there's a definite difference between an attack page and a RFAr; the latter is more than the "sole purpose of disparaging" its subject; it keeps evidence on a user's conduct. But I feel strongly that the word "page" should still apply; user pages have been historically used as actual attacks on other users (i.e. XXXX is a racist Serbian nationalist), and this change reflects that. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315">Ral315</a> (<a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315">talk</a>) 17:08, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think ATTACK would apply to RfAs or sandboxen being used to prepare an RfA.

<dd>I definitely agree that the guideline should not apply to RfArb / evidence pages, but I have seen people use it as a misnomer. Modifying the inclusionary language might not be the answer -- what about adding an exclusionary clause.

<dd>You should be more appalled to discover that there are editors whos conduct warrants administrative action, and you should be glad there are administrators and users who do due dilligence in investigating and addressing such. Is it unfortunate that something like that is necessary? Of course, but it is necessary and it hurts us all when admins and users trying to help by gathering and presenting evidence can be accused to harboring attack pages. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 15:35, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my experience such user pages to "gather evidence" about users tend to be rather one-sided and serve mostly to cast that user in bad light, and as such I would have no regrets about deleting the lot of them. You can always keep evidence on, I don't know, your hard drive? Or possibly that stack of note paper next to your computer, if you want to go analog. Productive dispute resolution is, of course, not an attack, but a list of "bad things done by User:Foo" is far from productive. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 15:51, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Have you ever participated in a <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfAR_e1cf.html" title="WP:RfAR">WP:RfAR</a>B? It takes a lot of collaborative effort by editors, which can't be done offline. As unfortunate as it may be, sometimes it is necessary to bring an editor's conduct into question -- which is precisely why RfARB exists. I believe the official policy referrs to such pages as <i>workspace</i> (which is very productive when prosecuting an arbitration case). I am not advocating that we endorse users' ability to "keep a list of bad things done by User:foo" -- please understand that my purpose in this RfC is to limit the use of the "attack page" charge to its intended definition and not to allow users to extend it to administrators and editors who keep such pages as part of an ongoing investigation or arbitration regarding someone's conduct. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 22:09, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the talk page attached to any <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfAR_e1cf.html" title="WP:RfAR">WP:RfAR</a> should be ample for any appropriate collaborative discussion, anything else should be kept privately, on the hard drive, if at all. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZeraeph_9a9c.html" title="User:Zeraeph">Zeraeph</a> 02:18, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Indeed. If there is an RFAr, there is already a page there for evidence (which, incidentally, has more purposes than simple disparagement). If there is not, or not yet, an RFAr, there is no need for this so-called collaboration. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 09:35, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not sure it is such a tiny point. Maybe I have selective attention, but it seems to be something of a growing fad at the moment to create pages for the sole purpose of subjectively maligning other editors, whether overtly and abusively, or passive aggressive and covertly passed off as "collecting information on *questionable* users for the good of the project" (Hell--oo...designating an user as "questionable" or similar, is, in it's own right, an attack, and I guarantee that if you are obsessed enough to dig long enough you can selectively collate enough diffs to make any editor who has a pulse look *questionable*).</dd>

<dd>I was genuinely staggered the first time I saw a page like this.

<dd>I would like to see this page not only stay, but be expanded and elevated to a policy that will eradicate such pages from Wikipedia and take the focus away from collating information to use against other editors at will, and back to collating information from which to build an encyclopaedia.

<li>It's not about this page, it's about what it <i>says</i>. This page says we delete attack pages.

<dd>This page exists because we need a guideline that defines <b>what constitutes an <i>attack page</i></b> . Think of it in a legal sense... the legislature makes the <i>law</i> that says <i>thus-and-so is prohibited</i>, and then the law is specifically defined by the courts (what exactly constitutes <i>thus-and-so</i>). I believe that's how this page came into existance, and why it definitely should exist. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 10:18, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Ah, but no. Wikipedia doesn't do legislation, and we don't need a strict definition of "attack page" because that'd encourage <a href="../../../w/l/_/WP%7EWL_5eab.html" title="WP:WL">wikilawyering</a> and gaming the system. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a bureaucracy, <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">doesn't have firm rules</a>, and most definitely doesn't have a lawbook.

<li>Well if we don't need a strict definition of an "attack page" we probably don't need definitions of "vandalism", "incivility" or "NPOV" either. The lack of clear definition is more likely to encourage wikilawyering than the provision of it, because it means there is no "bottom line" on the subject and obscure half relevancies can be dredged up out of context, ad nauseam, to excuse any aspect of it on either side.</li>

<dd>So, just to be clear... being completely unaware of the previous AfD, I asked a while back that we expand this page. Radiant, you argued against expanding the page during my request for expansion (see above), and now you want to use the fact that the page hasn't been expanded expanded as a reason to delete it. As another editor pointed out previously, <b>The lack of clear definition is more likely to encourage wikilawyering</b>. Also, I used an analogy in my previous comment, with the attempt to help you understand why this is here, and why we need it. I wish my attempt at illustration was more successful. &#160;:-) I am aware that wikipedia doesn't have laws. Also, please don't bring up discussion and then selectively copy responses that support your position -- let's have this disccusion in one place.

<p>I believe this page needs expansion. Recently, several pages I had in my User space were regarded as "attack pages". I felt these claims were unjustified and unwarranted given everything I have read so far under WP policies and guidelines. Nevertheless, the pages were nominated for MfD. One of the supporting users recently replied to my query concerning why she thought this was an attack page:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>As the pages have been deleted, it would be hard for me to go into exact details, but generally, I think it's a bad idea to maintain a page on Wikipedia in which you document the real or imagined misbehaviour of other editors and/or your problems with them. It makes for bad feeling, as they inevitably discover it. If you need to keep a record of these things, I suggest you keep it on your own hard disk. That's all I really have to say.</i> (ElinorD)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AElinorD&amp;diff=116497877&amp;oldid=116488359" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AElinorD&amp;diff=116497877&amp;oldid=116488359" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<p>However, as the page <i>currently</i> says:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>It should be noted that this guideline is not meant to apply to formal good faith reports on a user's conduct or pattern of behavior made in accord with policy. For example, a request for comment filed in good faith would not be considered an attack page.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I think this guideline, then, requires further "fleshing out".</p>
