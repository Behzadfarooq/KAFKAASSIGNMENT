<p>Hi, Dwiki here. I archived the prior discussion as the article was reverted to a point before any of this discussion occurred for reasons of copyright infringement. The discussion is archived here ---&gt; --<a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwiki_de79.html" title="User:Dwiki">Dwiki</a> 07:10, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article should not have been reverted. There is and was not copyright infringement as the previous talk page discusssions showed. The minor material that was "copyrighted" was posted with permission. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 13:22, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It is not permitted under fair user provisions, as it was entirely pasted into this article. If you are the author, however, you need to not only "allow" its use but release the document under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> - see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequesting_copyright_permission_5781.html" title="Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission">Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission</a>. If you are willing to take this step, the content is permitted. As for whether or not it's a good choice to place so much content into an article that espouses a particular point of view, that's up to the custodians of this article. I'm not willing to invest the energy into this article that it needs, but its largest problem with the pasted content is that the pasted content was a POV essay. The net result is two years later, the article still uses non-neutral language, making assertions that things "should" happen, when it is clearly only the opinion of the author. In this respect, the addition borders on original research. This is the tone of an essay, not a Wikipedia article, and thus, why is it in here in the first place?

<p>Wikipedia is not a place to republish entire articles - <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikisource.html" title="Wikisource">Wikisource</a> is thataway. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and that means articles should be summaries. The article that's being copy-pasted here is far too detailed, written in an inappropriate tone and reads as an apparent diagnosis/treatment guide. That's not what Wikipedia is for. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 02:50, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Others disagree with you on this point, so a better approach than wholesale deletion would be to improve the article by judicious editing. This would lead to a consensus, which had been achieved on this page previously. Wholesale deletions are not constructive or consistent with Wikipedia editing practices. <a href="../../../d/p/e/User%7EDPeterson_3157.html" title="User:DPeterson"><font color="red">DPeterson</font></a><sup><a href="../../../d/p/e/User_talk%7EDPeterson_eca1.html" title="User talk:DPeterson">talk</a></sup> 12:43, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with both points of view here. Rather than engage in a revert war...which is just not productive, I will restore the section deleted and make some edits to improve it.

<dd>There, judicious editing done. Wikipedia articles should be summaries of main and important points, not detailed guides listing every single bullet-point symptom and instructing on treatment therapies from a single POV. Furthermore, I've removed the puffery language like "leading theory" and whatnot, unless sources can be provided for those statements. The article in question is also written in an inappropriate tone for an encyclopedia. <b>"Attachment is fundamental to healthy development, normal personality, and the capacity to form healthy and authentic emotional relationships (O'Connor &amp; Zeanah). How can one determine whether a child has attachment issues that require attention?"</b> - That block is entirely useless here. We can't assert that it's fundamental. We can't ask questions in the text. We can't tell people to go see a licensed health care provider if someone's exhibiting XYZ symptoms. That is not what Wikipedia is for. The entire article is written that way, and hence is not appropriate. Please do not reinsert the text in question, because it's not an encyclopedia article, it's a how-to guide. If you want the whole unedited article on the Web, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikisource.html" title="Wikisource">Wikisource</a> is thataway. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 16:33, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Removing large sections of text that are copy-pasted in from an external source and which are written in an entirely unencyclopedic tone is hardly vandalism. I have repeatedly pointed out that the sections in question are unacceptable, because they speak from an active voice and presume to assert facts not in evidence without attribution. You are attempting to enforce the wholesale addition of material, and that won't fly. The text in question has been GFDLed, which means, guess what, anyone gets to bend, fold, spindle and/or mutilate it. That's what Wikipedia's about - not copy-pasting a clearly-polemic pro-single-POV article into a text box and claiming it can't be touched. As for the "other editors," they're transparently single-purpose accounts which conveniently show up every time you need them to create false consensus for your POV on attachment-related articles, so you can dispense with the charade. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 10:06, 17 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Yes, Wikipedia policy clearly states that such blanking can be considered vandalism.</b> You, you have made your point...but there are many others who disagree with you, therefore blanking is in appropriate. A better approach is to edit the article to improve it, not just hack away at it. Building consensus and collaborative editing is a corner-stone of Wikipedia. In fact, other editors here have begun to edit the sections in ways that take your view into account. You should either let that happen, or help. You are misrepresenting my views here FCYTravis. I am not saying that the article or sections cannot be touched...only that it be improved, as other editors have begun to do in a collaborative and cooperative fashion.

<dd>Can you verify your credentials then, as per the current proposal by Jimbo? I for my part am most certainly not going to give you any personal details on myself. A verfication of both of your credentials could be done if you want that. It would also clear up the concerns of your [WP:COI|conflict of interest]]. Are you involved with some sort of therapy for perceived or real attachment disorders? Does your income depend on some sort of therapy for this?

<dd>Very strange reaction indeed... But interesting. Your opinion that the proposal borders on personal attacks has not been mentioned yet on the discussion page of the proposal. I recommend you mention it there. It won't change anything saying it here. Your reaction of course gives rise to further scepticism. So do you not want your credentials verified and taken into consideration now? In case your claims to a PhD are false it might be best for the two of you to confess right now.

<dd>Maybe you'd want to lead by example? Your reticence to disclose your background and expertise, raises further skepticism and make one wonder about your affiliations.

<blockquote>
<p>Attachment is fundamental to healthy development, normal personality, and the capacity to form healthy and authentic emotional relationships[1]. How can one determine whether a child has attachment issues that require attention? What is normal behavior, and what are the signs of attachment issues? When adopting an infant, will attachment problems develop? These and other related questions are often at the forefront of adoptive parentsâ minds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that is fine. The article responds to the questions. However, if there is strong sentiment, at least the first line should remain and the last part after the reference can be deleted.

<blockquote>
<p>Attachment is the base of emotional health, social relationships, and one's worldview (Zeanah, C., 1993). The ability to trust and form reciprocal relationships affects the emotional health, security, and safety of the child, as well as the child's development and future inter-personal relationships. The ability to regulate emotions, have a conscience, and experience empathy all require secure attachment. Healthy brain development is built on a secure attachment relationship.</p>

<p>First of all, the full citation should be given: Zeanah, C., (Ed.) (1993) Handbook of Infant Mental Health, Guilford Press, NY.

<blockquote>
<p>Children who are adopted after the age of six months are at risk for attachment problems. Normal attachment develops during the child's first two to three years of life. Problems with the mother-child relationship during that time, orphanage experience, or breaks in the consistent caregiver-child relationship interfere with the normal development of a healthy and secure attachment. There are wide ranges of attachment difficulties that result in varying degrees of emotional disturbance in the child. One thing is certain; if an infant's needs are not met consistently, in a loving, nurturing way, attachment will not occur normally and this underlying problem will manifest itself in a variety of symptoms. When the attachment-cycle is undermined and the childâs needs are not met, and normal socializing shame is not resolved, mistrust begins to define the perspective of the child and attachment problems result[2]. The cycle can become undermined or broken for many reasons: Multiple disruptions in care giving Post-partum depression causing an emotionally unavailable mother Hospitalization of the child causing separation from the parent and/or unrelieved pain. For example, stays in a NICU or repeated hospitalizations during infancy. Parents who have experienced their own relational trauma, leading to neglect, abuse (physical/sexual/verbal), or inappropriate parental responses not leading to a secure/predictable relationship Genetic factors Pervasive developmental disorders Caregivers whose own needs are not met, leading to overload and lack of awareness of the infants needs The child may develop basic mistrust (Erikson), impeding effective attachment behavior. The developmental stages following these first three years continue to be distorted and/or retarded, and common symptoms emerge. It is very important to realize that when one is trying to parent a child with attachment difficulties one must focus on the cause of the behaviors and not on the symptoms or surface behaviors. Furthermore, the following behaviors can be indicators of a variety of problems. A child exhibiting several of these behaviors should receive a comprehensive evaluation by a licensed mental health professional to determine the cause of these symptoms. Many of these symptoms can be seen in children who have experienced complex trauma [3], attachment difficulties and other issues. Superficially engaging and charming behavior, phoniness Avoidance of eye contact Indiscriminate affection with strangers Lack of affection in a reciprocal manner Destructiveness to self, others, and material things Cruelty to animals Crazy lying (lying in the face of the obvious) Poor impulse control Learning lags Lack of cause/effect thinking Lack of conscience Abnormal eating patterns Poor peer relationships Preoccupation with fire and/or gore Persistent nonsense questions and chatter indicating a need to control Inappropriate clinginess and demandingness Inappropriate sexuality</p>
