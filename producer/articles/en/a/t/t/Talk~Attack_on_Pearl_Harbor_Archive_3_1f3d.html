<p>Since the OP has reverted my attempts to ameliorate this section, I have deleted it. Anyone who would take Stinnett's book seriously must first explain why those knowledgeable of Navy cryptology discredit his findings. See for example Steven Budiansky's analysis at [<a href="http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/pubs/cryptologia/ClassicArticleReprints/V24N2PP119-130Budiansky.PDF}" class="external free" title="http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/pubs/cryptologia/ClassicArticleReprints/V24N2PP119-130Budiansky.PDF}" rel="nofollow">http://www.dean.usma.edu/math/pubs/cryptologia/ClassicArticleReprints/V24N2PP119-130Budiansky.PDF}</a></p>

<dd>I support that. There's a tendency on wikipedia to include every freak theory about everything. Someone writes a speculative book about something, a (well-meaning) wikipedian reads said book, and thinks: "Hey, this should be in the encyclopedia!" It shouldn't. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 16:21, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You asked on the moderated Usenet WWII newsgroup about Stinnett's book and got this response: <b>Rubbish. While the footnotes seem to me to be largely correct, they don't support the claims in the text, and in some cases directly contradict those claims</b>. The writer gave other objections as well. So I think the section should stay out altogether, though if the OP wants to include the book in Further Reading as an alternate explanation, that's appropriate. --<a href="../../../c/u/b/User%7ECubdriver_1b95.html" title="User:Cubdriver">Cubdriver</a> 11:23, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see that the rightwing, war-loving, hierarchy-loving "history buffs" have managed to delete all the references to how the American government deliberately let Pearl harbor be bombed, and how they worked for months to make it happen, so that they could use that to manufacture consent for the profitable war to follow.</p>
<p>There is MUCH MORE to this controversy than just the cryptography angle. There are interviews where powerful people talk about how they need to make this Pearl Harbor incident happen. Much more, too.</p>
<p>No doubt these rightwingers, oops, I mean "libertarians" will erase this comment of mine...</p>

<p>I'd like to see more about how FDR ordered the fleet to be moved from California to this vulnerable position in 1939, and how he fired Admiral Richardson for opposing the move. Also how the second Admiral Kimmel also voiced security concerns. Why not focus on facts that in a court of law would prove FDR's intentions beyond a reasonable doubt. --<a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrus255_3523.html" title="User:Cyrus255">Cyrus255</a></p>

<dd>We're not here to "prove" anything. This article concerns the attack, so longterm strategic decisions belong elsewhere. Lastly, the goal of a navy is to go into "harm's way" - they do no good in a port. There was little reason to think that Pearl Harbor was vulnerable.

<p>There are three sides to the foreknowledge contoversy. The Traditionalists support the conventional history that blames the PH Attack on bureaucratic bumbling. The second side is the Opposition who accuse FDR of deceiving the American public about his foreknowledge. The third side are the Revisionists who argue that, based on recently released documents, FDR had foreknowledge of the attack, but did what he had to do based on the incomplete information he was given. This web page "Attack on Pearl Harbor" is the provence of the Traditionalists and I have no problem with anything on their page. The foreknowlege issue does not belong here. Stinnett's book is Revisionist and, in fairness to FDR, he points out that FDR was told that damage to US Navy ships would be minimal because his military advisors believed that Japan could not use torpedos in the shallow water of the harbor. Stinnett also mentions that FDR turned white in the face when told of the actual damage. I think is is safe to say that FDR was as shocked at the damage report as those who did not have foreknowledge. I do have a problem with the Opposition because they apply a double standard. They blame FDR for allowing the PH attack to proceed with the resulting loss of lives, but do not blame him for approving the Normandy invasion when he knew thousands of US soldiers would die, either on the beach or further inland. Operation Overlord for the Normany invasion was surrounded by massive deception of the public about when and where. The Opposition does not accuse FDR of deceit regarding the Normandy invasion. Why all the hostility regarding the PH attack? This only causes the Traditionalists to become too defensive, believing they are defending the honor of the Navy and FDR. One problem with Stinnett's book is the title, which may have been his editor's doing. If it had been titled "Day of Shock" it would not have had the hostile accusatory tone that "Day of Deceit" has. I believe FDR had foreknowledge, that the provocations were intentional, that FDR made a very difficult judgment call, and he did the honorable thing. I admire him greatly for it. 4.235.207.173 04:39, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Your take is notable in being novel. Most arguing for foreknowledge seem to have no admiration of FDR at all, though many think the Navy did well. But, regardless of any of that, these comments belong at the Advance Knowledge article. This article is concernced with the attack, and mentions motive sand alternatives only in passing. That mention should be there to be sure, but this is a long article and so the mention should be (must be) brief. I suggest that you move this long comment to the Talk: page (with appropriate edits) as it is much more relevant there.</dd>
<dd>Your division of PH discussants into three clases is an interesting one. I don't think I agree, but thank you for giving me a freshish perspective. <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 19:52, 22 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's notable for being ignorant. Examine what FDR was <i>actually doing</i> &amp; you'll see he didn't want to provoke Japan to war. "Advance knowledge" presumes he knew Japan would bomb Pearl. Nobody outside Japan knew that; hell, many outside <i>NGS</i> didn't know.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Japanese Justifications for the Attack</span></h2>
<p>I added a citation (#5) to a "Japanese views" paragraph. The referenced Internet article by Arima provides a good view from the Japanese perspective and may be worth reviewing to see if more material should be referenced from it in the main article. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 13:33, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Japanese strategic motivations</span></h2>
<p>This is really a fine article, but I didn't get a convincing sense of Japanese strategic motivations for the attack. Perhaps the relevant sections could be explained more clearly. Take a step back, and try to get a sense of the big picture, perhaps? (A reader's perspective.)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The "Japanese Perspective" section at the end of the article goes into the Japanese strategic motivations in greater detail. Perhaps more of that section could be placed earlier in the article to further explain why Japan decided to attack Pearl Harbor? However, since the article has already achieved "Features" article status (the "cream of the crop" of Wikipedia articles), I'm not sure if there will be much support to make any major changes to the article. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 12:45, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The Japanese perspective section could certainly use some improvement. Coincidentally, someone has provided us with a source on that topic, see above. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 19:08, 11 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay, I'll work on the Japanese perspective section. I'll look at adding some more background from the Japanese POV at the beginning of the article also since there seems to be some support for doing that. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 13:59, 12 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The large edit by Cla68 is generally good, but I think there is quite a bit of POV in respect to the account of imperialism in east Asia. It's more complex than the account given, adn in any case, this is not the article for coping with those issues. A mention of a long-standing Japanese committment to resistance to any extension of that imperialism to Japan itself is probably appropriate here, however. But the idea that Japan's long extended push for control of &lt;pick your territory into which they went&gt; was merely due to oppostition to Western imperialism is highly debatable. Worth recording the debate here on WP, just not in this article. Thoughts? Comments? <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 15:54, 12 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>What you say is definitely true, since I was using Japanese sources (which I'll add later since it's so time consuming to have to reorder the notes table at the bottom), I can see that the Japanese POV probably came through too strongly. Please feel free to edit for NPOV. I'm probably too close to the Japanese side at the moment to do a good job on it. Appreciate the help with the section. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 16:14, 12 April 2006 (UTC) Actually, on second thought, I'll give others a day or so to edit it for any balancing or NPOV that may be required, and then I'll add the citations after that. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 19:35, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1st paragraph shortened as requested. I believe that the events around the Opium War along with the Meiji restoration began the chain reaction of events that resulted in the war between Japan and the U.S. Thus, I'm reluctant to take out any more of the verbiage on the subject. However, if anyone can summarize it even further, that would probably be of benefit to the article. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 23:52, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm a former history teacher with an MA in U.S. history. This is an excellent article, but is still overly American-centric (I'm American by the way). The section on Japanese preparations mentions both British and American influences on Japanese preliminary planning. No mention whatsoever is made of Minoru Genda's original thinking, for example the seemingly well-documented fact that Genda saw a video of American carriers sailing in box formation (during a 30s naval review) which led him to originate the idea of massed carrier aircraft attacking one target. I read the discussion above about the bogus (IMO) theories of how FDR allowed/masterminded the attack as well. These theories detract from the Japanese accomplishment, since they assume the Japanese couldn't have engineered this attack on their own. Since many of you have worked long and hard on this article, I am asking: would it be appropriate for me to add some details regarding Minoru Genda's original thinking? They will be accurately foot-noted.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkm62_2ba0.html" title="User:Markm62">Markm62</a> 08:34, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>M, There's a kind of silent convention which leaves comment sections from some time ago (as in this instance 4/06) alone and to start a new section with a substantially later comment (in this instance 9/06). I think your comment here would have been best in a new section.</dd>
<dd>That said, I agree that Genda's contribution is deserving of a sentence or two. The problem is that if everyone gets a sentence or two we will end up with a poor article consisting mostly of glued together single sentences. with that in mind, be bold and dive in. At worst, there'll be some sloshing back and forth as people intervene to clean up the article from your depradations.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nagumo's decision to withdraw</span></h2>
<p>The fifth bullet point under this heading states that "The timing of a third strike would have been such that aircraft would probably have returned to their carriers after dark." Earlier in the article, the beginning of the attack is quoted as being 7.53am Hawaiian Time, and just after that the duration of the attack is put at "Ninety minutes". It seems to me that the timing of the conclusion of the battle is incompatible with the notion that a third strike would have ended after dark, which even conservatively would have been at least another 6 or 7 hours away. Does anyone have more reliable information than what I have quoted?</p>
<dl>
<dd>6 a.m.: planes take off from carriers. 7:55 a.m.: first wave attacks (i.e., nearly two hours en route). 8:25 a.m.: second wave. 9:30 last planes withdraw. Presumably the last planes would have landed about 11:30 a.m. A CAP would of course be up and might have to be refueled before taking off again. Then the attack planes would have to be brought back on deck, refueled, and rearmed. Two hours in total? Just a guess. We're now up to 1:30 p.m. Two hours to Pearl Harbor, an hour over target, and two hours back. They would have had daylight, almost certainly, and high losses were acceptable, so if some or many didn't get back to the carriers, that was all right. So it doesn't seem to me that daylight was a huge problem. --<a href="../../../c/u/b/User%7ECubdriver_1b95.html" title="User:Cubdriver">Cubdriver</a> 21:49, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Think what would have had to happen. The first and second strikes used separate planes that were fueled and launched from the carriers before the first strike reached their targets. Any third strike would have had to have used planes that had taken part in the first and/or second strikes. That means at minimum:</p>
<ol>
<li>The planes from the first and second strikes would have had to have flown back to the Japanese carriers and been recovered.</li>
<li>The planes would have had to have been assessed for damage,</li>
<li>The planes would have had to have been refuelled,</li>
<li>The planes would have had to have been rearmed,</li>
<li>The planes would have had to have been relaunched,</li>
<li>The planes would have had to have flown back to Pearl Harbor,</li>
<li>The planes would have had to have attacked again,</li>
<li>The planes would have had to have flown back to the Japanese carriers and been recovered.</li>
</ol>
<p>The last planes from the first and second waves landing back on the carriers at about 11:30am would have been reasonable. That leaves six and a half hours of daylight or so. The Japanese carriers were about 200 miles from Pearl Harbor which at the cruising speeds of the torpedo aircraft and dive bombers of the day was at least 1.5 hours of flying. There we have, just getting to and from the target, 3 hours used up out of the 6.5 available.</p>
<p>Launching carrier aircraft is a significant time factor that most people don't think about. Assuming four launches a minute on a modern aircraft carrier it will still take 15 minutes to get a 60 aircraft strike outbound. The Japanese aircraft carriers were certainly not capable of 4 launches a minute, although there were 6 of them taking part so that is less of a problem than it might appear. However we also have the fact that a large strike of aircraft needs to climb to cruising height and get in formation before leaving for the strike. Doing that with WWII aircraft is a considerable undertaking in and of itself due to their relatively slow rate of climb. It could very easily have taken 30-45 minutes to get a strike airborne and underway, and possibly as much as an hour. Assuming 45 minutes we have now used up 3.75 hours out of the 6.5 available simply to launch the aircraft and for them to travel to and from the target.</p>
<p>We now move on to damage assessment. If a third strike was to be flown then aircraft potentially taking part would have had to have been assessed for battle damage before being cleared. That could easily have taken 15-30 minutes. Let's say it took 15 minutes extra as it could fairly easily have run in parallel with recovery operations. That means 4 hours of the 6.5 available have been used up to check the planes for battle damage, launch them and for travel time.</p>
<p>We now have to consider refuelling and rearming. That was a long process and Japanese carrier doctrine was not as efficient as American in this respect. Midway is the classic example of what can happen if you get caught in the middle of refuelling and rearming. Let's say that took 90 minutes as a rough guess. That's 5.5 hours of the 6.5 available used up.</p>
<p>Now thinking about the attack itself. The first set of strikes lasted for 90 minutes in total. That did include a considerable gap between the two waves. Let's say the attack lasted for 30 minutes. That's 6 hours out of the 6.5 available used up.</p>
<p>So we have 30 minutes left as a safety margin, time to make the actual decision to strike, and time to deal with CAP operations. 30 minutes is not much of a safety margin and CAP aircraft would certainly have been in the air given the proximity to US soil. That's also assuming 90 minutes for rearming instead of the 2 hours assumed above and 90 minutes each way for transit rather than 2 hours each way for transit. Assume those and we are very much into darkness when the Japanese aircraft come back to the carriers.</p>
<p>That's why the Japanese aircraft could very easily have come back in the dark. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 22:28, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Another perspective: Tameichi Hara states that from the very beginning, Japanese naval commanders were constantly being harangued by headquarters staff admirals to conserve fuel, ammunition, personnel, and equipment as much as possible with the implication that their careers and honor were being judged by this criteria. Hara believes that the reason why so many Japanese commanders withdrew just when it appeared they had a decisive victory in hand (<a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Savo_Island_c51e.html" title="Battle of Savo Island">Battle of Savo Island</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Santa_Cruz_Islands_c357.html" title="Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands">Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_Battle_of_Guadalcanal_fc66.html" title="Naval Battle of Guadalcanal">First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf_14ce.html" title="Battle of Leyte Gulf">Battle off Samar</a>) was for this reason.

<dd>Consider a hypothetical third wave, which planes would be used, returning first wave or returning second wave? Was every plane capable of independent navigation? First two waves, was any effort made to 'bunch up"? Is recovery slower than launch? Do planes from different ships fly in the same formation? were there plans for a third wave? I just don't see how anything beyond a piecemeal effort would be possible. CorvetteZ51 17:47, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Don't forget another factor, often overlooked. Nagumo's destroyers were burning fuel oil by the ton, &amp; he had no AOs to replenish it.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The surprise attack</span></h2>
<p>Japan was suppose to declare war 30 min before attacking, but writing the declaration of war took too long and the air planes had reached their target before it was finished. So this is why Nagumo ws forced to initiate a suprise attack. The Japanese believed in honor nad a suprise attack was not honorable at all.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Um, sorry to burst your bubble, but (a) declaring war and then attacking Pearl Harbor 30 minutes later is still tantamount to a surprise attack (not to mention subsequent attacks on the British, Dutch, and French, just to name a few), and (b) your comment about Japan not launching a surprise attack for honor's sake is dangerously misinformed. The Japanese had no compunction about launching a surpise attack, and were more than willing to do it to the Russians in 1904 at Port Arthur. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 02:58, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I believe that many of the Japanese leaders desired to make a distinction between a <i>sneak</i> attack and a <i>surprise</i> attack. In the chapter from <i>Japan at War, an Oral History</i> (full book citation in the notes section of the main article) in which Admiral Yamamoto's former personal aid is interviewed, the aid says that Yamamoto wanted the U.S. to be given an announcement of breaking-off of relations just before the attack occurred so that the attack wouldn't be considered "sneaky," but instead, a "surprise." Of course, even if that had happened as Yamamoto desired, the people of the U.S. may have still have considered it a sneak attack. In fact, the difference between a "sneak" attack and a "surprise" attack is, of course, very debatable, if there is a difference. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7ECla68_4b38.html" title="User:Cla68">Cla68</a> 16:49, 26 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sneak attack implies a dishonorable tactic of leading your opponent to believe your intentions are other than what they are, and/or disregarding conventions in order to take advantage of the opponent's expectation that you would fight by the conventions other than those you have used in the past. After the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Port_Arthur_3766.html" title="Battle of Port Arthur">Battle of Port Arthur</a> in 1904, no one in the west was entitled to believe the Japanese wouldn't use the same tactice of surprize attack suddenly at the height of diplomatic tensions. Indeed, <a href="../../../t/o/g/Togo_Heihachiro_abf4.html" title="Togo Heihachiro">Togo</a> had studied the practices of the West very closely, and was merely applying the lessons he learned from the French while he was in China observing their practices during the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Foochow_cfbf.html" title="Battle of Foochow">Battle of Foochow</a>. The French issued no warnings, no formal severing of relations, and their attack was devastating. Togo saw this was the way business was done, proceeded to use it on the Russians, and later when <a href="../../../i/s/o/Isoroku_Yamamoto_6192.html" title="Isoroku Yamamoto">Yamamoto</a>, a known proponent of naval aviation was placed in charge of the Combined Fleet in 1939, how can anyone claim it was such a huge surprize that Yamamoto would not do the same? He was simply following what he viewed and anyone in the west should have viewed as standard operating procedure in the far east theater.</dd>

<dd>Was <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_El_Dorado_Canyon_a04f.html" title="Operation El Dorado Canyon">Operation El Dorado Canyon</a> a sneak attack? Our first response is certainly not, and the first thing that comes to mind is justification- Lybian treachery already set the rules that marquis of queensbury conventions did not apply. Don't be too shocked that justification and recitation of percieved treachery by the west was at the forefront of the thinking of Japanese leaders. I think it is more accurate to say that the Japanese view was while the attack may have been a surprise to the american and japanese public, but it was simple arrogance that led the american leadership not to expect an attack on Pearl Harbor.</dd>
<dd>There is substantial credence to this viewpoint. The British and Americans had given Japan two options in China. Either back down, or go to war. In fact, the American military staff in the far east was informed that war was a likely scenario, and it was a common view that it was inevitable. So what was the big surprize here? The prevailing opinion amoung the British and American navies was simply that the attack would be in the far east, not in the western theater. As for the notion that a carrier force would be this effective, the article notes the stunning effectiveness of Yarnell's Blue team attack on Pearl harbor which did precisely what the Japanese did 9 years later:
<ol>
<li>attack from the north from behind a storm front</li>
<li>attack on a sleepy winter Sunday morning</li>
<li>destroy the army fighters on the ground,</li>
<li>air defence neutralized, proceed to destroy the fleet at anchor in the harbor with torpedos and bombs</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>It was no surprise to the navy that this could be done. Mitchell also proved the vulnerability of battleships, and though his and Yarnell's exercises were discounted as unrealistic, there was no excuse to reject the undeniable new reality presented by real world the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_on_Taranto_16a9.html" title="Attack on Taranto">Attack on Taranto</a> in 1940. Sorry, but this gave the Americans ample time to appreciate the vulnerability and build defences. It was well known by the allies how to defend effectively from long range attack, but the response was far from a best system employing destroyer pickets and something like Britain's <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chain_Home_3058.html" title="Chain Home">Chain Home</a> coordinated air defence system. The "wide open barn door" deficiencies in American defences have all been thoroughly remarked on and were corrected, but only after yet another undeniable demonstration for the bone headed military leadership. So where does that leave us? 1) the Japanese were obeying conventions they learned from the west and demonstrated as their standard operating procedure in the 1904 war with Russia 2) the Americans actually were expecting an attack- they were only wrong about the location. 3) The American naval leadership chose to disregard the vulnerability of their base revealed by Taranto and the war games that Mitchell and Yarnell- they were surprized only because they were in denial- they were living in the past.</dd>
<dd>Certainly everyone today agrees that it was a foolish decision on the part of the Japanese to attack. But the surprise relied more on the fact that the US navy was in denial about the threats posed by naval aviation in general, and the capabilities of the Japanese in specific. Further, the American leadership was not entitled to claim the Japanese were behaving in an unpredicable manner. They had demonstrated their doctrine of sudden attack over an extended period of time. Not attacking until formal breaking off of relations is a demonstration of poor character as was the attack by the French on the Chinese at Foochow. But the Pearl Harbor attack equally illustrates the poor character demonstrated by American leadership who stubbornly refused to believe their own tests and the experience of Taranto that Pearl Harbor was seriously vulnerable to attack by massed naval aviation. Kimmel and Short were guilty of dereliction, but for larger reasons that what they were accused of in the commission report. Further, they had a lot of company in the upper ranks for their dereliction of duty. -<a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMak_Thorpe_0bde.html" title="User:Mak Thorpe">Mak</a> 21:29, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I believe the problem was not so much that they considered an attack impossible, but highly improbable. Signal intelligence had given the americans an excellent picture of the japanese movements in Southeast Asia. They didn't know everything, but they knew that large japanese invasion forces were on the move and going to land somewhere in Malaya, Borneo and the Philippines. These information was so much taken from decoded messages, but from data gathered by the much simpler means of direction-finding and traffic analysis (unlike MAGIC this data was avaiable to the Kimmel and Short). The invasion forces maintained radio silence once out of port to keep, so their positions to be discovered by direction-finding, but were still receiving messages addressed to them, so it was pretty obvious they were at sea (because they were not confirming receipt of these messages and the other side demand confimation as usual). Because there was no identifiable radio traffic either from the carriers or to the carriers, it was assumed they were still in Japan communicating by short-range radio, which was to weak to be received by the far away listening posts. A similar radio-blackout had been observed during earlier operations, were the carriers were indeed in Japan as strategic reserve. So the assumption was the carriers and the main battleforce were in Japan waiting for the reaction of the US-Pacific fleet, ready to attack it if it should move toward the Philippines. This was apparently indeed the japanese Plan B, if the japanese carriers should be discovered enroute to Pearl Harbor. With hindsight it would probably have been the better plan. Everybody was lulled in by that analysis and believed there was no imminent threat to Pearl Harbor. Also keep in mind that the mobile radar were operating only from 04:00am to 07:00am, because that was considered to be the most likely time of an attack. Though it was obviously folly not to operate the radar 24h a day, it shows that they had the basics figured out correctly, if there was to be an attack it would happen early in the morning.

<dd>I was there many years ago and as I recall it was a whole lot less than either of those, a few drops a day. There wasn't much of an oil slick, just a hint of rainbow here &amp; there on the water. A quart a day for 65 years would amount to about 6000 gallons leaked by now, seems excessive. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoovinator_deb5.html" title="User:Doovinator">Doovinator</a> 01:57, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">'Treachery'</span></h2>
<p>In the intro paragraph, "The U.S. public was greatly offended by the treachery of the attack" seems an inappropriate (and somewhat loaded) phrase, and in any case needs more explanation. 'Treachery' implies that the attack was a breach of pre-existing trust (such as a treaty or alliance), but this was not really the case. The Americans were not officially at war with the Japanese, but nor did they trust the Japanese. I assume what is intended here is to say that the U.S. public were offended because the attack was made before any official declaration of war. This should be made explicit. <a href="../../../b/f/i/User%7EBfinn_cf83.html" title="User:Bfinn">Ben Finn</a> 16:50, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have changed the paragraph in the article to state that twelve ships were sunk or severely damaged. Which I think is a more fitting description and assessment of the actual damage. In fact many ships took some form of damage or another. However I feel that this number more accurately describes the significant damage that was done.

<dd>some perspective is needed here. The US had 16 old and one new battleship at the time, five were sunk or grounded. One was usable 15 months later. The old battleships played a minor role in the rest of war. The two cruisers that were damaged, were rapidly patched up. Two destroyers were writeoffs, but were stripped of usable parts. One desroyer had its bow blow off, but was repairable.CorvetteZ51 00:22, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Corv, You may be interested that theres's a book by a Navy salvage driver who worked at Pearl in the months following, starting almost immediately. His account of work on the Arizona is pretty starck. Brings home what one knows intellectually, but not so viscerally. He also reports that parts were selvaged from several ships, not just hte destroyers. Great read, if not really great literature. And, of course, the title and author excape me completely...

<h2><span class="mw-headline">15" shell used as armour piercing bombs&#160;?</span></h2>
<p>It's interesting how, according to the authors, main gun navy shells caliber used as aircraft launched bombs is different. According to my opinion the Japanese used 14" and 16", simply because no Imperial battleship had 15" guns, while 14" for 600 kg and 16" for 900 kg shells were available respectively from "Hiei" (or "Fuso", "Ise" etc. WWI design classes) and from the Washigton treaty "Nagato" class. It's unlike that Germans or Italian supplied 15" shells from "Bismark" or "Veneto", while there were no captured supplies of 15"L42 English rounds of French "Richelieau" 381mm guns. And it's very unlike that an aircraft different from a two-engine bomber could lift a 18" "Yamato" shell.</p>

First, "pressure on Japan to force withdraw"? I imagine it's a typo. (If "force withdraw" was the intended phrase, and it actually means something coherent, than it must be some esoteric construction and so maybe the wording should be changed anyway.) Secondly, "the 1911 U.S.-Japanese treaty of commerce an act which later permitted imposing embargoes." Aside from the apparent need for a comma between "commerce" and "an," and perhaps need caps for Treaty of Commerce, the sentence is still mildly unclear.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pearl Harbor as "home soil?"</span></h2>
<p>The article under "Mythical status" says "Pearl Harbor is a major event in American history marking the first time since the War of 1812 America was attacked on its home soil by another country." This claim neglects the "attack on U.S. soil" by the Confederate forces in the Civil War, the attacks on the U.S. forces and citizens by Native Americans, and the attack on the U.S town of Columbus New Mexicos by Pancho Villa in 1916.Furthermore, when I click on "home soil" up comes "<a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeland.html" title="Homeland">Homeland</a>" which is defined as "A homeland (rel. country of origin and native land) is the concept of the territory (cultural geography) to which an ethnic group holds a long history and a deep cultural association with —the country in which a particular national identity began. As a common noun, it simply connotes the country of one's origin." In 1941 Hawaii was not regarded by many U.S. citizens as our "homeland" or our "native soil" or our "home soil" and certainly not as the place "where our national identity began" any more than Guantanamo is today or Iraq be if we have military bases there 40 odd years from today. Hawaii in 1941 was just a military base and a tourism destination. The U.S. anger was over a sneak attack which killed thousands of our military and weakened our defense capability, not that our "home soil had been attacked." It was a territory 2300 miles from the U.S. that the U.S. navy and marines had seized in 1893 in support of American planters, and to obtain a naval based and fueling station in the Pacific, as noted in US Public Law 103-150 in Wikisource. It had only been a U.S. territory since 1898, or 43 years at the time of the attack. Becoming a U.S. territory was within living memory of many Hawaiians and U.S. citizens. For these reasons, I suggest that the "mythic status" section be removed.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:26, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hawaii was a US territory as of 1900, so your analogy to Iraq isn't exactly valid. Comparing it to Puerto Rico or Guam might be more realistic. In any event, Americans at the time immediately felt that America had been attacked 'at home' (see newspaper headlines and articles on the day following the attack) as opposed to being attacked in a foreign country. I believe however, that this part of the article is attempting to mention the status that the event obtained after the war.

<p>Plus I don't see any connection to U.S. Admiral Harry Yarnell's 1932 Army-Navy exercises. Were the results of this exercise available to the public? Is there any evidence that the Japanese knew of these exercises? Is there any evidence that Onishi or Genda or Yamamoto specifically knew about these exercises?</p>
<p>The issue here is that this section of the article implies that the Japanese simply copied British and American ideas, which I believe is not accurate. Thoughts? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkm62_2ba0.html" title="User:Markm62">Markm62</a> 17:33, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd say the mentions of Yarnell &amp; Taranto bear more on whether the U.S. should've been surprised. It's not like Genda needed somebody to draw him a diagram (tho if it's true he didn't realize the significance of the tank farm, Navy Yard, sub base, power station, &amp; torpedo store, maybe somebody should've!) <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrekphiler_ea82.html" title="User:Trekphiler">Trekphiler</a> 06:58, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"explicitly warned war with Japan was expected in the very near future, . And, on the day of the attack, General Marshall sent an imminent-war warning message to Pearl Harbor specifically."</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is the same old revisionist garbage. It omits, as usual, the <i>content</i> of the messages &amp; implies they warned of an attack <i>on Pearl Harbor specifically</i>. They did nothing of the kind. In fact, everywhere <i>but</i> Pearl Harbor was mentioned.</p>
<p>I deleted this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"and in any case was court-martialed the next year"</dd>
</dl>
<p>It implies a connection between his criticisms over Pearl &amp; his court martial. There wasn't one. There <i>was</i> one in <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richardson.html" title="Richardson">Richardson</a>'s removal.</p>

Distribution of this intelligence was capricious and confusing, and did not include material from Japan's military traffic as this was not available. At best, the information was partial, seemingly contradictory, or insufficiently distributed (as in the case of the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winds_Code_4706.html" title="Winds Code">Winds Code</a>). Warnings were sent to all U.S. commands in the Pacific, including the explicit war warning message in late November 1941. Despite the growing information pointing to a new phase of Japan's aggression, there was no information available pointing specifically toward Pearl Harbor."</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's misleading &amp; erroneous. To begin with, JN-25 had been broken as early as September 1940. It wasn't provided to FDR (as far as I know) because it was naval information only. J-19 (which the Japanese called <i>Tsu</i>) had been broken, and there was information in J-19 pointing to an attack on Pearl (the notorious "bomb plot" message), but J-19 wasn't being read because there wasn't enough manpower for Purple &amp; JN-25, let alone lower grade cyphers, &amp; the relevant signals had been "masked" to look like consular traffic (which was being ignored, for lack of manpower...) The Winds Code is a red herring that deserves to be ignored.</p>
<p>I rewrote this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"In 1924, General <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Mitchell_5084.html" title="Billy Mitchell">Billy Mitchell</a> delivered a 324 page report to his superiors warning of a future war with Japan, possibly including an air-attack on Pearl Harbor; he was essentially ignored. American commanders had been warned tests demonstrated shallow-water aerial torpedo launches were possible, but no one in charge in Hawai<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>i fully appreciated the danger. Nevertheless, believing Pearl Harbor had natural defenses against torpedo attack (e.g., the shallow water), the U.S. Navy failed to deploy torpedo nets or baffles, which they judged an interference with ordinary operations, and so a low priority. Due to a claimed shortage of long-range aircraft, long reconnaissance patrols (chiefly Navy flying boats and Army Air Corps bombers) were not being made as often as required for adequate coverage, or as were later shown to be possible (e.g., immediately after the attack and with fewer planes). At the time of the attack, the Army, which was responsible for the defense of Pearl Harbor, was in training mode rather than on an alert footing. Most of its portable anti-aircraft guns were stowed, with the ammunition locked in separate armories. To avoid upsetting property owners, officers did not keep guns dispersed around the Pearl Harbor base (i.e., on private property)."</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's misleading &amp; erroneous. There was a <i>real</i> shortage of LR a/c in Hawaii; Kimmel had only 36 PBYs operational. The Army was responsible for LR patrol, <i>per</i> a prewar agreement, &amp; Short was not going to get more B-17s; they were going to the Philippines, which had a higher priority, &amp; Britiain, which had a higher one still. (Trials "immediately after the attack", I suspect, concentrated on the <i>known</i> attack direction, which neither Kimmel nor Short could afford to <i>beforehand</i>.) The Army &amp; Navy were both on a training status; note, despite having <i>all</i> the information available, DC didn't change this. And it was Kimmel, not Short, who was responsible for defending the Fleet.</p>
<p>I rewrote this:</p>

<dd>"and because Tokyo had neglected to inform them of the crucial necessity to deliver it on time"</dd>
</dl>
<p>As written, it was misleading (based on a common myth). Funny thing is, OP-20G got it decrypted, translated, typed, &amp; delivered in plenty of time...</p>
<p>I added this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Even before Nagumo began launching, at 04.30, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minesweeper.html" title="Minesweeper">minesweeper</a> USS Condor spotted a <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midget_submarine.html" title="Midget submarine">midget submarine</a> outside the Harbor entrance and alerted <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destroyer.html" title="Destroyer">destroyer</a> <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Ward_%28DD-139%29_3ebd.html" title="USS Ward (DD-139)"><i>Ward</i></a>. <i>Ward</i> carried out a fruitless search."</dd>
</dl>
<p>I deleted the "routine patarol"; given <i>Condor'</i>s warning, I doubt it was routine. (There's some question in my mind <i>Ward</i> was aware it was a midget; should this be stated as fact?) Also, TBS exchanges were monitored ashore, but the presence of a potential midget sub was never reported to Kimmel, allegedly because watchkeepers were asleep (Costello, <i>Days of Infamy</i>).</p>

<dd>As for your edits noted above, I applaud your industry, thank you for the reminder that the Thailand fleet had been sighted before the Pearl Harbor attack (had slipped my mind), and must disagree with the tone and some of the facts in these edits. In fact, JN-25 was NOT broken prior to 12.1.41 in any edition. This was at the beginning of its life, a superencrypted additive code/cypher. There were several new editions (one on 12.1.41) and became a two part code as well. In the absence of considerable depth at any particular edition, such systems (essentially state of the practical art of the time) are very difficult to break. The highest credible estimate of the percentage of JN-25 broken prior to 12.1.41 is about 10%. wh the opening of hostibilies, traffic increased, much more depth became possible, and the 12.1.41 edition was steadily broken to the point of sufficient information to stage the Midway ambush. As for attack information in minor codes/cyphers, one which had been broken did indeed carry a warning. It was sent, IRC, on 12.6.41 but not decrypted till 12.8.41.</dd>

<dd>Edits to the contrary are ill made in my view.</dd>

<p>As for others, I should be glad to discuss them with you, but suspect the likely volume is likely to be more than this talk page can manage.

<dd>"Although the Japanese concentrated on battleships (the largest vessels present), they did not ignore other targets. The light cruiser <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Helena_%28CL-50%29_95e6.html" title="USS Helena (CL-50)"><i>Helena</i></a> was torpedoed, and the concussion from the blast capsized the neighboring minelayer <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Oglala_%28CM-4%29_519d.html" title="USS Oglala (CM-4)"><i>Oglala</i></a>.

</dl>
<p>It's misleading. My guess is, the attacks on cruisers were mistaken identity, being taken for battleships, &amp; the DDs were certainly in error.
