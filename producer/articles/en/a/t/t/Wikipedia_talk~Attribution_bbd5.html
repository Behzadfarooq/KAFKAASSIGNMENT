<p>What happened to it, particularly the part that mentions "protection is not an endorsement of the current revision"? That's kind of the most important part of the notice.

<dd>I don't see how it's a "drastic or significant" debate.&#160;:-) I worry that some of the people posting on this page aren't familiar with the policies. There was no change from V and NOR to ATT. Therefore, the issue is whether we have them on one page or two. The spirit and letter of the policies remains unchanged either way. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:34, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's an upcoming straw poll to determine whether or not the policy should even exist, Jimbo had to get involved due to editor complaints, and the page has been protected due to edit warring.

<dd>That's two ways of saying the same thing. I repeat: One possible outcome of the poll is that WP:ATT will be made inactive (which probably means {{<a href="../../../h/i/s/Template%7EHistorical_f63d.html" title="Template:Historical">Historical</a>}}, though it could conceivably be {{<a href="../../../r/e/j/Template%7ERejected_0a64.html" title="Template:Rejected">Rejected</a>}}, not that the distiction matters right here). As with others, I disagree with the term "demoted"; I don't think there's any such thing. Either something is or isn't policy. In order to have the Disputedtag at all, something has to be a policy in the first place; the tag indicates that there is substantial disagreemet with whether the label "policy" actually applies to something, and that <i>is</i> the case here, or "ATT made inactive" would not be an available option. Read the plain wording of the poll, Jimbo's concerns, and the template. "This page's designation as a policy or guideline is disputed" is the wording on the template. Making WP:ATT inactive is by definition a change of the page's designation (probably to Historical). PS: Yes, "Proposed" is clearly wrong. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 21:33, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

You still don't understand {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisputedtag_63ab.html" title="Template:Disputedtag">disputedtag</a>}}'s meaning.

<dd>I believe you've miscast my argument. I've <i>never</i> said what you bring up in point #1, and already said just the opposite: {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisputedtag_63ab.html" title="Template:Disputedtag">Disputedtag</a>}} <i>cannot</i> be placed on something that isn't already a policy or guidline; I don't think anyone, anywhere, ever has sugested that {{Disutedtag}} is equivalent to {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProposal_1286.html" title="Template:Proposal">Proposal</a>}}; that would just be silly (nor that <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> should be tagged with the latter, which would also be silly). That you have edited the template, along with numerous others, doesn't strike me as particularly relevant, much less authoritative. About the only message I can reasonably take away from what you have said is that you believe it makes sense to oppose addition of this template, until the moment the poll opens, and oppose for now only because in this one special case <a href="../../../j/i/m/WP%7EJIMBOSAID_3445.html" title="WP:JIMBOSAID">Jimbo has said</a> something you interpret as trumping all other definitions of "designation as a policy is disputed".

<dd>1. I've tried very hard to clarify, but you <i>still</i> don't understand what I'm saying or what {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisputedtag_63ab.html" title="Template:Disputedtag">disputedtag</a>}} means. Again, it does <b>not</b> apply to a situation in which someone believes that a policy/guideline should no longer be a policy/guideline (which probably is true of <i>every</i> policy/guideline). It's for use when someone believes that something <i>isn't</i> a policy/guideline but has been falsely tagged as one. Jimbo has the authority to create policy, so there is no possibility that this page has been improperly tagged as such.</dd>
<dd>2. I cited the fact that I authored the wording because you're quoting it as evidence that the tag means something that it doesn't. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Levy_9c9c.html" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 00:23, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is not what the template actually says; it says that the designation as a guideline/policy is disputed. Disputes of that nature <a href="../../../c/c/c/WP%7ECCC_b716.html" title="WP:CCC">can arise for reasons other</a> than false tagging. If your overly narrow interpretation were the only one possible, then the template would simply be TfD'd in a heartbeat as totally useless, because false tagging of things as guidelines is simply reverted on sight. If you don't believe me, go write some random essay and slap a guideline tag on it. We'll probably just have to agree to disagree on this issue; you don't believe my view, I don't believe yours, and I don't think we're going to change our opinions on the matter. You seem to be confirming that your template history citation <i>is</i> a claim to non-existent authority; you were only one of many people who worked on the wording there, and your interpretation isn't automatically any more valid than that of others. Meanwhile the template's talk page supports my view. I explained uses for this template months ago, and they have not been refuted, and they countered interpretations that <i>really</i> didn't make sense, such as "someone doesn't like this policy/guideline". But really, with the newly widespread advertising of the community discussion page my reasons for insisting on the template's presence here are effectively moot, so I don't particularly want to continue this circular argument any longer. I'm happy with my interpretation, and you seem to be with yours, so "oh well". &#160;:-) — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 00:41, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>1. Yes, it says that the designation as a guideline/policy is disputed. That means that someone has designated the page a policy/guideline and someone else believes that it isn't one. It does <i>not</i> mean that someone believes that the designation should be changed. If your overly broad interpretation were correct, nearly <b>every</b> policy/guideline page would bear this tag at all times.</dd>
<dd>2. The template <i>was</i> TfD'd by a user who shared your misunderstanding. I suggest that you read <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_Log_2006_September_27_8857.html#Template:Disputedtag_and_Template:Disputedpolicy" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/2006 September 27">the discussion</a>.</dd>
<dd>3. Yes, if someone slaps a policy/guideline tag on a page that obviously isn't a policy/guideline, it will simply be removed. This tag is for use in a reasonable disagreement as to a page's status (e.g. some editors believe that consensus was reached, but others don't).</dd>
<dd>4. No, I'm <i>not</i> claiming that I possess any special authority. I'm pointing out that you're telling me what I meant when I wrote something.</dd>

<dd>If user Jimbo Wales said it's policy for now until the discussion is over and we're going with that, then the disputedpolicy tag would not be appropriate because it implies there's a dispute about whether the policy applies at the moment. I like the current tag: <i>"This page was created to serve as a combination of Wikipedia:Verifiability, Wikipedia:No original research and Wikipedia:Reliable sources. It was believed that consensus for such a merger was reached, but that has been called into question. For the time being, this remains the canonical policy page, but the above pages retain their applicability. Pending long-term resolution of this dispute (presently under discussion), the page has been protected from editing. This is not an endorsement of the current version."</i> It lets people know that something is happening. It wouldn't be good to have the page pretty much just say "this is policy." period if there's a discussion going on that might make it no longer policy, taking users of the page by surprise. -- the tag should indicate that there's such a discussion, which it does. However, the other pages e.g. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> still don't have the needed merge tags or similarly prominent tags. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 01:27, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>SMcCandlish, I'd like to second Jossi's message to you. What you are doing here is highly disruptive, and is bordering on, if not crossing into trollish behavior. We are trying to focus on finding the right wording for the straw poll requested by Jimbo, which is not an easy task. To get even more disruption here by having mediation <i>over a template</i> is really over the line. Please just accept that anything that does not have clear consensus must remain as it is for now, as we need stability to move forward.

<dd>You have the right to reject the mediation. Oh well, I tried. I have to point out that there <i>is no</i> agreement to keep related policies locked. The majority of those who have responded to the issue have challeged it, not supported it. The irony in what you are saying to me is almost unbelievable. It amounts to "Consensus is important! Except when Crum375 and Jossi want something!". Please. So, <i>no</i>, I am not going to simply "accept" what you are trying to impose. I don't feel I need to <i>say</i> anything more about the matter right now, but be very clear that my decision not to argue with you any further at this time emphatically does not equate to agreement with you. PS: The fact that we're focusing on the poll and that coming to consensus on it is hard has nothing whatsoever to do with the matter I sought arbitration about.

<p>Also posted to the general discussion page... I notice that there is a lot of confusion and disagreement about how RS fits into all of this... some people think that RS has been merged into ATT, some people think it hasn't. Some think that ATT elevates RS to Policy, others ardently deny this. I thought I would comment -</p>
<p>The problem is that RS has always been a unique case... falling into a grey zone between policy and guideline status. Both WP:V and WP:NOR discuss the need for reliable sources to back our edits... so, to some degree, the <i>concept</i> of RS has always been a Policy statement. Saddly, neither WP:V and WP:NOR explained what was <i>meant</i> by the term "reliable sources", or how to determine if a source was reliable or not - so a guideline page, "WP:RS", was created take care of this. Unfortunately, the creation of that guideline page put RS into a half in / half out status... on one hand editors could say "RS is Policy" since it is prominently mentioned in several Policy page... but on the other hand, editors could say "no-RS is only a Guideline. See, it says 'Guideline' at the top of the page". Those who wanted to inforce the <i>concept</i> as expressed on the Policy pages, edited the Guideline to emphisize its "these are the rules" nature, those who disagreed with this enforcement edited the guideline to stress it's "this is just guidance" nature. And so we ended up with a Guideline page that stated both "guidance" and "rules" ... Neither betwixt or between.</p>
<p>Now let's look at what happened with the creation of ATT ... some people have complained that ATT "elevated" WP:RS to Policy... others have complained that it "demoted" WP:RS to little more than an essay. But in reality it did neither. The conceptual, "these are the rules" side of RS was <i>re-incorporated</i> into the Policy discussion and made clearer, while the "this is guidance" side of WP:RS was shifted into the FAQ page, to be worked on and eventually made back into a guideline (I would recommend renaming it to something like "Determining reliability"). This was not an "elevation" of WP:RS to Policy status... nor was a "demotion" of WP:RS to something less than Guideline status ... it was a needed breaking up of something that had alway been a little bit of both.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_bbd5.html" title="Edit section: Dispute notice on talk page">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dispute notice on talk page</span></h2>
<p>I need other user's opinions as to whether I have a right to place a dispute notice at the top of this talk page.</p>
<p>Background: Some time ago, rather than placing a dispute tag on the policy page itself, as a somewhat less obtrusive way to indicate the presence of a dispute I placed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AAttribution&amp;diff=112835413&amp;oldid=112832527" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AAttribution&amp;diff=112835413&amp;oldid=112832527" rel="nofollow">this</a> notice at the top of the talk page, under some other notices at the top of the talk page. I consider that this dispute is still ongoing. A user whom I consider to be a party to the dispute, SlimVirgin, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AAttribution&amp;diff=113144783&amp;oldid=113144572" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AAttribution&amp;diff=113144783&amp;oldid=113144572" rel="nofollow">removed</a> the notice about 28 hours later and stated that "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACoppertwig&amp;diff=114189673&amp;oldid=114189666" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACoppertwig&amp;diff=114189673&amp;oldid=114189666" rel="nofollow">There is no dispute</a>", also asking me not to put the dispute notice back up and calling the dispute notice "disruptive editing". The reason I consider the user a party to the dispute is that the user has reverted both my edits to WP:ATT, (edits which I intended as logically partial reverts to the proposed new wording "attributable ... not whether it is true" because they eliminate or partially eliminate a new meaning that the new words introduce about the treatment of false but attributable information), and I still object to the new wording which has not been changed. I hereby repeat my invitation to user SlimVirgin to participate in debate with me on this issue at <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_bbd5.html#Role_of_truth" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution">Wikipedia talk:Attribution#Role of truth</a> with the goal of achieving mutual understanding, and of achieving persuasion one way or the other, or compromise, or a better solution, and of achieving consensus. Numerous other users have expressed opinions in this issue, including some quite similar to mine.</p>
<p>My position about having a dispute notice: I believe that the usual procedures for dispute tags should apply to this notice. I believe the usual procedure is that if a user puts up a dispute tag, other users are supposed to leave it there until the dispute is resolved, and if someone removes it before the dispute is resolved there is nothing wrong with the action of putting the dispute tag up again. I believe that the usual procedure when some parties claim that there is no dispute is to leave the dispute tag in place on the grounds that there is, at least, a dispute about whether there is a dispute or not.</p>
<p>Seeking input: Please comment on the status of the dispute notice, whether the dispute notice should be there or not, whether I have a right to have it there even if there is no consensus for having it there, whether it would be wrong of "disruptive" of me to put the notice back up again, and whether it would be wrong for someone to remove it again before there is agreement that the dispute is resolved. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 17:22, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In theory, I can't see any rationale for reverting the good-faith talk page edits of others, generally, unless there is something demonstrably wrong about them, like putting {{<a href="../../../w/p/m/Template%7EWPMILHIST_6777.html" title="Template:WPMILHIST">WPMILHIST</a>}} on <a href="../../../b/u/g/Talk%7EBugs_Bunny_7c8d.html" title="Talk:Bugs Bunny">Talk:Bugs Bunny</a>), or archiving talk page discussions that are still in progress, or making personal attacks (scratch that; that is not a good faith edit anyway), or the post was obviously made to the wrong page because the editor forgot which edit window they were in, and so on. But doing so with the rationale that "There is no dispute" would obviously be nonsensical POV-pushing, since the dispute is <i>self-evident</i> right there for everone to read. We don't normally flag disputes in this way (usually we use non-talk page dispute templates), but we don't normally preface talk pages with POV statements either, and as the project page is locked, it seems like a rational way to note that there is a dispute. In this particular case, I think your notice is POV itself, because you signed it and directed readers to a specific topic you want them to see. A simpler statement to the effect of "However, not all editors agree that the intention of policy innovations has been achieved." on the end of the existing notice would do the trick and is much more neutral. WPians are smart enough to read around and make up their own minds without been led directly. That's my take. PS: No, it wouldn't be "disruptive" to post this again, and reverting it <i>could</i> be if the reversion rationale were nonsense again. PPS: Given how hot tempers have been around here, I wouldn't bother, since the wording change to "claimed" already makes the point that there are disputes about whether the intention has been achieved. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 00:55, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please, speak plain English. I'm fairly sure I have a commonsense understanding of the concept in question, but I find that reading this section leaves me shaking my head in bewilderment. Pardon me for coming late to the party; no doubt the present language reflects deep thought and debate, which I have not tried to research. Yet the end result is disappointing. Here is the text:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<hr style="width:15em" /></dd>
<dd>Editors often make the mistake of thinking that if <i>A</i> is published by a reliable source, and <i>B</i> is published by a reliable source, then A and B can be joined together in an article in order to advance position <i>C</i>. However, that would be an example of an unpublished synthesis of published material serving to advance a position, and it constitutes original research.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> "<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, therefore <i>C</i>" is acceptable only if a reliable source has published this argument <b>in relation to the topic of the article.</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here is an example from a Wikipedia article, with the names changed. The article was about Jones:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Smith says that Jones committed <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plagiarism.html" title="Plagiarism">plagiarism</a> by copying references from another book. Jones denies this, and says it's acceptable scholarly practice to use other people's books to find new references.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now comes the unpublished synthesis of published material:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>If Jones's claim that he always consulted the original sources is false, this would be contrary to the practice recommended in the <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Manual_of_Style_77c7.html" title="Chicago Manual of Style">Chicago Manual of Style</a></i>, which requires citation of the source actually consulted. The <i>Chicago Manual of Style</i> does not call violating this rule "plagiarism." Instead, plagiarism is defined as using a source's information, ideas, words, or structure without citing them.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The whole point of this paragraph is the conclusion that, given the <i>Chicago Manual of Style's</i> definition of plagiarism, Jones did not commit it. This is the editor's opinion; it is original research. If the paragraph attributed the opinion to a reliable source <i>that specifically commented on the Smith and Jones dispute</i> and made the same point about the <i>Chicago Manual of Style</i> and plagiarism, it would comply with this policy. In other words, that precise analysis must have been published by a reliable source <i>in relation to the topic</i> before it can be published in Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd>
<ol class="references">
<li id="_note-0"><small><b><a href="#_ref-0" title="">^</a></b> Jimmy Wales has discussed the problem of unpublished syntheses of existing material, stating: "Some who completely understand why Wikipedia ought not create novel theories of physics by citing the results of experiments and so on and synthesizing them into something new, may fail to see how the same thing applies to history." (Wales, Jimmy. <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-December/017591.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2004-December/017591.html" rel="nofollow">"Original research"</a>, December 6, 2004)</small></li>

</dl>
<p>I think all is well up until "Now comes the unpublished synthesis", but the following blockquote takes a strange sharp turn, hence tends to read like gobbledygook; and I fail to see how it supports the claim about "The whole point of this paragraph." Perhaps it would suffice to rewrite this second blockquote something like this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The <i>Chicago Manual of Style</i> supports Jones's position. The practice recommended there requires citation of the source actually consulted, but the Manual does not call violating this rule "plagiarism." Instead, plagiarism is defined as using a source's information, ideas, words, or structure without citing them. Jones's claim that he always consulted the original sources, even if false, does not rise to the level of plagiarism.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Or perhaps a better example can be devised. As it stands, this example is not clear writing, nor is the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/exegesis" class="extiw" title="wikt:exegesis">exegesis</a>. One assumes the policy is confusing enough to need a clarifying example. The writing in this section does not accomplish that, but instead piles on additional confusion. IMHO.</p>
<p>Again, apologies to those who have labored to get this far; the document as a whole is a welcome improvement. --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 17:27, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, this is an actual WP example, including the double negative; so there nay be resistance to chnaging it. The first sentence of your rewrite is actual OR (since the <i>CMS</i> doesn't mention Jones). The synthesis consists of implying that support without stating it. Perhaps.
<ul>
<li>The <i>Chicago Manual of Style</i> requires citation of the source actually consulted, although the Manual does not call violating this rule "plagiarism." If Jones did not consult the original sources, he violated this recommendation. Instead, plagiarism is defined as using a source's information, ideas, words, or structure without citing them.</li>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm assuming readers will realize that the <i>Chicago Manual of Style</i> does not explicitly mention Jones. In fact, isn't that the point of the example? Must support be <i>implied</i>, rather than stated, to have a synthesis? I assume that synthesizing conclusions without adequate foundation is to be avoided either way. The "<a href="../../../s/u/b/Subtext.html" title="Subtext">subtext</a>" of my revision of the second passage is, "(<i>In my opinion</i>) [t]he Chicago Manual of style supports …" and "… does not rise to the level of plagiarism (<i>in my opinion</i>)." It is the hidden interjection of opinion, masquerading as a claim supported by the Manual, that constitutes the problem.</dd>
<dd>Whether the example is taken from life is irrelevant; we need the example to be clear. As noted elsewhere, <i>many</i> articles draw together facts from diverse sources, which is not a problem <i>per se</i>. In fact, I assume that if this example said "Chen asserts that the <i>Chicago Manual of Style</i> supports Jones", where Chen is a reliable source, then all is well. Or if an editor compiles a (fair) list of relevant facts and leaves the reader to draw conclusions, that is also fine.</dd>
<dd>But the example, as given, is hopeless. Without further context, my complaint would be that the writing is poor, not that it improperly synthesizes a conclusion. I see an assertion in the commentary that the "whole point … is the conclusion …", but frankly (again, lacking context), I think that is far from clear. What about the <a href="../../../s/y/l/Syllogism.html" title="Syllogism">following</a>?
<ol>
<li>All men are mortal (Scholar 2001).</li>
<li>Socrates is a man (Expert 2005).</li>
<li>Socrates is mortal.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>Is the <tt>{{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}}</tt> tag justified? Does it depend on the details of the example? How is an editor to know? What if the final assertion were revised? "It may seem plausible to conclude that Socrates is mortal, but the judge has not yet issued a decision."</dd>
<dd>If a rule is so confusing that reasonable people cannot decide when it applies, it's a bad rule. If an example is supposed to clarify the rule and leaves us more confused than ever, it's a bad example. This is a bad example. Is there a good one? --<a href="../../../k/s/m/User%7EKSmrq_61e9.html" title="User:KSmrq">KSmrq</a><sup><a href="../../../k/s/m/User_talk%7EKSmrq_bfac.html" title="User talk:KSmrq">T</a></sup> 20:33, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You're probably right that the example needs to be clarified; but it does need to be implicit. This paragraph is designed to counter this psricular sort of bad editing; "The <i>Chicago Manual of Style</i> says Jones is a plagiarist" is covered by the rest of the policy, since it is false and unsourceable. Therefore any example which contains it is not an instance of novel synthesis. Perhaps two examples; one containing the forbidden conclusion, one without it. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 20:53, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, but I know from painful experience that editors may disagree on examples that seem as obvious as the above syllogism.</dd>
<dd>Back to the wording; how about the following:</dd>
<dd>
<blockquote>
<p>Jones acknowledges copying references without consulting the original sources. This is contrary to the practice recommended in the <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Manual_of_Style_77c7.html" title="Chicago Manual of Style">Chicago Manual of Style</a></i>, which requires citation of the source actually consulted. However, the <i>Manual</i> does not call violating this rule "plagiarism"; instead, it defines plagiarism as using a source's information, ideas, words, or structure without citing them. Therefore, Jones is correct in denying plagiarism.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
<dd>In this version we see an explicit editorial conclusion ("Jones is correct"), but no claim that the Manual <i>itself</i> asserts that conclusion. Does this satisfy the "must be implicit" requirement for the example? I think so. However, I also see this as perilously close to the syllogism, so close that reasonable editors will disagree.</dd>
<dd>Why is this not a syllogism? Well, one could argue that Jones did use information (the references) without citing the source; in which case Jones <i>did</i> commit plagiarism <i>as defined by the Manual</i>. Which view is correct? We don't know! The <i>editor</i> decided, which is a step too far. (Or so we are told.)</dd>
<dd>Often only an expert will notice such an issue, and may then have difficulty explaining why the conclusion is not justified. Yet it is also common for an expert to draw the conclusion, and then have difficulty responding to a challenge by a non-expert who is not convinced the conclusion is routine and uncontroversial.

<p>KSmrg is not the first one to be bewildered by this example. It makes no sense, because the "synthesis" is a simple logical conclusion, and simple logical conclusions don't count as synthesis. It's a holdover from the old policies, I've complained about it again and again, and it seems impossible to get rid of because of people who blindly insist on keeping everything in the old policy whether or not it makes sense.</p>
<p>Yes, it's a real example. It takes a bad decision made in a real example and uses it as precedent for all of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>(To top it off, I've been continually misunderstood about this. People have insisted that I think the statement should be allowed in a Wikipedia article. I don't--I just think that the explanation why not is wrong. It's an unreliable source, since the Chicago Manual of Style is not an authority on this particular case, not original research.) <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 17:47, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would like to echo the "please, speak plain english" plea of the original poster. The example of synthesis is confusing and difficult to follow, and it does not make logical sense even if you follow it closely. The whole point of an example is to explain the policy, and the example is failing to do so clearly.</p>
<p>I've proposed an alternative example at <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_FAQ_0e21.html#Example.28s.29_of_unpublished_synthesis" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution/FAQ">Wikipedia talk:Attribution/FAQ#Example(s) of unpublished synthesis</a>. I propose that the example is removed from this page (and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>) and replaced by the suggested example (or another alternative) at the FAQ.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any comments, objections, or alternative suggestions?</p>

<dd>Canonical is a common enough word with a well understood lay meaning. It lacks some of the nuances of "definitive" and may in some circumstances be a useful alternative. In fact using "definitive" to describe <i>written</i> policies on Wikipedia is probably a very, very bad idea. For instance, someone might get the idea that our policy is composed of fixed and immutable words. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 01:45, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>My congratulations to those who put this proposed guideline together. It is extraordinarily well done.</p>
<p>I do have one small point. Let's say <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Cuban_eda1.html" title="Mark Cuban">Mark Cuban</a>, in his [<a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com" class="external text" title="http://www.blogmaverick.com" rel="nofollow">blog</a>], says, "Bill Gates is a buffoon for reasons XYZ." If I am reading the the section on "self-published sources" correctly, this policy would prevent us from using that material (in an article where it would be appropriate to mention opinions of Bill Gates). But if the <i>Podunk Weekly Tribune</i> reports that Cuban says Bill Gates is a buffoon, we can use it.</p>
<p>That seems to be a little backwards, but perhaps that's the only feasible way the policy can be framed. No policy will be perfect. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 03:17, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think I agree with that assessment. Nothing could be more authoritative about <i>what Mark Cuban says</i> that Mark Cuban, so the blog in this very narrow instance would actually be a more reliable source for <i>that fact</i> than the random village newspaper (especially since that newspaper's source would almost certainly be the blog in the first place!) <i>Neither</i> are reliable sources for the alleged <i>fact</i> that Bill Gates is, said, or did anything. The little newspaper <i>would</i> be a good source for such an alleged fact if it were quoting a US District Attorney on what filing Microsoft made a hour ago in one of its court cases (though it is likely that less podunk sources could be found for the same quote unless they somehow got a scoop.) — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 10:53, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have spent far too much time now arguing on policy, so this will be the last thing I say, and then I will go back to editing the encyclopedia. I think the above little point is serious, and this has always bothered me. Mark Cuban's blog is probably the most reliable source in the world for what he thinks, but we don't care, because the guiding policies are <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUndue_weight_9fd9.html" title="WP:Undue weight">WP:Undue weight</a>. I think our policy would be much cleaner, if all these judgements about what sources to use are moved to NPOV. This is how my ideal Wikipedia policy would look like:</p>
<ol>
<li>We have one policy deciding what sources are used and how much weight is given to each source.
<ul>
<li>NPOV for normal articles.</li>
<li>BLP when it is applicable. (Yes, I would like BLP to overrule NPOV, not just say that NPOV should be applied more strictly, I believe a biography should have a slight <i>bias</i> towards a charitable presentation).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ATT decides how we are allowed to use sources to avoid doing original research.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is much head-ache when people include verifiable information on a biography citing WP:V or WP:ATT to back up their activities. And some people, including Jimbo, think the problem is due to original research using only primary sources; but <i>the problem is not with using primary sources!</i> Primary source are excellent when giving a purely descriptive plot summary of a book. The reason we don't like primary sources is when they are being used to argue a case (SYNT) or when they are used descriptively, but where they don't belong, as in a biography. News reports in the above context is one indication that the comment deserves to be given more weight, but it has nothing to do with verifiability. Before I even came to these conclusions, Armedblowfish had suggested that the Reliable sources guideline, if appropriately rewritten, might help clarify issues of due weight, see <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_and_undue_weight_b4f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources and undue weight">Wikipedia:Reliable sources and undue weight</a> for more information on that.

<p>"Reliable" is not a good generic term to describe the sources which wiki points to as the ones to use. A so-called reliable source which is mandatory to use may well be less reliable than a source which it is not permitted to use. This certainly doesn't help new editors to make sense of things. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> implies necessary sources may be unreliable, as its concept is "a means of dealing with conflicting views." If two sources have conflicting views one (or both) is by definition not reliable — although both their views must still be represented — so to carry on using the term for them is inaccurate and confusing. Terms proposed to replace "reliable" include "acceptable", "allowable", "permissible" and "appropriate". This proposal is not to change the guideline but to use a term that defines it better.

<p>Wikipedia, when it began had only one rule: "ignore all the rules". Since then a lot of well- meaning (and not so well meaning) people have made wikipedia a bureaucratic Frankenstien, with a million different rules.</p>
<p>Often those veteran editors who know wikipolicy the best are able to push their pet version of wikipedia than those who don't know all of the bureaucratic abreviations <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> etc.</p>
<p>The more veteran an editor, the more benefit this editor gets in pushing their view of wikipedia by knowing all of the bureaucratic rules. So these policy wonks who would be the most influencial in abolishing 99% of the rules, won't because all of the myraid of rules benefit them, because the rules handicap new users. In otherwords, veteran editors won't give up their power.</p>
<p>A few admins have personally complained to me that many admins and veteran users don't even write articles anymore, instead they frequent ICQ and socialize with like minded editors. These editors are here to push their vision of wikipedia, using wikipolicy.</p>
<p><b>SUGGESTION 1</b></p>
<p>I suggest we abolish 99% of all these rules, including the ones debated here. I know 99% of the editors here (including the same policy wonks who make and protect policy) will come up with all kinds of <a href="../../../s/l/i/Slippery_slope.html" title="Slippery slope">slippery slope</a> arguments why we should keep the million rules, so the proposal to abolish 99% of the rules is dead in the water.</p>
<p><b>SUGGESTION 2</b></p>
<p>Since abolishing all the rules is a pipe dream, why not create rules that help build wikipedia, not delete articles on wikipedia? <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> are often used by editors as an excuse to <b>remove</b> content. Aren't we all here to create content? We have <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> but were is [[WP:IS]]? 99% of the rules we created are negative: you can't do this, you can't do that. If I could change one thing on wikipedia it would be to remove the word "encyclopedia" from the title. Wikipedia is much, much more than a encyclopedia. Too many editors get stuck on the idea that since this is supposed to be an "encyclopedia" there needs to be a myrid of rules making wikipedia an encyclopedia. This is short sighted.</p>
<p>The longer wikipedia is around the more rules veteran wikipedians impose upon themselves. These rules make it harder for new wikiusers to join wikipedia, and it leaves a negative view of how wikipedia is run.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">WP:RfC</a> page is a nightmare of rules which only makes the admins job of screening out RfC's easier, but is a nightmare of requirments. Do we even need <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">WP:RfC</a> page? Do we need an arbcom? A body of supreme court wikipedia judges?</p>
<p>Personally, I hesitate to write any articles anymore because I am afraid some wikipedian will come along, and citing policy, delete everything I have wrote.</p>

<p>All of the quoting of and linking to statements by Jimmy Wales in the See Also and Sources and Notes sections is, I think, a bad idea. As a relative newbie editor myself, I don't much care what Jimmy Wales wanted Wikipedia to be, I care more about what Wikipedia is becoming because of individual contributions. I'd like to figure out what all the policy means, and if I think it makes sense, not when Jimmy said the particular part that is important on this page or this section of this page. I also think that the essentially exclusive citation of what Jimmy says can emphasize to Jimmy that if he wants to change things, he can just say so and, viola, it will all be changed. Wikipedia is a good idea because lots of people can contribute, not because one person can change the direction of the project on a whim. I like this policy.

The main problem I see is that it encourages noobs (and even experienced editors who don't spend any time in policy debates but almost exclusively work on articles) to quote Jimbo as athoritative, but out of context or when what he is saying is not an Office action, but simply him discussing things as a Wikipedian. Make it about the policy process rather than about the speaker, and much less <i>argumentum ad Jimbonem</i> (which the WP:ATT debate has been overflowing with) will occur.

<dd>Originally, Wikipedia was concerned with being a reliable source of information. It was based on the idea that "<a href="../../../l/i/n/Linus%27s_law.html#Linus.27_Law_according_to_Eric_S._Raymond" title="Linus's law">given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow</a>", and errors would, in general, be corrected faster than they were entered, leading to the encyclopedia converging towards truth. These original principles are still somewhat visible on <a href="../../../r/e/p/Wikipedia%7EReplies_to_common_objections_644f.html" title="Wikipedia:Replies to common objections">Wikipedia:Replies to common objections</a>.</dd>
<dd>The emphasis has since been shifted towards references, though, with newer policies that state things like <i>"The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth"</i> and say to remove unsourced statements on sight even if you know them to be true.</dd>
<dd>So yes, in the current policy paradigm, it is better to put in stuff about the moon turning blue than to put in things that are true. — <a href="../../../o/m/e/User%7EOmegatron_4264.html" title="User:Omegatron">Omegatron</a> 21:56, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>So does a reliable source refer to verifiability of the source, or to the reliability of the fact therein, or both?</dd>
<dd>The reason I ask is that some obscure scientific theories are often described in obscure journals. The publications are not well-known, but copies can be found in libraries. So the obscure theories are verifiable... the sources are reliable. But the theories being described could be bunkum, but are not described inappropriately.</dd>
<dd>So if we described Dr Spock's theory on the blue Moon, is the source wholly reliable if it's checkable? --84.9.191.165 22:22, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For scientific theories we generally require reputable peer-reviewed publications. Additionally, if they are very obscure, with minimal or no citing by other independent publications, we may consider them fringe theories, in which case they would not be included at all, per <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUNDUE_5fa0.html" title="WP:UNDUE">undue weight</a>. Also, if any exceptional claims are made, we require exceptional (i.e. even higher quality and quantity) sourcing. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 22:30, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why is citing required? Popular conspiracy theories do require reviews in order to describe them, unless we're going to include a section of critique?

<dd>As far as I know, the validity of a fringe theory is of no consideration to Wikipedia, after all, we do not assess the validity of the flat Earth theory, in order to include it (though we may have a critique section do just that)?</dd>
<dd>And doesn't notability requires any independent coverage, not just citations? After all, a fringe theory could be notable with a bunch of non-scientists, who are no less important than a bunch of scientists; and as long as we attribute, we satisfy notability?</dd>
<dd>Isn't it the <i>assessment</i> of a fringe theory that would require peer reviewed citations in order to write a critique? And this is very different from describing a fringe theory. --84.9.191.165 09:10, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The citing of a scientific paper by another independent publication adds more validity and/or notability to it (it may be cited as a flawed theory also). The decision to include or exclude a fringe theory in Wikipedia hinges on its notability (e.g. citing by others) as well as the number and quality of publications in which it appears, plus its acceptability in the mainstream. If it is really obscure and on the fringe, we don't include it, until it becomes either better known or validated by others, preferably both. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:20, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If a source is reliable, then it should not matter whether we are describing a myth or a fringe scientific theory. In which case "Reliable source" refers to the verifiability of the information, not to the validity of the myth or theory?</dd>

<p>i find that the relevant policies do not say enough about negative derivations from sources, which should be rightly classified as original research. what i mean here is that we are to detail what the source <i>does</i> say, not what the source <i>doesn't</i> say, especially when it's used to forward a POV, and especially when that source is a primary source. for example, if a source says "He pleaded not guilty to murder", yet one cites it postulating: "He did not plead not guilty to manslaughter". another example would be a source which says "Do not kill innocent men", yet you cite it saying "Source X says nothing about not killing innocent children". there are hundreds of things that a source may not mention, and to utilise that is a manipulation of the source. i have come across an editor doing exactly that: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ma_malakat_aymanukum&amp;diff=118178225&amp;oldid=118028945" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ma_malakat_aymanukum&amp;diff=118178225&amp;oldid=118028945" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. he has been warring, persistently, and against numerous editors, to include this negative derivation which is clearly intended to forward a POV. he is not interested in ceasing this behaviour despite having the policy explained to him, including by an admin. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 19:52, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This issue is adequately addressed in the current policy. An editor cannot attribute to a source what the source doesn't say; this is equivalent to a ban on negative derivation. For example, one cannot attribute the statement "Source X says nothing about not killing innocent children" to source X because source X contains no such statement (I presume). <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 19:59, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that this is a problem ... but I think it is a NPOV issue more than a NOR issue. The relevant policy for any addition on this would be WP:NPOV. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 20:01, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>i agree that the ban on negative derivation can essentially be deduced from the policy (i just think it needs to be a little more explicit). the issue here, as opposed to attributing something to a source what it does not say, is actually making the observation that the source says nothing about X. Blueboar, i was thinking it would be more of an ATT-based issue because negative deductions, regardless of their accuracy, are essentially OR. is it possible to have a word or two just making this explicit so editors don't have to waste time responding to justifications like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ma_malakat_aymanukum&amp;diff=118178225&amp;oldid=118028945" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ma_malakat_aymanukum&amp;diff=118178225&amp;oldid=118028945" rel="nofollow">this</a>? <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 20:22, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I do not think negative derivation should be <i>banned</i>, although we should be extremely careful with it. Suppose, for example, some editor insists on adding that <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Webster_5371.html" title="Daniel Webster">Daniel Webster</a> introduced a bill on telegraphy to the moon in 1835, and cites some crank in support of it. It is extremely unlikely that any reputable source will have bothered to deny the claim; but we can say that no biographer (including X who lists all of Webster's legislative actions) mentions it. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 22:34, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This suggestion of ban for negative derivation is a manifestation of danger of decreasing the priority of "goal-oriented policies" in favor of "procedure-oriented" I was speaking in the section <a href="#Role_of_the_truth_3_:_.22Sweeping_Responsibility_under_the_Rug.22_or_.22Axiomatic_Introduction_into_Wikitruth.22" title="">#Role of the truth 3 : "Sweeping Responsibility under the Rug" or "Axiomatic Introduction into Wikitruth"</a>. If we think of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> as primary rule, then this is a non-issue: absence of a separate statement is just as <b>equally immediately verifiable</b> as its presence, with the only difference that the verification will take twice as long time on average: you have to read the <i>whole source</i> for negative derivation. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 01:25, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>After second careful reading I see that this section in fact discusses 4 different things. In particular, the referred "editor doing exactly that: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ma_malakat_aymanukum&amp;diff=118178225&amp;oldid=118028945" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ma_malakat_aymanukum&amp;diff=118178225&amp;oldid=118028945" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>" violates a yet another rule of common sense: of course "Koran" doesn't write that master is not forbidden to shave female's slave genitals and not forbidden to feed her with only <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahlep.html" title="Sahlep">sahlep</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Dondurma.html" title="Dondurma">dondurma</a> and ... The issue is relevance: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of trivia</a>. At the same time the quoted statement would make sense in the context of a general discussion of consent to sex in Islam: since Qur'an is #1 one authority for Islam, the fact that a certain issue is not covered deserves mention. On the other hand, <a href="../../../t/a/f/Tafsir.html" title="Tafsir">what Qur'an says and what says not</a> cannot be judged by a random wikipedian: it says more than a layman may read. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 01:41, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Regrettably there doesn't seem to be a policy against derivations from absence of something in source - in fact negative derivation seems to be used in one of Wikipedia's own policy statements. At least that's the only way I can interpret the so-called example of new synthesis at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:SYN" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:SYN" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:SYN</a> - you have to assume that a negative deribvation is made by the authr of the text complained about (and I do mean assume - that author suggests no such deduction) to call the thing a synthesis (the synthesized conclusion isn't stated by the author either, so it would be a bad example even without requiring one to assume a negative derivation). 81.138.97.98 20:07, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jimbo Wales requested a poll to gauge community thoughts on the Wikipedia:Attribution merger. A poll for this is being crafted, and is somewhat close to done. Concensus for the past 24 hours (with the occasional dissenting <i>voice</i> of course) that the thing is close to done. Only the main question is still heavily debated.

<p>To sort that out. Accepted <i>group</i> concensus seems to be to pre-poll to 4/1/07 22:00 and then launch a site-wide poll (again, as implied/requested by Jimbo) at 4/2/07 00:00.

<p>The example in the section on unpublished syntheseis is somewhat flawed. First it misses the point that the offending paragraph is self-contradictory, so the statements in it can hardly have come from a reliable source. Then it claims that the whole point of the offending paragraph is a conclusion that the offending paragraph does not in fact draw.</p>
<p>If comeone wants to claim that the thing isn't self-contradictory they have to explain how one can use a source without using any of its information, ideas, words, or structure! Or perhaps explain to me why someone should be allowed to cite this comment as a source supporting the idea that pigs can fly just because it doesn't say explicitly that they can't.

<p>I suggest that the two main subsections of WP:ATT ("Reliable Sources" and "No Original Research") be reversed so that "Reliable Sources" comes first. The reason is that "Reliable sources is positive instruction (telling people what to do) and "No Original Research" is negative instruction (telling people what not to do). I believe the human mind handles instructions a lot better when the positive instructions are given first. Then the person can form images in their mind when reading the positive instructions, and modify those images when reading the negative instructions. Putting the negative instructions first can lead to blank images in the mind and a feeling of frustration with the question "Well, what <i>am</i> I supposed to do then?" until the person gets to the positive-instruction part of the page. From then on you have a user who was experiencing frustration while reading one of the key policies for the first time. Also, I expect that the positive instructions will need to be referred to more often, since people are more likely to need details about how to do what they are actually doing, than details about what they're avoiding doing -- I could be wrong on that point, but in any case it helps to have the more-often-used part first. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 00:49, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The page can't be edited, yet there's no page protection notice to indicate what's going on. There is no justifiable reason for such an omission. At the same time, this is obviously a highly disputed policy, but there's no disputed policy tag on the page. It's absurd to remove a disputed policy tag in the middle of such contention. Meanwhile, a poll is being conducted, but the talk page indicates that in several instances editors attempted to stop the poll by removing the text of votes. Some editors have been directly dismissive of comments simply because they dispute the claim that this merger represents NO change in policy. I hesitate to express my opinion, or expend any energy on a process that's sabotaged, and subjected to out of hand dismissive comments, but I try to maintain hope that when my opinion is asked for it might actually be listened to. In any event, it seems I've stumbled into an ugly mess. This is highly discouraging, frustrating, and counter productive if consensus is a goal. And, I believe it's irresponsible not to clearly indicate the disputed status of this policy until some resolution occurs.<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 23:05, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have issues with <i>both</i> of these statements. To Zadignose: The tag at the very top of the page serves as a custom version of both a {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisputedtag_63ab.html" title="Template:Disputedtag">Disputedtag</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProtected_7bf5.html" title="Template:Protected">Protected</a>}} template (and {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergeto_cea0.html" title="Template:Mergeto">Mergeto</a>}} for that matter), after days and days of fighting and consensus building to get something on this page that served these purposes. Please don't re-open an old wound.</dd>
<dd>To WAS 4.250, you appear to be misunderstanding the meaning and import of {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisputedtag_63ab.html" title="Template:Disputedtag">Disputedtag</a>}}; it is <i>not</i> for content disagreements with what a policy document says, but for whether a policy document has consensus to represent policy, as that particular document; So, its use would have been just fine here. The only way we could indicate that the content of the underlying policy materials was itself disputed (which isn't the case; this is hypothetical) would be if all four (five, including ATTFAQ) documents were tagged with a new template saying as much; but a <i>lot</i> of people would disagree that any such template should/could reasonably exist, given that policy is descriptive not prescriptive except when it comes from Jimbo/the legal office (e.g. the copyright policy and WP:BLP). Even tagging all of them with {{<a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDisputedtag_63ab.html" title="Template:Disputedtag">Disputedtag</a>}} wouldn't indicate that the underlying policy language was disputed; in fact, such tagging would accurately describe the present situation, as there is a dispute over whether the policy material should be in ATT (and ATTFAQ to the extent that it has absorbed parts of RS), which automatically means there is a counter-dispute about them remaining separate as V, NOR and RS.</dd>
<dd>All that said, everyone on all sides appears to be content with the present merge/protect/dispute custom templates, except for Zadignose (who may now better understand that they serve the purposes he/she wants to be served by such templates.) I.e., this is a total non-issue at this point. Given that I was among the first to raise the issue to begin with, I think I'm pretty right about this one. &#160;:-)</dd>

<dd>All right, I'm not looking to stir up mud. If the bundle of comments in the first template are generally accepted as a substitute for "disputed" and "protected," while describing the contents as canonical and standing alongside a template that declares this a widely accepted official policy that all users should follow... well, I'll have to go along with that until a real resolution comes along. But I remain disturbed by the impression it gives. The presence of this text at the top of the talk page is also disturbing: "<b>The project page associated with this discussion page is an official policy on Wikipedia. It has wide acceptance among editors and is considered a standard that all users should follow. Before you update the page, make sure that any changes you make really do reflect consensus.</b>" When we talk here, must we embrace this assumption? It seems highly deceptive to preface the talk page with the claim that the policy has wide acceptance when that acceptance is now being guaged and is far from certain to result in a consensus to support what is already claimed. Well, well, let it be, let it be.<a href="../../../z/a/d/User%7EZadignose_7917.html" title="User:Zadignose">zadignose</a> 04:24, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You kinda do have to go along with ATT being <i>presently</i> canonical, since Jimbo said it is (in his official role). No, you don't have to embrace the assumption that this situation will continue; that's what the poll is about, after all.

<dd>English-language sources should be used whenever possible, because this is the English Wikipedia. Sources in other languages are acceptable if no English equivalents have been found. Published translations are preferred to editors' translations; when editors use their own translations, the original-language material should be provided too, preferably in a footnote, so that readers can check the translation for themselves.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I'm afraid "equivalent" is a bit vague in that regard. It might be understood to entail "of equal quality", but it might also be taken to mean "of broadly similar value". Sometimes "equivalent" does mean something like "virtually identical", but since sources in different languages are rarely virtually identical, one is left on one's own in ascertaining exactly what degree of similarity is meant here. I'm afraid that people will take this to mean that if there is <i>a</i> source in English supporting the assertions in the text, it is to be preferred to a foreign-language source, even though the foreign-language source might be more informative, more appropriate, or of higher quality for some other reason. In any case <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> has been claimed by many not to depart from policy established in <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and that page is more explicit on this point.

<dd>I agree, and I believe I may have argued against the reduced wording at the time, but I can't be sure. In general, we need to get *way* back to what was originally in WP:V and WP:RS. It's these kinds of subtle changes that concern me; in particular, the non-English-language sources concern me, as I've seen the POV-warring which results when POV pushers put idiosyncratic interpretations on their own translations. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 11:26, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am currently in discussion with someone about whether the long form of an acronym is well known or not. I stated that the majority of people refer to that train system (<a href="../../../m/t/r/MTR_7c6f.html" title="MTR">MTR</a>) by its acronym and are unlikely to know the long form. The other poster states that I need evidence to show that it is the case. And yet the website of that corporation, along with its customer site refers to itself as the acronym. Hence by common sense, most people who want to learn about the corporation will know the system by its acronym. The only documents mentioning that train system in its full form are government documents and tourist guides, which, I assume by common sense, most tourists and citizens won't read. So, how am I going to show that I am correct if it's impossible to find any strict academic statistic indicating that it is true? Apart from this, the other poster is challanging the current title of the present material.

<dd>For those who have never heard of the Mass Transit Railway, e.g. tourists and many people not from Hong Kong / Asia, the full name is much more descriptive than the acronym. Hence, it would be a better title. Once establishing that MTR is the acronym for the Mass Transit Railway, you may as well use MTR for the rest of the article. The problem with "common sense" is that it is frequently not universal.

<p>I wish to point out something that is not getting much attention here, and it is that <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> has really been a very sloppy policy. It takes care of the worst offenders, but others can slip through its cracks. Unlike the current WP:NOR policy, this one very forcefully makes it clear that verifiability and not truth are the standard for this encyclopedia. The latter is very important since everyone who wants to post their original research here is screaming "this it the truth" (or even "this is Truth")!</p>
<p>The hole in WP:NOR comes from there are new ideas out these that do get placed in peer reviewed publications so that they can be considered and debated. Most of these get very little attention, and you gat a primary source either without secondary sources or secondary sources that refute the primary source. Such items are not notable, and perhaps more importantly are not verifiable since they lack a comprehensive "paper trail". Being on a stronger footing with respect to keeping ideas of this ilk out is an asset to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>If you want to know where I am coming from, I am doing original research of my own. I have considered the point at which it would become proper for inclusion in Wikipedia, and the answer that I come up with is when my ideas become debated amongst gravitation specialists. This will not occur as of its initial publication, and any such debate nmay take years to develop even if my ideas are correct.

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I noticed these statements on ATT and V:</p>
<p>ATT: "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is attributable to a reliable published source, not whether it is true." V: "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth."</p>
<p>These are totally wrong and misleading, as they say "<i>The</i> threshold for inclusion". The bar is in fact much higher than this -- <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, etc. all provide additional criteria that must be satisfied for inclusion. These statements contain the misleading idea that <i>anything</i> attributable/verifiable is game for WP -- your street number, telephone number, anything from the local porn mag, etc. even though such things are most certainly <i>not</i> suitable. Although a seasoned WP user may be able to see that the bar is higher, what about new, inexperienced users? Let's say that somebody just comes in, reads WP:ATT/WP:V, sees this, but not noticing the other policies, decides to put in an article about their street or something, and then they see it AFDed and disappear, with comments in the discussion like "non-notable", or "directory entry", etc. which they wouldn't have known were real criteria since they though that the threshold was only attribution/verifiability. I would suggest these sentences be reworded by changing the initial part "The threshold for inclusion..." to "One of the most important criteria for inclusion...". This would emphasize the importance of this criterion but not go so far as to make it seem as though it is the <i>sole</i> criterion (which is flat wrong). mike4ty4 23:30, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would say the issue is far less binary than that. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> talks of both inclusion and reputability of sources as matters of degree. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> says to "divide space describing the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources".

<dd>The entire statement seems to be the source of much contention anyway. I'd suggest a complete rephrase, perhaps to something more like "That material is <i>true</i> is not grounds to include it in Wikipedia: it must instead be <i>attributable to a reliable published source</i>". <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 10:46, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

Now, if we delete the Flat Earth theory, then we <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#Merging" title="WP:N">encourage greater inclusion of it in the Earth article</a>, thereby giving it more weight.

<dd>That sounds right to me, even if not terribly convenient. We have always treated novels and the like as self-sourcing, basically (i.e. if the dialogue just mentioned were from a book, one would certainly not need to cite a third-party source such as a book review or Cliff's Notes for the quote), and I can't see that this is any different for videos, songs or other media, just because they aren't dead trees. I would certainly have no objection at all to a time code identifying where in the film or song or whatever the cited material occurred, by way of analogy to a page number in a book, but I would not <i>insist</i> on it (especially since it may not be very accurate at all for material sourced from video or audio tape - analog VHS tape runs at different speeds in different machines - vs. DVDs or other digital media. Another way of looking at it is that if we <i>can't</i> source in this manner, then virtually every single TV show and movie article is at least partially unsourced, and many (I mean thousands) would have to be immediately AfD'd as utterly <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unsourced and therefore unreliable</a>, because they are entirely self-sourcing. This is a goose/gander issue, really. If it's good enough for novels and comic books, it's good enough for movies and album tracks. PS: this does point out a somewhat different issue, namely that a clever <a href="../../../d/e/_/WP%7EDE_3fff.html" title="WP:DE">disrupter</a> can fairly easily create plausible but totally fake citations to things like TV shows few people ever watched, songs on out-of-print albums, and so forth; but this is not a problem unique to non-paper media. It is equally trivial to assert cited facts from books, magazines, comics, and newspapers so hard to obtain that no one is ever likely to verify that the citations are valid.

<dd>PS: WP and books are emphatically <i>not</i> the same medium. The fact that you can fairly easily quote a text passage from a book into e-text on Wikipedia is no different from quoting a clearly-spoken passage in a movie. Both are precisely equally verifiable (and precisely equally difficult to verify in that one has to obtain and examine the source); the only difference is that <i>if</i> you are given a page number, the source will be more quickly verifiable if it is in print.

<dd>For books we have google book searches etc, and we can locate a word in written electronic media within seconds. We can also request the user for a page number, and that would make it really easy to verify. Reading a book requires no special technology. But watching a video available only on VHS, (or DVD) requires one have a video cassette player, or DVD player. Also books can be easily obtained from libraries (that's how I verify them), but libraries have relatively few collections of movies, and even less of tv programmes.</dd>

<dd>Technology and cost are not relevant. If, for example, Donald Duck (Disney) and Bugs Bunny (Warner) appeared together on a <a href="../../../v/i/e/ViewMaster_f3fe.html" title="ViewMaster">ViewMaster</a> disk, that disk would be its own source (one would need to identify it by serial number and so forth). The fact that the (hypothetical) item is hard to find, and requires a special viewing apparatus is of no consequence. Similarly, there might be a recording of <a href="../../../e/n/r/Enrico_Caruso_1297.html" title="Enrico Caruso">Enrico Caruso</a> that only exists on a 78 rpm vinyl record, never re-released on CD. Quoting the lyrics of that song and sourcing it to the 78 in question is not problematic, even though it requires an old-school record player to play it, and obtaining it might cost you $2500 on eBay. By way of a real-world comparison, three of the most valuable sources on <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-pocket.html" title="One-pocket">One-pocket</a> cost easily $700 to $1500 to obtain, each, because they are out of print (books) and major collectors' items. The most valuable reference for <a href="../../../c/u/e/Cue_sport.html" title="Cue sport">cue sports</a> in general usually runs $500 to $900 itself for similar reasons. Too bad, so sad.

Yes they can provide <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">convenience links</a>, but that is beside the point. There are literally at least hundreds of thousands of books that Google isn't cognizant of (same goes for Amazon, etc.) Modern gee-whiz search tech is fantastic for things that are in print or semi-recently were in print, yet utterly, unbelievably useless for much older but authoritative historical material that predates the concept of the ISBN number. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 04:10, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With so many in support of WP:ATT, it also leaves open the question of whether NOR, V and RS have "wide acceptance". I think the status quo of <i>everything</i> being policy is the best way to continue until we can sort out a solution. A large proportion of the objections to WP:ATT were not objections to its content, but its form, so I think it is fair to say that the content has wide acceptance, and that is all that is necessary (I think) to have a policy tag on the page. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 07:40, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The content of WP:ATT does not have wide acceptance. A number of users have expressed objections to its content. I have expressed strong objection. The proponents of the current wording of WP:ATT have shown a reluctance to discuss the reasons for the wording and possible alternative wordings. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 13:35, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would disagree with Coppertwig. I think there definitely is broad support for the <i>content</i> of ATT. Very few of the "oppose" comments discussed content issues. By far, the majority of the "opposed" comments discussed the feeling that V and NOR express a significantly different idea and should not be merged... but said nothing about the content. Indeed quite a few "opposed" comments expressed support for the idea of exporting the wording of ATT to clean up and imporove V and NOR. The issue <i>isn't</i> content, but concept. Is it better to have one policy or two? <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 14:05, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My opposition said that it wasn't a bad idea to merge, but it WAS the content that was the problem. Even excluding the RS parts, ATT subtly changes V as to how and which sources can be used. That is a fundamental change. It expresses the ideas of a minority of wikipedians who are very active in editing att/nor/v/rs but it doesn't express consensus. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 15:49, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, there is no question that a few people have issues with the content ... taking a quick look at the comments, I come up with aproximately 30 of the "oppose" comments that mention one aspect of the content or another as being an issue. That is around 8% of the "oppose" votes and 3% of the total. To me, this indicates that while there is not broad support for the <i>concept</i> of ATT, there is fairly broad support for the <i>content</i> of ATT. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 18:12, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>True... I suppose what I am getting at here is that Coppertwig seemed to be saying that since there was no broad consensus in favor of the ATT merger, there was also no consensus for the language. We certainly can't say that with the results of this poll. Actually, what the poll indicates is that most people feel there are concerns that are more pressing than content that need to be addressed... things like which of these pages should be policy, and how we should go about it. We can argue about language once we know for sure what we are arguing about and where. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 20:58, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Part of the problem with the merge is that the question of merger was commingled with all the refinements of language that came about in the process. For example, WP:V says almost nothing about when citations should be in-line, and ATT was attacked from all sides of that debate.</p>
<p>I support almost all of what WP:ATT actually says; where it has new language from WP:V it does represent current best practice.

<dt>Limitations of sourcing requirements</dt>
</dl>
<p>If a material passes <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html" title="Neutral point of view">Neutral point of view</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, it has its place on wikipedia. But, such material needs not always to be based on sources, and unwanted material may be rejected using other (more adapted) principles. The key to source requirement is: if a reasonable doubt arises on this material, how can it be verified?</p>
<ul>
<li>Common knowledge material ("<i><a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> (pronounced /ˈlʌndən/) is the capital city of England and the United Kingdom</i>") needs no special source, as long as it respects the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html" title="Neutral point of view">Neutral point of view</a> criterium (is the prononciation the same everywhere?). If you doubt this information, the point can be easily checked.</li>
<li>Explanation material ("<i>Sex-selective abortion was rare before the late 20th century because of the difficulty of determining the sex of the fetus before birth</i>" - <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex-selective_abortion_and_infanticide.html" title="Sex-selective abortion and infanticide">picked here</a>) is welcome, as long as the information is relevant with respect to the article. Any reader capable of understanding the sentence can see the point, there can be no reasonable doubt on such a material.</li>
<li>Most scientific material (see <a href="../../../p/o/k/Poker_probability.html" title="Poker probability">Poker probability</a> for instance) can be easily explained and/or demonstrated if needed. The limit here is that of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and relevance/notoriety, but a presentation of maths underlying poker probability is welcome if adapted to the potential reader. Such presentation can be easily checked and corrected by contributers of the same field.</li>
<li>Non-controversial material needs not to be heavily sourced&#160;: reading "<i>The blizzards generated in the north each winter often drift southward into the central highlands</i>" in <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography_of_Bhutan_99c9.html" title="Geography of Bhutan">Geography of Bhutan</a> seems an interesting description, and the general reference to <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library_of_Congress_Country_Studies_1c77.html" title="Library of Congress Country Studies">Library of Congress Country Studies</a> seems quite enough for that article.</li>
</ul>
<p>If not everywhere, when is a source required, then? A source is clearly needed for statements that are both potentially controversial, and could not be verified otherwise. "<i>In his early teens, Albert <a href="../../../e/i/n/Einstein.html" title="Einstein">Einstein</a> attended the new and progressive Luitpold Gymnasium</i>"= non controversial, whereas "<i>Einstein publicly stated reservations about the proposal to partition the British-supervised British Mandate of Palestine into independent Arab and Jewish countries</i>" should clearly be:</p>
<ul>
<li>there may be doubts on that material,</li>
<li>and the only way to settle a dispute on authenticity would be a source.</li>

<dd>Generally, I'd disagree there. <i>Sourcing is required</i>, period, not a nicety, not only necessary in certain cases. Granted, non-controversial and very plausible information may effectively never have someone come along to demand a source. But <i>if someone does</i>, the information must be sourced or removed. If you need a reliable source that the chemical formula for water is H2O, it'll take you all of two minutes, arguing would take more time than just providing the source. If something is <i>really</i> common knowledge, that's always the case—sourcing will be easy to find. If not, the knowledge isn't as common as you thought, and a source is needed all the more. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a></sup></small> 07:50, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Agreed. Sourcing is required for anything that a reader might not know, which is just about everything. Given the appalling grasp of geography that I've seen some people show, I don't suspect it would take too much searching to find somebody who didn't know that London was the capital of the UK, particularly if you're asking in non-Western countries. Limited logical deduction is OK, as long as you stay within the limits of what most readers would be able to follow and be sure is correct. The only caveat is that you're free to leave out the sources for things you think will be uncontroversial until somebody requests them. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 12:15, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>When a source is not problematic, well, .. it's not a problem, of course. Sourcing is clearly a good <i>recommendable practice</i>, I agree. But taking it as a <i>requirement</i> is too strong.</p>
<p>The problem we often have on fr: is not about good faith contributors, but POV ones, very clever at using the rules of the system, who tend to supress what is against their opinion in the articles on the (factual) basis that it is not sourced. As the rule is stated, they are formally right "Sourcing is required" - but a supression clearly leads to POV article and loss of relevant material. Moderators are helpless in front of such vandalism: they see it's a POV argument, but they are stuck with the respect of a formal rule, the original contributor has gone since long &amp; can't answer, and they usually can't find themeselves a relevant source which would close the case... Never seen that on en:? well, maybe it's a french exception, then.</p>
<p>All this because what is proposed is the formal rule (sourcing), which is just a mean to quality, and not the objective themeselves, which are <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html" title="Neutral point of view">Neutral point of view</a> and relevance. What we need to fight against such vandalism is a caveat saying everything inserted should be sourced "<i>whenever relevant</i>" and can be remouved if unsourced "<i>when the material is dubious and litigious, and can only be verified by linking it to a reliable source</i>". It's obvious, but only for contributors with good faith, &amp; those are not the problem I'm after.</p>
<p>Sourcing requirement formally prohibits any kind of synthesis, introductive or explanatory work, which is clearly outside the point. And for trivialities, sourcing is most of the time not pertinent, though possible. For common knowledge, "everybody knows" (at least, any parent), for instance, that when a baby pierces its teeth it tends to get irritated bottom - how could you ever <i>seriously source</i> such a thing?&#160;;o) The sourcing terrorism is such that some contributors tend now to oversource, and try to put a reference in front of each and every assertion of an article, because this is the supposed quality requirement for Wikipedia (!) Is this what you want? This is what the rule says... <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichelet_9211.html" title="User:Michelet">Michelet</a>-<a href="../../../../fr/m/i/c/Discussion_Utilisateur%7EMichelet_086d.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Discussion_Utilisateur:Michelet">Me laisser un message</a> 16:03, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Uh, I have kids, and I've never seen "toothing causes an irritated bottom." If you put that into an article, I <i>would</i> be very likely to request a source. But that's exactly why sourcing is the best policy. You and I could argue all day long, and I wouldn't convince you and you wouldn't convince me. But if you can provide a medical journal, saying that's really so, then into the article it goes, and my personal experience is irrelevant. On the other hand, if you can find nothing but anecdotal evidence, it does <i>not</i> belong in the article.

<dd>Uh, I had quite a few kids myself and I know what this guy was talking about. Toothing is colloqually associated with fever and diarrhea. And it is very easy to find discussions of this, as long as you use proper terms, rather than "baby talk" ("sore bottom", etc.), like, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=baby+teeth+diarrhea&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=baby+teeth+diarrhea&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">thusly</a>-&gt;<a href="http://www.americanbaby.com/ab/story.jhtml?storyid=/templatedata/ab/story/data/11021.xml" class="external text" title="http://www.americanbaby.com/ab/story.jhtml?storyid=/templatedata/ab/story/data/11021.xml" rel="nofollow">here</a> (which btw says "yes and no", in best traditions of wikipedia's NPOV&#160;:-).

<p>After long thinking and reading other's opinions (especially <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_Role_of_truth_e9bd.html#Role_of_the_truth_3_:_.22Sweeping_Responsibility_under_the_Rug.22_or_.22Axiomatic_Introduction_into_Wikitruth.22" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution/Role of truth">"An Axiomatic Introduction into Wikitruth"</a>) by <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">user:Mukadderat</a> I convinced myself (possibly somewhat contrary to the intentions of Mukadderat) that indeed, "Attribution" is the core policy stemming from the intentions of wikipedia: gathering of encyclopedic knowledge. As Mukadderat correctly noted, there are other places to <b>create</b> the knowledge, just like there other places for collecting "non-encyclopedic" knowledge&#160;: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">wiktionary</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitravel.html" title="Wikitravel">wikitravel</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikibooks.html" title="Wikibooks">wikibooks</a>, etc. I believe, this is a deliberate and well-undestood distinction of encyclopedia, "to collect, not to create". And therefore "attibution" i.e., indication of the source of the <i>collected</i> knowledge, is among natural core policies, not to say in best modern academic traditions.</p>
<p>The remaining three: WP:V, WP:RS, WP:NOR are but detalizations (albeit very important) of the core policy: the sources must be verifiable and reliable (not "my dad told me so") and we explicitely exclude wikipedians from the list of sources, even if they are experts: either the expert knows the source (hence should have no prolems to comply with the policies) or them itself is a source of newly created knowledge (which is not encyclopedias are for). `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 18:15, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Therefore my proposed course of action is to proceed according to the <b><a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">wikipedia:Summary style</a> of writing</b>:</p>

<li>Make the WP:A to be the "root" policy, with (at least) three sections which contain detailed summaries of WP:V, WP:RS and WP:NOR, with each of them referring to the corresponding main sub-articles, like, {{main|Wikipedia:Verifiability}}, etc.</li>
<li>The performed "merge" was in fact a good cleanup of the original policies, therefore the second suggestion is to start re-introducing the made changes back into the three.</li>
<li>the FAQ page must be a single one, for the whole bunch, possibly including <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> since these policies must be considered together.</li>
<li>Write a good <i>rationale</i> for the policy, the one based on the purpose and role of wikipedia, not on some catch phases like "verifiability not truth", which sound a revolutionary way, but call for unnecessary conflict with quite a few people who want reliable knowledge, which is produced by the whole combination of wikipedia policies.

<dd>Yeah, my opinion is that RS is not policy, and including a summary of it on a policy page elevates it to one. There are some basic disconnects between the two policies and one guideline.

<dd>I agree with him that some guidelines are not mere advices, but in fact descriptions of wikipedia works.

The "Policy" part must contain at least two fundamental sections (1) list of rock-solid types of reliable sources (2) a policy how to decide whether a particular source is reliable (suggested items: 2.1. The context of "source reliability" must be recognized ("Al Gore is not RS for opinions about <a href="../../../g/r/a/Gravity.html" title="Gravity">gravity</a>, but OK for US politics) 2.2.
