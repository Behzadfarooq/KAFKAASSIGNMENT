<p>The author wrote (or transcribed),</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The US Army typically uses observation helicopters (such as the OH-58 and H-6) in support of attack helicopter. But it is starting to fall out of favor as the gunships are getting as sophisticated or more than the observation helicopters deployed to support them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The US Army went to pure, single aircraft-type units in an attempt to streamline logistics lines and reduce the amount of money each unit had to spend on its parts requirements for maintenance. It has nothing to do with a supposed preference to work that way. Although I will admit there are those uneducated (no matter how educated) within the force who may see it that way. The pure <a href="../../../t/o/%26/TO%26E_70a4.html" title="TO&amp;E">MTO&amp;E</a> (I-series) occurred in the early 90's. All it did was create upheaval in doctrine, and unit operations. In addition, recent documents I've viewed at the Combined Arms Research Library<a href="http://cgsc.leavenworth.army.mil/carl/contentdm/home.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://cgsc.leavenworth.army.mil/carl/contentdm/home.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> seem to point out that the U.S. Army actually <i>drifted away</i> from operating that way due to a focusing on what are <i>now</i> seen as the more traditional Cavalry or Attack missions, since the units no longer consist of a mix of reconnaissance and attack helicopters.</p>
<p>In the current conflict, this has changed, and once again, you see a pairing of the two different machines because one relies on the strengths of the other and vice versa, and the missions dictate the use of those combined strengths.

<p>How has USSOCOM "developed" a new concept of Attack helicopter over the last 20 years? They've simply mirrored earlier U.S. Army, Soviet, British, etc. efforts to provide Attack support to ground troops by arming a utility-type airframe. It works for them because it streamlines their logistics tail (including pilot qualifications).

<p>I flew Cobras in Vietnam for 18 months and I have no knowledge of a "flexible rapid fire 20mm cannon" I was just going to question this but I see it edited out. The only 20mm cannon I remember were wing mounted, although a 20mm turret may have been added later. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan_D._Ric_0933.html" title="User:Dan D. Ric">Dan D.

<dd>Nice work on the updates BTW. It might be worth noting that the interim Cobra, although much modified, remains in production 40 years later. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan_D._Ric_0933.html" title="User:Dan D. Ric">Dan D. Ric</a> 06:48, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dan, reading this article again, I think "The Modern Attack Helicopter" needs to be modified to include that information. Right now, it seems very U.S.-centric and very Apache-centric in its POV, when the fact is that the current conflict has thrown the Apache's apparent reign over all attack airframes into question. It reminds me of that laughable quote from The Military Channel's show <i>Top Ten Helicopters</i> where one commentator claims that, "Everybody wants to fly it, even if they won't admit it." (<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorn2flie_33b4.html" title="User:Born2flie">Born2flie</a> 15:40, 9 October 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>Some would argue that the Apache did exactly what it was designed to do survive under fire. To quote one of the product designers when I was given a tour (my Grandfather was a VP for McDonald Douglas) "For what it can't fly through, the pilot will likely survive the crash landing." Now since it's personal expirence, obviously I can't put such a quote in the article. <a href="../../../p/p/g/User%7EPPGMD_7152.html" title="User:PPGMD">PPGMD</a> 18:19, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some would also argue that point in denial of fatalities from AH-64s being shot down. My point is that this article is about Attack Helicopters in general, not leading to an opinion that one particular helicopter is the preeminent specimen. The reader should be allowed to arrive at their own conclusions. (<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorn2flie_33b4.html" title="User:Born2flie">Born2flie</a> 20:01, 9 October 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<p>If you read the list of attack helicopters, don't you think it is ironic that the US names its attack helicopters American Indian tribe names? The Indians basically got destroyed by the US and then the US names its helicopters Indian tribe names. Is that to honor the Indians or what? <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_friend100_562e.html" title="User:Good friend100">Good friend100</a> 15:08, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh dear, where to start. The US Army actually names almost all its aircraft after Native American tribes, not just attack helicopters. THe UH-72A was recently named <i><a href="../../../u/h/-/UH-72A_Lakota_1e9d.html" title="UH-72A Lakota">Lakota</a></i>, and a Lakota chief attended the ceremony. Hard to attend ceremonies when you're destroyed. In additon, have you thought that maybe the US Army names its aircraft that way partly as an admission that it was wrong to have treated them so badly, even though no one in the US Army was alive at that time?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Btw, do the Turks name aircraft after the Greeks they slaughtered in Asia Minor? DO the Isrealis name aircraft after the Palestinians? THe Birtish after the Celts? The French (Franks) after the Gauls? The Arabs after the original (African) Egyptians, or the Persians (pre-Iran)? I could go on. History is full of despicable invasions and conquerings of tribes and nations by others. Why not stop picking on nations that have admitted wrong-doings, and spend some time going after those that have yet to admit their past wrongs? Oh, maybe the difference is that when you pick on Americans, we either capitulate, ignore you, or laugh at you (like I'm doing now!). These other nations have a tendency to behead their critics. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 23:14, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not anti American by the way, I'm actually pro American and I support America unlike some of my ignorant Korean friends who forget American help during the Korean War. I'm just pointing out that its pretty ironic.

<dd>My apologies if I misunderstood your tone. However, I was somewhat basing my comments on my understanding of the following:
<dl>
<dd><i>Isn't it ironic, how, after the USA destroyed the Indians, then name their own attack helicopters Indian names? Isn't it ironic how a "Native American" helicopter, used by the United States, is used to destroy the enemy when the name of the helicopter itself was destroyed 150 years ago? Good friend100 04:12, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>
<dd><i>It just bothers me sometimes when I read helicopter names. Good friend100 12:27, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I understand that it could bother you, but remember: The people who did that to the Native Americans have been dead for over 100 years. In recognition of those mistakes, the Army now choces to honor native American tribes by naming all their aircraft after them. It may be ironic in a sense, but as I stated above, what other Army honors its former enemies this way? There may be some, but none come to mind. - <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillCJ_b53d.html" title="User:BillCJ">BillCJ</a> 17:08, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonel.html" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> Jay Vanderpool,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> was the chief architect of the U.S. Army Attack Helocopter. He did not invent the concept, but he was one of the poineers. The problem I have is citing the true nature of the resistance to attack helos in the 1950's-60's army. His unit was called "Vanderpool's Fools". Their was a great deal of ridicule given not just to the concept but to Col. Vanderpool. The Time-Life series "epic of flight" goes in dept, but I no longer have the books. Any web sources? The Centennial of Flight just lists a brief diescription.
