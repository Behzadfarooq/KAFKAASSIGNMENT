<p>Hi Atticuslai,</p>
<p>Thank you for explaining the reasons why you have removed the criticism section from the City Harvest Church wiki page. I cannot speak for the first three uncited criticisms as I did not put them up. However, I would like to respond regarding the last two:</p>
<p><br />
"The church has been criticised by Way Of Life Literature, a fundamental Baptist organisation, for its support of Kong Hee's wife, Sun Ho, in her previous dual role as both a Christian pastor and a pop singer.[1] However, she is currently no longer a pastor of the church.</p>
<p>Every Tom, Dick and Harry has some opinion (and criticsm) about anything that can be found in Wiki, but we don't list them all out simply because many of them are just that: Tom, Dick and Harry. Is Way of Life Literature a notable or influential group? If we want to include an opinion from Way of Life group, then the criticism section must be thousand lines long because we should include criticism of the church (or many other churches, or many other subjects) from lots of places."</p>
<p><br />
Response: The general understanding of the morals that a church is supposed to stand for VS the superficial material image of pop star is highlighted here. Whilst you make a good point that the Way of Life group is by no means a well known organisation, it is important the wikipedia provides its readers with as many relevant points of views as possible. For a church to support the pop star status of it's (ex?)pastor contradicts the values that a church is supposed to inculcate. It is also common knowledge that Sun Ho did play these two roles at the same time in the past (as seen in the reference for the below criticism). Therefore the Way of Life group is actually irrelevant to this discussion as all this criticism does is highlight the contradictory action of this church. The Way of Life group is merely there as a group who has expressed this shared point of view.</p>
<p><br />
"While Sun Ho was pursuing her career as a singer, she was heavily criticized for wearing a flaming red Giorgio Armani gown that "showed too much flesh — and in all the wrong places". However, while the media had previously portrayed her as a "singing pastor" without objection, she had not denied it until the incident. It was reported that she told The New Paper: “I'm just the music director of my church, and I'm also a counsellor. I'm not a pastor. I don't preach.”[2]</p>
<p>The article is about City Harvest Church. There is a wiki page on Sun Ho, and I believe this portion of the text should go there instead."</p>
<p><br />
Response: I agree with you that this criticism focuses mainly on the character of Sun Ho. However, as she is a leader of the church (or close to, or used to be), her actions significantly impact or reflect on the church. People identify leaders closely to organisations (eg. Lee Kwan Yew and the PAP), thus I feel that some summarised form of this article should remain on the City Harvest page.</p>
<p><br />
Final Word: City Harvest is a controversial church with flamboyant leaders and evangelical influences. This needs to be pointed out to give the whole picture, especially in wikipedia. I hope you read my comments and understand where I'm coming from.</p>
<p><br />
Regards, Mark</p>

<p>Hi Atticulai,</p>
<p>I appreciate that you have responded to my comments. From what you've written I can see your point of view, and that you make a good point when you say that the City Harvest page is not about Sun Ho. (About that point, I've tried moving it to the Sun Ho page. However, I cab't seem to get the reference list working properly. Would it be possible for you to have a look at it as I am unable to fix this problem with my limited editing skills?)</p>
<p>However I still feel that there is a need to let the readers know that the church supports the popularity of a secular singer, and that the singer is the co-founder and current musical director of the church. The focus would be on the church's actions, letting readers make up their own mind about this support.</p>
<p>Let us say we take the fact that she is an ex-pastor aside. I'm not saying that their actions are wrong. I'm trying to say that it's controversial if a church supports a pop star (imagine if City Harvest was in support of Britney Spears for example).</p>
<p>The morality contradition here is not of my opinion, but of fact. This is taken from the wiki entry on pop music,</p>
<p>"pop music has historically been the source of numerous moral panics, especially as many of the styles that influence it trickle up from minority groups (racial, ethnic, sexual or class-based) about which the dominant class holds negative stereotypes. In addition, many parents view explicit lyrics as gateways to sin, blaming pop music for increases in drug use, teen pregnancy, and violence. As a result, some conservative groups forbid children from attending social gatherings in which pop music may be played. In addition, pop music stars can be controversial role models for teens; older generations tend to over-emphasize the stars' influences on teens' lives and make unfounded generalizations about entire groups of people based on pop stars' behavior."</p>
<p>While I am not saying Sun Ho is individually responsible for any of these actions, pop culture and the pop star icon as a whole are associated with different morals from the biblical source that churches represent. The ten commandments in the bible are one of the moral principles of the church. These paradoxes beg the question, "why does a church associate so closely to a pop star?"</p>
<p>The Way of Life group's statements simply reflect a Christian group's criticism of the biblical supporting the secular. And readers need to know that City Harvest church controversially supports a secular pop star.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening and I await your response. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Choo_2ea8.html" title="User:Mark Choo">Mark Choo</a> 04:36, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I actually wrote the bottom part first, but then I looked at the Way of Life reference more closely and realised that it was criticising more about Sun Ho actions and the Charismatic movement as a whole. I apologise if it has taken much of your time. However, I have found our discussion throughly engaging and your input very useful. I appreciate your patience, responding when most people would say no more.</p>
<p>I will thus move this reference to the [Sun Ho] page. And with regards to the city Harvest page, I will edit it to reflect that this public figure is part of the church leadership.</p>
<p>I have included below my concluding thoughts. I hope you find them as invigorating as I found your's.</p>
<p>Regards, Mark</p>
<hr />
<p>I think you have misunderstood me. I have nothing against pop stars, and I am a Christian as well. I am simply trying to justify this point of view.</p>
<p>I have been trying to explain to you that there has been scientific socioogical studies on the pop culture industry to describe what a pop star is and why people follow them. Even though all those pop stars which you have described have "clean" images, that's just it. It's just superficial images that they present to people THROUGH the media. The media is simply the medium that they use to let you think who they are, as you yourself has just demonstrated. You do not know them as a person, just as an media image.</p>
<p>Regarding quote, "But where in the Bible did God talked about not "associating" with pop star?", and keeping in mind that we're not dealing with idol worship, do you accept that there is a fundamental difference between the secular world and the Christian world? I mean, if that was not the case, why are Christian book shops separate from others? Why is the Christian music industry separate from the mainstream? When a pastor of a church starts singing publicly NOT about God, and wearing clothes showing "too much skin", shouldn't her "christian" status be questioned? And if the church in which she is senior pastor of condones this action, doesn't this action in itself become controversial which should be public knowledge.</p>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but you seem to be saying to me that the secular and Christian world have the same principles and values.</p>
<p>On this point- "Here are the facts: - Not one cent from the church was used to promote Sun Ho's material or her "stardom". - No one was forced to support (buy her CD) or listen to Sun Ho's music. - The members of City Harvest Church supported Sun Ho as a singer, in their own capacity. Just as they would support their favourite movie stars, singers, etc."</p>
<p>What facts do you have to back it up? Have you seen the financial records? Has there been an inquiry into whether members have been forced to consume her music?</p>
<p>This is fact. I have personally been to City Harvest Church once, and during this service the pastor was encouraging the people there to "go out to buy Sun Ho's CDs. The more CD's you buy, the higher she'll be on the chinese music charts, and the more popularity she gets the more she'll be able to spread God's word!" That is what I heard with my own two ears. If that is not support from the church, I don't know what is.</p>
<p>You might say that this incident has created a personal opinion for me on this matter, but that's not relevant. What's important is that I have debated this matter neutrally. I have not mentioned this incident as I am a nobody. I am simply a person who is trying to edit a wiki page so that it presents all relevant points of views.</p>
