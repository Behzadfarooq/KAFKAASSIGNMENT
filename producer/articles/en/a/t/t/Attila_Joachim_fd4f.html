<p><b>Attila Joachim</b> (1923-1947) died at approximately 24 years of age due to accumulated internal bodily injuries suffered from repeated beatings by the Hungarian (Magyar) collaborators of the German nazis during the <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budapest.html" title="Budapest">Budapest</a> <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust.html" title="Holocaust">holocaust</a> circa 1943 and 1944 in <a href="../../../b/u/d/Budapest%2C_Hungary_3b80.html" title="Budapest, Hungary">Budapest, Hungary</a>. He was a student at, and a 1946 graduate of, the "Képzőművészeti Főiskola" (<a href="http://www.mke.hu/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.mke.hu/index.php" rel="nofollow">"The Hungarian Academy of Fine Arts" in Hungarian</a>, <a href="http://www.mke.hu/english/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.mke.hu/english/index.php" rel="nofollow">"The Hungarian Academy of Fine Arts" in English</a>, a university level professional college) in Budapest, Hungary. Attila Joachim's student status from 1941 to 1946 is shown by the student registration records of the Hungarian Academy of Fine Arts, <a href="http://www.mke.hu/about/hallgatoi_adatbazis.php?formdata%5Bxname%5D=joachim" class="external text" title="http://www.mke.hu/about/hallgatoi_adatbazis.php?formdata%5Bxname%5D=joachim" rel="nofollow">Student registration of Attila Joachim at the Hungarian Academy of Fine Arts</a> in Budapest. Immediately after graduating in 1946 he began teaching at the academy. (OPEN QUESTION: Did the students and faculty of the "Képzőművészeti Főiskola" aid and assist the hunted victims to hide and to escape from the hunter Hungarian (Magyar) collaborators of the German nazis during the Budapest holocaust?)</p>
<p>Attila Joachim (1923-1947) was the third of three children of the Hungarian (Magyar) artist painter <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferenc_Joachim_3b86.html" title="Ferenc Joachim">Ferenc Joachim</a> (1882-1964) and his wife born Margit Graf (1892-1965). He was survived by his two older siblings, his sister Piroska Joachim (1913- ) and his brother <a href="../../../f/e/r/Ferenc_Gabriel_Joachim_d32c.html" title="Ferenc Gabriel Joachim">Ferenc Gabriel Joachim</a> (1920-1989). This was a Roman Catholic family. Attila Joachim (1923-1947) would have been certainly aware and conscious that his mother's sisters born <a href="../../../j/u/l/Julia_Graf_1d62.html" title="Julia Graf">Julia Graf</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/z/Rozsa_Graf_4827.html" title="Rozsa Graf">Rozsa Graf</a> and their husbands and children were murdered in cold blood sometime during 1943 or 1944 by the Hungarian (Magyar) collaborators of the German nazis during the Budapest holocaust. Attila Joachim (1923-1947) is being remembered now in August of 2006 by his 93 year old sister Piroska Joachim (1913- ) whose later married name is Mrs. Piroska Porkolab or in the Hungarian (Magyar) language usage Porkolab Tivadar-ne.</p>
