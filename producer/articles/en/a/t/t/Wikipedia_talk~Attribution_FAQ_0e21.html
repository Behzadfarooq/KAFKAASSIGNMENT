<p>Great structure here. My only suggestion would be that this start with a short section titled something like "What kind of sources are regarded as reliable?"

<dl>
<dd>This entire paragraph is original research, because it expresses the editor's opinion that, given the <i>Chicago Manual of Style's</i> definition of plagiarism, Jones did not commit it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I disagree. "Given the <i>Chicago Manual of Style's</i> definition of plagiarism, Jones did not commit it" is a fact, just like "given a definition which says that plagiarism is a cube, plagiarism has six sides" is a fact. It's a direct logical inference.</p>
<p>The paragraph is inappropriate because we have no reason to *care* that the Chicago Manual of Style's rules lead to a certain conclusion; the Chicago Manual of Style isn't an authority on this particular case, and probably not even on plagiarism in general. In other words, it's a reliable sources issue, not an original research issue.</p>
<p>And I'm aware that this example is from <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. It's a bad example there too. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 22:20, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it's an excellent example, because many editors don't get it, yet it's classic OR. You wrote that" 'Given the <i>Chicago Manual of Style's</i> definition of plagiarism, Jones did not commit it' is a fact." But it's a fact that no reliable source has discussed in terms of Jones. That makes it the essence of OR. Anything introduced into an article (fact, argument, whatever) must have been published by a reliable source <b>discussing that topic</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If we allowed Wikipedians to argue that "Given the <i>Chicago Manual of Style's</i> definition of plagiarism, Jones did not commit it," I could just as easily add: "However, according to publication X, the Chicago Manual of Style's definition of plagiarism is inadequate." And we'd be off, swapping each other's OR i.e. personal opinions. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:22, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know why you're saying "If we allowed Wikipedians to argue...". I'm not claiming we should let Wikipedians argue that. I just think the example mischaracterizes *why* we don't let Wikipedians argue that.</dd>
<dd>'Given the <i>Chicago Manual of Style's</i> definition of plagiarism, Jones did not commit it' is a fact. It isn't a fact we should use, because the Chicago Manual of Style isn't a reliable source, but that isn't original research--that's use of unreliable sources. Even if you classify that as original research (which I think is a bad idea, because then you've classified all unreliable sources as original research), it isn't original research *on the grounds of not being a fact*. It's original research because yes, it is a fact, but the fact isn't useful, and is being misapplied in a way which is original research.</dd>
<dd>And if it's a fact, we shouldn't say it isn't. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 14:50, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>I may also add that the example refers to a real case, and describes it in a misleading way. See <a href="../../../a/l/a/Talk%7EAlan_Dershowitz_3e27.html#The_debate_with_Norman_Finkelstein" title="Talk:Alan Dershowitz">Talk:Alan Dershowitz#The debate with Norman Finkelstein</a>. The difference between the real case and this is that in the real case, the statement that Jones (Dershowitz) didn't commit plagiarism according to the Chicago Manual of Style isn't an original invention of the Wikipedia editor at all. It's sourced to "James O. Freedman, the former president of Dartmouth College, the University of Iowa, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences." We cannot ourselves use the Chicago Manual of Style to analyze whether Dershowitz is a plagiarist, but if we have a reliable source who does that analysis, we can legitimately quote him. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 01:53, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the plagiarism example is horribly confusing, and should be replaced. Synthesis is described as combining two statements, A and B, to reach a new conclusion C. As well as being a confusing and complicated case, the example never explains what sources A and B say, or even what sources A and B are (although source B is presumably the CMS). Without this information, the reader is left guessing at what the example is getting at, and I find it unsurprising that so many readers have come to different conclusions about what it is trying to say. In my view it should be replaced by a clear and straightforward example of synthesis. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEnchanter_c99f.html" title="User:Enchanter">Enchanter</a> 14:54, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, it is synthesis. A is "the Chicago Manual of Style defines plagiarism as doing _____". B is "Dershowitz did not do _____". C is "according to the Chicago Manual of Style, Dershowitz isn't a plagiarist".</dd>
<dd>The problem with calling this original research is that this synthesis is a straightforward logical deduction, and those are exempt from being original research. Consider my example above; the Chicago Manual of Style claims that plagiarism is a cube, so we deduce that according to it, plagiarism has six sides.</dd>
<dd>Neither of those is original research. Rather, they are unreliable sources--the Chicago Manual of Style isn't an authority on the Dershowitz case, and can't be quoted on it. Rejecting them for being original research rejects them for the wrong reason, and sets a bad precedent for using straightforward deductions. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 17:04, 28 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not familiar with the original case it is based on, but the "B, Jones did not do ____" is not actually there in the example. So if this was the intended interpretation it's not properly expressed in the example. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEnchanter_c99f.html" title="User:Enchanter">Enchanter</a> 21:43, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Structuring as an FAQ, though, means that you don't need to read it all for it to be helpful: most people will read the parts that are relevant to sources they are interested in, and ignore the rest, I suspect. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 07:47, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I very much agree that this will need a hawk's eye kept on it to prevent contradiction of the policy statement. This is the likeliest place for interest groups to try stitching in loopholes that suit themselves. On the other hand, the policy must take priority; the FAQ should not be considered canonical, only the policy. This shouldn't even claim to be a guideline, or we'll have to post armed guards on it 24/7.</dd>

<p>Do we need a separate section for each web site that anyone can contribute to? Or could we just lump MySpace, YouTube, Wikis, and so on in a single section. And maybe even combine them with blogs. That seems better to me, as the same problems apply to all:</p>

<p>This section in the proposal currently doesn't seem to answer the question enclosed in the section title. In the single paragraph of that section there are currently some circumstantial explanations that reliable sources can conflict (maybe amounting to something like "don't panic" as part of an answer to the initial question). But no real answer to <i>What do I do...</i></p>
<p>May I suggest to add something in this vein as a second paragraph to that section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When each of the differing versions are notable in their own right, are based on reliable published sources, and there is enough <i>difference</i> between the competing versions to be noteworthy, then proceed with what is described in <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>: "(...) all significant published points of view are to be presented (...)", each with their own reference. An example that also the <i>difference</i> between the sources needs to be non-trivial: for instance, if competing official sources give a few percent difference in population numbers for an average city, that is maybe not a "notable" difference - just round the number and put "approx." before it, referring to the available reliable sources.</p>

<p>The FAQ refers to <i>A New York Times account of a George Bush speech is a secondary source</i>. This is creating the false impression that <i>all</i> newspaper articles are secondary sources, when actually, a large amount of newspapers accounts are primary sources. Wording needs to be found to make that distinction clearer. The reason I am rasing this, is that some editors are claiming that an article that appears in a small town newspaper (e.g. 'The Post Crescent" From Menosha, Wisconsin) is "a reliable secondary source", because of this FAQ, and claims that that small-town newspaper is more reliable than a book on the subject by a respected author. So, please, let's clarify these issues in the FAQ. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 06:25, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is interesting. My take on it is that articles using entirely primary sources may "tend to" violate NOR, but not so much <i>because</i> they use entirely primary sources. An article using entirely primary sources may violate NOR if primary sources are being used to make unsupported analytical claims, but secondary sources being used to make unsupported analytical claims are equally unacceptable. If the issue is lack of analytical context at all, that's an NPOV issue, unrelated to type or quality of sources. Meanwhile, NOR presently states that "Although most articles should rely predominantly on secondary sources, there are rare occasions when they may rely entirely on primary sources (for example, current events or Braunfeld v. Brown)". That's missing in this version -- I'm not certain why. -- <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Bailey_63ba.html" title="User:Lee Bailey">Bailey</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELee_Bailey_a8f7.html" title="User talk:Lee Bailey"><font color="black">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:01, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(undent) Is a court ruling a primary source (on the ruling) or a secondary source (on the meaning of the law)? One can argue each way: appellate judges are professional scholars interpreting material, but the cases then are further subjected to analysis, especially for a case of first impression.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly agree with the objective of the primary/secondary distinction. I think it a mistake to try to force a term from historical studies to neatly fit other areas. And, even among professional historians, the term does not have the same quasi-juridical import that it has on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 00:10, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

Could you also please explain what it is you don't like about the way I worded it, so that I can try to find another wording that might work better for you?</dd>

<p>Look at the first sentence of the answer to "How do I format citations?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At a minimum, any substantial, surprising, or controversial claim in an article should be accompanied by an <b>inline citation</b> . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am uncomfortable with the "at minimum" formulation, especially since all articles should contain at least one substantial claim. Footnotes exist to aid the reader in locating the relevant fact, either to verification or for further research. In longer articles with many sources, this is good, but there are many articles for which footnotes would serve no purpose and would even create a distraction.</p>
<p>One can write a perfectly reasonable short biographical article for some members of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_peerage.html" title="British peerage">british peerage</a> using three sources: the <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictionary_of_National_Biography_5c24.html" title="Dictionary of National Biography">Dictionary of National Biography</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burke%27s_Peerage_048e.html" title="Burke's Peerage">Burke's Peerage</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Complete_Peerage_6f30.html" title="The Complete Peerage">The Complete Peerage</a>. In most cases, the entries are a page or two at most, indexed by name, and the sources simply provide a cross-check on one another. One editor even argued that <i>s.n.</i> (Latin, <i>sub nomine</i>, [look] under the name) should suffice in place of a page number. Since most of the information can be found in any of the three sources, I see no purpose in associating a particular datum with a particular source.</p>
<p>In a lot of mathematical articles, the oft-mentioned reason for lack of citation is an embarrassment of riches: look it up in any textbook. My proposal to solve that is a "Further reading" section, such as the Britannica used to have, which would serve both as reference and to direct interested readers. The same advantage does not apply to inline citations: the whole argument appears in any of the sources, possibly in a slightly different form. Furthermore, for GFDL reasons, the examples and diagrams are often original, so not footnotable, which would require reduplicating footnotes before and after the unsourced text. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 19:48, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess the important thing is that no statement should be immune from a request for attribution. So many articles, especially advanced topics in mathematics, can very well be written with simply one textbook reference. This is no problem and there are very few edit wars on advanced math topics&#160;:) However, if one editor doubts the correctness of a proof or requests attribution, it should be granted. Even "self-evident" mathematical reasoning should not be immune to requests for inline citation, but only when someone really doubts the correctness, not because it is fashionable to have inline citations. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 16:32, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>However, you get people who go through random articles and say "cite or I delete" simply because they enjoy forcing people to jump through hoops, not because they sincerely doubt the correctness of something. It's essentially vandalism, and is popular because making the demand takes a few seconds while saving one's article takes much more time.</dd>
<dd>It's also popular among POV-pushers, who selectively demand citations for material they know very well is true but which is embarassing to their side.</dd>
<dd>Wikipedia's policies are needlessly encouraging such people. We really don't *want* anyone to be able to demand attribution under any circumstances. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 21:29, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Our policy on using self-published sources allows us to use them only in the case that the author is known and recognised as an authority (for one reason or another). In general, on a wiki, there is no single author. I suppose in the unusual case that a wiki page had only ever been edited by people who could be identified as authorities, a version of that page might be a reliable source. This strikes me as a highly unlikely situation, however, where <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> would be the best solution. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 21:45, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A Wikipedia article can be thought of in these two ways: as a collection of individual self-published contributions, or as a whole collaborative article. A novel printed as a paper book can similarly be seen in those two ways: as mostly self-published by the author but with some corrections of spelling errors etc. self-published by unidentified proofreaders and the choice of title self-published by the editor.</dd>
<dd>I would like to remove the statement that wikis are not reliable. It's OK to have a statement that Wikipedia is not to be used as a source for Wikipedia articles, but stating that Wikipedia is not reliable just contributes to Wikipedia's poor reputation for reliability. There's no need for that. Some Wikipedia articles have a good level of reliability. I suggest that the atomic numbers of the elements in Wikipedia is probably at a fairly high level of reliability. Some Wikipedia articles are written by professionals in their field and are closely watched. The collaborative development on Wikipedia is essentially similar to (or the same as) peer review and editing that occurs in some other media. Some Wikipedia articles have gone through Wikipedia peer review, which, while it is not the same thing as peer review in a scientific journal, can actually be more thorough in some ways. Each source needs to be judged on its merits, not just thrown out because it happens to be in wiki form. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 00:21, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't agree with Jossi's rewording: "An exception to this would be those MySpace pages about which there are secondary published sources that attest to the identity of the person featured in that MySpace page." First, the edit summary claims it is to make the FAQ compliant with the Attribution policy, but I can't find where the policy says that. Second, the statement confuses reliable with secondary. We are not talking about interpretation or analysis, just a simple fact: is the purported author or publisher of a MySpace page really the author or publisher? Reliable primary sources are just as acceptable for establishing straightforward facts as secondary sources, and we should never use the phrase "secondary source" as if it were a synonym for "reliable source". --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 17:01, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>For nearly six months, the WP:NOTTRUTH section has read:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Doesn't Wikipedia care about truth?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is a common misunderstanding. Wikipedians care greatly about producing a high-quality encyclopedia. By demanding reliable sources, Wikipedia depends on the published research and opinions of experts. For many subjects, this will be the truth, pure and simple. For others, it will be as close as we will ever get to the truth. For still others, it is merely the best information currently available. For controversial subjects and matters of faith or opinion, the truth Wikipedia strives for is to accurately describe all sides of the debate, including their strengths and weaknesses. Of course, experts are sometimes wrong, and theories are frequently incomplete. Because Wikipedia is continuously updated, it can improve as human knowledge improves, depending on reliable sources.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This has now been changed to a phrasing that I think is less helpful.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedians want to produce a high-quality encyclopedia. By insisting on the use of reliable sources, Wikipedia depends on the published research and opinions of informed commentators. Editors ensure that all majority and significant-minority opinion is included in articles — in rough proportion to the representation of those views in reliable published sources — but without otherwise indicating which of the views, if any, may be true.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We simply present reliably attributed statements, views, and arguments, then allow our readers to judge for themselves. That is, the threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material can be reliably attributed, not whether any individual editor holds it to be true.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It seems to me that the revised version is oriented more towards a person who already understands NOR and NPOV and less towards the audience of this FAQ. It misses two points that I think are essential, and somewhat conflates WP:ATT with NPOV. First, it omits that the policy acually improves the truth-value of the encyclopedia. If we discuss who believes Foo and who believes Bar, and do so accurately, we <b>are</b> speaking truth. Second, it omits the relation between continual improvement and this policy: as experts change their opinions, Wikipedia expects to keep up.</p>
<p>The discussion about significant minority opinions and letting readers decide for themselves belongs in an NPOV FAQ. We properly exclude a significant amount of attributable material from qualified researchers because the view is obsolete, or is too new to have gained significant support, or has been rejected by the vast majority of researchers. The material passes WP:ATT, but fails other policies. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 16:21, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Robert, I take your point, thank you. The reason I changed it is, first, that the passage had a didactic, almost patronizing, tone to it that I feel is best avoided. Secondly, it was wordy, and I tried to tighten the writing throughout the FAQ. Third, and most importantly, it implies that we <b>do</b> care about truth. But we really don't! We have to put the "truth" out of our minds when we're writing and stick to what authoritative sources in that field are saying, even if it's nonsense. Examples of problem sentences:</dd>

<dd>I agree with Robert, and consequently I'm restoring much of the earlier version. WP is not Truth-atheistic, at most we're truth-agnostic. Where there's no reasonable debate in the sources, there's also no problem in proclaiming that the consensus is true and accurate, or at least as accurate as we can make it.
<ul>
<li>"For many subjects, [what we publish] ... will be the truth, pure and simple."</li>

<ul>
<li>Will it? How do we know?</li>

</dd>
<dd>If there is no serious discord in the sources, we can pretty well take it as written. The speed of light in a vacuum is in fact 1,079,252,848.8 km/h, George Washington died on 14 December 1799, and, from the Main Page today, a fluidized bed reactor (pictured) can be used in the creation of fuel, rubber, vinyl chloride, polyethylene, and styrenes. All those facts have to be sourced, but they are indeed facts. I would include in this category facts that have been more accurately ascertained since earlier sources were published. Sources that were reliable in 1980 may not be reliable now, at least as to some subjects. Editors have to make a judgment call on what to cull, and that judgment should be informed by how likely the source is to be accurate. Old theories will sometimes be worth noting at some point in the article, in language such as "Pluto was formerly considered to be a planet," but the point remains that there are data that we can be fairly convinced are true.

</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Unless of course there <i>aren't</i> any sides in the debate. Controversial subjects, by definition, are the subjects in which it is likely that there will be a dispute among and between reliable sources. Your stylistic argument is correct, and I've fixed that in my edit.

<p>There are cases where the reliable source provides false information and the source that provides the correct information doesn't meet Wikipedia standards. In this case, the policy demands that Wikipedia include false information.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia_talk%7ENo_original_research_archive13_6651.html" title="Wikipedia talk:No original research/archive13">covered bridge</a> example is well known; the sources claim the bridge is closed; the guy who visited it saw that it's not. There's also a recent example where a vandal added a spurious entry saying someone is Iranian, and this is now being reported in reliable sources as a true fact--most likely someone just copied the vandalized information from Wikipedia, but we have no way to prove it. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 22:00, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>WE are entitled, indeed, requited, to judge our sources; that is one reason "reliable source" has not been defined, because it would mean putting down in words the criteria of that judgment. We should probably avoid doing this as much as possible, but we cannot escape it.
<ul>
<li>For the covered bridge; the effort is laudable; but the user's photos are original research, and unless he posts them, how do we know they exist? (Taking thje claim out of the article would be a reasonable comporomise.</li>
<li>Circular sourcing, in which "reliable sources" say something becuase WP does, is a growing problem, and we should have a guideline on it. If it can be shown that the sources that say "Iranian" are all after that version of the article, and none of them claim primary sourcing, it may be due weight to mention that concern, or simply decide the other sources are more reliable. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 22:59, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For the covered bridge, the point is that the reliable sources/verifiability policy require adding (or at least leaving in) false information. If you try to deny that verifiability and truth are ever at odds with each other, you're not accurately describing Wikipedia. In some cases, "verifiability, not truth" really *means* "not truth".</dd>
<dd>In the Iranian vandalism case (I found it: <a href="../../../s/a/c/Talk%7ESacha_Baron_Cohen_5472.html#include_Persian_descent" title="Talk:Sacha Baron Cohen">Talk:Sacha_Baron_Cohen#include Persian descent</a>, the key is that none of the sources *say* they cribbed from Wikipedia. The idea that they did is purely conjecture. Going from what we actually know about the sources, they are verifiable, reliable, sources. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 03:50, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Re the covered bridge example: If the editor who saw the bridge first-hand convinces the other editors that the bridge is not covered, then they should delete from the article the statement about the bridge being covered. If there is disagreement, then there is a content dispute, and they need to discuss and resolve it; one possible result would be to replace "The bridge is covered." with "Source X states that the bridge is covered." There is nothing wrong with an editor expressing on a talk page opinions, personal knowledge or original research in an effort to convince other editors; they could email photos of the bridge to other editors, for example, to support their argument about deleting the statement, even if the photos would not be acceptable on a Wikipedia article page for one reason or another. In any case, no one should knowingly advocate leaving a false statement in Wikipedia. "Source X states that the bridge is covered" is generally not false even if "The bridge is covered" is false. --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 19:10, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Re requiring false information: I disagree. Wikipedia policy does not (or should not) ever require adding or leaving in false information. Also, the "not truth" wording needs to be changed to make this clear. If whether the bridge is covered or not is a relatively minor detail, editors can simply leave out this (false) detail along with many other details which are left out because they are unimportant, irrelevant to the article, etc. If whether it is covered or not is presented in the "Reliable Sources" as an important topic, (e.g. extensively discussed), then perhaps due weight requires that it be mentioned, but nothing in Wikipedia policy prevents the editors from transforming it into a true statement by inserting "Source X states that ...". --<a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECoppertwig_185e.html" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> 19:19, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I also removed (just now) a rhetorical flourish. ("Not attempting to proclaim the truth gives us the best prospect of accuracy.") I think it's stylistically superfluous, and logically incorrect. (If anything, including divergent views makes us less accurate, although it makes it more probable that the truth will be included in the various positions included in the article.) Following my own logic, I also rewrote the flourish at the end of the subsection. <a href="../../../d/c/b/User%7EDCB4W_e3cc.html" title="User:DCB4W">DCB4W</a> 23:58, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>See the rest of the third paragraph, for which it was written. We are more likely to attain accuracy, in the long run, by following the debate of experts, than by trying, with our limited judgment, to declare which one is right. In the short run, we can be accurate in saying that "both X and Y are now supported by scholarship"; saying simply "X" or simply "Y" is guesswork. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 00:12, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You're missing my point about the wording. Comprehensiveness is the enemy of accuracy. If we have eleven incorrect theories and one correct one, the article is horribly inaccurate (eleven errors!) but it does have the answer contained therein. Our policy is the way it is not because it leads to accuracy, but because we are not always in a position to discern truth from falsehood. I think we're disagreeing over wording rather than policy. <a href="../../../d/c/b/User%7EDCB4W_e3cc.html" title="User:DCB4W">DCB4W</a> 00:23, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, that's an argument that comprehensiveness is the enemy of <i>precision</i>, which I suppose it is. You should also consult Robert West's post above the section break: saying "these are the twelve theories" can be done with perfect accuracy. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 00:27, 22 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not necessarily. For one thing, the words "precise" and "accurate" are usually used interchangeably. To the extent that they're used distinctly, "accurate" means "free of error" whereas "precise" means "exact." Look at <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accuracy_and_precision.html" title="Accuracy and precision">Accuracy and precision</a> for the gunshot metaphor. The comprehensive approach is the shotgun: it's neither precise nor accurate but the target is extremely likely to be covered. The Wikipedia approach is the shotgun; aiming may imply POV or other editor bias. The <i>statement</i> "these are the twelve theories" may be accurate, but an <i>article</i> that includes 12 theories, 11 of which must logically be incorrect, is inherently inaccurate. It's an inaccuracy we accept as the price of doing business, because we're willing to sacrifice accuracy for comprehensiveness. Again, it's not clear to me that we're arguing over anything more than semantics at this point. <a href="../../../d/c/b/User%7EDCB4W_e3cc.html" title="User:DCB4W">DCB4W</a> 00:47, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Even as self-published sources, Wikis should only be used when they are not subject to arbitrary editing; for instance, the current version of a Wikipedia article may be edited at any time, so a better source would be a version from a specific date, which does not change. +</dd>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Attribution/FAQ#.22Are_Wikis_reliable_sources.3F.22" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Attribution/FAQ#.22Are_Wikis_reliable_sources.3F.22" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>I did discuss it, or tried to. I also pointed out places where people wanted to use Wikipedia as a self-published source under circumstances where our current policy allows self-published sources. The objections to Wikis as sources are that</p>
<ul>
<li>They are self-published</li>
<li>They may change, and you can't tell which user wrote something or even be sure that it'll still be around</li>
<li>The real-life identity of a user may be uncertain</li>
</ul>
<p>The second objection just *isn't true*, since Wikipedia allows you to link to a specific dated version, or even to a specific diff, which is less likely to change than most other web-based sources. The first and third objections are easily taken care of: use them only when self-published sources are allowed and only when there's no reasonable doubt about who the author is. It's true that the latter is a judgment call, but <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> *itself* says that self-published sources are allowed under certain circumstances "so long as there is no reasonable doubt who wrote the material".</p>
<p>It may not have been worded that exact way before, but the paragraph in fact is consistent with policy, and the flat-out statement that they are never, ever, allowed, is not. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 14:33, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're basing this on <a href="../../../p/a/u/Talk%7EPaul_McKenna_0299.html#Legal_section_struck" title="Talk:Paul McKenna">Talk:Paul McKenna#Legal section struck</a> then no way would I allow Wikipedia diffs as source there. Wikipedia attempts to avoid self reference, for starters, and that's before the legal implications. Let the lawyers do what they are paid to do. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 14:56, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, I'm basing it on policy, I only thought of the McKenna issue afterwards.</dd>
<dd>Other examples include:</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../j/i/m/Talk%7EJimmy_Wales_e8bc.html#Question_RS" title="Talk:Jimmy Wales">Talk:Jimmy Wales#Question RS</a></dd>
<dd><a href="../../../e/r/i/Talk%7EEric_S._Raymond_Archive_2_9d98.html#Response_by_the_target_of_the_article" title="Talk:Eric S. Raymond/Archive 2">Talk:Eric S. Raymond/Archive 2#Response by the target of the article</a>, specifically the point where Eric says that the person who accused him of making pro-war entries to the Jargon File apologized for it.</dd>
<dd>And remember what self-reference is. Self-reference, according to <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a>, is implying that the article is a Wikipedia article. Using Wikipedia *as a source* doesn't violate self-reference.</dd>
<dd>I'd also claim the McKenna reference should be allowed, since we have an article about a person, quoting a self-published source to show what the person has said. This fits Wikipedia's rules governing use of self-published sources. (Yeah, I commented on that page while forgetting this; I goofed.) <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 18:52, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then I see no point in taking this further, since I believe it is counter-productive to do something people have been asked not to do by the foundation's legal counsel. I would suggest that these examples violate <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. I would suggest they are counter-productive, and that they are harmful to the project. I would make the point that in the McKenna instance you haven't met the third point, you haven't found McKenna self-publishing anything. the same at the Eric Raymond page, you have no qualative evidence that is the subject. Posts to Wikipedia talk pages are posts to message boards, and we don't use those as sources. What you have is original research, wiki-lawyering and counter-productive editing. If someone wants to use one of Brad Patrick's statements from the edit history on why we can't edit a page, what do you believe will be the result of that? Brad patrick will simply lock articles, leaving no comment and lots of people will become upset. We have a saying in my house, "don't upset the apple cart". Jimmy Wales' article is the only example that works, because you have a reliable source backing up the point. But like I say, I'm done here. I can't see such diametrically opposed points of view reaching consensus. I support the policies as they stand. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 14:12, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A post to a Wiki *is* a self-published source, by definition. I don't understand why you think it isn't.</dd>
<dd>The reason we don't use posts to message boards as sources is that, as stated in the FAQ, we don't know who actually wrote them. If, in fact, there is no reasonable doubt they were written by the subject (as stated in the rules about using self-published sources), then they no longer fall under the prohibitions on using posts to message boards.</dd>
<dd>And if we use a self-published source in an article about the author, and the author comes by and starts locking articles, and it isn't an office action or some other situation where the author's following Wikipedia rules by locking the article, then that author is abusing Wikipedia. We should not have rules which say "don't do this because someone might abuse Wikipedia to get back at you". <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 14:27, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ken's second objection to wikis as a source, "They may change, and you can't tell which user wrote something or even be sure that it'll still be around" is more nearly true than his comments suggest. If I happen to stumble upon the edit that introduces a passage into an article, then it's not true. But usually, I read the passage of interest, see that the article has a long edit history, and I have considerable difficulty in discovering which edit introduced the passage. There is no function, that I know of, to automatically determinte which edit introduced a certain passage. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 19:31, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>While that is true, the proper conclusion is not "and therefore a Wiki can never be a source". Rather, the proper conclusion is "and therefore, a Wiki can never be a source, unless you manage to find the particular edit that introduced the passage". It may, in fact, be hard to find the proper edit; but if someone manages to do it anyway, then they've overcome this particular objection.</dd>
<dd>And anyway, it's usually easy to find edits. Do a binary search; if an article has 200 edits, see if the edit is in version 100. If not, look in version 150; if so, look in version 50, etc. It doesn't take that long. It's even easier in most cases where you really want to use a Wiki as a source because you already know the name of the person; that person may have not made many edits to the whole article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKen_Arromdee_3302.html" title="User talk:Ken Arromdee">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ken_Arromdee_0020.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ken Arromdee">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>Maybe it is helpful for other people. I personally find it confusing since it seems to imply that not all self-published sources should be handled the same way. A different explanation is given for each kind of self-published source. Perhaps you could combine it into one big section that says something like, "Are message boards, mailing lists, USENET postings, blogs, wikis, IRC, Myspace, and YouTube reliable sources?" or, "What kinds of sources are usually self-published, and what should I do about it?"</dd>
<dd>It is also confusing to me in the sense that it focuses more on the source being a blog, message board, wiki or whatever, rather than focusing on the complete lack of editorial oversight. For example, if I found a InterUniversityWiki that was a joint project for inter-university collaboration, and only trusted representative professors were able to get accounts, would you still consider that self-published?</dd>

<dd>As I understand it, the problems of self-published sources are basically all the same. You mostly get random Joe Bobs whose <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUNDUE_5fa0.html" title="WP:UNDUE">opinions don't count for anything on Wikipedia</a>. The random Joe Bobs do not represent expert or majority or even large minority opinions. In the rare case you get a Subject Expert rather than a Joe Bob, there is rarely any guarantee that the Subject Expert is indeed the Subject Expert and not a fake. No one has reviewed Joe Bob's in any way, with rare exception. In addition, even if you could say, "This page is reliable at this point in time," many self-published sources, like wikis and personal websites, can change suddenly at any time. Standard exceptions apply to all, but are rare.

<p>From time to time an editor declares that we must include the views of a some author who has not received favorable reviews, with the explanation that if the Genius received his due, we would include his views in full.

<p>I want to echo some embedded comments above. It's, well, basically kind of silly to declare that blogs are unreliable. It's like saying "sources printed on A4 paper are unreliable". A web log is simply a medium, and the content conveyed by that medium has to be evaluated on its own merits. Jakob Nielsen's blog is a damned-well reliable source, as he is arguably the most emminent writer in the field of computer-human interface usability (and absolutely in the top five even if you have another favorite.) Notably (no pun intended) he cites sources (often to usability studies performed by his own company, but I don't see anyone, anywhere challenging them, and their methods are sound within the bounds of social science). The blog of Jimmy Smith, high school sophomore in Norman, Oklahoma, is not likely to be reliable for much of anything other than what girls Jimmy thinks are cute. But the same would almost certainly be true of a book somehow published by him, or a Jimmy's World TV show hosted by him. <i>It's not the medium, it's the reliability of the message.</i> The problem with blogs (and wikis) generally is not really a problem with blogs, etc., it's a problem with lack of editorial control, and that problem is something that some blogs, etc., actually escape. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 00:32, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_FAQ_0e21.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Synthesis&quot; does not mean what some editors seem to think it means">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Synthesis" does not mean what some editors seem to think it means</span></h2>
<p>Okay, I am amazed, nay stupified at how people cannot seem to grasp this concept. Thusly, I am going to go over it again. <b>Slowly</b>.</p>
<p>This is the <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/synthesis" class="extiw" title="wikt:synthesis">dicdef of synthesis</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>the formation of something complex or coherent by combining simpler things</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the word "synthesis" is interchangable with "collection" or "combination". <b>This is not debatable. That's the definition as far as Wikipedia is concerned.</b></p>
<p>Now let's look at the FAQ text everyone seems so intent on keeping:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>Original writing is desirable; it is original ideas or new synthesis of ideas and viewpoints that violate policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That might initially seem acceptable, but let's replace "synthesis" with the above words which mean <b>the exact same thing</b>.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>Original writing is desirable; it is original ideas or new combinations of ideas and viewpoints that violate policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>Original writing is desirable; it is original ideas or new collections of ideas and viewpoints that violate policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither of those are in line with the Wikipedia policy on OR, because they effectively prohibit any article from drawing on multiple "ideas". Don't believe me? Here's an example, taken from <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder.html#Causes" title="Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder">a real article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Research suggests that ADHD arises from a combination of various genes, many of which affect <a href="../../../d/o/p/Dopamine.html" title="Dopamine">dopamine</a> transporters.<sup id="_ref-dopamine_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-dopamine" title="">[1]</a></sup> Suspect genes include the 10-repeat allele of the DAT1 gene,<sup id="_ref-gene_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gene" title="">[2]</a></sup> the 7-repeat allele of the DRD4 gene,<sup id="_ref-gene_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-gene" title="">[2]</a></sup> and the dopamine beta hydroxylase gene (DBH TaqI).<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems fine and dandy, right? But wait, look at that second sentence. It clearly uses not one, not two, but <i>three</i> different "ideas", or a <i>collection/combination</i> of ideas, if you will. And since I can't find any other source which used that <i>exact</i> collection/combination of ideas, that makes it a "new" collection/combination of ideas. This means it's original research, and must be removed from the article immediately.</p>
<p>Obviously, the above reasoning is inconsistent with the actual policy, but if someone were to edit an article based on this FAQ that would be the conclusion they would have to come to. Hence, the word "synthesis" should not appear in that sentence.</p>
<p>Now as to Jossi's assertion that "there's a new definition of synthesis according to policy": No. You are wrong. Try again. The word already has a well established definition in the english language. If I decided to re-define the word "<a href="../../../p/e/d/Pederast.html" title="Pederast">pederast</a>" to mean "experienced Wikipedia editor" and then wrote a policy FAQ using that "new definition", exactly how many seconds would it be before the FAQ was deleted and I was banned? (And yes, this is an extreme example, but I'm trying to prove a point here) The word already has a definition that almost all english speakers understand, and trying to re-define it will only confuse people.</p>
<p>I am amazed that this is such a big issue. This is a mind-bogglingly simple concept to grasp: <b>the word you are intent on using has a definition that makes the sentence inconsistent with policy.</b> I realize it's a nice-sounding word (most latin-derived words are) but no amount of shoehorning here will fit it into the FAQ properly. Someone made a bad word choice a while ago and nobody caught it until now. It's a single word; find another one to use. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 10:22, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You cannot be serious. But in case you are: <b>the word "synthesis" means "collection".</b> That's it. That's <b>all</b> it means. What policy sets out to prohibit is a collection of ideas <b>that implies or leads to a separate, new idea.</b> The term "synthesis" doesn't cover that; it covers <b>any</b> collection, meaning anything made up of multiple elements. <b>This includes things like the above sentences from the ADHD article, which are obviously not OR.</b> The word "synthesis" is not the right word to express that particular concept of the OR policy, unless it is <b>specifically</b> mentioned that said synthesis must lead to a new idea or conclusion. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 21:44, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not following either. And BTW, my comment was not that "synthesis" has been defined in policy as a term. That is a straw-man argument. What I said is that synthesis has been used in this context in WP policy, and it is a long-standing formulation as it applies to no original research. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 14:36, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Then let me rephrase my example: if I wrote a policy where I used "pederast" in the context of "experienced Wikipedia editor", and nobody removed it for, say, a year, would it be okay to leave it in (and also insist that the same use appear in all other policy documents) because it was "a long-standing formulation"? No, it would not. The word clearly has a well-established meaning that is different than what we want to talk about.

<p>Your example on ADHD, upon which you base your case, is not original research as it is simply providing information that is well sourced and attributed without attempting to draw a conclusion or assert a synthesis of these viewpoints. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 14:40, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>YES! EXACTLY! <b>THAT WAS THE POINT!!!</b> That sentence is <b>not</b> original research, but the langauge in the FAQ says it is while the current "synthesis" wording remains. And again, you used that word "synthesis"; from the context of your sentence, it seems like you think it means something like "a new creation based on assumptions from multiple, lesser elements." Am I right? That's the problem; <b>that isn't what "synthesis" means.</b> The word "synthesis" is interchangable with the word "collection". I don't know how I can make this any clearer. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 21:31, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think synthesis can cover a range of writing: simple collection of facts from various sources at one extreme, to combining earlier ideas to form a new idea at the other extreme. I think editors could write <b>some</b> passages that could be called synthesis and yet be acceptable in Wikipedia articles. So I tend to agree with Yukichigai, although his use of <i>synthesis</i> does not seem to include the generation of new ideas. --<a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerry_Ashton_8a7d.html" title="User:Gerry Ashton">Gerry Ashton</a> 15:00, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

The word "synthesis" is clearly being misused here, and even if someone can dig up an alternative dicdef somewhere that supports the way the term is being used here, that won't solve the problem, as ambiguity about the meaning will remain, and the policy will be open to too much interpretation. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 15:55, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have raised this before, but this is a good time to raise it again... I often come across articles that imply a synthesis but don't actually state it. ie, where the various <i>parts</i> of the synthesis are laid out in such a way as to strongly lead the reader to a given conclusion, but where the conclusion itself is not actually stated. In our model it would be saying: A + B (= C). When I have raised the issue at RfCs, I am often told it is fine, as long as the article just states the facts without actually reaching a conclusion. The reader can reach their own conclusions. The problem is that given the facts stated (often cherry picked) and the way they are laid out, the reader is led directly to the unstated conclusion the writer wants them to reach.

<p>I've removed the example of synthesis from <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a> on the grounds of it being ambiguous and hard to follow. I propose that a more straightforward example is given on this page to illustrate what Wikipedia means by an unpublished synthesis of ideas. One possible example could be:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Example:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"In 1950, average rainfall in Northland was 10 centimeters per year<sub>Reliable source 1</sub>, whereas in 2005 the average rainfall was 9 centimeters per year<sub>Reliable source 2</sub>. Therefore the climate in Northland is changing, and getting dryer over time<sub>No source</sub>."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Under the attribution policy, the conclusion that the climate in Northland is getting dryer is not permitted, where it is not backed up by an appropriate source. This is because coming to a conclusion like this requires careful consideration of the source data, which Wikipedia is not in a position to verify. A climate researcher would consider how the measurements were made, and analyse the available data and relevant theories, before coming to a conclusion. Wikipedia is not in a position to verify this background research itself. Instead, a conclusion from combining other ideas must be attributed to a reliable published source, unless it is straightforward and uncontroversial.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Lots of alternative examples of what Wikipedia means by unpublished synthesis would also be possible. Any comments on whether the example is appropriate, how it could be improved, or alternative suggestions? <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEnchanter_c99f.html" title="User:Enchanter">Enchanter</a> 22:09, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I like the explanation but not <i>sure</i> I like the example all that much. It is very succinct and gets to the point, but it might mislead some into thinking they can't draw more obvious conclusions, e.g. "In 1950, Northland had 10 centimeters of rainfall,<sup>[reliable source 1]</sup> but was considerably drier in 2005,<sup>[no source per se]</sup> with only 2 cm.<sup>[reliable source2]</sup>" Or am I being paranoid? — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 22:30, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

One way of addressing the first point might be to add your comment into the example, by including something like "On the other hand, a straightforward observation which draws no novel conclusions, such as 'In 1950, Northland had 10 centimeters of rainfall<sup>reliable source 1</sup>, but was considerably drier in 2005<sup>no source per se</sup>, with only 2 cm<sup>reliable source2</sup>', may be acceptable.". Alternatively, we could look for another example altogether. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEnchanter_c99f.html" title="User:Enchanter">Enchanter</a> 22:43, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I kind of like just explaining it. Draws a line (possibly a fuzzy one, but still a line nevertheless). I think the This Is OR, This Alternate Is Not OR example format will be helpful and reduce strife and confusion. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 22:53, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Putting the above together, and adding some introductory wording, I propose inserting:</p>
<p>==How do I avoid doing original research?==</p>
<p>Wikipedia does not publish original research or original thought. This includes unpublished facts, arguments, and ideas; and any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that serves to advance a position.</p>
<p>===Example of an unpublished synthesis of published material===</p>
<p>Material can often be put together in a way that constitutes original research even if its constituent parts have been published by reliable sources. If you have reliable sources for the edits you want to make, be careful that you're not analysing the material in a way that produces a new idea or argument of your own. Just because A is published by a reliable source, and B is published by a reliable source, doesn't mean that A and B can be joined in order to advance position C.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Example:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"In 1950, average rainfall in Northland was 10 centimeters per year<sub>Reliable source 1</sub>, whereas in 2005 the average rainfall was 9 centimeters per year<sub>Reliable source 2</sub>. Therefore the climate in Northland is changing, and getting dryer over time<sub>No source</sub>."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Under the attribution policy, the conclusion that the climate in Northland is getting dryer is not permitted, where it is not backed up by an appropriate source. This is because coming to a conclusion like this requires careful consideration of the source data, which Wikipedia is not in a position to verify. A climate researcher would consider how the measurements were made, and analyse the available data and relevant theories, before coming to a conclusion. Wikipedia is not in a position to verify this background research itself. Instead, a conclusion from combining other ideas must be attributed to a reliable published source, unless it is straightforward and uncontroversial.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, a straightforward observation which draws no novel or controversial conclusions, such as "In 1950, Northland had 10 centimeters of rainfall<sup>reliable source 1</sup>, but was considerably drier in 2005<sup>no source per se</sup>, with only 2 cm<sup>reliable source2</sup>", may be acceptable.</dd>

<li>A: No Wikipedia reader can know that you are an expert in the field that the article is about, nor judge the particular information you have edited or added (or even removed) on the basis of the expertise of its original author or later editors. Who you are and what qualifications you have are completely transparent to users of the encyclopedia.

Telling other Wikipedia editors what your qualifications are and providing proof of them does nothing to get around the core issue. While Wikipedia welcomes and is enriched by editors with expertise in any field, the fact that you are an expert does not mean that you are exempt from Wikipedia policies about the attributability and reliable-source verifiability of information. If you believe that sourced information in an article is incorrect and/or that its sources are unreliable <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">feel free</a> to remove the questionable material (or correct it, if your correction still agrees with the cited sources, or you provide a new source).

</ul>
<p>Could surely be made more concise, but that's the gist I'm trying to convey. See the largest thread at <a href="../../../a/l/b/Talk%7EAlbinism_a9c9.html" title="Talk:Albinism">Talk:Albinism</a> for a good example of why this is needed.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_FAQ_0e21.html" title="Edit section: Anonymous sources">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anonymous sources</span></h2>
<p>I would like to ask for some clarification on anonymous sources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An anonymous source is an unnamed person or a work created by an unnamed author. Anonymous sources are not acceptable in Wikipedia, because we can't attribute the viewpoint to its author. <b>Anonymous sources whose material is published by reliable secondary sources, such as Deep Throat in The Washington Post, are acceptable, because Wikipedia's source in this case would be the newspaper, not the anonymous source.</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the article <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Union_of_General_Workers_9f85.html" title="National Union of General Workers">National Union of General Workers</a> I have been discussing the inclusion of an anti-union editorial/commentary by what appears to be an anonymous teacher that was published in <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolis_%28English_magazine_in_Japan%29_d0d5.html" title="Metropolis (English magazine in Japan)">Metropolis</a> magazine <a href="http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/581/lastword.asp" class="external text" title="http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/581/lastword.asp" rel="nofollow">Killing the Golden Goose</a>. The source magazine is a reliable publication, having been published for 13 years or so. There is a long history of editorials in the magazine, though they are usually not anonymous. In this case, I suspect the writer was concerned about reprisals from the union. However, the person highlights some very important points about the Union's activities that I feel should at least be added as claims.</p>
<p>My proposed text is:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The union has been criticized for its aggressive militancy in pursuing the Shakai Hoken (National Health Insurance) issue. An editorial in <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolis_%28English_magazine_in_Japan%29_d0d5.html" title="Metropolis (English magazine in Japan)">Metropolis</a> argued that the union's actions would actually harm the majority of teachers and force the wider community of foreigners working in Japan to pay high premiums with less coverage than alternative private schemes. The article argued that allowing foreigners to opt out of the insurance scheme was a benefit to all but a small number of long-term employees.</dd>
</dl>
<p>There already has been a long, long discussion about this on the Union talk page, that ended in the source being removed as being unreliable. However, the guideline above (in bold) says that anonymous sources can be used when in reliable publications. Should this particular source be included or not?

<dd>I see no reason why not. But you will have to discuss the details at talk page and find common ground with other involved editors.

<p>Yes, I'm back. Yes, it's about synthesis again. No, I'm not going to stop until the FAQ accurately reflects policy. Now that we have that out of the way....</p>
<p>So, after the little "incident" on the WP:A talk page (which I'm really, really sorry about) I was finally able to get a clear statement on what y'all (or at least SlimVirgin) think "synthesis" means.</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote" style="margin-top:0;">
<p>Synthesis is a putting together.</p>
<p style="line-height:1em;text-align:left;padding-left:2em;"><small>—<cite style="font-style:normal;"><a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> (<a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SlimVirgin_2cc7.html" title="Special:Contributions/SlimVirgin">contribs</a>)</cite></small></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if I can take this one step further, we can swap the terms "synthesis" and "a putting together" from now on. Good, on to step two.</p>
<p>Step two is to examine the sentence I've changed. (repeatedly) Prior to my change it read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Original writing is desirable; it is original ideas or new synthesis of ideas and viewpoints that violate policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if we do that little word swap I described above (plus some grammar fixing) that sentence means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Original writing is desirable; it is original ideas or a new putting together of ideas and viewpoints that violate policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read that again. "A new putting together of ideas and viewpoints violates policy?" I think not. It does if that "new putting together" advances a point, <b>but the sentence doesn't say that</b>. It doesn't even say "can violate policy" or "may violate policy," it says that <b>all</b> "new putting together of ideas and viewpoints" violates policy. That is incorrect; hence, the sentence needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>Now, of course, comes the part where someone will inevitably say something like, "synthesis is an important part of policy, it needs to be in the FAQ." I agree, it does. Just not in that sentence. Certainly it should go in that section, and probably should have its own section of the FAQ. The problem is that the "synthesis" part of WP:NOR really cannot be adequately explained in a single sentence, certainly not in a manner that is as simple and easy to understand as is really necessary for a FAQ. After all, a FAQ is supposed to be clear, well-spoken, and so easy to understand that there is virtually no chance for people to come to incorrect conclusions regarding what it says.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd like you to just evaluate the new sentence as it stands after my changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Original writing is desirable; it is original ideas and viewpoints that violate policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is that sentence not true? No. Does it in any way distort or confuse the reader about policy? No. In fact, I'd argue that because it is so simple and to the point it is vastly improved; as it stands now it is a short, simple statement that is easy to understand and remember, and goes to the very core of the WP:NOR policy: "original ideas = bad for Wikipedia." Hell, it even covers the "synthesis" issue, because a "synthesis" violation must "advance a point" to be a violation since that "point is" (say it with me now) <b>an original idea</b>. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 21:43, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Such time stamped postings can be used in articles about the Usenet itself, but not in other articles. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 12:43, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I explained why above -- as a citation of a historical event that wasn't historical enough to be cited in an official publication... for example the announcement of a release of a piece of software. Sometimes such archived, timestamped Usenet postings are the only solid record of a software release date that exists. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThoric_d3ff.html" title="User:Thoric">Thoric</a> 15:14, 22 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That raises two questions in my mind ... 1) If the release date of a piece of software is not notable enough to be cited in a more reliable publication, is it notable enough to be mentioned here? and 2) Since he main objection to usenet postings is that we have no way to verify what is being posted or who is posting it... how do we know that a post saying a piece of software was released is a valid record for the release date? <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 15:23, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To answer #1, I would say that the release of well over 90% of <a href="../../../g/p/l/GPL_a75a.html" title="GPL">GPL</a> software gets released without any publication in a "notable" publication. For example, you would never find a newspaper article boasting the merits of the next version of <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Compiler_Collection_cfca.html" title="GNU Compiler Collection">GCC</a>, yet archives of <b>gnu.gcc.announce</b> would certainly be a reliable source for release history. As for #2, I would argue that Usenet deserves more credit than you are attributing to it -- especially in the case of archived posts from the days when the World Wide Web was young (or nonexistent). Archived Usenet articles are a valuable historical Internet record. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThoric_d3ff.html" title="User:Thoric">Thoric</a> 18:01, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Absolutely. When I was at <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation_eebe.html" title="Electronic Frontier Foundation">EFF</a> in the early days, virtually all of our organizational communication to our constituency was through comp.org.eff.talk and comp.org.eff.news other than direct e-mail of our newsletters to subscribers. What I or Mike Godwin said on comp.org.eff.talk was literally EFF speaking, in many cases (if they were just random conversations, not, but when we were speaking as EFF spokespeople on EFF policy matters, they are in fact reliably sourced statements about EFF policywork at that point in time.) — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 20:05, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This FAQ seems to indulge in the fallacy that all <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wikis</a> are attempts to build <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedias</a>. Now, I can think of several reasons why citing such a page would not be a terrific idea, but remember, in general <i>a wiki is just a way to build a web site.</i> Depending on who is allowed to edit and the policies in place, a wiki may have in principle as much reliability as any other web page. (This may, of course, be damning with faint praise.) What about, for example, software documentation which is made available in wiki form? If the documentation derives from the software developers themselves, this seems just as good a source as any other company website. As long as the citation links to the specific version of the page, what would be wrong with this?</p>

<p>This FAQ currently states, "Wikis, including Wikipedia and other wikis sponsored by the Wikimedia Foundation are not regarded as reliable sources. However, wikis are excellent places to locate primary and secondary sources. Many of them license content under the GFDL, which might be worth importing into Wikipedia, but once imported, the material is subject to Wikipedia:Attribution and Wikipedia:Neutral point of view."</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly agree that Wikipedia should not be allowed to be used as source or reference for some fact. This will result in circular reasoning ("We should write X in Wikipedia because Wikipedia writes X here"). This type of logic is fallacious and only begs the question. (This also reiterated in [[[WP:OR]], where it states only primary and secondary sources should be used to cite statements, and tertiary sources, such as Wikipedia, are to be avoided.) However, we currently policy that states Wikipedia article can, in fact, be used as sources, per <a href="../../../s/u/m/WP%7ESUMMARY_66b7.html" title="WP:SUMMARY">WP:SUMMARY</a>. The policy states we can summarize the article, without giving references, so as to ensure article do not overly long. Of course, very long articles are burdensome for readers, and summaries of the main points are necessary to condense the general ideas. However, simply using a different Wikipedia article seems to violate the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> policy and the one stated in this FAQ.

Of course there are issues where a citation ought to be included in the summary - for example BLP issues, surprising facts, and direct quotes - but common sense says that if the reader is interested in the summarized material then she/he will go to the main article. The summary paragraph should be a short, high-level summary; if it is long enough that it starts to meed many references, it is too long anyway.

<dd>Right. It's not WP sourcing itself, its simply cross-referencing to where the sources are.

My take is that the above statement on the article may have been correct three years ago. IMHO, wikipedia IS a reliable source today. Wikipedia has matured enough to be considered a reliable source. The millions of users everyday definitely think so too. Comments requested.</p>

<dd>Wikis (including Wikipedia) are absolutely not reliable. They may be a great resource, but they are inherantly unreliable by their nature. An article you cite to may change dramatically after you cite it (and could in fact say the exact opposite of what you were trying to support). The article you read may reflect a vandalized version and thus not be reliable. Edits are made anonimously with no way to attribute who said what.

<dd>Not all wikis necessarily need be anonymous. Suppose I found a wiki, InterUniversityBiologyWiki, which did not allow edits without an account, and only admins (who were all heads of biology departments at universities) were allowed to create accounts. Furthermore, these biology department heads only created accounts for their top biology professors and researchers, under these peoples' real names. Granted, I've never seen a wiki like that, but disallowing anonymous edits and making account creation a privelge is possible, and is done on some wikis.</dd>

<p>I tried to change this. It got reverted.</p>
<p>My own concern was with using statements by people on talk pages, etc., which should count as self-published sources usable in articles about the author. What discussion there is is still on this page under <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_FAQ_0e21.html#.22Are_Wikis_reliable_sources.3F.22" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution/FAQ">Wikipedia_talk:Attribution/FAQ#.22Are_Wikis_reliable_sources.3F.22</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EAttribution_FAQ_0e21.html#Wikis_as_reliable_sources" title="Wikipedia talk:Attribution/FAQ">Wikipedia_talk:Attribution/FAQ#Wikis as reliable sources</a></p>
<p>I find the objections to this to be specious. Some of them amounted to "it's difficult to do this". Fine, only allow it when someone has done it despite the difficulty. The biggest objection, that a Wiki can change at any time, is answered by using a permalink. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 15:08, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
