<dd>She doesn't carry more weight than anyone else. She just happened to be the person who Jimbo tried to work out a temporary solution with. Maybe I'd be listed there if I had managed to work out a temporary solution first.

<dd>Maybe true but does not resolve the objection. The level of control that that editor in particular has been trying to assert over the text is disturbing enough without the poll implying that that this is some kind of vote to go with Jimbo's ideas vs. SV's. The discussion is <i>quite</i> broader than that.

<dd>SMcCandlish, please don't use this as an opportunity to cause trouble. There is simply no trouble to cause. Jimbo and I came up with a compromise position, which actually works pretty well, because there was never any intention to deprecate V and NOR; I was heavily involved in writing and maintaining those pages so I'd be one of the last people to want to see them forgotten.

<dd>I've written I think 5 responses to this in various tones, and just can't seem to get it where it will sound right. I'll just have to summarize. And I won't even wikilink to any guideline and policy pages. Just because you don't agree with my stance on the issue and aren't happy that I'm criticising what I see as patterns of behavior on your part does not mean that I am here to "cause trouble" or am in fact "causing trouble", nor that I am being anti-constructive, or deconstructive, or unconstructive, or destructive, or whatever you envisioned the opposite of "constructive" to be in the context in which you used that word. I didn't come here to fight with you. I did happen to notice very rapidly when I did come here that you are personally exerting an enormous amount of influence over this alleged policy and its better-accepted predecessors, and I object to that level of influence. If you'd care to address that, I'd be happy to continue the conversation. If you just care to charaterize me as a "trouble"-"causing" non-"constructive" pee-on, then we should probably take that to user pages to the extent it should be discussed further at all. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 08:52, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Again, just to be really clear on this, I'm not alleging bad faith on <i>any</i>one's part. I just think there's a lack of balance. That a level of deference is being granted to people who have "worked for five months" on this merge, and that incoming opinions on the matter are being devalued. Please do note that I am not bringing up <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. While I said a while back that I could detect a whiff of it in the air, that's as far as I've ever gone with that line of reasoning. I think that <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> accusations as such are accusations of bad faith. Having been subject to a BF accusation just now myself, I wouldn't wish that on anyone. I'm not sure how to get this across in a nice, fuzzy-bunny way, is all. Some of us are not happy at all about WP:ATT's coming into being, others are not happy about its present wording, either because it does not accurately reflect the origin policies, or changes them too much in this way or that, and others are not happy about the fact that they're merged at all (process questions be damned). There are numerous viewpoints on this, probably 9 at least, just from the basic math and without accouting for minor variations. I don't think it is unnreasonable for some to have issues with the process and asking hard questions of those in effective control of the process. I think (to really to get to the point) that all parties involved are entitled to edit summaries that adequately explain their rationales, or which direct parties to an actually extant talk-page rationale that adequately addresses the issue. <i>That largely has not been happening around here.</i> — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 09:16, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>SMcCandlish, this tone is <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">completely unacceptable</a>. Slim has worked very hard on this policy, and worked out the compromise with Jimbo. I don't understand why you want to remove her name, but I oppose your doing so strongly. You must be aware that it will upset her, and I just don't understand why it's so important to you to do that. I know that policy discussions can get heated, and the policies concerned here have from time to time resembled battlefields, but it's not necessary.

<dd>Notwithstanding the note below, I see in retrospect how the "come out where ever you are" commentary may have sounded nasty.

<dd>I'm not sure I follow you. I'm transgressing AGF because I (and I'm not alone in this) am raising issues about over-control and lack of trasparency in this policy merge, meanwhile I get blatantly attacked as a "trouble maker" and un/not/anti-/something/de-"constructive"? I'm not implying any bad faith of SV's part. I objected (something like 2/3 of a day ago) against making the upcoming straw poll be about "SlimVirgin vs. Jimbo"; that's all. I got reverted in a manner that (habitually, in my view, though that is not the topic here) provided no justification for the revert, so I undid it, and explained the rationale for doing so. The AGF accusation here seems unwarranted and defensive. Not to mention completely missed the point. Instead of actually getting an explanation this time, I instead get told I'm an AGF transgressor. Am I expected to suddenly stop questioning anything or having an opinion at all from now on? Why is SV's cow so sacred? — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 08:52, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't see what you mean at all. There is no Jimbo v. SlimVirgin. Quite the opposite: we came up with the most recent position together.

<dd>Gahhh... That was the entire point of my edit. Remove the personalities and just make it be about the issues. Before I got jumped on, my next edit was going to be removal of Jimbo's name. (See the edit summary of that page today if you don't believe me. EVERYthing I've done with that page has been stepwise and in series.

<dd>Definitely too confusing. My proposed scheme would be a much simpler wording:
<dl>
<dd><b>Option 1</b></dd>
<dd>Wikipedia:Attribution is the only policy, Wikipedia:Verification and Wikipedia:No original research are redirected to sections of it that discuss the concerns formerly considered by those pages</dd>
<dd><b>Option 2</b></dd>
<dd>Wikipedia:Attribution is the primary policy, with Wikipedia:Verification and Wikipedia:No original research as subsidiary policies that provide simplified explanations of the concepts involved, and refer readers to Wikipedia:Attribution for further information. This is the current status quo.</dd>
<dd><b>Option 3</b></dd>
<dd>Wikipedia:Attribution is marked as historical, Wikipedia:Verification and Wikipedia:No original research are restored to full policy status</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The current scheme, with sections and subsections is way too hard to follow. I don't think the option of keeping WP:ATT but leaving WP:V and WP:NOR as the primary policies stands a chance of success, it being an extremely unwieldly option. Better just to mark ATT as historical and be done with. If absolutely necessary, it could be done as a sub-option of option 3 in my list, as it is a close variant, but I think it's better to avoid those nested choices. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 08:58, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to note that that wasn't a very graceful comment.&#160;;-) I went out of my way to specifically imply that the bias was not intentional. I think we may be having a simple culture clash. There is nothing malevolent at all about pointing out bias in a survey; it's just part of making the survey more sound (in social science terms; in hard science terms they are all meaningless nonsense of course). Anyway, while I do have my irritable disagreements to air, this isn't one of them. Please do not overgeralize discomfiture with one or two or seventeen things I've said to blanket opposition to everthing I say. PS: I don't think anyone here is misguided.

<p>We have three fundamental, distinct, but related doctrines, or content policies: verifiability, no original research, and neutral point of view. The question is, do we need three <b>pages</b> (one for each doctrine), two (one page might cover two of them), one (consolidate the lot on one page called "fundamental content policies") or four (one for each plus a summary of the lot and explanation of how they interrelate, called "summary of fundamental content policies"). There is no doctrine of "attribution". Attributing is a practice that is often (but not always) helpful for avoiding breaches of the three doctrines. The options should reflect the possibilities of how many <b>pages</b> we might need. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 08:41, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with your summary. We have two "doctrines," attribution and NPOV. If one violates attribution, this may be either because the work is original research or it may simply have the undesirable consequence that it becomes unverifiable (i.e., impossible to distinguish from original research). <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 08:50, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This implies that "no original research" and "verifiability" are the same thing, but they are not and never were. Even the existing attribution change does not claim they are (or I hope it doesn't - it talks about various key principles). This is the kind of confusion that happens when you try to merge what are really distinct ideas into one policy page. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 09:06, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, that's not an implication at all. There is a requirement that content in wikipedia be based on the content of reliable sources; if you ignore this requirement by making up information then it's original research, if you ignore it by failing to list the sources you're using then it's a verifiability problem. They're two different possible outcomes of failing to follow the same general rule. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 21:28, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Attribution is not a "doctrine", "policy" or anything else. It is an idea (heading towards "if it is not attributed then delete it") which a small group of editors have developed and are trying to make policy but for good reasons have not achieved anything approaching consensus. --<a href="../../../h/e/n/User%7EHenrygb_9b92.html" title="User:Henrygb">Henrygb</a> 11:08, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well, AGF as well. I wouldn't want to downplay fundamental ideas about user interaction or intellectual property, or anything else. But the three fundamental content doctrines are interrelated (yet doing distinct jobs) and very important.

<li>There's no such thing as "three fundamental content doctrines". There's a bunch of policies, and a bunch of founding principles, several of either relating to content. There are no "layers" of importance among different policies. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 13:52, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Is <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIFECTA_0312.html" title="WP:TRIFECTA">WP:TRIFECTA</a> still around? That might be the reasoning for some people thinking of three core polices.

<p>I removed (but was reverted) the words "Yes" and "No" from the options because I found them to be either confusing or biased... "Yes" and "No" are answers to a question... but there isn't a question stated above the options to which a yes/no answer should be given. Without such a question, prefacing the options with a positive or negative word gives a positive or negative bias to the option.</p>
<p>Turn it around and you will see what I mean. Since this poll is in response to Jimbo saying he does not like ATT, we just as easily could say:</p>
<ul>
<li>"No, the current version of ATT is acceptable, RS/NOR/V should be explanatory"</li>
<li>"Yes, RS/NOR/V should remain separate, ATT isn't needed"</li>
</ul>
<p>My point being that the choices end up being the same, but phrased from a different perspective (ie implicitly supportive of the idea of dumping ATT instead of keeping it).

<dd>Radiant, I don't see how your comments relate to using the words "Yes" or "No"? We still have the same number of options being presented, whether we include the words or not. If the number of options is a problem... then why not just cut the choices to the core question, and have only two options: 1) "ATT enjoys consensus" and 2) "ATT does not enjoy consensus"</dd>
<dd>I just don't see how adding "Yes" and "No" clears up the muddle... but I do see how it adds an unintended bias spin to the poll. Again, you could swap them so they say "No, I like ATT" and "Yes, I hate ATT" and still have the same options being presented.</dd>
<dd>If having the words "Yes" and "No" is important, then we should at least have a question stated for which a yes or no answer is called for ... a heading... something like: "<b>Does WP:ATT have community consensus?</b>" <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 15:18, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Radiant does have a point... the more options you present, the more difficult it becomes to determine which option has consensus. So perhaps what we need to do is structure the questions a bit better ... I would suggest the following: <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 15:35, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>1) Is the current version of ATT acceptable?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, the current version of ATT is acceptable.</li>
<li>No, the current version of ATT is not acceptable.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>2)If you answered "Yes" to the primary question, what should be done with WP:V and WP:NOR?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Redirect them to ATT.</li>
<li>Keep them as subsidiary/explanatory pages under ATT.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>3)If you answered "No" to the primary question, should we...</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Work on ATT some more with the idea of eventually effecting a merge?</li>
<li>Keep WP:V and WP:NOR as seperate policies in their own right?</li>
</ul>
<p><b>4)What should be done with WP:RS? (not a vote - please comment)</b></p>
<p>I would support that. <s>Only problem I see is (4). RS had no support as a guideline before the merger.

<p>While not claiming any spectacular expertise, I always find Wiki polls <i>sooo</i> funny given a few years of (low-to-middlish) market research management work. Wiki cannot properly construct the if-then/and/or structure of <a href="../../../c/a/t/CATI_7e70.html" title="CATI">CATI</a> surveys because a Wiki survey cannot create a "blind" environment: Q3 or Q14b are going to be viewable while an editor answers Q1 on a Wiki survey, and thus the survey wording itself biases any datum within it. Given that this poll is important (given Jimbo's intervention), we ought to do it right (if we are to do it) by starting with <i>one</i> question. We can only answer <i>one</i> properly, because we cannot be blind with more than one. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Do you feel that WP:V and WP:NOR should be merged into a single policy page?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>And that's <b>it</b>.</p>
<p>Perhaps other people have a different "basic question"? I think we can have a robust, unpolluted answer to <i>one</i> question. If we really wanted to be serious, we could disallow comments and only allow agree/disagree——leave an "open-end" section for comments. What we cannot do is create an if/then survey in the Wiki environment. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 20:12, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the if/then statement should be avoided. Perhaps this alternate organization is a compromise:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Q: What, if anything should be done with the current Policies &amp; Guidelines of Attribution, Verifiability, No Original Research, and Reliable Sources?</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li><b>Option 1</b> All 4 ideas should be merged into a single page, "Attribution".</li>
<li><b>Option 2</b> All 4 pages should be maintained as seperate policies and guidelines.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Then, once concensus is built on THAT point, a futher single question poll could be used to decide on more details, for example, if Option 1 reaches consensus, then we can ask:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Q: What should be done with the older policies and guidelines of Verfiability, No Original Research, and Reliable sources?</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>

<li><b>Verifiability</b>: Redirect or maintain as seperate page for historical or clarification purposes?</li>
<li><b>No Original Research</b>: Redirect or maintain as separate page?</li>
<li><b>Reliable sources</b>: Redirect or maintain as separate page?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>Alternately, if option 2 wins consensus, then we can ask:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Q: What should be done with these 4 policies and guidelines if they are all to be kept seperate?</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li><b>Keep all 4 as valid policies and guidelines</b></li>
<li><b>Eliminate Attribution and return to <i>status quo</i> before the merge attempt.</b></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<dd>This creates a 2 round straw poll, and avoids the confusing nature of an if/then poll. The specifics of each question could be tailored to better capture the points of contention here. But it would seem to me that we need to soon establish where the community intends to go on this. While polling may be evil, it can be hard to slog through discussions where a very small number of passionate editors are debating an issue. It can be impossible to actually establish concensus from a discussion with only a handful of participants. Sometimes there is a genuine concern, and other times there is only one or two editors who are objecting over the silent voices of the vast majority of editors who support the opposite position. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>|<a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayron32_19db.html" title="User talk:Jayron32"><small>talk</small></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jayron32_7743.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32"><small>contribs</small></a> 20:58, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jayron, thanks for looking and partially agreeing, but perhaps I didn't explain properly: if we are to do this, we must start with one <b>non-</b>open-ended question (a category important for lawyers and market researchers alike...). "What, if anything should be done..." is an open-ended question. We should start with a "yes/no"—as clear as a yes/no as possible. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 21:08, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I agree with you, I'm afraid the issues are far to great to deal with with a single yes/no question. We need to decide between a number of possible outcomes -- at a minimum the possible outcomes must include "revert to just Verifiability, No original research and Reliable sources", "keep only Attribution and tag the rest as historical" and "keep Attribution, and make Verifiability, No original research and Reliable sources subsidiary to Attribution." <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 21:35, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, assuming I agree with you (I don't, because you're mis-reading the suggestion), what you suggest suggests to me closing down this page and, ultimately, the discussion in general. A good, thoughtful, dictatorial decision from Jimbo is preferable to this. The "outcomes" must include... what?

<dd>I object to Wikipedia polls and never vote; but it looks horribly as if I'm going to have to this time. In which case, I hope I am not presented with one of those rococo polls peculiar to Wikipedia.

If ultimately approved, this is a MAJOR change of editorial policy structure (even if, at the outset, the policies are supposed to stay the same).

<dd>No, you missed nothing, but I've sure confused myself - this all only happened a day ago, but my chronology is already fuzzy. As I discussed with Jimbo on IRC, I had one idea and he had another. I think I created a version of the page in preview which was worded along the lines of finding out what people hoped to happen to the redirects and what the final status of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> should be. However, after IRC discussion, I modified them so as to be looking for what you mentioned above - opinions on whether the merger had (has) consensus. This seems to be the version I saved.

<p>If you want it really simple, you would have two options Yes and No. Then you can have specifics about how these Yes or No would work. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 13:51, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To unpack last, I'm assuming the intent here is not to decide whether the words on ATT need to be tweaked, but whether the basic idea of ATT replacing RS, V, and NOR, is a good one... What redirects where, etc. is subsidary and can be worked out through further discussion if there is consensus for the main change. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 14:07, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The point of having this poll is that Jimbo wants to know two things... 1) "Does the merger of V/NOR/RS into ATT have community consensus?"&#160;? and 2) "If it does, what do we do with the old policies and guideline that got rolled into it?" These are two seperate questions. So shouldn't we ask them seperately? <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueboar_4858.html" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> 14:13, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>We discuss neither here. WP:ATT is not a change in policy, merely a change in presenting it. The actual policies haven't changed much lately.

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>And to add, I'm not disagreeing with the latest wording at all, which is very straightforward. Two concerns:
<ul>
<li>We need to allow people to vote yes even if they don't want to have all three merged; Jimbo seems to want to keep NOR as a separate concept, for instance.</li>
<li>"Delete" and "detail pages" are not the exact options. Live pages, historical tags, etc. Rather than over-loading the initial question, we can defer that debate. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 14:45, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Jossi, you'll give up over my dead body.&#160;:) Jimbo has agreed that the Attribution policy be canonical, and so it is only the merger that's at stake and the poll is therefore not as crucial as it seems. I believe that the Attribution policy will go from strength to strength, even if the merger is voted down, because the other policies will be linked from it and it will centralise them. Discussion over the poll wording is necessarily knotty, because we're all acutely aware that dodgy wording would skew the result, as happens on so many Wikipedia polls. I hope you will somehow find the patience to deal with this wretched poll, because you've been one of the backbones of the Attribution policy all along. The FAQ in particular owes a lot you. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 14:50, 22 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thanks... Problem is that it is not up to anyone of us to dismiss the poll. If Jimbo has the power to single-handed challenge ATT as he did, and as he asked for a poll, looks like we shall have a poll regardless if it is a good idea or not. This may sound callous, but that is the reality of it. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 14:53, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Just so. And all the more reason not to give up now. If the poll supports the merger, Jimbo will accept it, and we're there. But even if the poll goes against the merge, it's not the end of the world because Jimbo has agreed to the Attribution page being canonical. So I see the glass as half full going on fully full.&#160;:) <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 15:05, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This poll came about because Jimbo has some questions he needs answered... but I'm not even sure if we have agreement as to what those questions are. How can we agree on the options to be presented if we can't agree on the questions to be asked?
