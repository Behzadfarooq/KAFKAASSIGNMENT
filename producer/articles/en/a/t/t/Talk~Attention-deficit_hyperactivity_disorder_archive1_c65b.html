<h3><span class="mw-headline">Arguments for Excluding Feingold Diet from ADHD Article</span></h3>
<p>Following is an assessment of the Feingold DietS from CHADD Fact Sheet "Assessing Complementary and Controversial Interventions" (2003):</p>
<p>"The most publicized of these diet elimination approaches is the Feingold Diet. This diet is based on the theory that many children are sensitive to dietary salicylates and artificially added colors, flavors, and preservatives, and that eliminating the offending substances from the diet could improve learning and behavior problems, including AD/HD. Despite a few positive studies, most controlled studies do not support this hypothesis. At least eight controlled studies since 1982, the latest being 1997, have found validity to elimination diets in only a small subset of children "with sensitivity to foods." While the proportion of children has not been empirically established, experts believe that the percentage is small. Parents who are concerned about diet sensitivity should have their children examined by a medical doctor for food allergies."</p>
<p>Including the Feingold Diet by its brand name is even more outrageous than including only pharmaceutical brand names in the section on treatment by medication would be.</p>
<p>If there were evidence or even an explicit theory characterizing the mechanism by which ADHD symptoms in particular were caused by salicylates and artificial colors, that might make it legitimate to single out Feingold by name, as opposed to elimination diets.</p>
<p>Since the diagnosis of ADHD is supposed to only be possible once other medical and psychological causes of the symptoms have been ruled out, it is a non sequitur to include any allergy-related treatments here. If we are to include elimination diets as a cure of ADHD, we should then include all cures for all the other possible medical and psychological causes of the ADHD symptoms. --DCDuring 02:40, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You ask for evidence of a mechanism .....Yes - there is. Ward <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> found that children with ADHD lost zinc upon exposure to synthetic coloring. As zinc was lost, their behavior deteriorated. Waring found that children with ADHD are low in the enzyme Phenol SulfoTransferase-P (PST). PST is necessary for neurotransmitter processing in the brain; it is necessary for metabolism of ingested phenolic compounds such as synthetic coloring; salicylate suppresses PST by up to 50%.

<p>Even if ADD and ADHD are the same thing, which I don't understand, then shouldn't there be a little bit more mention of ADD.

As far as i have understood it, ADD is a subcategory og ADHD. Both of the disorders originate from the same problem, only that ADHD is a stronger version of ADD. The underlying problem is that there is not enough dopamine beeing secreted or the re-uptake is to fast, resulting in a lack of neuronal fireing. (Dopamine binds to the dopamine receptors and gives an excitatory or inhibitory signal, wich makes the neuron either fire (exitatory) or not fire (inhibitory), (by fire, i mean that the neuronal cell sends a signal to next cell). Anyways some of the symptoms are the same for the two categories, such as a short memory span. But unlike a person with ADHD (wich is hyperactive) a person with ADD may instead fall asleep uncontrollably (like a narcoleptic does). The underlying cause here is the same, wich is the lack of dopamine affecting the dopamine receptors, but may yield very different results. The person with ADD may fall asleep because the lack of neuronal fireing makes the activation in the brain not enough for the person to stay awake (a primitive center in the brain called the sleep centre, wich i think is located in the hypotalamus (correct me if i am wrong here, in a thread below)). This centre in the brain sends out regular sleep signals, and if there is not enough activity this message will override and make the person fall asleep. (corrections could also be needed here, as i am not entirely sure about this, but it is what my doctor told me) I think this is also the reason the Narcoleptic falls uncontrollably asleep. (Narcolepsy is a close cousin to ADHD/ADD as my Neuropsycologist told me. And it is also a problem in the lack of dopamine. Resulting in some shared symptoms with ADD, such as a very short attention span and falling uncontrollably asleep.) Anyway, the reason the person with ADHD is hyperactive is that the dopamine level is so low, resuliting in extremely low ihibitory and exitatory signals, thus making the brain overcompensate for the low activation level in the brain, by being hyperactive, (thus exposing the brain to much more stimulus by acting out and being impulsive). Anyway, my point is that the effects of the activation level in the brain are so different causing some very different symptoms (hyperactivity in contrast to falling asleep uncontrollably), making them very different from eachother. And this is why i agree with Pingveno and Chaz that they should be seperated and not merged. Even tho it is the same underlying problem, just to a different degree, the results are very different. You can easily tell a person with ADHD from a person with ADD. But the medicationing is the same, amphetamines and variations of it (like dextroamphetamine). So if you give a hyperactive person amphetamines, this will increase the dopamine levels and neuronal firing resulting in a less need to act out and overcompensate, and the person with ADD will not fall asleep because the activation level is high enough to not be overridden by the sleep signal. Back to my point, you can easaly tell a person with ADD from a person with ADHD and the symptoms are different. I have probably argued against myself and my point here, but i am just telling you what i have learned (from neuropsycologist, physician and classes in bilogical psycology). I have argued for and against the merging of the two states, but i am just trying to make things a bit clearer. (if you can correct me in any way in this long thread please do in a post below) I have probably derailed a lot here, but that is because i have a very short attention span myself. And yes, like Pingveno said, there should at least be a small comment about this in the beginning of the article, to make it clearer for the reader that ADD and ADHD has different outcomes. So ADD is ADHD without hyperactivity but instead a chance to fall asleep uncontrollably. A childhood friend of mine has ADHD (and unmedicated, will not be mistaken for a person with ADD). So as Pingveno said, so i think it would be appropriate to make a comment in the first part of the article about this. Flaffen 04:10, 7 april 2006 (CET)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Country specific view of drugs</span></h2>
<p>The list of the drugs available for ADHD in this article is American specific. What drugs are available and what type of restrictions there are on them vary from country to country. In Canada Ritalin is the equivalent of non restricted, Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine...Australians often call it Dexamphetamine) is controlled but nowhere near as strictly as in the US. On the other hand until recently those were the only two stimulants that could legally be prescribed. A slow release of Adderall was recently approved in Canada. Desoxyn and such are not available for prescription here.</p>
<p>The result can be kinda perverse at times. It is not that hard to get a Rtialin prescription if there seems to be a problem (I have adult add that was covered by an anti-depressant and child add before that ---but when i had to change the anti-depressant because it wasn't working it became apparent that it was a problem again[actually the anti-depressant worked better for add than depression]...my doctor was willing to give me some Ritalin until i found a specialist but would not prescribe dexedrine because it was controlled---and i had a history of a <b>bad reaction</b> to Ritalin). However if Ritalin doesn't work it can be difficult to get the alternatives. Part of that is because by our law Dexedrine (for example) can only legally be prescribed for someone with ADHD, ADD or narcolepsy. In summary from what i see discussed it is initially somewhat harder and definetely more inconvienient to get Ritalin or other stimulants in the US, but there seems to be less focus on drugs other than Ritalin being inherantly more difficult or dangerous (they haven't generally shown to be in any studies i see up here)--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcie_43f5.html" title="User:Marcie">Marcie</a> 19:52, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have ADHD and i am currently using the drug Concerta to treat it. Concerta is an extended release drug which means that the pill dissolves slowy throughout the day to eliminate the peaks and vales in coverage that happen when taking ritalin. I also take ritalin in the morning so that the Concerta has time to take effect. I would like to add Concerta to this page but i am not quite sure how to do that. Would someone please help me or just go ahead and add Concerta? Thanks -578 a new user</p>

<p>Could we put in something regarding treatment opinions being somewhat different from country to country...in Canada norephefine is often viewed as importantly as Dopamine...i know in my case Dopamine doesn't make a hell of a lot of difference, but the norephenefrine DOES. Generally the dopamine is what causes my tics....how do i know...experimentation with different anti-depressants to see if they helped...the one's with Norphenefrine (mispelled) seemed to make a bigger difference...although the dopamine might help.</p>
<p>I've seen very contradictory stuff on the Omega fatty acids...ranging from works doesn't do a thing. Could be an individual thing again. I take them for other reasons i haven't noticed a bit of difference in my adhd, although my body feels like it has a better balanced diet now and i think i can see a bit of a difference in my hair...and i've been taking them since May!...--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcie_43f5.html" title="User:Marcie">Marcie</a> 19:51, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>A book that has impacted my whole life When I was a teenager, I first read The Virginian Railway, written by rail historian and photographer H. Reid, a Norfolk native. He combined the usual information about locomotives and rolling stock customarily found in railroad books with the business strategy of the two founders of the VGN, who were each fascinating men with seemingly endless ideas and energy. These days they may have been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder!</p>
<p>Reid's storytelling writing style included many stories told by former railroaders, who came to be very loyal to the VGN, which paid its employees and vendors a little better than absolutely necessary. The building of the railroad was a story of little business winning over big business. It was built to the highest possible engineering standards, was enormously profitable, and operated an amazingly wide range of innovative equipment.</p>
<p>The Virginian Railway enthralled me and has impacted my life, career, and hobby interests greatly in the 40 years since I first read it. I have 3 copies of H. Reid's epoch book, including a rare first edition, which has the best quality photographs. I still enjoy re-reading it (as do many other Virginian Railway enthusiasts I have been told).</p>
<p>I also want to say that anyone who thinks they have ADD or ADHD or whatever should read Driven To Distraction. I would compare reading this book at age 44 to having a car and finding the owners manual in the glove box after you turn the first 100,000 miles!!! <a href="../../../v/a/o/User%7EVaoverland_3ef2.html" title="User:Vaoverland">Vaoverland</a> 12:25, 16 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I admit, Having ADHD makes it is very, very difficult for me to maintain a npov when it comes to ADHD. It is even harder when I read something like the above. I have several gripes with these two paragraphs, but I'm not sure how to incorporate them into the article, or if I should even try.</p>
<p><i>The nutritional data has been well summarized in a review article (Burgess et al., 2000, Am J Clin Nutr 71:327-330). Children with ADHD have lower levels of key fatty acids. In fact, one study found that the lower the levels, the worse the symptoms. The possibility that fatty acid deficiency is a trigger for ADHD is especially plausible as nutrition scientists have recently demonstrated that the American diet is extremely deficient in omega-3 fatty acids. At the same time, the incidence of ADHD is rapidly increasing. More support for this idea comes from the findings that breast-fed children have much lower levels of ADHD, and that until quite recently, infant formula contained NO omega-3 fatty acids. These findings are only correlational, and do not prove a causal connection.</i><br />
<i>Initial studies with supplementation with various fatty acids found improved cognitive function, visual acuity, and reduction of at least some of the symptoms of ADHD. These findings are similar to those in which improved cognitive function and increased IQ are seen in breastfed children—who get more fatty acids from their mother’s milk than do formula-fed infants. The data from these studies are promising, but inconsistent. Why did only some of the studies see an effect, and why were only some symptoms improved? These questions cannot be answered unless one knows about the effects of these fatty acids on the dopamine system.</i></p>

<p>Not sure if this should be up top or on bottom (i.e. if this is the start or end of the page), so, feel free to toss this to the bottom if it's out of place, but: Any thoughts on creating a section 'high-functioning and AD(H)D'? There is the fainest hint of such a section in the 'celebrities' / world figures references in this article, however, I was thinking of approaching it more seriously / technically. I think it could tie in well with the fact that the comorbidity between ADD and a variety of LDs is somewhat high (this could be contrastingly linked in the article subsection I'm speaking of) but, in contrast, there is also a wonderfully fat tail on the right hand side of the distribution for high-achieving individuals with ADD -- high kertosis values in more and more of the studies, although still left skewed. Anyway, please share thoughts on this ... if feedback seems receptive, I'll work on developing a section.</p>

<dd>Because it is speculation at best. There is no way to definitively prove that some historical figure had ADHD. Besides there is no shortage of confirmed modern day ADHDers. Ty (The Carpenter on Trading Spaces), the guy who played the middle son on the Brady Bunch are two that come to mind. Both have said in interviews that they have ADHD.</dd>
<dd>Speculation cheapens the diagnosis. Its easy to say that people such as Ben Franklin had it, but its impossible to prove, and more over it minimalizes the difficulties that we have.

<dd>Well, did <i>he</i> actually? IMHO, including potential historical 'colleagues' is not that bad, quite in contrary. Partly qfor pure edutainment purposes and partly because one might also have a look at the <i>circumstances</i> that accompanied those persons and enabled them to become worth remembering. Just draw your conclusions from those, you might discover things which are good for you. No need to feel intimidated, btw: <i>if</i> those people are labeled correctly, they <i>will</i> have had their issues and quirks to cope with throughout their life. I think it is actually quite motivating. Don't victimize yourself!</dd>
<dd>And then, please mind you, that speculation can be quite scientific, if it is done right. In this case that might e.g. mean to get all the biographical facts (childhood reports seem crucial to me) that might be applicable either pro <i>or</i> contra and use those to approximately answer the standard diagnosis questionnaires. That provided, you might want to get at least one expert's opinion on each case. At least all confirmed members of the club of the unfiltrated should know one...&#160;;-) True, a certain propability to err is there, but such is life. --<a href="../../../b/r/s/User%7EBrsma_0dac.html" title="User:Brsma">brsma</a> 15:25, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<b>Other Causes</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>A number of different lines of research may be converging on an answer, or at least part of the answer. First, neuroscientists have determined that the dopamine system does appear to be central to the symptoms of the diagnosis, and certain changes in this system are consistently seen in those labeled as having ADHD. Second, certain essential fatty acids, <a href="../../../o/m/e/Omega-3_fatty_acids.html" title="Omega-3 fatty acids">omega-3 fatty acids</a>, have received increasing attention from nutrition researchers as being essential for healthy brain development. This family of compounds has been directly tied into function of the dopamine system, and appears to be of critical importance in formation and maintenance of these systems. Third, clinical nutritionists have noted that ADHD labeled children are often deficient in omega-3 fatty acids, and that supplementation with various fatty acids may reduce some of the symptoms.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Is there really a connection between omega-3 fatty acids and ADHD? The research supporting such a connection was conducted by scientists in three very different areas who do not ordinarily communicate with each other. This means no one has specifically studied the possibility. However, the findings in each area are very suggestive. If the connection between omega-3 fatty acids is true, then dietary supplementation could be an effective prevention for the disorder, and could be a less costly alternative treatment, with fewer adverse effects, and would ultimately address the root problem, unlike current psychotropic drug treatments.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Initial studies with supplementation with various fatty acids found improved cognitive function, visual acuity, and reduction of at least some of the symptoms of ADHD. These findings are similar to those in which improved cognitive function and increased IQ are seen in breastfed children, who get more fatty acids from their mother’s milk than do formula-fed infants. The data from these studies are promising, but as yet inconsistent. Why did only some of the studies see an effect, and why were only some symptoms improved? These questions cannot be answered unless one knows about the effects of these fatty acids on the dopamine system, and the economic realities regarding who is funding studies attempting to debunk the correlation.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Making an adult lab rat deficient in omega-3 fatty acids results in significant metabolic changes, in the number of dopamine receptors and the amounts of dopamine in different parts of the brain responsible for learning, memory, and attention. Not surprisingly, adding n-3 fatty acids reversed these effects. More interesting studies have looked at developmental effects. If female rats are fed a diet deficient in n-3 fatty acids and then become pregnant, their offspring show marked changes in the dopamine areas of the brain, which look like those seen in ADHD-labeled children, and in the spontaneously hyperactive rat (Acar et al., 2003, Neurosci Res 45:375-382). The pups were also hyperactive. Supplementation of the female rats’ diet either during pregnancy or while nursing prevented this from happening. However, supplementing the pups’ diet after weaning only partially reversed the effects. This means that supplementation will only be partially effective as a treatment. Changing the diet of pregnant women and their infants and toddlers will be necessary to maximize the effectiveness of n-3 fatty acids in preventing ADHD symptoms.</dd>

<p>In December 1999, NIMH released the results of a study of nearly 600 elementary school children, ages seven-to-nine, which evaluated the safety and relative effectiveness of the leading treatments for ADHD for a period up to fourteen months. The results indicate that the use of stimulants alone is more effective than behavioral therapies in controlling the core symptoms of ADHD - inattention, hyperactivity/impulsiveness, and aggression. In other areas of functioning, such as anxiety symptoms, academic performance, and social skills, the combination of stimulant use with intensive behavioral therapies was consistently more effective. (Of note, families and teachers reported somewhat higher levels of satisfaction for those treatments that included the behavioral therapy components.) NIMH researchers will continue to track these children into adolescence to evaluate the long-term outcomes of these treatments, and ongoing reports will be published. This study has been severely criticized, as it was not double-blind and the sponsors failed to provide a control group.</p>

Primary among these is the omnipresence and exploitive qualities of advertising. In the time that ADHD has arisen as the epidemic it is often portrayed as, advertisement has become virtually unavoidable, and advertisements utilize much more sophisticated methods of deception. Some suggest that people (children, especially) are aware of this attempt at pervasive trickery, whether consciously or subconsciously, and react by avoiding extended attention in order to avoid being deceived. Naturally, this self-defense reaction, when carried over to school and home, presents obvious problems. From this point of view, prescribing drugs is effectively only to alleviate symptoms, but entirely avoids the cause.</p>

<dd>You're fighting an uphill battle. It's quite beneficial for the drug industry if there's a condition generally treated with drugs that supposedly "affects" 5% of the population. They are the ones with the money. They can keep repeating the terms "disorder" and "chemical imbalance" constantly despite the fact that it has never been proven that neurological differences observed in ADHD (and other "disorders") are in fact pathological in nature. There's no credible evidence to suggest that ADHD is nothing but genetic. For alleles to reach 5% prevalence it is just not possible for them to be pathological. And in fact, it appears that the DRDR-7R allele increased in prevalence so quickly that it must have provided some benefits at one time, if not now. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 00:48, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The only research I've made reference to is one published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (it's actually DRD4 not DRDR). It's silly to suggest that's my original research. Thom Hartmann's research is his too, of course. Perhaps you can also find a Usenet group where you can argue your pro-disease view, but wait, the drug industry is already doing it for you. Maybe it can be argued that autism is a disorder... maybe. To suggest that something as mild as ADHD is a disorder is just plain stupid, not to mention damaging to the self-esteem of otherwise completely healthy kids. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 03:19, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

From which representative of the medical establishment -- oh, wait! You've already decided that the medical establishment, if it supports the existence of ADHD, is on the take and that therefore your assertions that ADHD is "mild" (because you've never seen a case you wouldn't classify as "mild") mean more. Well, that's original research, pal. You want anecdotal evidence? I could tell you of my own experiences, of the very distinct difference between my regular ADD state and the state I was in when they found a medication effective for me -- I never realized before then just how much <i>effort</i> I have to put in to concentrate, to tune out distractions, to multi-task, but on the medication I was like other people: I could <i>decide</i> to concentrate and I could do it. I could think "Oh, I have to handle X today, don't I?" and I could <i>continue what I was working on</i> and not <i>completely forget about X because I didn't switch mental tracks right away.</i> It still breaks my heart sometimes that I had to be one of the people who have a rare allergic reaction to that medication and I couldn't stay on it. I could tell you about the worst case of ADD I've ever seen, and the one that convinced me that ADD is real: a very lovely and very smart girl who, if you just stay quiet and let her talk, will tell you what's on her mind, and you'll realize that it's very well-considered, insightful thinking. But if you interrupt her -- even so much as asking her to repeat a word you didn't catch -- the distraction completely derails her. Don't try to tell that that's normal or mild because it isn't autism. I could give you this and more anecdotal evidence besides but if you think this is the place for anecdotal evidence, which seems to be all you have to offer, then I encourage you to read <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and clue in. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:56, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't even get what your argument about the girl who gets distracted consists of. There are mute autistics, such as Jasmine O'Neill (<a href="http://greg.quuxuum.org/journal/o_neill.html" class="external text" title="http://greg.quuxuum.org/journal/o_neill.html" rel="nofollow">read her essay here</a>) who present a good case about autism not being a disease. She's mute, ok. Don't you think that's an actual difficulty? Explain why her view would be pro-neurodiversity and not pro-disease. And you tell me about a girl who gets very distracted. Give me a break. Poor little girl. She's probably perfectly healthy and being made to believe that her brain is broken. And I'd ask you this: Is this problem a problem actually for the girl, or is it simply that those who interact with the girl have arbitrarily defined this to be a problem? Does the girl think that she has a problem? Is the desire to have her conform to social norms (and I assume mainstream schooling) more important that accepting her for who she is? Can you predict the girl's future with any accuracy? As to the genetics argument, it's very simple. If an allele goes from 0% frequency to 5% frequency in what appears to be 10,000 to 40,000 years, can you really argue that it is not in fact due to at least some positive selection? <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 19:33, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I'm sure if he had lived in this day and age, first, his parents would have been made to worry about his brain being broken. He would have been given Ritalin or something.

<dd>ADHD is only a 'disorder' when it's not mild. That is the point of the 'significant impairment' criterion you question further down the page. It's possible to be very inattentive and very hyperactive, but if it's not posing any issues, then it's not ADHD.<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 03:51, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Who said anything about things not existing? The argument is whether certain neurological differences are pathological or not. Is ADHD something you have or something you are? Do you catch it, like you'd catch a cold, or is it part of who you are? Would it be possible to completely remove the ADHD from the person without destroying the individual that once was? These are questions that I believe only an ADHD person could answer. If you were to ask that about asthma, I doubt anyone would indicate that asthma is part of their personality. Clearly there are conditions that you do acquire, e.g. anxiety. Anyone can get anxiety, and I do believe for many it's possible to rid oneself of anxiety (without the need to be medicated for life). People with anxiety do <i>suffer</i> from the ailment and I don't think anyone with anxiety would reject a cure. No one is going to fight for someone's right to be anxious. But there needs to be a distinction between real ailments and so-called "disorders" which are defined solely in terms of what are considered behavioral deviations from "normalcy" -- "normal" as in a statistical distribution that is. (Real ailments are sometimes present along with ADHD and other disorders, and people tend to assume they are part of the disorder or caused by the disorder). There needs to be a distinction between suffering from a "disorder" vs. suffering because of neurological intolerance, i.e. being called disease. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 18:57, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

They have written controversial essays that stirred things up, like "Don't Mourn For Us" by Jim Sinclair. They have organized letter writing campaigns, set up websites, and so on.

<dd>I hardly agree with your theory Neurodivergent. Telling us (ADHD) people to take some "cues" from the Autistic community is not relevant basis for fixing this disorder, and I dont take it lightly. Sure anyone can take advice and go with it, but the fact is, the problem is still there and embedded in our neurological framework permanently. There are some things that can be overcome and others that cant, without the aid of a drug that can modify the chemical imbalance. I think you need to kick it in the butt because you obviously feel your own Autism is an "identity" you can work around with your own intelligent ways of doing so, thats great, but Autism is NOT the same. You think everyone out there is just getting brainwashed by an entire industry of researchers that [i]only[/i] care about $$ and not seeking real answers backed by significant and valid research? I beg to differ, and I also am sure theres plenty of people in that industry themselves that suffer from ADHD who would plaud their own foundings. Being a case myself, I KNOW what its like to deal with ADHD, and whats its like when I take Aderoll, and the differences are astounding to say the least. I believe your opinions are seriously malformed and unfounded and you need to take a second look about it before sticking to a narrow-minded pathological pov. Hyperfocus is one element of a persons ability to concentrate better as an ADHD person, and with ADHD they are able to do it particularly well under relaxed conditions. But on the other end of the spectrum, the reality of the condition with this kind of concentration affected with ADHD is when trying to focus under stress or "forced concentration". Recent research shows this problem quite clearly the PHYSICAL cause through SPECT imaging research of the Caudate nucleus. As one concentrates with a calm demeanor, the bloodflow to the caudate nucleus is normal, everything is firing healthy. When they are under stressful concentration, the bloodflow is severely hindered and it does not recieve the oxygen and glucose neccessary to support function of the Caudate nucleus and it partially shuts down. This is also related to short-term memory problems. Please enlighten me more your anti-(pro)disease hoopla, as I am very concerned YOU are brainwashing people into thinking this is just something they should learn to cope with and the remedy is more a circumstantial one that drugs cannot provide the answer. -Anemos 09:16, 01 February 2006</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Example of so called hyperactive person.</span></h2>
<p>One child was send to psychoterapeut to be cured from being hyperactive. Kid was normal and healthy, so therapist invited family of that kid.</p>
<p>Since family come kid statred behave unnormaln. For many of you that means that kid was healthy, family was ill.</p>
<p>So describing and treating kids with drugs means harming them.</p>
<p>Another example is from "monroe institut" (guys that invented or use sound to for example put someone to sleep)</p>
<p>They treated one kid, after few weeks kid become as describe "self confident" and was as i remember optimistic. All in all he become independend and self confiden, when kid returened to the familly quickly he become same as before.</p>
<p>It means one kdi was healthy, his family was making him ill.</p>
<p>I hope you-the reader- are good. And if you are doctor, try retalin for yourself. and then find out what you are doing to kids for money.</p>

<p>I think i know how one can found who is making all ADHD theory and trying made other to belive it: Thoes who earn most from it. Thoes can be drug producers, teachers that insted of making interesting lessons are calling bored kids hyperactive.</p>
<p>And possibly others that make money from whatever is related to ADHD or others couse i think more people will lie about some syndromes will creat some names, will calling it some disorders, only to make what they are doing more easlier (like teachers) or to make money, (i wish them someone describe them some drug they ware making money of and make them take it for them self)</p>
<p>In the way of fictional couses and wide range description:</p>
<p>What works?</p>
<p>And please remember that after 6months of any thing can change person so writing that 6 months of prozac or retalin helped is an lie or harmful joke.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">One angle</span></h2>
<p>Any situation where the solution is just "prescribe the kid some pills" isn't properly handling in my opinion. There are a million ways to help an ADD person perform better and avoid the problems ADD does cause or deal with them. I think coping skills (or work-arounds) are more valuable than meds or at least as important. I need closed captioing to be able to watch TV without my mind wandering. Seeing the words makes the extra difference in having enough stimulation hold my attention. That beats popping a pill. However, some meds and the workarounds are the best balance for me. My doctor listens to me. However, I think it is tougher for the kids.</p>
<p>Also, some parents and teachers just focus on hyperactivity. If thats all thats wrong, then it ain't ADD/ADHD. Hyperactivity alone is not ADD/ADHD. But, because I ahve hyperactivity, I know it keeps me from making friends because people don't like it. So, I have to ask, is it enough of a problem that I care? Kids have other people making those decisions, so it's harder.</p>
<p>I think one point that is getting missed is that for an ADHD diagnosis, the items on the checklist have to be present in more than 1 setting and have to be causing functional problems for the individual within the past 6 months for a ADHD condition of any type to exist. If you had <i>everything</i> on the checklist and your life was going great, no diagnosis. The degree <i>any</i>of it is a <i>functional</i> problem for the person (not the convenience of teachers or parents) is a critical piece. I know there is a condition regarding brain wiring because I have it. Its just the same as a talent. Someone can be a wonderfully coordinated athlete, someone else a musical genius, etc. I am not ashamed of it, I just need to tend to it like I would any other part of my bod. If someone gets a diagnosis and doesn't like the meds, it probably ain't ADD/ADHD. Doctors can be wrong, and a lot of folks think that too many kids are misdiagnosed currently. Also, Dr. Hallowell says the next time around, the DSM will be changing the labels again, so maybe they'll call, it genius syndrome next, I dunno. To me it is a difference, OK, people are different. The important thing is how does the person's life go? Because the meds can help with the extremes.</p>
<p>If everything in the person's life is OK, then it can't be ADHD by definition.</p>

<dd>I tend to disagree. What if ADHD were to be defined in terms of genetics? (It would be many different conditions then, but suppose that.) The reason you'd want to keep the label, despite managing to function quite well, is that it's a form of identity that I believe is more important than nationality or ethnicity. It's too bad that there's a tendency to pathologize human diversity these days, but for now there are no replacement labels. (Homosexuals probably went through this before.) <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 00:19, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also if you look at the DSM criteria, the one that says that you must suffer from significant impairments in order to be diagnosed seems kind of vague and arbitrary.

<p>One great thing about the Internet is that you can find out more for yourself. It is true that many teachers don't keep the kids challenged enough. Most of mine sure as hell didn't. But, when you are the main one bored (look around) and seem to suffer more than everyone, maybe that's a flag to understanding yourself better. I was relieved to start understanding about ADD because I always thought something was wrong with me, (too lazy, doesn't try hard enough, doesn't care enough, etc.). Now I understand me better. Thats totally different than being forced to deal with doctors by family or school when you don't think anything is in need of improvement with yourself (or could be). Keep in mind , the ADD symptoms are not in the voluntary area of a brain, so it ain't willpower or desire that control them. Also, people with ADD are often poor at self observation, so that's kind of a catch-22 for diagnosing ourselves. <a href="../../../v/a/o/User%7EVaoverland_3ef2.html" title="User:Vaoverland">Vaoverland</a> 21:33, Apr 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>About the kid who is "normal and healthy" until family is present, it is a known fact that the ADD traits can run in families. Thus, a kid who can function well or has adapted in another environment could find chaos in a home managed by parent(s) with ADD behavior who are not successfully using <a href="../../../c/o/p/Coping_skill.html" title="Coping skill">coping skills</a>, maybe even more chaotic with siblings. <a href="../../../v/a/o/User%7EVaoverland_3ef2.html" title="User:Vaoverland">Vaoverland</a> 13:50, Apr 7, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Doing a search on ADD/ADHD, which seems to be the most common reference used to the disorder, does not hit on any title. The results is a listing of pages which include the acronyms instead and offer many irrelevant pages.</p>
<p>Why the dash between Attention and deficit? Why a separate page for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder?</p>
<p>This page mentions the three forms of the disorder. (two of which branched ADHD to the ADD/ADHD acronym didn't they?) As I follow it; ADHD is the inclusive term, with ADD being the form without the hyperactivity, and WHAT for the third?</p>
<p>Does all three forms have the (dis)ability to hyperfocus? I add the (dis) because I personally find hyper focusing to be less an ability as a requisite to any focus that kicks in on it's own accord. It's often in a direction other than the task at hand.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">labels</span></h2>
<p>as Robt has noted, there is an abundance of confusion over the various labels and subtypes. Dr. Ned Halloway has stated that additional changes are expected in the next round of the DSM. Maybe some of it will be easier to explain.</p>
<p>If I understand correctly, the three subtypes would be:</p>
<dl>
<dd>with hyperactivity (and not so much inattentiveness)</dd>
<dd>with inattentiveness (and not so much hyperactivity)</dd>
<dd>combined type (with both hyperactivity and inattentiveness)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most adults are less likely to display the hyperactivity aspect, and perhaps that is why the ADD (without the "H") seems like a more comfortable term to use.</p>
<p>When we label ourselves, or let others do it, I feel that it is important to remember that part of the criteria for making an official diagnosis is functional impairment in our lives within the past 6 months. If you have the requisite number of "symptoms" on the checklist, and in multiple settings, but everything is going great in your life, you technically do not have the condition as a "disorder". However, for many of us, accepting the label of disorder opens the door for treatment, therapy, and medication which can relieve functional impairments.</p>

<dd>Immediate survival instincts are not an issue when in a state of hyperfocus. At the risk of reading too much into your example, there are very few tasks which one might hyperfocus on that would not immediately be interrupted due to things like smoke. If their house was burning down around someone who was in a state of hyperfocus, they would notice–if for no other reason than it would quickly become impossible to continue what they were doing.

<li>the claim it makes seems suspect; those of us who have been clinically diagnosed with ADD know how carefully the history of the patient must be compared to what would be normal for a "baseline" patient in order to be confident of a diagnosis. Therefore, I find the statement that ADD/ADHD are being diagnosed in great numbers in populations which are themselves far from "baseline" to be suspicious. Perhaps this will be possible when the organic basis of ADD/ADHD is better understood and it will be possible to look for the cause rather than for the effects, but that day is not yet here. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:27, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>First of all, I'll leave aside the question of whether chemical imbalance has been categorically repudiated because I'd have to get myself up to speed; so for the purposes of this discussion, let's assume that the motivation for Om's latest edit is valid. My problem, then, with the edit is that "regulation of how the brain controls behavior" is confusing, because the brain controls behavior but who regulates the brain? Well, in the old version it's clear that <b>certain chemicals</b> control the brain, but that's the part that we're trying to get rid of. So who's left to regulate the brain? It seems to me that if the chemicals aren't doing the regulating, no one else is, and "is related to regulation of how the brain controls behavior" should be changed to "is related to the brain's control over behavior" or some such.

<li>Thanks for the thoughtful response, Philip. The nature of interactions between relatively static brain architecture and biological processes is much better understood by some than the revised section intro would imply, but by and large the depiction is somewhat accurate. This prevailing assumption is in part fostered by the conflicted message that the brain is too mysterious to be understood, yet 'experts' clinging to the '<a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_imbalance_theory.html" title="Chemical imbalance theory">chemical imbalance theory</a>' are imbued, unlike lay citizens, with the capacity to divine the truth of the matter. The saturation broadcasting of advertisements promoting the 'chemical imbalance theory' has apparently vanished, mysteriously, in recent months, perhaps as a result of efforts on behalf of psychiatric survivors. According to David Oaks, of <a href="../../../m/i/n/MindFreedom.org_9b27.html" title="MindFreedom.org">MindFreedom.org</a>, "Pfizer, Inc. does not explain the following important indisputable fact: There is no scientific evidence for such a chemical imbalance. For example, there is no reliable diagnostic lab test for any alleged chemical imbalance for any mental disorder. Pfizer, Inc. has broadcast this fraud many times on television, in print, on the web and in other material reaching millions of Americans The public believes that your agencies are protecting their interests, and you have approved these ads. FCC, FDA and FTC share responsibility, both legally and morally, for immediately halting this harmful deception.<a href="http://mindfreedom.org/mindfreedom/pfizerlies.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://mindfreedom.org/mindfreedom/pfizerlies.shtml" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></li>

<dd>According to <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Pribram_db7a.html" title="Karl Pribram">Karl Pribram</a>, mental processes are mediated by wave interference patterns, which he implies are dependent largely upon the template of neural structure. Reading between the lines, his <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holonomic_brain_theory.html" title="Holonomic brain theory">Holonomic brain theory</a> infers neurochemical processes are secondary to brain architecture in terms of brain function regulation. The concepts entertained in <a href="../../../s/y/s/Systems_biology.html" title="Systems biology">Systems biology</a> also tend to repudiate the simplistic notion that adding or subtracting chemicals in one column essentially offset 'imbalances' caused by chemicals in another column.

<dd>I'm not an expert neurologist by any means, but the last tiem I checked, my ADHD is helped by a chemical. My brain is partially regulated by chemicals. Water is a chemical. Neutrotransmitters are chemicals. Synapses only work between neurons because of chemicals. What else exactly is in the brain to effect? I'm quite a bit confused, and I'd like something in a peer review journal before we commit to the idea that there is no such thing as chemical interference.--<a href="../../../t/z/n/User%7ETznkai_3625.html" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> 17:47, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<p>As I noted in my objection to <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_imbalance_theory.html" title="Chemical imbalance theory">Chemical imbalance theory</a>, that term is not widley used inthe mainstream, and is likley inherently POV. Furthermore, Ombudsman's edits are more confusing than neutral in using the word "symptoms". besides, when we say "treat a cold" or treat any medicine, we often "treat" it by neutralizing the symptoms.</p>
<p>Part two of edit was to remove all of the see also so we can come to a consensus on what should be there and what should not. See Alsos should be relevant to the reader, not POV forks. list of famous people I see. Auditory Processing Disorder, I do not. Learning disabilities should be on there. Chemical Imbalnce Theory is again, a neoglism. Holonomic brain theory gives me 230 hits on a google search as a term, just under 3000 for an all search, I may be flagging it as totally disputed as well, I will have to look. The rest seem to not be relevant, but again, links to a wider dispute. going on.

<p>Objection to the statement about milk addiction was raised but was swamped by controversy over editing procedure. Let's remove the statement in 5 days along with its accompanying vauge allusions to unspecified researchers if no one can provide valid citations. The concept of addiction to milk is incompatible with mainstream definitions of addiction, but may be exploited by irresponsible popular news media. As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia should cleave to a higher intellectual standard and not allow its notion of addiction to become excessively diffuse. The article should be a guide to generally accepted and substantiated knowledge, not an alarmist polemic or a playground for speculation. <a href="../../../m/p/u/User%7EMpulier_5afc.html" title="User:Mpulier">Myron</a> 30 June 2005 15:58 (UTC)</p>

<p>" Omega-3 fatty acid supplements have been shown to dramatically improve concentration skills, and in particular reading, as well as decrease ADHD behaviors (Richardson, et.al, 2005, Oxford-Durham Study, Pediatrics" This was added in, and I have not checked the information myself, so I have no preference. the paragraph as a whole follows:</p>
<p>Nutritional data has been well summarized in a review article (Burgess et al., 2000, Am J Clin Nutr 71:327-330). Children with ADHD have lower levels of key fatty acids. In fact, one study found that the lower the levels, the worse the symptoms. The possibility that fatty acid deficiency is a trigger for ADHD is especially plausible as nutrition scientists have recently demonstrated that the American diet is extremely deficient in omega-3 fatty acids. At the same time, ADHD diagnoses are rapidly increasing. More support for this idea comes from findings that breast-fed children have much lower levels of ADHD, and that until quite recently, infant formula contained NO omega-3 fatty acids. These findings are only <a href="../../../c/o/r/Correlation.html" title="Correlation">correlational</a>, and do not prove a conclusive connection.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have RV'd this claim because it would suggest self contradictory messages. Someone who knows more than I about O-3 acids should handle this</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Evidence is skimpy because omega-3 is not a patented drug, but many ADHD researchers and professionals are inclined to support the likelihood that Omega-3 helps. Some believe that it is most likely that it improves cognitive functioning generally. Others believe that it only works for those that have specific deficiencies not detected in the more routine kinds of deficiency tests. Should we try to get an expert involved here.

I use "average psychotherapy" because there was no differentiation among the techniques used in the MTA. A later analysis of the data found that behavior modification techniques were the only psychotherapies that could be shown to be effective.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Improving the Impact of Stimulant Use for the ADD/ADHD Diagnosed</span></h3>
<p>Some adults are finding better results from stimulant based medications when they are used for certain tasks, rather than taken regularly. While stimulants increase focus and productivity, they may also impede vocal communication and creativity. Therefore, it is suggested to try and experiment to find the most beneficial way of utilizing these drugs. Experimentation should include trying the various stimulant based drugs to see which have the best results for a given individual. Additionally, some individuals find more positive results from a lower dosage than one based solely on their weight. In worse case scenarios, some individuals are over medicated and fail to truly benefit from a well rounded therapy. Finally, encouraging the patient by giving them more control over their use of stimulants can sometimes be very effective in helping them cope with their symptoms. This approach demands much more time and patience from the psychiatrist or therapist and is more costly in the short term. However, when stimulants are used judiciously, in conjunction with diet, exercise and the cultivation of cognitive skills, the patient will ultimately experience a higher quality of life through maintaining both creativity and enjoying better focus control.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Industrialization and Mass Education</span></h3>
<p>Perhaps ADD/ADHD is not a disorder at all. Perhaps it is a reflection on the failures of mass education, an evolutionary new kid on the block. Public education in the West has only been around at best since the 1800s. Prior to that time children of the elite had access to book learning and tutors. After all, it was Benjamin Franklin (supposedly another ADHD "sufferer") who introduced the concept of the public library. The mass majority of children either helped work in an agrarian setting and or served as indentured servants, where they enjoyed much more personalized developmental attention and guidance from either their families or their masters.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just speculation, as far as I can see. I was about to say that the only part in it that seems to be other than pure speculation is the hunter/farmer theory, but it's not even about the agrarian lifestyle being especially well- or ill-suited for the ADHD person, it's the idea that mass education failed. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 14:53, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>“They concluded that the brains of ADHD subjects were 10% smaller than those of normals, and claimed this as proof that ADHD is a brain disease. What Swanson failed to acknowledge was the fact that virtually all of the ADHD subjects had been on long-term Ritalin treatment, and that this….was the likely cause of brain smallness. Swanson did acknowledge this fact, immediately thereafter, when I made the point from the audience. Castellanos acknowledged, in an interview published in the January 2000, Reader’s Digest that ‘Incontrovertible evidence (that ADHD is a disease) is still lacking,” and also that “these smaller areas of the brain could be the result of stimulant treatment.” Dr. Fred Baughman Pediatric Neurologist in response to the review of brain scans by a Dr. Swanson and Dr. Xavier Castellanos of the National Institute of Mental Health</p>

<dd>The inclusion of this picture seems to be reflective of a certain quickness-on-the-draw in this article with respect to claims about the etiology, prevalance, and treatment of ADHD.

Furthermore, shouldn't we distinguish between claims that have some level of acceptance and those that have not won any significant support ?

<dd>I'm not too familiar with overseas qualifications, but I'd suggest that your "psychologist" is possibly not. Or at least their MA may be in psychology, but you usually need a professional qualification ("clinical psychology") rather than being a "therapist". From what I understand, in the US, this tends to be a minimum PsyD or Phd <a href="http://www.socialpsychology.org/clinrank.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.socialpsychology.org/clinrank.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. That's not to say that I think people with that qualification are at all better, just that psychologist is a fairly ambiguous term.</dd>
<dd>I'd imagine that a BALSW is a Bachelor of A.L. S(ocial) W(elfare). No idea about the A.L. though. CPSTP is Community Psychiatric Supportive Treatment Professional.<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 01:47, 13 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h4><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../c/a/f/Caffeine.html" title="Caffeine">Caffeine</a></span></h4>
<p>Though not an official mainstream treatment, the ubiquitous use of caffeine means that it is probably one of the most frequently used, unofficial treatments for ADHD. Caffeine is found in coffee, tea and cola soft drinks. Many students and adults will self-medicate with caffeine. Signs that one is self-medicating would be the observation that one's focus improves with the stimulant, and that one cannot function as well without it. Users often report that drinking caffeine in the evening does not impair their sleep, and that in fact, it may help soothe and relax them, thus helping them sleep better. Drinking only 1-2 cups daily is probably not self-medication, but someone who needs over 5 cups daily throughout the day in order to stay awake and focus may possibly be self-medicating.</p>

<p>Kratom is a plant which produces a stimulant-type effect in lower doses. Little research has been done on the relation between ADHD and kratom, however it has been used for centuries in Thailand to help motivate laborers. In low doses, it increases awareness, and concentration, allowing someone to sustain work habits. As the dose increases, it can cause <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euphoria.html" title="Euphoria">euphoria</a>, which makes long tasks more enjoyable, which suggests that kratom may be an effective method to help treat ADHD.</p>

<dd>Here's my take on it: The <i>results</i> that are purportedly achieved from the uses of these substances are unreferenced. However, I think the fact that individuals <i>try</i> to self-medicate with these substances (caffeine and nicotine, at least) is fairly undeniable and does not require references. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:15, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't have references at the moment, but it <b>is</b> pretty much common knowledge that many undiagnosed (and, for that matter, diagnosed) people with ADHD often <b>self</b>-medicate with nonprescription stimulants. This includes caffeine and also cocaine for more <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisocial_personality_disorder.html" title="Antisocial personality disorder">antisocial</a> people with ADHD.

<dd>Not likely, given the context. For people who are <i>diagnosed</i> with the disorder, sure, it's a plausible (if hard to falsify) theory that it's only a placebo effect. But the essence of the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placebo_effect.html" title="Placebo effect">placebo effect</a> requires that you <i>expect</i> a certain effect -- why would people who haven't even articulated that they have a medical problem generate a false medicalized belief that a certain substance would and does help them with this problem?

<dd>I'm not too clear on the "context", but people self-medicate because they perceive a problem, in which case a placebo effect is clearly plausible. The definition of "medicate" is to attempt to treat or cure something. So if they haven't articulated that they have, or that they perceive they have, a medical problem, then by definition they can't be self-medicating. You are suggesting that people who are unaware they have a problem could be taking something that relieves their symptoms, however, that doesn't fit with a definition of self-medication. For example, eating steak is only "self-medication" if you believe that you have, or you actually have, an iron deficiency. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 00:19, 25 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, it appears we're differing on the definition of "self-medication", then. To my mind, if someone says "Man, I can never wake up in the mornings. Why don't I have some coffee? That should clear my head" they are self-medicating: they are perceiving a problem, and they are choosing a chemical substance to apply to treat the problem. You are suggesting that it does not count as self-medication unless they are perceiving the state they are trying to treat as specifically a <i>medical</i> problem. For some conditions, this distinction is not significant, but for ADD it is highly significant, since most undiagnosed ADD sufferers are <b>quite</b> aware of a problematic state but the possibility that it's a medical problem (rather than a fault in their character or upbringing) is highly likely never to have occurred or been presented to them.</dd>

<dd>I entirely agree that. However, the effect of the cup of coffee can be decompose into two distinct effects that may or may not occur. The first is that the stimulant properties of the caffeine may wake them, the second is that the expectation of the coffee waking them up may make them feel more awake above and beyond the effect of the stimulant. Thus, just because a substance may have an actual measurable effect doesn't preclude it from having a placebo effect. That is, people who have ADHD diagnosed and medication prescribed can have not only the physiological effect of the medication, but a placebo effect <i>as well</i>. Similarly, people who may or not have ADHD and are self-medicating <i>may</i> be benefiting from the properties of the medication, but can also be enjoying the placebo effect, irrespective of whether the substance is having an effect or not. Where ADHD is not diagnosed, I'd suggest that, on balance, the likelihood of the benefit being placebo rather than physiologically driven is higher. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 00:35, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I honestly think you need to step back and rethink this, because frankly your logic is a bit labyrinthine. You seem to be arguing that if it <i>could be</i> placebo effect, it <i>is</i>, and therefore even though we know coffee and nicotine have stimulant effects that someone who <i>knows</i> that they have stimulant effects is more likely to be experiencing placebo effect? Rather than the actual effect we know the substance to have? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 00:10, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I couldn't agree less. You are fundamentally misunderstanding scientific criticism. Finding a plausible alternative explantation does not make the alternative explanation true, but creates reasonable doubt over the proposed explanation. It is the entire point of including a placebo condition in experimental studies, and the reason why in correlation research it is extremely important to control for as many other factors as possible, because there is always the possibility of a confound or third variable causing the observed effect.</dd>

<dd>Further, without specific reference to caffeine, the logic seems very bunk. Most people I know find coffee has a focussing effect; whereas the point of the paradoxical effect of amphetamine on ADHD is that only people who have ADHD find it stimulating. Thus, without some science behind it, it seems *very* like original research. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 09:29, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I am aware of this; contrary to your assertion, I am quite familiar with the scientific method. You are <i>correct</i> that where the possibility of a placebo effect has not been controlled for through double-blind studies, the possibility remains that the effects observed are placebo effects to some degree. Please tell me where your assertion comes from that they are <i>more likely</i> to be placebo effects in this particular context?</dd>

<dd>Furthermore, your facts are also lacking. I assume your assertion above was meant to be not "only people who have ADHD find [a known stimulant] stimulating", but "only people who have ADHD find it <i>focusing</i>". As logical as this hypothesis is, it is not the case; experiments have demonstrated that, contrary to the expectations of researchers, children who <i>did not</i> have ADHD who were given Ritalin <i>also</i> experienced a focusing effect. They did not experience it to the same degree as the children diagnosed with ADHD, but they still experienced it.</dd>

You are arguing "we cannot be scientifically sure that these substances have the effect their adherents believe and perceive them to have; therefore we should not mention it in the article." This dodges the question that has been posed to you before: if great numbers of people <i>attempt</i> to self-medicate with these substances, is that not a fact worthy of note <i>whether or not</i> they are actually receiving any benefit? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:33, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>You are arguing "we cannot be scientifically sure that these substances have the effect their adherents believe and perceive them to have; therefore we should not mention it in the article."</i></dd>
<dd>That's your faulty inference. It has never been my position, stated or implied, that this material does not belong in the article. What I do question, with this material, and any self-treatment or self-medication, is whether any subjectively observed improvement is a placebo effect.</dd>
<dd>In a population of diagnosed and medicated ADHD sufferers, there will be a proportion who are misdiagnosed. Of this proportion, some smaller group are likely, nevertheless, to perceive improvement via the placebo effect. In a population of non-diagnosed people who think that they have ADHD or a related problem, and choose to medicate, there is an extremely high likelihood that the proportion of people who do no have ADHD is higher. Of this larger group, it is similarly likely that a similar or larer proportion will also perceive improvement via a placebo effect. Hence, I'd argue the placebo effect is <i>more likely</i>.</dd>
<dd>Another way of slicing and dicing this kind of phenomena is to take a behaviourist perspective. That is, a person carrying out any form of treatment (whether it be bed-rest, taking some medication, acupuncture, or whatever), and on seeing an improvement, attributes the result to the treatment, and following reinforcement contingencies, is likely to follow the same pattern again, regardless of whether the treatment played any causal role at all.</dd>
<dd>This rather neatly underlines why many drugs, such as antibiotics are prescription medicines. That is, if antibiotics were freely available, many people would automatically take them the moment that they got sick. The majority of these people would get better (even if they had a cold or flu, on which the antibiotics have no effect), and would thus be likely to take antibiotics again in the future when they were sick. Antibiotics clearly work in a proportion of these cases, but the proportion of actual effect is higher in a group where those with likely viral infections had been ruled out.</dd>
<dd>You can apply the same logic to a treatment that does not work at all, and a good proportion of people would still perceive that it did work, and would follow that treatment again in the future. Some would argue that alternative medicine fits here. Also, depending on the outcome of efficacy trials, some stimulants and ADHD might fit here. <i>Stimulant</i> is, after all, a very loose category, similar to <i>Anti-Depressant</i>. That is, a stimulant is classified on the basis of effect, not mechanism. Amphetamine, methylphenidate, caffeine, and cocaine, all <i>stimulants</i> have differing methods of action, with sufficient similarities to be classified together. However, just because some are effective on ADHD does not mean the rest will be (some of them are excellent decongestants, some are not; this is also related to their stimulant properties).</dd>
<dd>My original point was that such self-medication could just be a placebo effect. Perhaps I should have qualified that to include the contingency argument that I have just outline. Effectively, what I want to register is that self-medication should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 00:07, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No problem. I think your 'robust' style of debate borders on gladiatorial at times, and certainly primed me. It's possible that some of this critique should make its way to the self-medication stub. On balance, I think its worth mentioning them, but unless there is some evidence that they are actually effective (and some of them may be), it should be a brief mention. The caffeine one in particular is problematic. It almost imples that everyone who finds coffee focussing is moving toward the ADHD end of the spectrum. As a style of argument, it also relies mostly on an appeal to the reader's subjective experience for its validity. Stimulants are usually calming as well as focussing for ADHD individuals, and I don't think that fits as neatly with people's subjective experience. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 23:47, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There is a tiny modicum of truth that can be found in this claim. Namely, just because two phenomena are observed together does not automatically mean they are cause and effect, and even though glucose is known to be just about <i>the</i> most heavily used biological fuel and the region that shows chronic underactivity in ADHD sufferers is the same region that people who show ADHD-like symptoms after physical brain injury were usually injured in and the symptoms of ADHD are completely consistent with the idea that that region of the brain is not able to use its fuel most effectively -- yes, until the mechanisms of ADHD are <i>completely</i> understood, those other theories remain <i>possibilities</i>. However, they are pure speculation -- it is in fact a mistake to call them "theories", as "theory" falsely suggests that some explanation has been proposed as to <i>how</i> "superior self-direction" would be signalled by low levels of glucose.</p>
<p>This is getting ridiculous. Many of the imaging techniques use glucose consumption as a means of demonstrating that a particular part of the brain is active (a lot of glucose) or not active. There is nothing else involved here. Nothing implied about glucose consumption. The real issue is why a part of the brain is getting active in normal people and not ADHD people when given an assigned task. If the ADHD person is not trying very hard (or not at all) at an assigned task the part of the brain that uses more glucose when doing the task will not use the glucose. This does not imply the problem is necessarily biological simply that the person with ADHD wasn't doing the assigned task, for whatever reason. But we already knew they weren't doing the task so measuring glucose consumption gives a false impression of biological association or "causality"</p>
<p>What this really is is an attempt to pretend that all theories and hypotheses which have not been proven to the satisfaction of the most heavily partisan skeptic are somehow on par, just like when an editor placed into the article the irrelevant crowing (copied, I think, from a Scientology press release) that when the president of the APA "conceded" that there is not a "clean-cut lab test" for ADHD, it was immediately translated as 'there is no test to determine whether a person suffers from a "chemical imbalance"' (a significant over-extrapolation) and "seen as a victory" by Scientology, which believes in the "<a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenu.html" title="Xenu">ghosts of space aliens killed by the Galactic Emperor</a>" theory. This is the same logic: 'If I don't like theory A, I just have to keep harping on the fact that theory A isn't <i>completely 100% proven</i> and keep mentioning alternate hypotheses B and C, even if they happen to be 0% proven.' Accordingly, I am removing this sentence. If someone chooses to find a way to express the tiny modicum of truth it contained, that's fine. But in its current state, it is deceptive spin. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 15:53, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Reducing Size of ADHD article</span></h2>
<p>If the ADHD article is too long by wikipedia standards, how can we reduce to a more appropriate size ? Consider the following attacks on the problem:</p>
<p>1. Make ADHD article solely about the DSM diagnosis (U.S. only ?) and its history (including controversy), etiology, prevalence, and treatment. This should include only material relevant for both adults and children and some brief discussion of the relationship between adult and childhood ADHD.</p>
<p>2. Make a separate article about "Attention Deficit" or "Attention Deficit Syndrome" ("ADS") with material about current research that does not fit in other articles. [Query: does this kind of material belong in an encyclopedia at all ?] Also references to general research on attention. This article would be free of nation-specific or other purely geographic material, except by way of discussing comparisons of national approaches explicitly.</p>
<p>3. Make new article on "ADHD in Children". This could include references to psychological therapies and approaches used most often for children, for example, behavior modification. Also material on parenting and teaching.</p>
<p>4. Edit "Adult ADD" to parallel "ADHD in Children" as much as possible. Should include references to psychological therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and self-modification/self-management approaches.</p>
<p>5. Make separate short article on hyperkinetic disorder and explain difference from DSM ADHD there or in article referred to in 2. above.</p>
<p><br />
Include only consensus material in bulk of article (NO one-study material). Try to use current cognitive-science and psychology survey articles as sources to introduce judgement of those familiar with the full range of scientific literature into Wikipedia articles.</p>
<p>As I see it this would mean:</p>
<p>1. Moving all but a stub of the Testing section to "ADS", because it is not integral to the ADHD diagnosis.</p>
<p>2. Moving almost all of the Causes section except a stub to "ADS".</p>
<p>3. Shortening the Treatment section on medications, adding a stub on psychotherapy, retaining a stub on alternative treatments. Moving most of existing alternative treatments to "ADS".</p>
<p>4. Move Parenting to ADD in Children article.</p>
<p>5. Move all of Evidence for ADHD as an organic phenomenon section to "ADS".</p>
<p>6. Move Positive Aspects section to "ADS".</p>
<p>7. Move "hunter vs. farmer" to "ADS"</p>
<p>8. Move all of history section, except a stub, to "ADS"</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Are experts needed for this article ?</span></h2>
<p>Because I have an ADHD diagnosis, I am very interested in this article. For the same reason, I have read fairly widely in the popular literature in the field and made myself familiar with some tiny part of the scientific literature related to ADHD. This does not make me an expert. I have suggested possible directions for improving all the articles related to ADHD.</p>
<p>I really believe that we need to try to recruit some true experts to help with this article. I know of two names of people who have done serious reviews of alternative therapies for ADHD. There are clinical and cognitive-science researchers who have some perspective on the field whom we might me able to get involved. I am loathe to approach the advocacy organizations (ADDA, CHADD) for help because we may end up rendering ourselves open for propagandizing.</p>
<p>The ideal experts would have some breadth in the area. Michael I. Posner (Oregon), Swanson (UCI), Castellanos (NYU) are research leaders. Thomas Brown (Yale) has recently (2005) published a sophisticated semi-popular in the field that cites widely in ADHD research.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on including experts, whether and how ? Any specific names ? Any personal contacts with appropriate experts. DCDuring 12 Oct 2005</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder" solely defined by APA's DSM</span></h2>
<p>This is an amplification of a point I made previously. In particular it makes the arguement that the only unambiguous meaning of "ADHD" is the term defined by the American Psychiatric Association in the DSM-IV-TR. It is inherently limited in geographic/cultural scope to those nations/cultures that follow the APA. I don't know what kind of table or other data presentation we could devise to reflect national or other differences.</p>
<p>This is NOT to say that Wikipedia shouldn't provide some kind of coverage to the related and probably broader phenomena of "attention-deficit syndrome" (for lack of a better term) and "executive function deficit". A disambiguation page for "attention deficit" could steer people to the Wiktionary for "attention deficit" in the popular sense, to "ADHD", and to some broader discussion of "attention-deficit syndrome" (possibly in some article on attention), as well as to any articles focusing on ADHD in children or ADHD in adults.</p>
<p>Giving the term "hyperkinetic disorder" prominence seems to me to be a step backward, re-emphasizing the hyperactivity symptoms at the expense of the inattentiveness symptoms. The discussion of hyperkinetic disorder is useful principally to medical statisticians interested in making international comparisons.</p>
<p>Although it bothers my sense of order and logic, a case could be made for separate articles on "ADHD in Children" and "ADHD in Adults". The 'psychosocial' therapies used differ greatly and various other facets are different. Perhaps it will turn out that only some of the main ADHD symptoms can really be said to continue into adulthood (hyperactivity is clearly less prevalent). Maybe childhood ADHD is a combination of three underlying disorders and adult ADHD is a combination of only two underlying disorders. The parallel might be with diabetes, where juvenile-onset and adult-onset diabetes are significantly different.</p>
<p>ADHD, as the APA uses it, does not correspond in meaning to the popular use of the term attention-deficit, which, although certainly derived from the psychologists' jargon, is not identical in meaning to any vintage of any APA-defined term.</p>
<p>ADHD, as the APA uses it, does not encompass all those who may have attention-deficit symptoms, because it excludes virtually all cases where some other disorder that could cause those symptoms appears to be present because of other diagnostic criteria.</p>
<p>The realities of research may drastically affect the relative length and authority of coverage of various aspects of ADHD, overemphasizing hyperactive-type ADHD and ADHD in children. Research scientists investigating ADHD have concentrated on ADHD-HI because there is less ambiguity about the diagnosis and doing so reduces controversy which could jeopardize research funding and diminish the value of the completed research.</p>
<p>Research concentrates on children partially because of funding and partially because the subjects present fewer complications to researchers. Maybe this is because children's brains are less individualized. Experiences mold brain circuits. The more experiences, the more individuality, the harder it may be to make generalizations. 03:21, 14 October 2005 (UTC)DCDuring</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Methylphenidate (ritalin) and Scuba Diving?</span></h2>
<p>Hi there</p>
<p>I am a 29 year old guy who was first diagnosed with ADHD when i was 6 and still in South Africa (Durban). When i moved to Switzerland though, the Doctor didn't know anything about this dissorder and thought that my mother was insane talking about POS (as it was called way back then).</p>
<p>well a couple of months ago i finally got a new test done and am now in medical treatment with Methylphenidate (Ritalin) which seems to be working fine. not that i notice much myself, but more that the other people around me notice differences (to the better).</p>
<p>well thats enough of me, now to my actuall questions...</p>
<p><br />
Last week during a vacation on the island of mallorca, i wanted to do a Scuba diving course, and for this i needed to fill out a question form (about fitness, medications and so forth) which they always do to start of with. there were approx 20 or 30 questions there and if even 1 of them was answered with a "yes" one would have to go to the doctor and to a routine checkup (which is rather expensive out there). Well even though i got put on Ritalin just 2 weeks beforehand i still filled out the form with a "no" to the question: "do you regulary take medicine and/or drugs". actually just to save costs...</p>
<p>During the four days i did the course, i felt fine and had no problems on the theory test (40 questions - with only 4 of 10 allowed false answers) the diving itself was also not a big problem, exept for the third day.....which i messed up a bit.</p>
<p>We went out on the boat to a nice reef where i then had a small "panic attack" in the morning and broke off the dive after 15 minutes....and in the afternoon the same happened (probably a side effect from the first one in the morning). The Next day (and also last day of course) however everything was fine again, and i also passed the practical part of the test.</p>
<p>Funny though that i can't find anything in the web about Ritalin (Methylphenidate) whilest scuba diving, exept about teenagers which are advised to leave scuba diving completely. (which is not my intention - but i'm no teenager anymore)</p>
<p>Ok, Diving has a lot of "multitasking" and you have to keep concetrated a lot (deco, airammount and so forth) which is a bit harsh on a ads/adhd patient, but then on the other hand, it is so much fun and the ritalin actually helps</p>
<p>Does anyone else with ADS/ADHD dive? what sideeffects can come along?...</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">ADHD and genetics</span></h2>
<p>The section seems to miss the extensive twin studies and adoption studies which clearly show a strong link between genetics and ADHD.</p>
<p>From Barkley: "Adoption Research. <a href="http://www.continuingedcourses.net/active/courses/course003.php" class="external free" title="http://www.continuingedcourses.net/active/courses/course003.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.continuingedcourses.net/active/courses/course003.php</a></p>
<p>Another line of evidence for genetic involvement in ADHD has emerged from studies of adopted children. Cantwell (1975) and Morrison and Stewart (1973) both reported higher rates of hyperactivity in the biological parents of hyperactive children than in adoptive parents having such children. Both studies suggest that hyperactive children are more likely to resemble their biological parents than their adoptive parents in their levels of hyperactivity. Yet, both studies were retrospective and both failed to study the biological parents of the adopted hyperactive children as a comparison group (Pauls, 1991). Cadoret and Stewart (1991) studied 283 male adoptees and found that if one of the biological parents had been judged delinquent or to have an adult criminal conviction, the adopted away sons had a higher likelihood of having ADHD. A later study (van den Oord, Boomsma, &amp; Verhulst, 1994) using biologically related and unrelated pairs of international adoptees identified a strong genetic component (47 percent of the variance) for the Attention Problems dimension of the Child Behavior Checklist, a rating scale commonly used in research on ADHD. More recently, a comparison of the families of adopted ADHD children to those living with their biological parents and to a control group also showed the same pattern of an elevated prevalence of ADHD among just the biological parents of the ADHD children (6% vs. 18% vs. 3% respectively) (Sprich, Biederman, Crawford, Mundy, &amp; Faraone, 2000). Thus, like the family association studies discussed earlier, results of adoption studies point to a strong possibility of a significant hereditary contribution to hyperactivity. Twin Studies.</p>
<p>Since the last edition of this text, the number of twin studies of ADHD and its underlying behavioral dimensions has increased markedly. More exciting has been the striking consistency across all of these studies. This research strategy provides a third avenue of evidence for a genetic contribution to ADHD. But it also provides a means of testing any competing environmental theories of the disorder (e.g., that ADHD is due to poor parenting, adverse family life, excessive TV viewing, etc.). That is because twin studies can not only compute the proportion of variance in a trait that is genetically influenced (heritability), but also the proportion that results from common or shared environment (things twins and siblings have in common growing up in the same family) and that which results from unique environment (all non-genetic factors or events that are unique or specific to one child and not to others in the family) (Plomin, Defries, McClearn, &amp; Rutter, 1997).</p>
<p>Early research on ADHD using twins looked only at twin concordance (likelihood of twins sharing the same disorder) and did not compute these estimates of heritability, shared, and unique environment. These early studies demonstrated a greater agreement (concordance) for symptoms of hyperactivity and inattention between monozygotic (MZ) compared to dizygotic twins (DZ) (O'Connor, Foch, Sherry, &amp; Plomin, 1980; Willerman, 1973). Studies of very small samples of twins (Heffron, Martin, &amp; Welsh, 1984; Lopez, 1965) found complete (100%) concordance for MZ twins for hyperactivity and far less agreement for DZ twins. For instance, Gilger, Pennington, and DeFries (1992) found that if one twin was diagnosed as ADHD, the concordance for the disorder was 81 percent in MZ twins and 29 percent in DZ twins. Sherman, McGue, and Iacono (1997) found that the concordance for MZ twins having ADHD (mother identified) was 67 percent versus 0 percent for DZ twins.</p>
<p>Later research has computed heritability and environmental contributions to ADHD. One such study of a large sample of twins (570) found that approximately 50 percent of the variance in hyperactivity and inattention in this sample was due to heredity while 0-30 percent may have been environmental (Goodman &amp; Stevenson, 1989). The relatively limited number of items assessing these two behavioral dimensions, however, may have reduced the sensitivity of the study to genetic effects. Later and even larger twin studies have found an even higher degree of heritability for ADHD, ranging from .75 to .97 (see Levy &amp; Hay, 2001; Thapar, 1999 for reviews) (Burt, Krueger, McGue, Iacono, 2001; Coolidge et al., 2001; Gjone, Stevenson, &amp; Sundet, 1996; Gjone, Stevenson, Sundet, &amp; Eilertsen, 1996; Hudziak, 1997; Levy, Hay, McStephen, Wood, &amp; Waldman, 1997; Rhee, Waldman, Hay, &amp; Levy, 1995; Sherman, Iacono, &amp; McGue, 1997; Sherman, McGue, &amp; Iacono, 1997; Silberg et al., 1996; Thapar, Harrington, &amp; McGuffin, 2001; Thapar, Hervas, &amp; McGuffin, 1995; van den Oord, Verhulst, &amp; Boomsma, 1996). Thus, twin studies indicate that the average heritability of ADHD is at least 0.80, being nearly that for human height (.80-.91) and higher than that found for intelligence (.55-.70). These studies consistently find little, if any, effect of shared (rearing) environment on the traits of ADHD while sometimes finding a small significant contribution for unique environmental events. In their totality, shared environmental factors seem to account for 0-6 percent of individual differences in the behavioral trait(s) related to ADHD. It is for this reason that I stated at the opening of this section that little attention would be given here to discussing purely environmental or social factors as involved in the causation of ADHD.</p>
<p>The twin studies cited above have also been able to indicate the extent to which individual differences in ADHD symptoms are the result of nonshared environmental factors. Such factors not only include those typically thought of as involving the social environment, but also all biological factors that are nongenetic in origin. Factors in the nonshared environment are those events or conditions that will have uniquely affected only one twin and not the other. Besides biological hazards or neurologically injurious events that may have befallen only one member of a twin pair, the nonshared environment also includes those differences in the manner in which parents may have treated each child. Parents do not interact with all of their children in an identical fashion and such unique parent-child interactions are believed to make more of a contribution to individual differences among siblings than do those factors about the home and child-rearing that are common to all children in the family. Twin studies to date have suggested that approximately 9-20 percent of the variance in hyperactive-impulsive-inattentive behavior or ADHD symptoms can be attributed to such nonshared environmental (nongenetic) factors (Levy et al., 1997; Sherman, Iacono et al., 1997; Silberg et al., 1996). A portion of this variance, however, must be attributed to the error of the measure used to assess the symptoms. Research suggests that the nonshared environmental factors also contribute disproportionately more to individual differences in other forms of child psychopathology than do factors in the shared environment (Pike &amp; Plomin, 1996). Thus, if researchers were interested in identifying environmental contributors to ADHD, these studies suggest that such research should focus on those biological and social experiences that are specific and unique to the individual and are not part of the common environment to which other siblings have been exposed".</p>

<p>In case I might be accused of having an ax to grind, well, sure I do. I was personally 'diagnosed' with ADD as a child and drugged for it, without my consent and without being informed of the purpose of the medication, as I suspect are most children drugged for having the same attributes. This I think is the most deplorable aspect of the practice. We tell children, 'Say no to drugs', and 'Don't take candy from strangers'. Then we drug them but we don't tell then what for or we expect them just to trust the doctor because of his authority. Well don't act so surprised that children try to rebel, when we give them such conflicting signals! Fortunately for me, Ritalin caused me physical side effects, internal bleeding from a low platelette level, so I was quickly taken off the drug and never given another drug for my 'disorder.' <a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOneismany_293f.html" title="User talk:Oneismany">oneismany</a> 14:48, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I was never told what my 'disorder' was, but I gather from this article that it was inattentiveness or impulsiveness. Let me ask the medical professionals who authored this article, have you tried sitting in a classroom recently? Well I have, and let me tell you that sitting in front of a bad teacher while she expects me to shut up and take notes is very frustrating. I was probably inattentive to her, but who cares? She was impatient and she didn't explain herself very well. I am just lucky that I am 30 and I take classes to satisfy my curiosity, so I could drop that class; whereas poor little children, who ought to be outdoors acting on their curiosity, are instead forced to take classes whether they like it or not, and probably not for their information but just to keep them indoors. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOneismany_293f.html" title="User talk:Oneismany">oneismany</a> 14:48, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I guess that the big deal about my attitude was that I like to day dream. But I am proud of daydreaming and I am proud that I am still able to do it as an adult, despite decades of being stigmatized for it. Sure, sometimes it is distracting. Distracting to other people, but not to me. I pay a lot of attention to my daydreams; I do math and I compose essays, like this one, in my daydreams. I gather that many people do not, for one reason or another, but I would say that these people have a deficit of attention to daydreams and I have a healthy attention to them. My first reaction to finding out that this was supposed to be a disorder was 'What's wrong with it?' Clearly daydreaming in class is considered a lack of attention to teachers, but maybe the classroom dynamic or the teacher's attitude is disorderly and the active imagination of a child is simply natural. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOneismany_293f.html" title="User talk:Oneismany">oneismany</a> 14:48, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let me ask, do we consider red hair to be 'Red Hair Disorder', left-handedness to be 'Left-Handedness Disorder', or homosexuality 'Homosexuality Disorder'? Oh wait, sometimes we do and each of these things in the past has been the subject of stigma and bullying in school, not to mention medication and over-concern by adults. But clearly it would be <b>POV</b> to discuss these subjects under those titles on Wikipedia; and I submit that discussing the traits known as ADHD under the title of 'disorder' is equally <b>POV</b> not to mention patronizing, and perpetuating a stereotype, and perpetuating the ignorance of the capitalist motivation for classifying a whole type of people as needing pharmaceuticals. If daydreaming was natural and not a disorder, we might deal with the distraction aspect of it without using drugs, and then how would psychiatrists make so much money? <a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOneismany_293f.html" title="User talk:Oneismany">oneismany</a> 14:48, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The commercials on TV for medication for adult ADD are particularly patronizing. Am I to take drugs for having an active imagination? No doubt my mental characteristics are often regarded as an aberration by people around me, as they were was when I was a child, but I refuse to be shamed by that or forced to take drugs for that. What psychiatrists regard as a 'disorder' I consider an asset. Without my propensity for daydreaming I would not be able to think analytically; nor would I have been able to train my left hand to mimic my right hand for the purpose of learning to juggle. Something should be said in this article about the positive uses for mental attributes that are maligned by society. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOneismany_293f.html" title="User talk:Oneismany">oneismany</a> 14:48, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>For you 'ADHD' people out there, try learning to <a href="../../../j/u/g/Juggle.html" title="Juggle">juggle</a>. Or try learning something else that stimulates your neurons. Parents, try teaching your 'ADHD' kids to juggle or play the piano or something that engages their energy, anything but drugging them. And get them off refined sugar! It's no coincidence that both ADHD and the amount of sugar in our diets has increased at the same time! If you don't believe there is a connection, try this: remove all the sugar from your diet for a long period of time, and then try drinking soda, or eating candy, and see if you don't exhibit 'inattentiveness' or 'impulsiveness.' <a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOneismany_293f.html" title="User talk:Oneismany">oneismany</a> 14:48, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>On Wikipedia, ADHD should be presented as what it is, a diagnosis that may or may not reflect a factual account of mental attributes. The mental attributes in question should be given an <b>NPOV</b> description, and 'ADHD' should be noted as an interpretation of them.

<dd>I agree with many of the points discussed. However, ADHD is currently officially labeled a "disorder" by the medical community. If we feel this is wrong, we need to elaborate about the opposite POV, but only they can change the "wrong" name. Dialog such as this is undoubtedly read by some of the professionals, who may became better enlightened. Were it not for discussion and debate such as this, ADHD would still be considered "brain damage", and homosexuality would still be a mental illness treated with electro-shock therapy.

<dd>Hmm, thanks for the links to neurotypicals, etc. Earlier I was struggling to think of any npov descriptions for 'the traits formerly known as ADHD'; and the other articles provide many good suggestions, like vigilance, response-readiness, enthusiasm, flexibility, hyperfocus. I think we need to discuss the merits for each of these suggestions, and find some terms that are neutral and some that are positive to balance the negative descriptions of 'inattentive' and 'impulsive.' <a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOneismany_293f.html" title="User talk:Oneismany">oneismany</a> 11:51, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BTW 'disorder' is the correct term for the imagined disease that ADHD describes. ADHD is an interpretation of characteristics, and the definition of this characterization as well as the history of its definition should be preserved for the benefit of future generations. Just as, the knowledge that drugs have been prescribed for it, and stigma attatched to it should be preserved. But the topic should be the characteristics, not a single interpretation of them. Imagine that we were discussing red hair back in the days when red haired babies were equally maligned; or left-handedness, or homosexuality. The history of the people who have these traits, as well as the history of their treatment by society, should be the topic of this article. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOneismany_293f.html" title="User talk:Oneismany">oneismany</a> 11:51, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Like 'hyperactivity' and 'ADD' before it, 'ADHD' must be understood in its historical context, not just the context of its medical definition. What characteristics does it describe? Is it a coherent theory? What are some similar theories and similar treatments for other neurological attributes diagnosed as 'disorders'? It must be understood that the term 'disorder' when applied to mental characteristics is inherently biased. Who is impaired by it, how does it impair them? The analogy of 'disorder' does not always carry over from physical impairments to mental impairments, because mental impairments are often subjective assessments. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOneismany_293f.html" title="User talk:Oneismany">oneismany</a> 11:51, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Most importantly, the language of 'attention deficit' must be examined. Attention to what? To whom? Deficit from what? It would be chauvanistic for me to suggest, for example, that girls have an 'attention deficit' because they don't pay attention to me. 'I wonder how they cope with that. Maybe I ought to prescribe them the date-rape drug to treat their unfortunate disorder.' Well, what are we supposed to be paying attention to that supposedly aren't? What kind of deficit is this, where is it deficient, is there some discrete percentage that can be attached to it? The more you think about the term, the less it makes sense. Not only that, but in this light the 'attention deficit' language appears more and more pathological itself. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOneismany_293f.html" title="User talk:Oneismany">oneismany</a> 11:51, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The problem with a word like "disorder" is the negative connotation. It's actually good to have labels that better define your identity. Gaining an understanding of what makes you different from others can help your self-esteem. You're no longer just weird, stupid or a geek. It's unfortunate, though, that the replacement labels are medical and have to be attached to "disease", "syndrome" and "disorder". One of the worst things that could be done to a child is to have him believe that the way he is, his personality, is a disease. Imagine if Thomas Edison had been told he had a disease of the brain. You want to lift the self-esteem of children, not destroy it. ADHD kids should be told how unique and special they are. They should learn to be proud of who they are, not learn to pity themselves. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 14:56, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>those are not ADHD characteristics. Sure, he was hyperactive, but so are HFA kids.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">ADHD traits do not necessarily constitute a "disorder"</span></h2>
<p>While I generally agree with the sentiments recently expressed taking exception to the negative label of "disorder", I want to stress one aspect for your consideration. The diagnostic criteria for what they now call ADHD as a <i>disorder</i> requires that the symptoms not only be present, but that they are currently causing dysfunction and trouble in two or more life settings. So, if a person with ADHD attributes (aka symptoms) is getting along just fine in life, there is considered to be no <i>disorder</i> under the diagnostic criteria.

<dl>
<dd><i>D. There must be clear evidence of clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That's there in ADHD, Asperger's and I pressume basically all disorders in the DSM. The thing is, there are people with clearly significant impairments in these areas who still don't think of themselves as disordered. (I, for example, have one of those.) These impairments are more often than not either <i>defined</i> to be impairments by others, or <i>caused</i> by others. Let's take autism and social functioning as an example. There are autistics who really don't enjoy socializing and can live happily that way. Since most people do enjoy socializing for the most part, the neurology associated with not enjoying socializing is considered faulty, invalid, broken. That's really not that different to saying that since most people enjoy watching TV, those who don't have TV Deficit Disorder. There are autistics who would like to socialize, but don't do it in the way most people expect, so they fail. Since most people are pretty good at socializing, those who don't have this natural talent are considered to have a broken neurology. This is not that different to saying that those not born with a talent for computer programming have Algorithmic Deficit Disorder. There are autistics who avoid socializing because of mistreatment received in the past when they tried to socialize, not because of something inherent in who they are. In terms of occupational functioning, there are cases of autistics who have been fired from jobs not because of inability to do their job, but because of they way they are, things they say which are not considered appropriate, you get the point. Is that the fault of autism or is it a case of intolerance? <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 12:25, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yeah, I don't always socialize with people very well, but sometimes when I try to socialize I find out that I would rather have not tried. This isn't to say that I don't sometimes feel isolated. But I am a busy person, and I bet that happens to lots of people for lots of different reasons. My personality may indeed be a factor in that, and let's face it there's no point in blaming other people on my own problems. But every personality causes its own problems to an extent, and there's no point in labeling every problem that everybody has a 'disorder.' Now when I was paralyzed from the waist down, that was a disorder. But naming it a 'disorder' didn't help to solve the problem. There is a mentality that naming things a 'disorder' means we understand what it is. But in fact, it doesn't add any new information. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOneismany_293f.html" title="User talk:Oneismany">oneismany</a> 19:36, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, consider this. Suppose an autistic individual found a way to remove all these impairments. For argument's sake, let's say he finds a group of autistic friends he's able to socialize with very well; he finds a job as an independent consultant working from home, a job that requires little human interation; he's quite smart academically and finds an academic setting that accomodates him. Wouldn't it be silly to say that because of this he's no longer autistic? <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 13:48, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok, I had some more thoughts about the discussed contribution (which has been edited slightly meanwhile), BUT still, in my opinion it has to go (and I am not the only one feeling that)</p>
<ul>
<li>The main point of this paragraph seems to be, as 192.250.34.162 nicely put it, <i>"If a low-income family would gain Social Security benefits from claiming to have an ADHD child, that means that THERE MUST BE tons of low-income families malingering for profit by claiming their child has ADHD!"</i> →</li>
</ul>
<p>a) There are no references for it, so it is very likely it is unverified speculation (that’s exactly what it sounds to me)</p>
<p>b) Above all, it is not about possible CAUSES of ADHD. If there were some sources given, one could consider to move it to the section “Incidence”.</p>
<p>(Sorry, I am repeating things that have been already said...Just wanted to get sure before I delete the contribution of others)</p>
<ul>
<li>I also had a look at the Whitehall studies, but could not see any (direct) connection to ADHD. Even if there were such a connection, as I already mentioned, the author’s intention was not to say anything about how low income or social status contribute to physiological and psychological disorders.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, I am going to delete it finally. blackmamba 16:23, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>We should note, <i>in the intro</i>, that there is considerable debate about whether the disorder of Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is, in fact, an actual disorder or a figment of the medical community's imagination. However, we should not <i>endorse</i> this latter view, which is what the article currently does by calling it a "diagnosis", rather than saying it is a disorder whose existence happens to be disputed. It's like writing an article about the Apollo moon landings and calling them "what the United States government claims happened in 1969"; describing them in that fashion is embedding the belief "this isn't something real" directly into the wording, which is not NPOV. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:31, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, it is a diagnosis, which is true. It could also say it is classified as a disorder (<a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism.html" title="Autism">autism</a> article wording).

<dd>Well, "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder' is psychiatric terminology, so the least POV statement that can be made about it is that it is a diagnosis, so I don't see what makes that controversial. Unlike 'hyperactivity,' which is not a term invented for the DSM, the specific phrase of 'ADHD' describes the psychiatric diagnosis. Merely asserting that should not imply that the disorder exists or does not exist. But perhaps NPOV language implies that the subject is debatable, which mainstream psychiatry disagrees with. It can't be helped, however, if describing a subject by NPOV language has results which confict with official POV. Although the phrase 'ADHD is a diagnosis' may be avoidable in the intro, I think it is perfectly NPOV, plus it scans well, whereas the current intro still sounds awkward. Perhaps a better intro would be "Attention-deficit hyerpactivity disorder is a psychiatric diagnosis which interprets hyperactivity, forgetfulness, mood shifts, poor impulse control, and distractibility as symptoms of a neurological disorder." That would avoid the clunky introduction of neurodiversity right there in the first sentence.

<dd>According to the AADD article, "In 1987, ADD was in effect renamed to ADHD in the DSM-III-R." It seems the origin of this term as tool of psychiatry is well documented. In contrast, "hyperactivity" can be found describing "acute mania" as early as the late 1800's according to the OED. The intent of psychiatry in contstructing this term should not be underemphasized. Current psychiatric terms are very specific and even may be called jargon, and may not correspond to more general terms from outside psychiatry, whether or not the disorders are regarded as biological, neurological, socially constructed, or whatever. Merely noting that 'attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder' is a psychiatric diagnosis is not POV. So, I am changing the intro again to reflect that. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneismany_9c9b.html" title="User:Oneismany">oneismany</a> 06:48, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">First sentences. Confusing!</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I'm new here, so if I'm doing something wrong, sorry!!</p>
<p>The first few sentences do not make much sense to me. While there is controversy surrounding ADHD, there is a symptom checklist that psychiatrists use to diagnose. Maybe the article should begin by addressing exactly what symptoms a person with ADHD has instead of getting all political with evasive language. For someone who is not familiar with ADHD, the opening is completely baffling: "Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric diagnosis that interprets divergent personality traits perceived to be distracting as symptoms of a mental disorder." What does it mean for a trait to be perceived to be distracting?! Does this mean that people with ADHD distract others? "Characteristics sometimes interpreted as symptoms" Does this mean that different doctors have a different list of symptoms and sometimes one characteristic is interpreted as a symptom and other times not? Can we include an actual list of diagnostic criteria here?</p>
<p>The article is pretty long, but much of it is dedicated to the controversy surrounding medication and the diagnosis, and if someone is looking up ADHD to learn what exactly a person with ADHD suffers from (part of the diagnosis includes that the person actually is suffering), they do not find out much. This is not the case for other psychiatric disorders on Wikipedia, which list clearly what the symptoms include.71.194.155.170 08:14, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, the DSM-IV criteria should definitely be included in the article. BTW, the diagnosis does not include that the person is actually suffering. It simply says that there's "clinically significant impairment" in such and such areas -- this, of course, is subject to interpretation, and hence results in significant differences in prevalence across different regions when it comes to diagnosing "spectrum disorders" such as this. I'm pretty sure most children diagnosed are neither asked whether they are suffering nor are they actually suffering. Maybe the parents are suffering, or maybe the kids are suffering from intolerance by school officials or peers -- but this indirect suffering doesn't count IMHO. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 17:01, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Unfortunately, those who think it doesn't actually exist don't want the view that it <i>does</i> exist to get a fair hearing, so they edited it to the current confusing and needlessly complicated state. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:10, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looks like quite an improvement, ND! It makes a much clearer introduction to the subject. In fact, I think it's a good base for us to clarify and expand slightly the coverage of the non-mainstream views of the subject in the introduction -- distinguish, for instance, between the belief that ADHD is a mistaken diagnosis and the belief that it is actually a hoax.

<dd>The belief that it is a hoax is very "out there". It's basically a conspiracy theory which reflects badly on the rest of the skeptic views. I'm not sure how to address that, as it is notable/citable.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Explanation of social contruct view</span></h2>
<p>How to undermine the social construct view seems unclear. (This is probably uncitable so I'm just putting it here). It may be explained with a thought experiment. Suppose you go to a school and ask children to rate their classmates on a scale of "weirdness". Then you separate the children in two groups: (1) the "weirdest" 5%, and (2) the less weird 95%. Then you do PET scans and grey/white matter volume tests on the groups. Suppose you find some significant neurological differences (in average) between the groups, which would not be surprising. So you declare that there exists a "weirdness disorder". You could do the same with 20% instead of 5% with similar results -- an obvious first problem is that of demarcation. Another problem is that "weirdness" is likely a blanket term for a number of things.</p>
<p>To undermine the social construct view you need to do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show that a spectrum of behavior does not exist. People are either attentive or not attentive. There's no "a little inattentive".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Show that there is a group of people with a special characteristic distinct from people not in the group, and that the DSM-IV criteria detects this characteristic. A tumor would do it, except that concordance with the DSM-IV would likely be unreliable. An "average" characteristic for the group is no good; it has to be something that does not occur as a spectrum of differences. A gene might do it, like the DRD4-7R gene; however, if many different non-pathogenic genes are involved (as it appears to be the case) it could be argued that the genes cause the spectrum of behavior. Certainly, a clear genetic finding might undermine the social construct view, but not the neurodiversity view, and does not prove pathology in itself.</li>

<p>From Controversy/Concerns about medication: "<i>However, the methodology of this study was very poor and, when a site visit of leading experts reviewed the collected data, they concluded that the evidence was lacking to support this conclusion.</i>" The closest I could find is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By GARDINER HARRIS ROCKVILLE, Md., - Federal health officials said Thursday that they were looking into a suggestion by a small Texas study that Ritalin and other stimulant drugs given to children might increase their risk of cancer later in life. A team of experts from the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency went to Texas on May 23 to examine the methods used by the researchers, who found damage to the chromosomes of 12 children who took Ritalin for three months. Ritalin, which entered the market in 1955, has been used for decades to treat children for attention or hyperactivity problems. Dr. David Jacobson-Kram of the Office of New Drugs at the food and drug agency said that the study, by researchers at the University of Texas and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, had flaws in its methodology but that its results could not be dismissed. Drugs that are known to cause cancer cause similar chromosomal changes, Dr. Jacobson-Kram said. But other scientists cautioned that the study was far too small and its finding far too preliminary to cause alarm. The study did not include a comparison group of children who had not taken Ritalin. And federal officials said there was no reason for children currently taking Ritalin or other stimulants to stop taking them. Dr. Lawrence Greenhill of Columbia University, an expert on Ritalin and other stimulant drugs used for children, questioned why the government was devoting so many resources to following up on the study's findings. Dr. Greenhill, like many other academic researchers, serves as a consultant for companies that make the drugs. Copyright 2005 The New York Times Company</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is quite a bit different from the statement in the article. The flaws cited are that the study is small and that it's not <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double-blind.html" title="Double-blind">double-blind</a>. These are valid scientific concerns. I'm all for double-blind. But for the double-blind to produce different results it would need to be shown that placebo results in chromosome aberrations as well. As for the study size, that's a question of probabilities, and if you do the math, the findings are statistically significant. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 15:10, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>According to a phone conversation with the Medical Examiner, Dr. Dragovic, who examined a boy of 14 who had died of heart attack after about 8 years on Ritalin, the same effects you get from stimulant drug addiction (small vessel disease) will happen with stimulant drug medical use .... because of the lower dose, it just takes longer. He said nothing else causes the tell-tale lesions on the heart. Rat studies have shown these lesions at all doses of methylphenidate studied. A study of blood pressure rise, using only 11 people, said there was no "significant" rise ... but one of the 11 had a 20 point diastolic rise which is VERY significant, putting him in the danger region -- so they dropped him from the study!!!! Do you want the sources for these? I am not saying that the drug is not useful -- many drugs are useful but carry risks.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Positive aspects</span></h2>
<p>The following line in the "positive aspects" section is just hilarious.</p>
<p>"Despite these rather optimistic views of ADHD, there is no research to support them at this time."</p>
<p>As someone who has "true ADD" (as opposed to the various things that can look like it), I can tell you that it does have some positive aspects. It is simply a slightly different set of priorities for what the concious mind should be occupied with. Looking at it this way it's easy to see why there might be a comparative advantage in certain respects.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is quite a bit of evidence that other behaviors classified as psychiatric disorders have positive aspects, e.g. persons with bipolar disorder are demonstrably more creative than normal. Autism is also well-known for its disproportion of savant skills. But it's true that there's no scientific evidence that links ADHD specifically with such advantages - It's all very anecdotal. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 20:30, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The best way to determine if someone has ADD or not is behavior. The poster-boy of ADD behavior (in this case coupled with high IQ) is <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonardo_da_Vinci_1ee9.html" title="Leonardo da Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>. He had lots of things going on at once, thought up a lot of new ideas, and very rarely actually got anything done. If someone has some sort of difficulty concentrating or is hyperactive and does not show these traits, they do not have "true ADD." 68.190.35.84 07:44, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>While I agree with you, I have a problem with you saying "behavior" is the only way to determine "true ADD". I have ADHD as well and exhibit <i>many</i> of the negative behavioral aspects, but I think focusing on behavior alone really detracts from any strengths an ADHD person might have. Lord knows I got enough of that in high school from the staff. --128.200.104.65 04:50, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, there's no 'best way' to determine if someone is ADHD. A psychiatric diagnosis is, of course, subjective. No objective test will agree 100% with a psychiatric diagnostic (if done doule-blind), and I don't believe there will ever be one that does.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Born to explore</span></h2>
<p>I have checked out Born to Explore as well. It is a website of one individual who claims no special training, educational or professional qualifications on the subject of ADHD (or ADD). The site offers an interesting perspective, but falls far short of discrediting the current research for all people who may have ADHD.</p>
<p>As I have said before, I feel that it is important to remember: If you are not functionally impaired (as observed by others close to you, not self-observance), you do <i>not</i> meet the criteria for an ADHD diagnosis in any event. Few contributors to this article would argue that many behaviors and personality attributes mimic ADHD symptoms in people who do not have the condition as a disorder.</p>
<p>You sound like someone who has suffered under a possibly wrong diagnosis. If so, that is unfortunate, and IMHO, it happens too much. However, for the sake of argument and this WP article, just because you do <i>not</i> have ADHD <i>doesn't mean no one else does</i>. That should be basic common sense.</p>
<p>Regarding a separate article, whether it is in a section of this one, or separate, only so much unbalanced POV will go unchallenged in WP. Make your case with objective facts, not personal research or opinions. They violate WP policies. If you have personal experiences and/or a POV axe to grind, you should find a non-WP forum on the Internet or elsewhere where such contributions are appropriate and get a good hearing.</p>

<p>(NOTE: the following was copied from <a href="../../../v/a/o/User_talk%7EVaoverland_4dfb.html" title="User talk:Vaoverland">User talk: Vaoverland</a>)</p>
<p>Now, why would a reasonably intelligent person such as yourself believe in adhd? this is interesting. You read the born to explore website? what i would most like you to have read is the first section "what is ad/hd".Personally, I disagree with her choice of name, "born to explore"; i imagine it leaves the wrong impression of it being a rather weak, nonsense theory some idiot dreamed up, like that "hunter in a farmers world" nonsense, or indigo children,(though, make no mistake, I believe "indigo children" bears more credibility than adhd). I am such a strong advocate of the born to explore website because I am a psychologist who disbelieves adhd, and, as you correctly guessed, ( you seem to think i am the person or persons who have been participating in the discussion pages, which is why, I assume, you made the comment; but i am the person who has been vandalising the page recently, and I wont do that again, and who added the born to explore page into the external links) (which, incedentally, you had no reason, albeit its description, to remove)was misdiagnosed as adhd(as a child),because I was in fact going to write a book on the subject, and I was well on my way into the project, when I came across the website, at which point I gave up, because it described EVERYTHING I had in mind. Get back to me soon, as I wish to discuss this with you.</p>
<p>OK, in response, here are several items. Here goes:</p>
<p>1. I have no problem with the Born To Explore website or other external links in the article. However, the <i>placement</i> in the article was wrong. ADHD or not, we can expect and require contributor to follow the guidelines. My apology, as I abhor censorship, if that is what my revert accomplished. However, you should have added it under External links, and I should have moved your link there as a better choice of action.</p>
<p>2. If you don't register a free WP User account, please don't be frustrated when other contributors and administrators of Wikipedia get confused. It's not like you have to reveal any personal information to get a User account, because you don't. The project suffers from vandalism and bad faith edits primarily originating from IP addresses, not registered users.</p>
<p>3. I meant it when I said I feel sorry about a misdiagnosis, and I also regret the negative stigma many kids on ADHD meds feel, especially from their peers. This is also true for adults.</p>
<p>4. I was feel I was effectively misdiagnosed by <i>not</i> being diagnosed or counseled correctly by the professionals as a child. My parents and some several teachers got bad advice. A lot of damage and no help was done by (I have to assume) well-meaning but misguided individuals, who told my parents and teachers to treat my inattention and inability to sit still as deliberate defiance, despite any other evidence of anti-social behavior or resentment of authority.</p>
<p>Punishment as if I was an incorrigible delinquent did a lot of emotional harm; brutalization at an institution filled with other teenagers many of whom had criminal and violent backgrounds didn't fix what they thought it would, and it is only the grace of God that I did not simply transform into a violent person or one of criminal intent.</p>
<p>I do understand that misdiagnosis is a risk of attempting to help people and of receiving help. However, spotting the problem and then using the information in a malicious way is worst of all. Several of my teachers spotted my coordination problem, as early as my kindergarten year. No one did anything to help. The only thing I do remember vividly is a teacher calling me the most uncordinated kid in the history of my high school in front of 60 other students. Some kids <i>are</i> uncoordinated. Willpower on my part could not overcome that disability.</p>
<p>5. 30 years later, in 1995, while hospitalized for something else, at age 44, I was formally diagnosed by a psychologist who spent a lot of time with me and conducted a number of tests. He concluded that I have <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adult_attention-deficit_disorder.html" title="Adult attention-deficit disorder">adult attention-deficit disorder</a> (AADD) (93 percentile, whatever that means), as well as mild forms of both an <a href="../../../a/u/d/Auditory_processing_disorder.html" title="Auditory processing disorder">auditory processing disorder</a> and a <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motor_skills_disorder.html" title="Motor skills disorder">motor skills disorder</a>.</p>
<p>At his urging, I soon after read <i>Driven To Distraction</i>, which for me was like finding your automobile owners manual in the glove box after driving the first 100,000 miles without it. (I like analogies). Item after item of aspects of my behavior were covered, if not the cause well-explained. I have since read a lot of material and done quite a bit of introspection. Whether or not I have ADHD or it actually exists as currently defined, the current protocols at least give professionals, parents, kids, and adult individuals some options or tools towards living with the problems.</p>
<p>In my career in school transportation (1968-2004), I saw remarkable improvements in the school performance and apparent happiness of kids who have received an ADHD diagnosis, not always with medication. Special school programs in an enlightened setting can help these kids perform in a manner called gifted instead of being the class problem for teachers in a normal setting (as I was). My first contact of that nature was with a small school in <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bon_Air%2C_Virginia_90ea.html" title="Bon Air, Virginia">Bon Air, Virginia</a> in 1975. The principal, who noted my ability to visualize maps and prepare city-wide bus routes in my head (due to something like a photographic memory) told me you are just like a lot of my kids. She introduced me to six year olds who can real off the names and terms of every U.S. Vice President, for a quick example. She stressed to me that Special Education was not just for mentally retarded anymore, a lesson I embraced, even if my ADD diagnosis was to wait 20 more years. In the 1970s, they were just beginning to realize that the parents of many kids, all previously thought to outgrow the "disorder", often showed some symptoms not unlike those of their kids,. Some parents also shared that realization, leading if I recall correctly to formalization of ADD in adults in the 1980s as a condition.</p>
<p>6. I do not take AADD medications, and got no professional counseling help focused on my AADD (or whatever it is) until very recently.</p>
<p>7. I think working on Wikipedia has helped me learn more about my mental conditions and help me find <a href="../../../c/o/p/Coping_skill.html" title="Coping skill">coping skills</a> (or "workarounds"). For examples, I discovered that using <a href="../../../c/l/o/Closed_captioning.html" title="Closed captioning">closed captioning</a> on television and spell checkers to correct my frequent typing transposition errors, which resemble <a href="../../../d/y/s/Dyslexia.html" title="Dyslexia">dyslexia</a> (but aren't). The free ieSpell program (recommended by other Wikipedians) has proved to be a big help for me in correcting transposition errors as well as spelling in general. When I see misspelling in an existing article, I will often run the ieSpell program, finding it to be quick, easy, and amazingly intuitive in suggesting replacement words.</p>
<p>8. Fortunately, I also have the AADD attribute of <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperfocus.html" title="Hyperfocus">hyperfocus</a>, another controversial subject. Working on WP projects at my own pace is ideal for me. When I am "in gear", people say that I get a lot done. Often working one article leads to another (or two, or three). Despite all the problesm in my life which medication might ease, I would forgo it if it cost me the ability to have the <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperfocus.html" title="Hyperfocus">hyperfocus</a> state.</p>
<p>9. I do more maintenance work than content editing on subjects in WP for which i do not feel well-qualified, such as the ADHD and related articles. I feel I have especially helped make sure the controversy items in the articles get a hearing. A lot of people who have contributed have divergent opinions and edit accordingly.</p>
<p>10. If I could advise counselors such as many psychologists are these days based upon my current opinions and life experience, I would suggest that options be kept open. We can all agree that there is much still to be learned about our brains and how they impact our behaviors. Work on solutions to take advantage of what is special about each person, and use whatever tools are lawful and work.</p>
<p>Kids these days are a lot more worldly than when I was young, and I think many grown-ups sell them short. They should be able to help participate in some of the decisions about school problems, etc., at an earlier age, and that would relieve some of the stigma many seem to feel or having been tricked or medicated against their will.</p>
<p>Kids understand things like this: Do you want to sit still and can't? Ask any school bus driver: All kids are hyper after Halloween candy. Few kids would deliberately cause their driver to wreck the bus by not hearing an approaching fire truck or train! Right?</p>
<p>So, diet and maybe medication <i>may</i> help get our chemical balances where we want them. It like, if you stay up late, don't be surprised if you are too sleepy the next day to do your best (or even feel good). It should go without saying, but a if a kid <i>wants</i> to be the class problem, I would say the problem may go deeper than ADHD, or too much Halloween candy.</p>
<p>11. You stated "I was in fact going to write a book on the subject, and I was well on my way into the project, when I came across the website, at which point I gave up, because it described EVERYTHING I had in mind."</p>
<p>You didn't solicit my advice, but in all honestly, what reason is that to give up? We <i>need</i> more books to keep learning about this subject. A website misses many potential readers, and like <i>Driven To Distraction</i> for me, the BTE website might hit home for you, but I'll bet you have more to say/add.</p>
<p>I have to go now, and as usual, I have written more than I planned. I hope all of the above is food for thought.</p>

<p>I recommend that the information in the ADHD article about the genetic trait known as 'hyperactivity' should be merged into the 'Hyperactivity' article, to distinguish this information from the psychiatric diagnosis that identifies 'ADHD' as a mental disorder. Information from the 'Controversy' section that is not ADHD specific should go there too.

<dd>To start off with, the genetic principle of chromosomal inheritance categorically denies pathological origins. Diseases have their own genetic origins which are distinct from from the genes of individual organisms who are affected by them. The concept of 'disease' is relative to the organism, because any organism that damages another may be considered a disease. The nomenclature of 'disorder' has an identical relationship with behavior, e.g. any behavior may be considered a 'disorder' if it interrupts another behavior. If hyperactivity is inheritable (which evidence suggests it is), then it is a genetic trait and not a disease or a disorder. On the other hand 'ADD' and 'ADHD' are defined as disorders. The disorder defined in the DSM is a different topic from the behavior with the genetic basis. (Besides that, 'Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder' describes 'hyperactivity disorder' which implies that there is some other kind of hyperactivity.) <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOneismany_9c9b.html" title="User:Oneismany">oneismany</a> 23:19, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the following text:</p>
<p>"Studies show that those with ADD/ADHD are very creative, as a number of famous actors, writers, and artists have gained advantage from the disorder. Even <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> was believed to have had ADD. The reason why those with the disorder as so creative is probably because they are very focused on their thoughts and love to explore their imagination.</p>
<p>ADD/ADHD behavior traits are often mistaken for hyperactivity. Many with the disorder can't concentrate on tasks given to them, but are not necessarily hyperactive. In fact, in recent years, a large number of those with the disorder have shown to be rather calm and quiet, but are unable to pay attention because of too much focus on their own thoughts."</p>
<p>There's no factual basis cited for these claims (i.e., psychiatric examinations of Einstein during his life), and the whole thing reeks of over-interpretation. People with Asperger Syndrome claim Einstein too. How many disorders does this dead man have to be diagnosed with to make the living feel better? Leave him be, please.

<dd>You do realize that it is professionals who have "diagnosed" Einstein, at least in regards to Asperger's syndrome? I do think it's a bit dubious to diagnose a dead person (or diagnose over the internet), but then again, I think professionals should stop diagnosing kids left and right as <i>mentally disordered</i> as well. In a recent episode of <i>Boston Legal</i> they showed how a number of psychiatrists diagnosed a guy based on employment evaluation reports - not sure if that's done in real life, but I wouldn't be surprised. In some cases it can be pretty obvious that someone is something. For example, my dad did not speak until the age of 4, has an Aspie son, and an HFA grandson. It's a no-brainer to "diagnose" my dad as HFA as a child, even though no psychiatrist would give him a diagnosis now based on behavior or difficulties alone. Einstein, BTW, had a son diagnosed with schizophrenia, and there are a ton of other reasons to put him in the autism spectrum. Either way, I should note that it doesn't matter if Einstein or anyone else were ADHD or whatever. Failure to tolerate <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurodiversity.html" title="Neurodiversity">neurodiversity</a> is bigotry regardless. Self-acceptance should not be based the existence of 'superpowers' (as noted by someone in the autistic community). <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 01:31, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Twin studies have shown ADHD to be highly inheritable, almost as much as height. Other research shows that certain versions of genes, known as polymorphisms, may be linked to the disorder. A commonly identified one is the 7-repeat allele of the Dopamine receptor type 4 gene (DRD4). This gene has inconsistently been associated with novelty seeking aspects of personality and may be more frequent in populations that were more migratory in early human history -- the so-called "Out of Africa" theory. However, because at least 4-7 genes thus far are thought to be associated with ADHD, this is conjecture at this point. Individuals without ADHD also have the 7-repeat allele, though in smaller numbers. Some researchers refer to this allele as the "response ready" allele. Other genes found to date that may be candidates for association with ADHD are the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1), the dopamine beta hydroxylase gene (DBH TaqI), and the dopamine receptor type 5 gene (DRD5).</i></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">ADD is NOT synonymous with ADHD</span></h2>
<p>In many key area ADD and ADHD are dramatically different. These differences really make this article almost useless for ADD individuals to learn about their condition or recognize it in anyone else.</p>
<p>The reason is this article more than anyone I've seen online assumes there is no real difference between ADD and ADHD.</p>
<p>Yes people with ADD or ADHD are similar in terms inability to pay Attn, organize, loquaciousness, insecurity, procrastination Etc. and medications for treatment are identical;</p>
<p>The key differences between ADD and ADHD can result in two distinct, almost totally opposite sets of behaviors. Additionally, an ADD person often does not display outward, obvious signs of hyperactivity - thus the absence of the H that is in ADHD.</p>
<p>Below is a list of typical personality/behavioral characteristics of an ADD child and an ADHD child taken from about.com. This information is reflected on many other medical sites on the internet, however this one lays out the differences very clearly since it's not in "medi-speak."</p>
<p>ADD individuals tend to be:</p>
<pre>
   * Sluggish
   * Honors other’s boundaries
   * Obedient
   * Underassertive
   * Overly Polite
   * Docile
   * Modest
   * Shy
   * Socially Withdrawn
   * Bonds with others but doesn’t attract friends
</pre>
<p>Whereas the ADHD individual tends to be:</p>
<pre>
   * Physically Hyperactive
   * Impulsive
   * Intrusive
   * Rebellious
   * Bossy
   * Irritation
   * Show Off/Egotistical
   * Attracts friends but doesn’t easily bond
   * More prone toward Oppositional Defiant Disorder or Conduct Disorders
</pre>
<p>As you can see the differences are quite stark. A little common sense should tell anyone that a person with ADD may not appear overtly Hyperactive at all. However the general perception of a person with ADD is identical to ADHD</p>
<p>Many ADD people don't ever get diagnosed, because they simply do not resemble ADHD.</p>
<p>I'm looking at the ADHD article, and it really needs to be restructured or a separate article created for ADD.</p>
<p>Physiological conditions are described in terms of moods, feelings, beliefs and perceptions of all people sharing a certain condition. Bipolars can be identified, because they all act similarly.</p>
<p>This rule is broken with ADD and ADHD. Individuals who have either condition do not act similarly at all. One cannot guess someone is ADD by looking at someone with ADHD.</p>
<p>Psychological terms and diagnoses are evolving and changing all the time.</p>
<p>ADHD is gradually morphing. It's path if continued will ultimately result in it being grouped with bipolar. It already is referred to as "childhood bipolar" by some psychiatrists.</p>
<p>ADD by contrast in terms of behavior is the "polar opposite" of a bipolar. Wherever its evolutionary path takes it. It won't be grouped with bipolar.</p>
<p>I just thought I'd bring it to someone's Attn.</p>
<p>I will be happy to "fix" it. When I have the time. If no one else steps forward.</p>
<p>I am ADD, and I know from my own personal experience, my brother's and Mother's, beyond what I've read. ADD is NOT ADHD. The reason it tooks all so long to get properly diagnosed was we weren't Hyper, and we weren't troublemakers. Yet we are all about as highly ADD as a person can get. :-)</p>

<dd>I agree with most of the above. The problem is that the prfessionals who meet on this insisted on including the sub type which is without hyperactivity under the ADHD category when developing the DSM-IV (sp?) standards.

<dd>The different lists of bullet points are interesting, but they appear to be a hypothesis only. Is there any evidence that ADHD individuals can be separated clearly into such subgroups? I'm willing to bet any one individual can display the characteristics listed from either subgroup. Furthermore, there is likely no objective characteristic (like a gene or a medical test) that can sharply separate both groups. This, of course, is true of ADHD in general. It's clear that ADHD is both a blanket term for a variety of behaviors as well as a social construct. So until the science is able to decipher all that's going on behind the ADHD label, Wikipedia can only document the DSM-IV classification. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeurodivergent_04c1.html" title="User:Neurodivergent">Neurodivergent</a> 13:13, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>ADHD is NOT referred to as "childhood bipolar" by any competent psychiatrist. Sometimes the manifestations are similar and a child is misdiagnosed, so psychiatrists are cautioned to strongly consider the alternative diagnosis before adopting a working diagnosis and while observing the effect of treatment. Psychiatrists also use the concept of a "spectrum" of disorders and regard ADD as part of the ADHD spectrum. There is as yet insufficient evidence to warrant breaking ADD out as a distinct diagnosis unrelated to ADHD. There is indeed confusion in the general public about ADHD without hyperactivity, and the issue of the hyperactivity trait should certainly be clarified in the article. However, the "without hyperactivity" subcategory is the current state of the art. The notion of "polar opposite in terms of behavior" is vague, not useful, could add to a reader's confusion and should not be pursued. The DSM-IV classification is supported by voluminous discussion and argument and represents consensus on the part of many stakeholders. Personal anecdotes pale in comparison and should not carry weight in formulating this Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../m/p/u/User%7EMpulier_5afc.html" title="User:Mpulier">Myron</a> 15:59, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">ADD_ADHD caused by "Conflict of Physiology"</span></h2>
<p>A long article that mentions all the theories is not an encyclopedic level paper. That number of theories demonstrates the lack of knowledge about ADD and ADHD.</p>
<p>It is true that hunter gathers had survival issues with attention. Over hundreds of thousands of years pre-humans and early man developed a warning system that will break your concentration if something attempts to approach, usually from behind. We call that system “peripheral vision reflexes.” If you have been startled when someone stepped up beside you or caught something out of the corner of your eye, that was a peripheral vision reflex.</p>
<p>A small, thin slice of your vision field operates subliminally to detect “threat movement” and trigger the startle. We all have the ability to ignore detected movement once we identify it as harmless. But you can’t turn the system off.</p>
<p>The most likely cause of ADD and ADHD is that brain system. The phenomenon caused mental breaks for knowledge workers in the 1960’s. The cubicle prevents those mental events today.</p>
<p>In classrooms all the students do the same things at the same time preventing serious exposure to cause the expected mental break. But the constant inability to focus indicates exposure to Subliminal Distraction. Brain Fag, a Culture Bound Syndrome from Africa only happens in western style education not traditional apprenticeship training.</p>
<p>The problem is known only to a very few designers who work with Systems Furniture, cubicles. In three years of searching I cannot find any knowledge of the problem in any area of mental health services. The phenomenon does occasionally appear as a novelty on medical and magazine TV programs. A grad student from Australia says that the information is not in textbooks but is communicated in lectures. An explanation of the problem was included in psychology lectures up to about 1990. That's where I found it.</p>
<p>The phenomenon can be demonstrated with a simple psychology experiment.</p>

<p>In places where no protection is offered while persons are confined in very small living arrangements, mental breaks still happen.</p>

<p>I've just been cleaning up some of the referencing, and found the following (slightly hilarious) omission. The following reference "(see: Krause,Dresel,Krause in psycho 26/2000 p.199ff.)" has been in the article since July 2002<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder&amp;diff=126945&amp;oldid=126940" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder&amp;diff=126945&amp;oldid=126940" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> . Apart from the fact that I can't find any article that matches it, it seems most likely it was a reference for dopamine in the striatal region, but it somehow managed to get stuck with the norepinephrine reference, with which it has tagged along from 2002 until now.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">More on Sleep Apnea and ADHD</span></h2>
<p>There is a section in the article which talks about <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleep_apnea.html" title="Sleep apnea">sleep apnea</a> as a possible cause for ADHD. I'd like to see if anyone can come up with correlations between sleep apnea and ADHD and post them to the article.</p>
<p>I was diagnosed with sleep apnea in 1995 (age 28), although I am sure I had it in my childhood, based on my symptoms. Recently, I have also recently suspected of having ADHD, although I have not been tested to confirm it yet. Only learning about inattentive ADHD recently, I am now 100% sure that I have it... or, at least, all of the symptoms of it. I have 19 out of 21 symptoms on the Hallowell questionnaire, and the other two I didn't say yes to happen to me occassionally. For example, like many others with ADHD, I calm down with caffeine. That's just the tip of the iceberg. I cannot stay focused on anything. I literally can't work for more than 5 minutes at a time...</p>
<p>Anyway, getting back to my point, assuming that the test comes back positive, I am hoping to understand my ADHD better, assuming that the test results show that I have it. I think sleep apnea holds the key. I have several co-morbidities - ADHD is just one of them. I'd like to see more about sleep apnea, especially in adults, in the main article. --<a href="../../../b/m/e/User%7EBmeloche_55d1.html" title="User:Bmeloche">Bmeloche</a> 05:44, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Personal Comments</span></h2>
<p>I am sure that this is not the *appropriate* type of comment to make here, but I must say that as a (41 year old) adult recently diagnosed as having "classic ADD" I would never have recognized myself in this article. Indeed, reading this article made me feel as if having ADD was equivalent to being significantly brain damaged! My doctor gave me the book, "Driven to Distraction : Recognizing and Coping with Attention Deficit Disorder from Childhood Through Adulthood" by Edward M. Hallowell, John J. Ratey which (I feel) explained the condition I recognized as having in a much more balanced and less pathologizing way. I have never been told that I was stupid in any way. I was always in "gifted" programs in school, I have owned and run my own businesses, and am currently a PhD candidate in the top program for my subject in the country. Friends call me for advice because they say my "brain has more neural connections than anyone they know and (I) can always see connections others can't." I think I was the only person who truly recognized that I would have to read every page 7 times, simply because every mention of a subject, object or idea sent me off thinking about other things I knew about that related to that s/o/i. Thus, this ability to make connections between disparate things is a great amazing blessing and also a curse. But it is not just a curse! Reading this article was like reading a Wiki entry, "Dropped on the Head"! Since being prescribed Ritalin I have an amazing sense of peace and calm and the books I read are about there own subjects. However, if I *want* to make connections, accessing that aspect or faculty of mind is as easy as ever. I just think that if this Wiki entry was my only or first access to this (disorder) I would never think I had anything like it, because I would not believe (or my ego would not let me believe) that I could have attained what I've attained and be recognised as intelligent and creative if I had the disorder described herein. And I think the Wiki is such a wonderful and amazing project that I am sure like-minded others come here first for their appetizer introduction to every subject.

<p>I agree, and am in a similar situation. I was always considered gifted at school, making unusual creative connections. I would also always lose track of my coat, shoes, assignments and appoinments, but could make up for it on the fly so never had a strong negative result. After graduating college I saw a therapist (for unrelated reasons) who suspected I might have ADHD. I was very surprised and in denial, in part because I didn't think that I fit descriptions like this article. But many hours of neuropsychiatric evaluations say that I do have ADHD inattentive type. It's difficult to say how, but I think the article should be modified to include the diversity of abilities and variety in magnitude. Also, in response to the poster above, see <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adult_attention-deficit_disorder.html" title="Adult attention-deficit disorder">adult attention-deficit disorder</a>.

<p>I am in a similar situation to Anonymous above me, and I accepted my condition upon being diagnosed as I knew there was something that seperated me from many others. Fortunately, I've learned to proactively use my ADHD gift with my field of work. The solution to raising children who definitely have ADHD is not doping them with drugs but to guide them down a path where they can utilize their ADHD and keep their minds constantly challenged. --24.36.156.75 00:42, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Under the heading "Feingold diet" I was adding some opinion from other reviewers, when suddenly part of what I had added disappeared, and the following paragraphs appeared there:</p>
<p><font color="green">The various neuro-imaging studies have converged to suggest that at least three areas are involved in ADHD, these being the frontal lobes (particularly the orbital frontal region, more on the right side than the left), the basal ganglia (in particular the striatum), and the central cerebellum (vermis). Some research also implicates the anterior cingulate as possibly involved in ADHD. These various regions appear to be between 3–10% smaller than normal and between 10–20% less active than normal.</font></p>
<p><font color="green">Genetic research was discussed above and is also supportive of neurotransmitter problems being associated with ADHD.</font></p>
<p>However, in looking at the history, I cannot find where this change was made. Also, there are footnotes by my sentence more than what I put there, and they don't "go" anywhere.

<p>I have sent the following e-mail to Limegreen which I think should be public. My apologies in advance for the self promotion I display in this e-mail but I am a little miffed.</p>
<p>I just noticed that you eliminated by contribution to the ADHD article as "flaky" I do believe a little discussion with me would have been in order. First of all I have been a psychiatrist for 30 years and the observations made in that article are based on clinical experience. Exactly what is your clinical experience? I understand the conclusions are completely at variance with the shared beliefs in psychiatry but that does not make it flaky, or put in a category for the far out writers, particularly when the ADHD article does have a lot of very flaky references</p>
<p>As a begining comment, did you read the article itself? I have been published in the Psychiatric Times, the Psychoanalytic Study of the Child, Yale Review etc. Anna Freud wrote the following to me about another article, which means a lot in my field.: "I read immediately what you have written and found it very interesting and convincing...I have searched for the right words to describe the processes...but I was not able to find them... I believe you have done much better in this respect and I find myself quite fascinated by your elaborations..."</p>
<p>(I'll be happy to attach a copy of the letter.) Scott Peck wrote to me regarding a different article that it represented one of the few superlative articles he had read in his career as a psychiatrist.</p>
<p>A Dmoz search <a href="http://www.dmozsearch.com/index.php?browse=/Science/Social_Sciences/Psychology/Cognitive/Articles/" class="external free" title="http://www.dmozsearch.com/index.php?browse=/Science/Social_Sciences/Psychology/Cognitive/Articles/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dmozsearch.com/index.php?browse=/Science/Social_Sciences/Psychology/Cognitive/Articles/</a> reveals that a different article by me “On the Banality of Positive Thinking” is listed as one of ten important "cognitive"essays along with the “APA 2000: Historic Dialogue between Beck and Ellis” and “Chomsky Essays Discussion Salon – (A site at MIT hosting a collection of essays honoring Chomsky on his 70th birthday.)”</p>

<p>Dear Simon,</p>
<p>Wow - that was quick!</p>
<p>I am fine - and I hope you are thriving. You were in mind since I have been grading students exam scripts and they had been citing you (I had given them details of your SSRI paper during the course, and clearly quite a few have read and understood it).</p>
<p>I was wondering whether you would be interested in contributing an invited paper to Medical Hypotheses, of which I am now editor (you can see the journals web site via the link in my signature). You may have new ideas, or you might like to write up some of your previous work (especially that on the nature of SSRIs - which seems to me so important) as a 'formal' paper.</p>

<dd>Simon, I think your sense of "miffedness" may have led you to misinterpret my actions. The reference that I deleted was a published abstract of a poster presentation. You will see a reference to it here with the deletion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder&amp;diff=48188763&amp;oldid=48143694" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Attention-deficit_hyperactivity_disorder&amp;diff=48188763&amp;oldid=48143694" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>.</dd>
<dd>I felt that the poster abstract was poorly written, and was making some fairly large claims, relative to its weighting as an unreferenced poster abstract. Unless you publish under the name J. Breakey sometime, then I don't believe that the "flakey" call was directed at you.</dd>
<dd>Thus, I assume you object to my deletion of this sentence <i>Others have found indication that children with ADHD are metabolically different from other children, in zinc response to food dye, water/electrolyte handling, and an increased need of essential fatty acids.</i>, which was unreferenced. While I respect your experience, and find much of your work on this article excellent, wikipedia is working to to improve its <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, and thus I'd encourage you to reinsert your content, but reference your contributions. <a href="../../../f/n/_/WP%7EFN_5c8e.html" title="WP:FN">WP:FN</a> has information on how to format the footnoting used on the ADHD page.

<p>Sorry I assumed you had deleted my contribution. It seemed that the addition disappeared after your visit to the site. My even stronger apologies to readers at this site which I did not know existed. My self congratulation was obnoxious. I thought I had to validate that my very different views are coming from someone who is not automatically dismissed by thoughtful people in the field. However, I am glad I was directed here. After reading through some of the controversies raised on this site I feel even more strongly that my article, which is totally in opposition to most "expert" consensus views, might be worth the time of some of your contributors. It is written in a literary style rather than as a formal scientific paper, but that is precisely the point. While it tries to address scientific evidemce it also allows the freedom to discuss what is sensible and what isn't. This is important because despite the impression of many that we have nailed down all kinds of scientific facts about the biology of ADHD it just ain't so. See Dr. Castellanos' comments to Frontline. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/medicating/interviews/castellanos.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/medicating/interviews/castellanos.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> And despite the dismissal of environmental factors as opposed to biology, I hate to say it, but we are not dealing with a fair playing field in the discussion. See <a href="http://alternet.org/drugreporter/20594/" class="external text" title="http://alternet.org/drugreporter/20594/" rel="nofollow">It was like a whitewash</a>]] But I would also like to emphasize that I try to be fair. I have been asked many times to write for Peter Breggin's group of psychiatrists who are totally against meds and turned them down. Similarly, you might be interested in this e-mail sent to me which I also turned down.</p>
<p><i>Dear Dr. Sobo,</i></p>
<p>I read with interest your article entitled, A Reevaluation of the Relationship between Psychiatric Diagnosis and Chemical Imbalances.</p>
<p>I am working with Citizens Commission on Human Rights to assist in producing a series of short documentaries on abuses on psychiatry and abuses on the mental health system.</p>
<p>Our researches have inevitably led us to the theory of chemical imbalance and the way in which this is being used as a basis for prescription of some very serious drugs. We are very interested in your views on the use of the chemical imbalance theory and your explanations of the fact that there is no evidence to prove the existence of such imbalances. Would you be willing to grant us an interview on this subject?</p>
<p>The videos will be part of a permanent exhibit at the headquarters of CCHR and additionally will be distributed on DVD as part of a public education project.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Sheila Macdonald</p>
<p>Here is the response.</p>
<p><i>If I gave you an interview it would have to follow strict rules. I would have to approve of the edited footage! Because I have no intention of being part of a documentary that completely denounces these drugs as child killers or killers of any type. In my experience they have saved many, many more children than they have harmed. That would have to be in your documentary. I genuinely feel you will, despite good intentions, harm far more children than you will help if you scare the hell out of parents and they won't allow their children to be medicated when they could be helped by them. I am already finding that happening due to sensationalist news reporting. Your docuumentary sounds like it would merely reiterate the hysteria against the medications and that I am very against. So in that context you are the enemy as much as the drug companies.</i></p>
<p>(<b>in response to an earlier e-mail:</b>) As for ADHD please take the time to read the whole article instead of skimming it. There is no doubt that many children meet DSM IV criteria for ADHD, and the use of these drugs may be sometimes warranted. I am against the argument that the problem is simply biological and therefore drugs automatically follow.</p>
<p>So it seems I am that rare bird who disagrees with almost everyone. In other words, like most people I am not an "expert" but simply trying to make sense of the issues and argue what I believe to be true. My article on ADHD can be found with this link <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ss06470/ADHD.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/ss06470/ADHD.html" rel="nofollow">ADHD and Other Sins of Our Children</a></p>

<p>Although I have left in Schnoll's basic premise that the diet works but the studies are incomplete, I have removed reference to the supposition that the diet removes all processed foods and reduces the amount of sugar. Actually, it doesn't. The Feingold Program Product Information Committee volunteers spend many hours a week researching products with manufacturers so that we can provide members with Foodlists of more than 150 pages listing thousands of products -- and many of them are processed foods. We also do not eliminate sugar, and sugar is not automatically reduced by using the diet. In fact, we often encourage parents to make sure that they have plenty of treats on hand -- especially in the beginning -- so that the child will be comfortable and happy with the diet change. Later, for the sake of general health, it may be preferable to reduce sugars, to use organic foods when possible, etc. -- but in the beginning all that takes a back seat to implementing a diet that still has enough fun foods to make the child happy. Yes, that includes pizza, hot dogs, and cake mixes. <a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShulae_0e99.html" title="User:Shulae">Shulae</a> 13:09, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Clearly certain individuals have benefited greatly from ADHD. Michael Flatley, originator of Riverdance, was diagnosed with ADHD during his childhood in Chicago. He was also a golden glove boxer. He has also repeatedly walked out on situations where people in charge tried to tell him what to do.</i></p>
<p>This idea seems to have a false conclusion: that Michael Flatley would not have been successful in his life without ADHD. Since there is no way to tell one way or another, this is just whistling in the dark and really doesn't belong in a wikipedia article. Not only that, it has a "famous people with ___" reek. And then later on it links to an article which seems based on diagnosing famous successful dead people with ADHD. Since it is impossible to say if people in the past had certain disorders or not (I have heard that Edison was everything from an autistic to ADHD to insomniac to an idiot) commenting on it is meaningless. Add that to the length of the article, and I suggest paring down sections like this as much as possible. When I have time I will come back and try to do some myself. --<a href="../../../i/g/n/User%7EIgnignot_131a.html" title="User:Ignignot">Ignignot</a> 18:31, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
