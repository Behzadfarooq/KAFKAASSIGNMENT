<p>I am wondering, should this even be linked between the Christmas Invasion and the second series episode "New Earth"? It's awfully hard to consider this "official", even though it does have the doctor and seems to be done by the same production staff, wouldn't this episode be more like "Dimensions in Time"? If so, should the information be unlinked from those other pages, and let this rest seprately? I say it probably should, as it really doesn't fit with the rest of the show, as the central part of the story is breaking the 4th wall. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadagast83_195a.html" title="User:Radagast83">Radagast83</a> 23:20, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think a large part of the reason why this is in the running order is because of how the production team have hyped it up as being a full-fledged production with new sets, new effects, etc. which seems to lend it a bit more legitimacy. That being said, what do other people think? --<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKhaosworks_56f9.html" title="User:Khaosworks">khaosworks</a> (<a href="../../../k/h/a/User_talk%7EKhaosworks_e07b.html" title="User talk:Khaosworks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Khaosworks_06d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Khaosworks">contribs</a>) 23:33, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't consider it canon, although I consider it more like a particularly advanced game than <i>Dimensions in Time</i>, but then we're not dictating what's canonical and what isn't.</dd>

<dd>Potentially the Beeb could chose to air it again after every episode of series two, which would confuse where it fits in somewhat. It's not a proper episode of Doctor Who and isn't pretending to be, and wasn't broadcast on a "proper" TV channel - arguably it's no more a TV episode than if the same game had been placed on the official BBC website only.</dd>

<dd>That all said - and I wouldn't list it myself - given how it was promoted, as khaosworks says, I'm not sure there is a sufficiently strong argument to remove it now it's in the infoboxes. --<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWhouk_a4bc.html" title="User:Whouk">Whouk</a> (<a href="../../../w/h/o/User_talk%7EWhouk_b2f7.html" title="User talk:Whouk">talk</a>) 23:41, 3 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I can see arguments both ways — on the one hand, it was produced by (members of) the "official" production team, at a time when the series was in production (then again, who was responsible for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pescatons_96f7.html" title="The Pescatons">The Pescatons</a></i>?). The Christmassy content seems to tie it to TCI a bit (although I suppose that it could be broadcast again after <i>next</i> year's Christmas special). I also think there's a good chance that it will show up on the DVD of <i>The Christmas Invasion</i>, along with the Children in Need scene — not that that makes it any more or less canonical — after all, "Oh, Mummy!" isn't a canonical account of Sutekh's life after <i>Pyramids of Mars</i>!</dd>

<dd>Whouk, I meant only to remove the "Preceded by" and "Followed by" information, as it's more accurate to say that "New Earth" follows "Christmas Invasion" instead of following "Attack of the Graske". "Attack" is more in the la-la land of non-official Doctor Who stuff like "DiT", I mean, it's a game! It's nice that they went all out in the production, but the entire concept (beyond a game) is quite silly, espeically since there are multiple endings to chose from. That alone should make it outside the realm of "offical" Who.<a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadagast83_195a.html" title="User:Radagast83">Radagast83</a> 04:45, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>&gt;(It did go out on 1st Jan; I suggest any "technical difficulties" were a general incompatibility with a &gt;particular STB (eg the Sony VTX-D800U).)</p>
<p>When it failed after the first option, the BBC put out a message saying something like 'We regret that we are unable to bring you this service due to technical difficulties', which suggested a fault at source. If what you say is correct (and I assume it is if you managed to see the repeat), then that they should have said 'you are having trouble receiving this service due to compatibility problems'.

<p>No, I got that same message about "technical difficulties" on the VTX-D800U on the New Year's Day repeat. Many people have reported problems with that STB (on both broadcasts), so it seems pretty definite that message is just an all-encompassing "something's gone wrong in the software" placeholder. It could conceivably appear if there was a broadcast problem, but in practice it appears the broadcast went out fine (or at least as intended), so if you saw it, it was just an incompatibility. --<a href="../../../k/j/b/User%7EKJBracey_fd74.html" title="User:KJBracey">KJBracey</a> 15:10, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Don't think the article mentions this but at the end the Doctor says roughly "They'll always be a chance for someone to sort out the Graske later on...might even be me". Is it worth mentioning this, especially since it leaves the door open for the Graske to possibly appear in a standard episode--HellCat86 07:18, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
