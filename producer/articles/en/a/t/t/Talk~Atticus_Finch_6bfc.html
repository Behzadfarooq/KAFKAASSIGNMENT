<p>I chose to make Atticus Finch as a seperate article because of his signifigance as a literary hero.</p>
<p><br />
Perhaps if there were articles about each of the characters, then they could be merged as well into the article.</p>

<li><b>Strong Agree</b> The article does not benefit by being seperate from the artice <a href="../../../t/o/_/To_Kill_A_Mockingbird_b818.html" title="To Kill A Mockingbird">To Kill A Mockingbird</a> and should therefore be merged. <a href="../../../m/e/i/User%7EMeighan_4bba.html" title="User:Meighan">Ed</a> 10:12, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>I disagree</b>--Atticus Finch is an important figure in literature. I say he should most definately have his own page. Maybe I should stand guard against his page to make sure its not deleted without an unfair trial!&#160;:-) --68.154.71.137 05:27, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b> Atticus is an important literary figure, and he is studied in many classrooms (my class just wrapped up our "To Kill A Mockingbird" unit last week). The page also has enough content to merit it's own article; like Harry Potter or Eragon. --<a href="../../../h/o/j/User%7EHojimachong_c483.html" title="User:Hojimachong"><font color="#0000CC" face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Hojimachong</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../h/o/j/User_talk%7EHojimachong_5367.html" title="User talk:Hojimachong"><font color="#00FFAA">talk</font></a></sup> 05:30, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Also disagree</b> I think Atticus Finch deserves his own page. Besides being a highly prominent character in American literature, he is also a classic hero in American Film. if you look at the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains page, almost single character has a link to their own page. Atticus is the #1 hero; he should have a page of his own as well. Hundreds of literary protagonists have their own pages, too, like <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holden_Caulfield_4f82.html" title="Holden Caulfield">Holden Caulfield</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarlett_O%27Hara_be4a.html" title="Scarlett O'Hara">Scarlett O'Hara</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregor_Samsa_8ae8.html" title="Gregor Samsa">Gregor Samsa</a>-- even <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humbert_Humbert_05f0.html" title="Humbert Humbert">Humbert Humbert</a> from <a href="../../../l/o/l/Lolita.html" title="Lolita">Lolita</a>! If there's something more that should be added to make this page more substantial, add it, but don't take away the page! --David_Costello 17:21, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> As popular a character as Finch is, he exists in a single novel, <a href="../../../t/o/_/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_45a9.html" title="To Kill a Mockingbird">To Kill a Mockingbird</a>. Is the character taken up as a subject in any source except in the context of the novel? Most of the information on the Finch page duplicates what's on the Mockingbird page. Put everything about Finch on the Mockingbird page and make the Finch page redirect to Mockingbird. (I think the individual pages for all the characters David Costello mentions should be merged into the pages for their respective novels, but I will start with the merge template with Atticus whom I care about.) --<a href="../../../m/e/y/User%7EMeyer_6dd4.html" title="User:Meyer">Meyer</a> 07:47, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> As important as Atticus is in the story of <a href="../../../t/o/_/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_45a9.html" title="To Kill a Mockingbird">To Kill a Mockingbird</a>, he exists only in the book and movie and the pages should be combined.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Yes, but...</b> Meyer has some good points, but does this article really just repeat what it already says in <a href="../../../t/o/_/To_Kill_A_Mockingbird_b818.html" title="To Kill A Mockingbird">To Kill A Mockingbird</a>? I don't think so: it provides information on Atticus' literary importance, the film version of Atticus and notes on the actor who played him, and information on the inspiration for the character, none of which appears in the book article. Granted, there are some things in <b>References in Popular Culture</b> that were borrowed from the book page, but I just put those in there to get other people interested in contributing anything I may have missed. Though confined to just one book, Atticus is a very unique character in American literature, and an article focusing exclusively on him would be a useful encyclopedic tool for literary students who don't yet know of his importance. --David_Costello 15:50, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Don't merge.</b> Besides, it would be useful to have a page on Atticus Finch that does not give away the ending of the book/movie, so that anybody who wants to learn about Atticus himself will not have to have the plot spoiled for them.</li>

It boils down to Atticus should be covered on the Mockingbird book and film pages <i>unless</i> there is so much material about him it makes one of the main pages too long, in which case he can get his own page. I challenge those of you who oppose the merge to beef-up this page as Darkcraft suggests (with good info. and not garbage) until there is too much good stuff to fit on the Mockingbird page. Then there would be no reason to merge it. --<a href="../../../m/e/y/User%7EMeyer_6dd4.html" title="User:Meyer">Meyer</a> 07:40, 5 March 2007 (UTC))</li>

<p>Oppose - Atticus Finch is not only a character in To Kill A Mockingbird, it's what he stands for that is important, so therefore he is more than a character, and seeing as this is an encyclopedia, it needs to have a seperate page for Atticus.--Bennelmes 21:27, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b>. Atticus is not simply a character in <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, he is an iconic figure in American literature. <i><b><a href="../../../b/i/b/User%7EBibliomaniac15_4b0f.html" title="User:Bibliomaniac15"><font color="black">bibliomaniac</font></a><a href="../../../b/i/b/User_talk%7EBibliomaniac15_e27b.html" title="User talk:Bibliomaniac15"><font color="red">1</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bibliomaniac15_b1b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bibliomaniac15"><font color="blue">5</font></a></b></i> 03:02, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b> I don't know if there is much of a novel without Atticus Finch. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDandyDan2007_1829.html" title="User:DandyDan2007">DandyDan2007</a> 00:16, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b>. Again, Atticus is a big-deal cultural figure who gets referenced all the time. Users might well have reason to learn directly about who Atticus is apart from their interest in Lee's novel, and discussion or mention of Atticus's cultural status and reception might be interesting and appropriate here, but significantly less appropriate in the discussion page for the book. (And, hey, if obscure Sonic the Hedgehog characters have their own Wikipedia entries, surely classic literary characters get them, too!) 152.2.205.209 00:43, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The standard for whether or not a fictional character should have its own WP page is not fame or literary significance or the existence of pages for unrelated silly characters. The standard is whether or not there is too much encyclopedia-quality information about the character assembled on WP to fit comfortably on the page for the literary work in which the character appears. Right now the Atticus Finch page is no more than a stub if you subtract unencyclopedic material and information that belongs on either the book or the film page. All your opposition to the page merge would carry a lot more weight if you spent even half the time you are now using posting oppose votes here in making improvements to the page. Prove your love for Atticus by making a page worthy of him. (Which page should be <i>Mockingbird</i>, I still think.) --<a href="../../../m/e/y/User%7EMeyer_6dd4.html" title="User:Meyer">Meyer</a> 03:57, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b> The fact that he is considered number one by AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains entitles him to a page of his own. Granted, reading through his article there is probably some things that can be trimmed. But certainly he is a notable character from To Kill a Mockingbird, and I would argue the only one notable enough to deserve an article. <a href="../../../b/_/c/User%7EB_cubed_4052.html" title="User:B cubed">b_cubed</a> 20:57, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I count four votes in favor of merging and 12 in opposition. Seeing that the two-weeks time (as alotted for such decisions) has expired since the bulk of the voting, this matter officially closed. As the opinion is decidedly against such a merger, Atticus Finch will not be merged into <a href="../../../t/o/_/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_45a9.html" title="To Kill a Mockingbird">To Kill a Mockingbird</a>. <a href="../../../b/_/c/User%7EB_cubed_4052.html" title="User:B cubed">b_cubed</a> 11:18, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it's a little misleading to say that Atticus completely abstains from violence--after all, he shoots the rabid dog and breaks his glasses while doing so, in a scene that has been interpreted (I think by Lisa Simpson, though I can't find a quotation) as an allegorical representation of the violence inherent even in the most civilized of us. Moreover, some people might think that killing an animal--even a rabid one--is a violent act.</p>
<p>(Interestingly, too, George Bailey only abstains from violence because he *can't*, right--he had that problem with his lung he got after saving his brother as a youth, giving the *brother* a chance to become a war hero!)</p>
<p>(But this is a quibble; certainly the spirit of the paragraph is apt.) 152.2.205.209 00:44, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
