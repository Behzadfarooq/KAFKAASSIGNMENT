<p>is it relevant to include these statistics? why did we not include the statistics of the prisoners, as well? this seems to show some inner bias in the article, as if the deaths of these officials were more sad and they were justified in the people they killed. "He had only worked their seven weeks." Regardless if this is a fact or not, that entire section seems like it's trying to get sympathy for the 'lost families.'

<p>What's up with the gratuitous movie references? It seems people have been going through wikipedia and adding any minor movie reference they can, regardless of whether or not it contributes to the value of the article. I mean, everything has been referenced in some movie or other, so what, are going to link every article to IMDB? Should we (somehow) play six degrees of Kevin Bacon with ancient history? Honestly, the attica riots were a horrible tragedy for everyone. The fact that some actor shouted one line of dialogue about it in some movie is taking a serious event and adding an utterly banal detail. -super90</p>

<li>One possible point of view is that such cultural references give evidence of how people remember the event long after it took place.

<p>I felt that there were too many meta-references to the Al Pacino movie, so I mentioned three of them in the paragraph about the Al Pacino itself and removed the rest.

<p>I just edited the "Cultural References" section for grammar and spacing, but can't figure out what the last paragraph (about "King of Queens") is trying to say.

<p>Let's not forget a few core realities. The people who were living in Attica Prison were not revolutionaries or political prisoners; they were criminals who had been convicted in open courts. And this was a prison riot, not some noble battle. This was a bunch of criminals who got together and decided to take over a prison, take some emloyees hostage, and kill some people. Anyone who thinks the rioters were heroes is either unaware of the facts or is deliberately ignoring them. <a href="../../../m/k/2/User%7EMK2_bdc2.html" title="User:MK2">MK2</a> 06:22, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In reverting an unsourced allegation that smacked of POV (something to do with gang rape) I also realised that two weeks ago an AOL IP also blanked the list of dead and cultural reference without leaving an edit summary. I have restored the cultural references. It might be better to cut it down, but that's the sort of thing we should discuss here; it certainly doesn't need to be blanked.

<p>I'm astonished you cite this source - www.libcom.org - as the basis for objective news reporting. It's hard-left propaganda site with its own interest in twisting and recolouring history. An equivalent would be citing the events of Kristallnacht entirely from the reports of the Volkische Beobachter. You have also repeatedly deleted the names of the those who were killed or injured, saying that 'wikipedia is not a memorial'. True enough but that list represents historical fact that I personally would have liked to have seen since it added to the context and the resolution of this incident.</p>

Also concerned about the statement, "all of the deaths has been caused by authorities retaking the prison."</p>

<p>How can this be a fact? A prison would have a armory, and most likely the prisoners would have looted it. Plus, some of the prison gaurds in some areas of the prison carried hand guns. This fact, just shows alot of bias to the entire article.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the sources section above, there's a source that claims the prisoners had no guns. Can you cite a source that counters this, rather than just supposition? <a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPearce.duncan_37bb.html" title="User:Pearce.duncan">Pearce.duncan</a> 01:21, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This is a widely-cited fact in every source I've ever read, watched or heard about the riot. Yes, Attica had an armory, but the inmates were qiuckly cut off from it. The hostage situation took place in areas generally accessable by inmates (cellblocks, exercise yards and the infirmary) but never reached areas of the facility where inmates weren't allowed (i.e. guard booths, front offices, armory, etc.) The rioters were able to take guards hostage and threatened them with homemade blades, but no credible source on either side has ever said that the inmates obtained guns.

<p>A couple ideas for improvement of the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>Governor Rockefeller's involvement in dealing with the prison riots should be discussed. Rockefeller refused to negotiate with the prisoners and was quick to order the raid that led to the death of the hostages. It was also supposedly his office that help spread the misinformation that the hostages had their throats slit.</li>
<li>For a time after the riots ended, the guards apparently tortured prisoners in retaliation for the riots and the deaths of their fellow guards. This led to several lawsuits by prisoners who claimed to have been received such torture. These lawsuits where eventually settled in favor of the prisoners.</li>
</ul>

<p>The opening paras to this article are biased "humble demands"... etc. An encyclopedia should not make value judgements re: the prisoners demands. Any objections before I add the NPOV tag? <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKristoferM_cd13.html" title="User:KristoferM">KristoferM</a> 19:58, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I removed the following three sentences:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>One of their most humble requests was for unrationed toilet paper.</li>
<li>The riots also revealed for the first time how American prison systems operated in regard to race issues, as many of the prison guards were seen as bigots.</li>
<li>Overall, this riot was shocking in how it exposed the racism of the prison system as Attica was a northern prison which many felt would be free of racism.</li>
</ul>
<p>which were the only obvious examples of npov I could find, and I removed the npov tag. How does it sound now? The article's tone does seem slightly sympathetic to the prisoners, leading with the conditions of the prison instead of, say, examples of the crimes the inmates had previously committed, but I don't think what remaining PoV there is warrants the tag. <a href="../../../k/z/n/User%7EKznf_b8a7.html" title="User:Kznf">Charles (Kznf)</a> 19:55, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>NPOV? Were reforms put into place? Did they get extra toilet paper? Why does EVERY historical event chronicled by Wikipedia have to make reference to pop music and movies?

<dd>Exactly. The Attica chant is a direct reference to Dog Day Afternoon, and only an <b>indirect</b> reference to the Attica Prison Riots. That is why the article first lists DDA, and directly people to that article (which has it's own cultural references section) and then lists <b>direct</b> cultural reference. <a href="../../../k/z/n/User%7EKznf_b8a7.html" title="User:Kznf">Charles (Kznf)</a> 19:05, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, I found a few references that stated that the chants of "attica attica" in some movies were references to the Dog Day Afternoon movie, but then I read this: <a href="http://www.courttv.com/archive/press/attica2.html" class="external free" title="http://www.courttv.com/archive/press/attica2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.courttv.com/archive/press/attica2.html</a> which indicates that it was a chant before Dog Day Afternoon. In any case, the chant itself seems to have outlasted, in cultural memory anyway, it's own context. Is this due more to the Dog Day Afternoon, or due to it's popularity at protests which DDA merely dramatized. Anyone who lived through the period care to cmment? <a href="../../../k/z/n/User%7EKznf_b8a7.html" title="User:Kznf">Charles (Kznf)</a> 18:59, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
