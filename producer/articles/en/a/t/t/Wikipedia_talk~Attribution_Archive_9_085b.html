<li>"Attribution" is obviously used in another sense in e.g. <a href="../../../a/t/t/Category%7EAttribution_templates_080e.html" title="Category:Attribution templates">Category:<b>Attribution</b> templates</a>, which is only about <i><a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyrights_92c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyrights">copyright</a></i>-related attribution.

<dd><i>Deductions of this nature should not be made if they serve to advance a position, or if they are based on source material published about a topic other than the one at hand.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't see the value of either part of this sentence. The first part seems to be a reference to NPOV, which this policy page is not supposed to cover. The second part I don't really understand at all and I think people trying to apply the policy won't understand it either. Can someone argue for keeping this sentence? --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero0000_a23c.html" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 23:59, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A key part of the existing policy of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> that I've often seen missed is that interpretations made to advance a position can be original research. In my mind, one of the more flagrant was Timeline skew theories for The West Wing, which took 3 AFDs (no consensus, no consensus, delete) to get rid of. That was by the second AFD full of citations that showed in show X incident Y was said to happen on Z date, but then built up mounds of argument about how all of these facts were supposed to demonstrate a skew of the timeline from reality, and cited nothing reliable on the timeline of the show as a whole. I've seen this piece of the policy missed so many times, that drumming it home by repetition is in my mind a good thing.</dd>
<dd>The current part of WP:NOR says "A and B, therefore C" is acceptable only if a reliable source has published this argument in relation to the topic of the article. This language is repeated in the paragraph immediately above the one you mention, and I don't have a reason to want it in both places. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a></dd>

<p>We have several sentences like this: "It should be possible for any reader without specialist knowledge to understand the deductions" and "Edits that rely on primary sources should only make descriptive claims that can be checked by anyone without specialist knowledge." I know this has been discussed before, but I think more discussion is needed because this rule is really really bad. I'll focus on just one serious problem that in my opinion kills it dead: <b>This rule eliminates almost all journal literature in the sciences.</b> If someone summarises material from the article "Asymptotics and bioavailability in a 17-compartment pharmacokinetic model with enterohepatic circulation and remetabolization" (Horkovics-Kovats and Zlatos, 2006), then I won't be able to check it because I don't have the required specialist knowledge. Does that mean I can revert the edit? Just because I am ignorant of pharmacokinetics (whatever that is)? <b>On the contrary</b>, we should welcome people who are able to read specialised sources and summarise them in plain language in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero0000_a23c.html" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 00:32, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Peer review doesn't change a primary source into a secondary source. Everything in a scientific paper is written by the people who created the knowledge. This can vary between disciplines; an extreme example is a mathematical paper which contains facts that came directly from the mathematician's brain. But in any case the first of the two examples I gave is not written in relation to primary sources, but rather all sources. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero0000_a23c.html" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 08:54, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The distinction between primary and secondary sources is most useful for history, and becomes less useful the farther you get from that field. The article on <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">Primary source</a> even start with the words "In historical scholarship..." When did the link to that article get removed from this policy?</dd>
<dd>I tend to consider math research papers to be somewhere between primary and secondary sources. I could see how a paper describing a chemistry experiment, but giving no analysis, could be viewed as a primary source. But any decent math paper not only presents new ideas but also analyzes them and places them in context; that sounds like a secondary source to me. Being peer-reviwed is mentioned by the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secondary_source.html" title="Secondary source">secondary source</a> article as a characteristic of secondary sources. An advanced book in mathematics may include previously unpublished theorems as well as giving a detailed development and analysis of previously known material. Again, that is a mixture of primary and secondary components. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 13:34, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As for Zero's original point, the sentences in question all concern deductions made by a Wikipedian, not a deduction of an expert publishing in a reliable source. If a peer-reviewed article on pharmokinetics claims that X1, X2, ..., X17, therefore Y, we may quote or summarize to that effect. Since Wikipedia is a general encyclopedia, the idea as summarized must be reasonably clear to educated readers who are not specialists in the relevant field. In all likelihood, those same non-specialists will be able (with effort) to verify that the article summarizes the article fairly, even if they don't follow the details. What must not be done is for a Wikipedian, based on his own knowledge of pharmokinetics, to say that if Y is true, then Z must also be true, unless the deduction is obvious even to non-specialists. Thus, if statement Y is "A is faster than B", then a Wikipedian may express this as "B is slower than A" without committing original research. (Yes, we have had idiots who argued that such a statement was OR.) Much beyond that requires a source. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 16:43, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, but even such elementary uncontentious deductions might require specialist knowledge just to understand the words used in the source. To continue the mathematics example, I think it is absurd to require than someone who never studied any mathematics should be able to look at a research paper and check that it confirms the summary that someone added to Wikipedia. If the source says "the antiderivative of cos(x) is sin(x)" then we should be able to write "the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x)" - this deduction is every bit as elementary and uncontestable as your faster/slower example but specialist knowledge is required to know that. What I'm thinking is that "It should be possible for any reader without specialist knowledge to understand the deductions" should be something like "It should be possible for any reader <b>with the background required to read the source</b> to understand the deductions". That wording probably needs work yet. Another example is when the source is in a rare language; we should not require that someone who doesn't know that language be able to check it. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero0000_a23c.html" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 22:51, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Saying "reader", as opposed to "Wikipedian", implies that one is an appropriate reader for the article. IIRC, that word choice was deliberate: we aren't limiting verifiability to the skills of a five-year-old. The article on pharmokinetics requires a certain amount of background to understand. Obviously, we needn't be concerned about attempts to verify by someone who lacks that necessary background. As for elementary calculus, I think it a tremendous stretch to call a course offered in high schools "specialist knowledge". The issue of whether to permit untranslated sources is controversial, and I don't think we have tried to settle that here. My personal opinion is that an untranslated source in French might be acceptable, but one in Hittite wouldn't be. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 23:19, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b></p>
<ul>
<li>I'm undecided. I was concerned about the direction the editing to this page took, and so I felt it was, for the time being, a failed policy, though I think the group of editors at the very beginning did a great job, and an early version could have worked. If it's to be revived now, I'd prefer to see it as a summary of NOR and V, without any policy change. It was the attempt to add a change that failed, because some people were opposed to any change, and others weren't prepared to settle for a small relaxation but kept wanting to expand the loophole. It had reached the point where some versions undermined the idea of having any sourcing policy at all. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:48, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The simplicity of using the exact RS and V wording for the exceptions has (hopefully) rendered this largely moot. When the page is live people will be conservative in expanding or contracting anything, so let's take it live with no innovations. Slim is there anything else on the page that you'd consider a policy change? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 17:54, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I have not participated in this page to date, although I supported the initial concept of combining V, RS, NOR into a single unified and coherent policy. I would agree with the above comments, that the way to go about getting this policy accepted is to maintain an exact copy of the existing component-level counterparts, except in cases where there is a clear conflict, where a reasonable compromise must be adopted. I would not deviate from the existing policies until this combo version is approved. Then it can evolve like any other policy. Are there people actually opposing the combined version on principle that V, RS and NOR should remain separate? <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrum375_9bc4.html" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> 00:48, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

If you don't like what the page says, discuss it; that's what people've been doing for the past months. This case is hardly "closed" given the activity here on the talk page. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 13:31, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>It wasn't a vote. It was a discussion starter. I think we are all grown ups here, and the straw poll was off to a perfectly agreeable atmosphere. Straw polls have long had legitimacy on WIkipedia, you've set a few up yourself in your time Radiant! This is a rather simple poll to resolve a rather simple issue, and saves tag warring. I dread to think that Wikipedia has descended to poll warring now. Whilst <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Polling_is_evil" class="extiw" title="m:Polling_is_evil">m:Polling is evil</a>, this poll doesn't come anywhere near the reasons why that essay exists. There really is no alternative to asking people if they feel the page should be tagged as rejected. It's a binary issue, and thus perfectly formed for polling. Let's not arbitrarily close all polls, because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy</a>. It's not my poll so I won't reinstate it, but I will assert <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a>'s right to do so and respect any decision Marskell makes in regard to this poll, barring a misreading of any potential outcome.&#160;;) <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 13:49, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks Steve. Absolutely this wasn't a vote on the proposal (hence I chose the rejected tag, rather than the policy tag—obviously no straw poll is going to settle a fundamental policy decision). Discussion is "what people've been doing for the past months". Yes, and it's getting pretty awful. This user would like to know whether it's worth putting time into this or if it's better to move on to other things. I know a number of users (including the person who started the page) think ATT is already dead. Let's see what comes up. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 13:57, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Put me in the "evil" support category - I think it's so dead that I don't keep up with it as regularly as I used to. It got off to a commendable start, but became sidetracked and abandoned, and since so few editors follow the page now, it no longer reflects any sort of broad consensus. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESandyGeorgia_ca9b.html" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 14:39, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I thought this proposal had died a long time ago. I wouldn't normally see any reason to mark something as rejected if it is still being worked on. However, the fact that after three months no consensus has been reached suggests to me that continuing to try and shape this into something acceptable to the community is likely to be a doomed effort, so I'll have to come down as weakly supporting adding the rejected tag (just out of a feeling that there could be more productive things to spend time on). On the actual proposal itself: the third exemption looks just as bad to me now as it did three months ago when the workshop fizzled out. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani"><span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span></a><a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYomangani_cde4.html" title="User talk:Yomangani"><sup>talk</sup></a> 15:10, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>A lot of people think that the third exception is necessary. It allows us to have articles covering topics that we would otherwise struggle to find adequate sources for. Whether these articles should be covered is not the subject of this proposal or of the policies it would replace; the guideline <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a> is the place for such concerns. I've yet to hear a good reason why it shouldn't be included, but I'd be happy to listen to one. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 15:33, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, this and the policies this page may replace are the places. Notability is a guideline page. Mark me as supporting the removal of the third exemption if that really is the sticking point. The second exemption should really be flexible enough to allow anything the third exemption is aiming to catch. What else do we need to move on to take this forward? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 16:03, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Another example that has been discussed is the use of Usenet sources in documenting the history of usenet. While there is at least one published book on this subject (and perhaps only one; my searches turn up two, but they appear to be the same book published by two different publishers), it is out of print and difficult to find copies of. However, there are plenty of sources available in archives of usenet material, both primary and secondary, that could be useful in writing such articles. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 16:42, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It should be obvious that I support the removal as well.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">FAQ?</span></h2>
<p>I've added a bit more from the NOR policy just to make sure the concept's nailed down. One concern I have is that we're missing the synthesis example from NOR; we put that on WP:ATT/FAQ to avoid taking up space. That synthesis example is one that a few editors have tried to get rid of because they see it as too strict, but it's in fact a very good example of the kind of subtle slide into OR via synthesis that a lot of editors engage in without realizing it. As the FAQ won't itself be policy, I'm a bit worried that, in making this page live, we've effectively given in to the people who wanted to get rid of the example. Would it make the page too wordy to include it here? It's <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html#Synthesis_of_published_material_serving_to_advance_a_position" title="WP:NOR">here on the NOR page</a>. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:42, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I too think that that synthesis example is excellent and you'll recall my badgering you about A + B = C. I have placed the example in; as with the other issues, I think the logic of repeating extant wording is sound. It only adds a bit and the page is still tight.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And I too am concerned about the (non-)policy status of the FAQ. I think we need to decide whether and what in what form we need it. The NPOV FAQ is policy; Francis rightly pointed that forking the page didn't make sense if the policy tag was lost, but in that case it was long-standing wording (it was critical that the pseudoscience section remained policy, for instance). If this FAQ is not to be policy, I'd suggest not having it at all; it will just muddle things. Remember that part of the point is to streamline the flabbiness of RS. We don't need an FAQ that duplicates it. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 19:33, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If WP:RS is to continue to exist, I think we can ditch ATT/FAQ. The point of the latter was to replace the former, but some editors are quite taken with RS, so there would be a fight. Maybe we should just forget getting rid of RS, at least for now, and focus on replacing NOR and V with ATT. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:47, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm going to object to this. I've written at length on <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_FAQ_4ce7.html" title="WP:ATT/FAQ">WP:ATT/FAQ</a> and will summarize here:</p>
<p>1) "Given the Chicago Manual of Style's definition of plagiarism, Jones did not commit it" is not original research. It's a simple logical deduction, and those aren't original research. That doesn't mean that the example is okay to use--but it does mean we're giving the *wrong explanation* for why the example is okay to use. The reason it's not okay to use is that the Chicago Manual of Style isn't a reliable source on Jones. The use of a logical deduction is irrelevant--if the Chicago Manual of Style had *directly* said "Jones isn't a plagiarist", it would be equally bad to use.</p>
<p>2) This example appears to refer to <a href="../../../a/l/a/Talk%7EAlan_Dershowitz_3e27.html#The_debate_with_Norman_Finkelstein" title="Talk:Alan Dershowitz">Talk:Alan Dershowitz#The debate with Norman Finkelstein</a>, and misrepresents that case. At least one editor attributes it to "James O. Freedman, the former president of Dartmouth College, the University of Iowa, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences"; James O. Freedman is the one who drew the conclusion from the Chicago Manual of Style, not us. If so, then the statement *can* be used (providing we accept him as a reliable source).</p>

<dd>I don't quite follow why you wouldn't like to call this <i>original</i> synthesis.</dd>

<dd>The reason I wouldn't like to call this original synthesis, or original research in any way, is that original research exempts simple logical conclusions. If some source says "Smith was born in New York City in 1960", I can write "Smith was born in the USA" without violating the original research policy, even though I've technically drawn a conclusion that is not in the source material.</dd>
<dd>Likewise, "The CMoS defines plagiarism to require X" and "Dershowitz didn't do X" can be used to form the conclusion "According to the CMOS's definition, Dershowitz is not a plagiarist". The process of drawing the conclusion itself requires only a simple logical deduction, and thus fails to be original research.</dd>
<dd>Of course, this statement is still unusable for other reasons, but not original research.
<dl>
<dd>why isn't it a reliable source on the issue.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Because the Chicago Manual of Style isn't an authority on the Dershowitz case, so any statements it makes about the case can't be used as sources. It would be just the same if the CMoS simply printed the statement "Dershowitz isn't a plagiarist", and we made no deduction (simple or otherwise) to get it. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 11:40, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">False attribution</span></h3>
<p>This runs slightly against the current trend (which I otherwise support) to minimize the changes from current policy. But I think now that we have the far better terminology of attribution, then synthesis can be discussed in terms of <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_attribution.html" title="False attribution">false attribution</a>. In the synthesis example, one is falsely attributing a conclusion to the Chicago Manual of Style. The article on false attribution has an example where Peter Doran's data on Antarctic temperatures is similarly synthesized to make case on global warming. The good thing with this approach is that it would cover other attribution fallacies like <a href="../../../q/u/o/Quoting_out_of_context.html" title="Quoting out of context">quoting out of context</a>, which are just as serious as synthesis. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 00:19, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you. I don't think it <i>is</i> a change to call the policy "attribution" instead of "verifiability," because in fact people already talk about whether things can be attributed, and the word "verifiability" is slightly misused in the policy. To verify something implies that we're confirming it to be true, which of course we're not; we're just seeking to attribute it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:55, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, yes, yes, this is precisely why I like this proposal. Attribution is not a change to how verifiability is properly understood on wikipedia, and experienced editors like yourself probably already think in terms of attribution, but for a new editor like me, the term "verifiability" is very strongly related to truth. Anyway, I'm going to sleep very happy&#160;:) I fully support the current proposal, or the one before my edit, which was just a minor aesthetic thing. The key point is that this proposal should not be rejected because of some details, the main idea is simply too good.

<p>And something else to add: The synthesis example seems to violate its own rules. "A and B, therefore C" is acceptable only if a reliable source has published this argument <b>in relation to the topic of the article.</b></p>

<dd>Hm. Perhaps we should blank the talk and just leave a big note: everthing used on ATT as proposed, is used now on extant P&amp;Gs. Perhaps the example should go, but we're leaving things in that are longstanding until this is live (this was an idea discussed at length above, in order to move the page forward). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 19:25, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is my impression that one of the things we are doing here is to clear up parts of the earlier policies/guidelines which are problems. I feel the Dershowitz example is seriously flawed and should not be in here.</dd>
<dd>And I'm not convinced that it will be possible to modify Attribution after it becomes a policy. It's very hard to get policies modified; if there's something wrong with it, it should be fixed before it becomes policy.

<dd>Well, OK: for five months this page attempted to amend policy. Very recently it was suggested that we simply cut &amp; paste from long-standing examples. I understand there's a flip-side to this coin (that it will be hard to amend it once live) but that's part of the point: a conservative process is the only thing that's likely to get us at least out of the starting gate (merging V and NOR into ATT). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 19:58, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's nothing wrong with the example; a complicated deduction is a complicated deduction, and claiming that Dershowitz plagiarized based on <i>your</i> reading of the Chicago Manual of Style is inevitably that. It's not adding up a column of numbers. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:20, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It isn't a complicated deduction. It's a *simple* deduction. It's utterly clear whether or not Dershowitz's actions, as described, fit the Chicago Manual of Style's definition; they do not. If the Chicago Manual of Style said that plagiarism was a type of canine, would you claim that deciding whether a wolf meets that definition is a "complicated deduction"?</dd>
<dd>Now, there are certainly reasons why you might not want to accept the conclusion; you might not, for instance, believe that the description of Dershowitz's actions is accurate, or you might not think that the Chicago Manual of Style's definition is an appropriate one to use. But while those are legitimate reasons to reject the conclusion, they are *other* types of reasons, and should be accurately characterized.</dd>
<dd>The example is also bad because it implies that the Chicago Manual of Style connection was only made by a Wikipedia editor and that no actual source was found for it. This is less of a problem because someone probably won't realize the connection unless they stumble on the Dershowitz article like I did, but it still isn't really what happened; in fact, a source was used and <a href="../../../d/e/r/Dershowitz-Finkelstein_affair_ecfc.html#Dershowitz.27s_response" title="Dershowitz-Finkelstein affair">Dershowitz-Finkelstein_affair#Dershowitz's response</a> still includes it. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 04:14, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>There are certainly better examples of WP:SYNT, and maybe one could start a guideline on synthesis to just collect different examples. This will be a serious problem though, because there is no real consensus on SYNT, see <a href="#Analysis_of_facts_from_statistical_surveys" title="">#Analysis of facts from statistical surveys</a>. Maybe having all the SYNT discussion on a separate page and attempt to reach a common understanding on this issue is a good enough reason to create a WP:Synthesis guideline... In any case, I don't think there is much point in trying to change the example in this proposal without that. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 04:46, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But I'm *not* claiming that Dershowitz plagiarized. I'm not even claiming that a conclusion saying so belongs in a Dershowitz article. I *agree* that the conclusion is out of place and should not be used as given--just that it is so for different reasons than people like Jayjg think. You can't just take something that's unusable for a different reason and claim that it's unusable because it's synthesis. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 17:45, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Steve, we can put in a sentence somewhere if you want, but it doesn't need its own section, because it's obvious. If the source has no name (and I mean written by an anon, published by an anon), then we don't know who the source is, and can't judge reliability. Therefore, it clearly fails the criteria. If, on the other hand, Bob Woodward publishes material he says he obtained from an anon source, that doesn't affect us, because our source is Bob Woodward in The Washington Post. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:51, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's not obvious. It may be to me and you, but I've been wiki-lawyered on this. Now if we never link to anonymous sources then we've got to say that somewhere in policy. All we have currently is guidance at WP:RS. I like what we have at the FAQ, which is where I copied that from, but it can't be guidance. There needs to be something. If you guys can work a sentence in, great.

<dd>At the risk of bogging us down again, if we write something about anon sources, we're going to have to say what we mean by a source, because we'll have to explain something like the Bob Woodward example. Jossi and I disagree about this. For me, a reliable source can be either the writer or the publisher of that person's work. So sometimes the reliability attaches to the writer, and we don't care where he's published, because he's so credible. At other times, the reliability attaches to the publisher, and we don't care who the writer is, or the writer's source, or indeed the source's source. Jossi disagrees, and wants us to regard whatever document we decide is reliable, for whatever reason, as our source; for Jossi, people are never our sources. I can see the merit in both positions, but we're going to have to choose one before any sentence(s) on anon sources can be written. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 01:05, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just a quick one, I think it makes a great difference if distancing language or prose attributions are used. When we use a prose attributions then the more important thing is that the person is reliable, but if we are stating a scientific fact and attributing it with a simple footnote, then this better be from a peer-reviewed publication, not a famous physicists personal homepage. So I think this is very difficult and I don't see how you can set it out in the policy.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Self-published sources again</span></h2>
<p>We've just had a change back to excluding self-published sources except in articles narrowly about the author of the source. This does, of course, exclude plenty of current uses of self-published sources that are totally legitimate. I don't want to have to use <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> to justify the existence of almost every source on <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timecube.html" title="Timecube">Timecube</a> or most of the sources on <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">scientology</a>. Let's fix this problem now: articles that relate to the author (as <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timecube.html" title="Timecube">Timecube</a> relates to Gene Ray and <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">scientology</a> does to L. Ron Hubbard) are a perfectly acceptable place to use a self-published source. Right? <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 21:08, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this help:</li>

<ul>
<li>Actually, the real problem with the new wording is that it's ambiguous: <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> is "<b>about</b>" L. Ron Hubbard almost as much as <a href="../../../l/2E/_/L._Ron_Hubbard_3ec8.html" title="L. Ron Hubbard">L.

<ul>
<li>Just to point out, I don't think this is new wording. It's the established policy and guidance copied verbatim from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 21:42, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, but it was altered here because of a strong movement, arguably consensus, to do so. I'm not sure the intended effect of "about", to stop pseudophysics from getting into physics articles, will work; this wording permits "Gene Ray says that this physical phenomenon is explained by the Time Cube&lt;:ref&gt;Time Cube site..." almost as much as the one that was there yesterday. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> <small><a href="../../../p/m/a/User_talk%7EPmanderson_2413.html" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a></small> 21:51, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You're going to have to quote me the exact section that is the problem and explain again the problem. I'd argue that there just plain shouldn't be an article on <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timecube.html" title="Timecube">Timecube</a> for starters, if we have no reliable sources to source the article from. What's the issue at scientology? And why isn't <i>The Guardian</i> cited once in that article? <a href="http://browse.guardian.co.uk/search?search=Scientology" class="external autonumber" title="http://browse.guardian.co.uk/search?search=Scientology" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, particularly <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,,1966433,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,,1966433,00.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 22:30, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>IMO: If a crank idea is sufficiently notable to be mentioned in reliable sources -- and especially if it was studied as a sociological phenomenon -- then I think it deserves an article. If a idea is discredited among specialists, but believed by enough non-specialists to have a measurable impact on the world, it deserves an article. If a system of belief has millions of adherants, then the fundamental works of that system are primary sources and should be so handled. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 01:45, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Let's <i>not</i> fix this now. This is verbatim wording from current policy, so it's not rigged one way or another.

<li>To add: I don't think you need to invoke IAR for Timecube. They're modest, but you have at least two reliable sources for the page, that I see. "Ray spoke at Georgia Tech in April of 2005" should not be cited to his blog, however. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 08:15, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whoever wants to propose a change should do so on the NOR or V talk pages for now. This page is just a summary of the existing policies, and the point of it is simply to have them on one page instead of two, and to get rid of the ambiguity of "verifiability". <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:55, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>We are slightly more tolerant of keeping uncited information. In particular we have eliminated the "Be careful not to go too far on the side of not upsetting editors by leaving unsourced information in articles for too long..."</li>
<li>We don't have the "If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it."

<li>The official policy defers citing sources to the guideline, while we are trying to specify it. This was recently discussed <a href="#In-line_citation" title="">here</a>.</li>

</li>
<li>The section <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html#What_is_excluded.3F" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR#What is excluded?</a> has been renamed <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html#What_is_original_research.3F" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT#What is original research?</a> and adds the distinction between "unattributed" and "unattributable" material.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What is not original research?</span></h2>
<p>This is a new section and I understand why this is needed, but I have been dragged into conflicts with editors on obvious issues and such discussions aren't very helpful. I prefer not to have discussions on what is "obviously right" at all... Could we perhaps add something to stress again that the burden of proof is on the editor who wants to include an obvious deduction <i>to find a source for it</i>. That is, if another editor, who doesn't have a disruptive history, is challenging an "obvious" deduction, then a source is really needed, not just further arguments on the talk page. Of course one should read such explanation, but one should have the right to just say "Look, I read you arguments, and I still disagree, please provide a source for you interpretations." I hope you know what I mean... --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 22:46, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just to note that I wrote this after auditing the differences and I personally no longer think this is an issue at all.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Diligent dissident's scythe</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>I've been reading this effort intermittently for months, and have scanned the archives, but haven't yet found a discussion about what has seemed to me the HUGE problem that this policy change seems likely to cause -- not at the policy level, but at the ground level where articles actually get edited: The policy knocks out vast swathes of fairly stable articles built on "common knowledge" (i.e. without citations), or self-published web sources. Fine, these articles will gradually get properly sourced, spurred by this new policy. Yet on an increasing number of articles, a diligent dissident's "sourced" but skewed insertions are held at bay by the consensus of the group. That dissident is being handed a huge scythe here to wreak havoc on otherwise stable articles by tagging or deleting material that is widely accepted but under-sourced, in retaliation for his own "sources" being excluded or minimized. For examples of such dissidence, see <a href="../../../p/r/e/Talk%7EPretender_2ea1.html#Dom_Rosario_Poidimani.2C_again" title="Talk:Pretender">Talk:Pretender#Dom Rosario Poidimani, again</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/l/Talk%7EFolke_Bernadotte_6102.html#Neutrality_Tag" title="Talk:Folke Bernadotte">Talk:Folke Bernadotte#Neutrality Tag</a>, and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Talk%7EMichael_I_of_Romania_26c2.html#Needs_work" title="Talk:Michael I of Romania">Talk:Michael I of Romania#Needs work</a> (in the first and last article, sockpuppets are used, but the reality is that all editors are in agreement except for the dissident). I expect that editors, faced with a dissident newly armed with this policy, will give up rather than try to respond to innumerable <sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags deployed by the dissident to wear down vigilance on the article and resistance to his edits (see <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Ilyinsky_6641.html" title="Paul Ilyinsky">Paul Ilyinsky</a> for an example of how such tags have virtually frozen substantive input to an article since November '06). How is it expected for this to be handled? <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 17:55, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Related to the "persistent dissident's scythe" problem, it seems to me has been the reliance upon well-respected websites for information in obscure or largely abandoned historical fields, where the author has put effort into research and taken advantage of web technology to put it online, rather than into getting their work published in traditional print media. I'm talking especially about research areas where there is virtually no other <i>updated</i> information available, or available in English. Examples include <a href="http://www.genealogics.org/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.genealogics.org/index.php" rel="nofollow">Leo van de Pas Genealogics</a> on obscure royal and noble families which is heavily vetted on <a href="http://groups.google.es/group/soc.genealogy.medieval/topics?hl=en" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.es/group/soc.genealogy.medieval/topics?hl=en" rel="nofollow">soc.genealogy.medieval</a>, and <a href="http://4dw.net/royalark/" class="external text" title="http://4dw.net/royalark/" rel="nofollow">Christopher Buyers' Royal Ark</a> on non-Western dynasties, and <a href="http://pages.prodigy.net/ptheroff/gotha/gotha.htm" class="external text" title="http://pages.prodigy.net/ptheroff/gotha/gotha.htm" rel="nofollow">Paul Theroff's Online Gotha</a> which updates changes in reigning and deposed Western dynasties and noble families. All three of these sites are constantly in use and under discussion at <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.talk.royalty/topics?hl=en" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.talk.royalty/topics?hl=en" rel="nofollow">alt.talk.royalty</a> and other forums that debate royalty &amp; nobility. They are widely cited in Wiki articles on royalty &amp; nobility, because there are simply no published substitutes for these sources, and because the editors are well-known online for accuracy in research, bias-control, and receptiveness to corrections. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 17:55, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I would disagree. WP:ATT is based in the <i>already existing</i> policies of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. On the basis of these policies alone, the articles that you refer to could be "attacked" by dissidents with as much power with, or without WP:ATT. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">(talk)</a></small> 18:11, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agreed, WP:ATT isn't changing the official <i>policy</i>, but it will change the <i>norm</i> -- indeed, isn't that what's intended? Now, challenges are frequently made to content perceived as POV, but <i>much</i> less frequently to content that is undersourced yet widely considered accurate. WP:ATT <i>encourages</i> editors to challenge undersourced material <i>even if it is believed to be accurate</i>. Hopefully, most editors will apply the new policy prudently. But what thought has been given to the impact of editors who see the new policy as a means of putting disputed insertions on the same footing as content broadly deemed acceptable (even if still awaiting appropriate sourcing)? Is it your assumption that this outcome won't result? <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a>

<dl>
<dd>"<i>The burden of evidence lies with the editor wishing to add or retain the material.</i>" and "<i>Any unsourced material may be removed...</i>" Again, it's acknowledged that these aren't new policies. But the point and effect of refining and re-iterating them is to <i>emphasize</i> their applicability and to legitimate <i>all</i> intolerance of undersourced content. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 05:38, 8 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I really don't see how this policy encourages anything that the old policy didn't already encourage. The section on <b>How to cite and request a source</b> seems far from encouraging the addition of lots of fact tags. In practice, I think most people never read past the first paragraphs, which are quite similar to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 12:34, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The current policy will <i>replace</i> <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and therefore it must re-iterate much of what it says. If you look at the above <a href="#Differences_from_current_policy" title="">#Differences from current policy</a>, you will see that the current proposal has slightly reformulated the "burden of proof" concept precisely to discourage editors to challenge undersourced material <i>if it is believed to be accurate</i>. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 16:31, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>That dissident is being handed a huge scythe here to wreak havoc on otherwise stable articles by tagging or deleting material that is widely accepted but under-sourced, in retaliation for his own "sources" being excluded or minimized</i>. Belated comment: very much agreed. This is under discussion elsewhere in relation to science/medical topics, where it's fairly common to have daft but well-sourced pseudoscientific assertions making notability, but no sourced refutation. This is happening in <a href="../../../m/u/c/Mucoid_plaque.html" title="Mucoid plaque">Mucoid plaque</a>, where one editor has more or less has free rein to post whatever assertion is available for this theory, but very few medical refutations are available. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 11:54, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, if he refuses too much criticism then how will he establish notability? And if he can establish notability, then we just hope there will be criticism. I think the dilemma works, such people will either have to accept independent reports or they face deletion. In the case of this mucoid plaque, it is highly dubious, and has no media coverage. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 17:22, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Intentions of restructure...</span></h2>
<p>I did a little restructure with the intention of easing the transition to this new policy, meaning I want to make it clear this isnt' anything very new, but one section of NOR and one section of V, and attribution is simply the uniting concept. It also makes sense for <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> shortcuts to redirect to the NOR section in the future, and similarly for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> except the title might be confusing. What is contained in our section "Reliable sources" is precisely <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and the shortcut <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> should probably lead to the FAQ&#160;:) At some point the old shortcuts could be deprecated, but it makes sense to have them during the transition. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 20:08, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In response to SlimVirgin's revert edit comment: I partially agree, and I was myself concerned with that. I will leave it be for now, except I'm sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution&amp;diff=98298932&amp;oldid=98296021" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Attribution&amp;diff=98298932&amp;oldid=98296021" rel="nofollow">guilty</a> of a similar re-ordering already, and let's at least amend that previous one and move the BLP back up. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 20:27, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Except, I can't think of where to put it without disrupting the flow... I'll leave it up to you guys. I short argument about me moving relevant stuff down, note that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is structured like that: it first states you need to cite sources, then tells you what to you should cite from. It's not that illogical when you think about it&#160;:) --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 20:31, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
