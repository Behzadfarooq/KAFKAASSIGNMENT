<h2><span class="mw-headline">Success?</span></h2>
<p>The article says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"In terms of its own objectives, the attack on Pearl Harbor was a tactical success which far exceeded the expectations of its planners."</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's the damndest definition of success I think I've ever seen. It brings the major industrial power into a war Japan is already over-extended with in China. It misses crucial targets in the harbor. It ignores major objectives (the carriers) Nagumo was <i>expressly ordered</i> to find &amp; sink, even at the cost of <i>half his carrier strength</i>. For "success" like that, an American or British admiral would've been court martialed, &amp; rightly. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrekphiler_ea82.html" title="User:Trekphiler">Trekphiler</a> 12:08, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A <i>tactical</i> success can be a <i>strategic</i> blunder. Nagumo couldn't sink the carriers because they weren't there. As you pointed out in another comment, Nagumo was operationing at extreme range from his bases. How long could he have searched or waited for the missing carriers? Trade three Japanese carriers for three American ones? Would that have been a good deal?</dd>

<dd>From the Japanese POV, yes. Their plan (however misguided) was to form an impenetrabe barrier defense around SWP &amp; hold it while the US became too exhausted to continue &amp; settled for a negotiated peace. (That IJN was incapable of protecting merchant traffic made nonsense of this, but nobody in Japan saw it, &amp; <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chester_Nimitz_b0a6.html" title="Chester Nimitz">Nimitz</a> underestimated it.) So, too, failing to attack the tank farms, Navy Yard, power station, Sub Base [!]--&amp; the old HQ Building, where <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypo.html" title="Hypo">Hypo</a> was located... Anything delaying a US counterattack was worth the sacrifice, given the barrier strategy. Not to mention Nagumo's <i>express orders</i>, or do you think disobeying a direct order in this way is defensible? (It's all too common among Japanese admirals. <i>Cf</i> <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Leyte_Gulf_14ce.html" title="Battle of Leyte Gulf">Leyte</a>) See Willmott's <i>Barrier &amp; the Javelin</i> especially, also Blair's <i>Silent Victory</i> &amp; Holmes' <i>Double-Edged Secrets</i> for the targets (tho I think Willmott mentions them all). <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrekphiler_ea82.html" title="User:Trekphiler">Trekphiler</a> 23:58, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks it could be this telegram coming from the Ambassador of Japan. I'm not sure if it was the same Ambassador who met with Truman (or someone at least from the Roosevelt administration) who tried to prevent the U.S that an attack will happen at Pearl Harbour (not if he was kept silenced by authorities) but was kept in the White House until the attack happen. So probably it was not a surprised attack that the U.S was aware of it and maybe let it happen.</p>

<p>125. A member of the Embassy was told by my ------- colleague that from many quarters, including a Japanese one, he had heard that a surprise mass attack on Pearl Harbor was planned by the Japanese military forces, in case of "trouble" between Japan and the United States; that the attack would involve the use of all the Japanese military facilities. My colleague said that he was prompted to pass this on because it had come to him from many sources, although the plan seemed fantastic.</p>

<p>I'm sure this has been discussed before in many forms, but ... I wikied this randomly, searching for "Battle of Pearl Harbor", and was surprised to be redirected to "Attack on Pearl Harbor". Is there some technical military distinction I'm missing here between a "battle" and an "attack"?</p>
<p>Put another way, are there other examples of Wikipedia articles about "two military forces engage in combat" that are titled "Attack on (X)"? I note also that it's categorized under "Battles of Japan"/"Battles of the United States". --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenkiNeko_608f.html" title="User:GenkiNeko">GenkiNeko</a> 19:33, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I checked out the Talk archives, and saw that this was discussed way back in 2002. However, I'm not sure why the outcome of that debate was to make it "Attack on Pearl Harbor". I agree with the point made there that even if one side is ill-prepared or surprised, it's still a battle - just one where the attacker has done well on the intel side of things.</p>
<p>The one angle I could see in favor of it being an "attack" and not a "battle" (suggested by a friend of mine) is that war hadn't been declared yet. On the other hand, the conflicts of the Vietnam War are listed as "Battles". What's the story here? --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenkiNeko_608f.html" title="User:GenkiNeko">GenkiNeko</a> 19:39, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Battle" implies opposing forces fighting each other. This is closer to a "raid", in which one force inflicts surprise damage against little opposition. I'd argue against changing it to "battle". Since the article name has been stable for years, substantial support should exist for a name change before it's enacted. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 21:03, 24 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that this should be thoroughly discussed beforehand. As to the "raid" idea, that makes intuitive sense to me; my concern is that I haven't seen a whole lot of <i>other</i> articles about similar events that use that terminology. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGenkiNeko_608f.html" title="User:GenkiNeko">GenkiNeko</a> 22:35, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Its most common name is Attack on Pearl Harbor. I've rarely(Actually, never) heard it called Raid on Pearl Harbor. Bombing of Pearl Harbor I have a few times. However, I'm sure most people when looking for this article type in Attack on Pearl Harbor.

<dd>It's unlikely any one phrase wil lsatisfy all. And all this was debated earlier in this article's history. See the archives o fhte talk page.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Nagumo's decision to withdraw after two strikes</span></h2>
<p>This whole section sounds like unencyclopedic speculation, but I've only removed the most blatant sentence: "Nagumo must have been very happy to suffer no losses and very probably did not want to push his luck." Even if that sentence was copied verbatim from a published source, it sounds like a wild guess. At the <i>very</i> least, the <i>very</i> excess use of the word "very" could be avoided where it <i>very probably</i> could be worded better (irony intended)&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJaksmata_9204.html" title="User:Jaksmata">Jaksmata</a> 17:48, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey guys.</p>
<p>Right...</p>
<p>Singapore Burning, by Colin Smith (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-141-01036-3</a>) informs us that a particular Commander Genda (attache of IJNAF @ Japanese Embassy, London) was quite impressed by the raid on the Italian Fleet @ Taranto, Italy by the RN, and wrote a careful appraisal that was sent to Tokyo. Susequentley IJNAF pilots honed their skills with the knowledge of the tactics used at Taranto.</p>

<dd>Actually, I'm not sure there's too much information, though I can certainly identify several points I would not have made. What I think is wrong is the presentation, which is flaccid and has no distinction by now. Everyone throws in a fact or two, making little attempt to leave a readable article / section / paraagraph behind. Adding something sometimes requires rewiritng of much more than a sentence or two, if the article is to be still readable. Nearly always possible, but too few have been willing to put in the time and effort.</dd>
<dd>The Colonel's objection is too simple, I think. Yes it's a long artlcie, but then it's a big subject and still the central concern of many, 65 some years later. See the alternative theories artlce if in doubt. Thus, I predict that no effort to produce a stremlined Brittanica article, the Colonel's ideal I suspect, will ever succeed. <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 15:29, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I believe that the list of fleets and forces should be removed, because it's way too much detail.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">By the numbers</span></h2>
<p>Let me make more controversy. The article says US losses were heavy. 2400 KIA isn't heavy, against a potential over 20000. Also, the infobox has Japan with 441 a/c. This looks to me to include every <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scout_plane.html" title="Scout plane">VS</a> on every IJN <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruiser.html" title="Cruiser">cruiser</a> &amp; <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battleship.html" title="Battleship">battleship</a>. Nagumo's six decks had 359 a/c between them; they were the strike force, so that's the important number. <i>Cf</i> Willmott's <i>Barrier &amp; the Javelin</i> &amp; Sakai &amp; Caidin's <i>Zero</i>, among others, for exact numbers. The 20000 figure is a postwar comment by <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chester_Nimitz_b0a6.html" title="Chester Nimitz">Nimitz</a>, mentioned in Holmes' <i>Double-Edged Secrets</i> (&amp; likely elsewhere). <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrekphiler_ea82.html" title="User:Trekphiler">Trekphiler</a> 00:20, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Looks like someone counted some lost a/c more than once. Can you, or any reader of this comment, provide better ones. My memory reports something less than 100 a/c lost, and I think that's high. It was a very efficient attack from an IJN view. Lots of damage to the enemy and little to them. Good trade off for them. <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 04:19, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I doubt it was double-counting, just somebody failing to distinguish between striking &amp; recon a/c. Japan lost an astonishingly low 29 birds; I'm unclear if that includes a/c damaged beyond repair or recovery accidents, but my understanding is all were directly due to enemy action. It was an exceptional tradeoff, product of surprise. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrekphiler_ea82.html" title="User:Trekphiler">Trekphiler</a> 20:23, 12 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>First off, 15% of a force killed or wounded is not "comparatively light", especially if the comparison is against the 64 killed on the other side. 40-1 KIA's is a heavy loss in any fight.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The comment on heavy losses is also regarding materiel, not just human losses, the Japanese lost 4 minisubs and 29 a/c, while the US lost 4 battleships, &amp; five other ships, and 188 a/c. To say the losses were comparatively light implies the minisubs had the near value of a battleship and a destroyer, and 6-1 ship losses is also "comparatively heavy", not "comparatively light. Second, calling the ships lost obsolete without citation seems to weaken the results of the attack. Yes, the planes and ships were obsolete by today's standards, but they were our Pacific Fleet at the time, equivalent to the Japanese forces, and they seemed to be pretty formidable to the Japanese, so much so that they attacked them. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodeCarpenter_0b40.html" title="User:CodeCarpenter">CodeCarpenter</a> 22:51, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I was counting the materiel losses. It was comparative to the <i>potential</i> losses, not to the <i>Japanese</i> losses, which is the usual standard. It "seems to weaken the results of the attack"? That's the idea. The Japanese missed the boat, destroying ships &amp; planes that would play small or no part in the war even had they survived. And it's not "obsolete by today's standards"; they were obsolete <i>at the time</i>. (If you don't know that, maybe you shouldn't criticize comments by people who do.) And how formidable to the Japanese they were isn't the issue, either. IJN was in the grip of a faulty doctrine, &amp; we shouldn't be endorsing it; the idea is to present a <i>historical</i> view, not parrot the contemporary mistakes. Furthermore, I wouldn't put too much emphasis on it; the attack on Pearl Harbor was as much a political statement, an attack on British-American unity, as on the Fleet. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrekphiler_ea82.html" title="User:Trekphiler">Trekphiler</a> 18:12, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"First, for classic battleship warfare, the relative isolation of Hawaii would make it difficult for any naval fleet to be outflanked"</dd>

<p>I'm unaware of naval warfare <i>allowing</i> "any naval fleet to be outflanked". Also, I rewrote this:</p>

<p>I've always understood the "Co-Prosperity Sphere" to be a political entity unconnected with strategy.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Stuffing</span></h2>
<p>The article says, "For pre-attack reconnaissance, two planes from the 8th Cruiser Division secretly scouted the Hawaii for the US aircraft carriers and targets, and so for the possibility of counter-attack." IIRC, this is confirmed by Dickson &amp; Goldstein in <i>Pearl Harbor Papers</i>.</p>
<p>Also, it says, "<a href="../../../m/a/r/Marine_Corps_Base_Hawaii_d7c4.html" title="Marine Corps Base Hawaii">Kāne<font face="Lucida Sans Unicode">ʻ</font>ohe Marine Corps Base</a>".

<p>Also, I deleted "First Attack Unit engaged the enemy from the right flank." and "Second Attack Unit engaged the enemy from the left flank." Navy bases don't have flanks. This isn't <a href="../../../d/e/e/Star_Trek%7E_Deep_Space_9_44c2.html" title="Star Trek: Deep Space 9">"DS9"</a>.</p>
<p>Also, I corrected the quote "This is not a drill" to "This is not drill." The "a" was not included in the actual message.</p>
<p>Also, I deleted "threat from U.S. submarines". This was very exaggerated.</p>
<p>I question "Nagumo was under strict orders not to risk his command any more than necessary." He had orders to find &amp; sink the U.S. carriers even if it meant loss of half his strike force.</p>

<p>This is nonsense, &amp; I deleted it. Japan's primary effort from 1931-1945 was China. "Cooperative efforts against British and Russian holdings" didn't exist, nor were there any Axis plans for them. The Germans &amp; Japanese couldn't even come to a firm agreement on supplying U-boats.</p>

<p>The article said "which detailed the administration's plan to provoke a war with Japan." This is <i>nonsense</i>, &amp; I deleted it. I've read the memo, reproduced in Stinnet, which I've also read. It's not supported by the facts, &amp; you have to believe in a conspiracy to read it as a "plan to provoke a war with Japan". <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrekphiler_ea82.html" title="User:Trekphiler">Trekphiler</a> 07:59, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"The Pearl Harbor attack was a brilliant tactic, but part of a strategy based on the belief that a spirit as firm as iron and as beautiful as cherry blossoms could overcome the materially wealthy United States. That strategy was flawed, and Japan's total defeat would follow.[24]" This sounds far too literary for any encyclopedia. Also, the bit on FDR knowing in advance should be more detailed in discussion/refutation. 75.68.6.81 12:49, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see the problem. The Foreign Office had oredered destruction of all but one Purple machine at the Washington Embassy, and for such high level messages only one or two poeople were aloowed to work on them (decryption, translation, typing, ...). The US had staffing problems (limited numbers of Japanese speakers, for instance), but it certainly had more available staff and so was faster. And so I'm not clear quite what your objection is/was. <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 07:39, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Cant't agree with your 'comparatively light' characterization. It's widely felt to have been a monstrous loss, and is proportionally high as well (see earlier analysis on this point above here). <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 19:46, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"It's widely felt to have been a monstrous loss"? I'm not persuaded. However "widely felt" it is, the professionals who opine on it disagree. Nimitz (who should damn sure know) felt the Navy got off easy. Consider: 7 battleships with crews around 1500 each; about 12 cruisers, about 1000 each; about 30 destroyers, about 150 each; 2 Army infantry divisions, 20-30000; a Navy patrol wing &amp; 2 AAF fighter groups, about 3000; &amp; I don't know how many Marines. Against that, 2400 KIA/1200 WIA <i>is</i> "compratively ligt", regardless how "widely felt to have been a monstrous loss". I'm changing it back.
