<h2><span class="mw-headline">Surprise attack by Japanese?</span></h2>
<p>fish n chips r 2 be eatin a sailin boat There appears to be some controversey with regard to this being a surprise attack by the Japanese. This attack did not come out of nowhere. Almost certainly the Japanese were goaded into it. But even more compelling is the plausibility that the government and military of the USA knew this attack was coming and did nothing about it so as to propel the USA into WWII.</p>

<dd>What a complete load of crap. Conspiracy is fashionable. Stupidity is more likely, &amp; what really happened. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrekphiler_ea82.html" title="User:Trekphiler">Trekphiler</a> 08:01, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On the question of prior knowledge (by DC, by ONI, by the Brits, by the Dutch, by Roosevelt / Knox / Stimson / Gen Marshall / Adm Stark, etc,) see a long comment by ww in the talk archive linked above. On the question of why conspiracy should be taken so seriously in the absence of anything other than plausible sounding allegations thereof (like more than suggestive evidence, even compelling evidence), I can suggest only two things.</dd>
<dd>First, FDR (and Eleanor and all those eggheads he brought to Washington when he was elected) really annoyed (scared, infuriated, , &lt;pick your own term(s)&gt;) a hefty percentage of folks, usually those with a vested interest in keeping things 'as they had been'. The Republicans generally were not very favorably inclined as he kept beating them at the polls, sometimes embarrassingly so. The Supreme Court was certainly opposed to many of the initiatives FDR got going and closed them down in many cases, which resulted in the FDR attempt to dilute opposition amongst the Supremes by expanding the Court. A case in serious oppositional point is the coup attempt (if it really was one) exposed by <a href="../../../s/m/e/Smedley_Butler_6a12.html" title="Smedley Butler">Smedley Butler</a> (retired Marine Corps Gen and winner of the Medal of Honor) and a Philadelphia journalist. It involved a DuPont heir/executive, some high powered corporate lawyers, and even, apparently, <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Smith_22a8.html" title="Al Smith">Al Smith</a>. Probably. These folks were so irritated at FDR that they (may have) organized a coup. The House UnAmerican Activities Committee was begun as a result of Butler's exposure of the approach made to him. Its first task was to look into the supposed coup. It was unable to conclude there was a real plot, beyond a few irresponsible folks looking into something, which may have died a very early death as a result of Butler's exposure.</dd>
<dd>Second, there are always people whose minds don't work the way most folks' do. And I don't mean clinically committable, though there are a non-trivial number of those as well; just characteristically conspiratorial. They always see sinister forces behind the scenes, or at least reason to suspect such things are there. Suspicious folk these are. Perhaps from long unrequited practice, they are skilled at explaining their view(s) and patient in repeating it over and over. Most folks don't trouble themselves to study somewhat remote issues, aren't familiar with any of the groundwork or 'evidence', and are somewhat easily convinced by a passionately and sincerely argued seemingly plausible case for conspiracy. It's in the nature of things that there aren't very many people arguing passionately and sincerely for the common sense, non spectacular, non conspiracy, account of &lt;whatever&gt;. And so, there is, in a mass media saturated world (in which large numbers of not very informed folk can be readily reached) a ready audience for such advocates, especially in the absence of any media sales market for the non spectacular, non conpiratorial, not very exciting, perspective.</dd>
<dd>I can only recommend to those encountering conspiracy theories about prior knowledge of Pearl Harbor, that they consider this structural difficulty in media prsentation and be willing to settle for "I don't know" or "I don't agree with &lt;whatever&gt; without my putting some real effort into studying the subject". Not very exciting, nor very satisfying, but the most sensible and intelectually responsible approach. There's clearly too much fanatic enthusiasm about many a current issue, some deadly and thus important, to rush to judgement on an historical issue based on a one-sided account designed to persuade and enlist. Consider only the WTC attack and all that's followed it (in the US, Europe, Asia, ..., and amongst the jihadists (or pick your own fanatic group) hidden here and there) as an example.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Apology?</span></h2>
<p>"In 1991, it was rumored that Japan was going to make an official apology to the United States for the attack. The apology did not come in the form many expected, however. The Japanese Foreign Ministry released a statement that said Japan had intended to make a formal declaration of war to the US at 1 PM, twenty-five minutes before the attacks at Pearl Harbor were scheduled to begin (it appears that the Japanese government was referring to the "14-part message", which did not even formally break off negotiations..."</p>
<p>What? American soldier are still in Japan now, and ride my train every day and walk around like they own my place! How should there be apology? The apology made was for not following the order of battle, not for the battle itself.</p>
<p>This was a time of war already started, it was defensive! United States was arming enemies of Japan, American pilot were joining Chinese air force while still under orders from American Army Air Force. FDR was looking for excuse already. Some people say he knew about the attack before it happen, but I don't think it was that kind of conspiracy at all; if the Japan Navy didn't make this attack, FDR would have joined the war against them anyway. Maybe not as immediately but within a few years at least. There was no mistaking the American preparations. This attack maybe only served to step on the coiled snake tail.</p>
<p>So my point is, this paragraph in its entirety seem to be very not neutral point of view. Should it be counterbalanced somewhere? Maybe should be an explanation of why American think there is need for apology of the attack? The Japanese government apology was because of course, nobody wants to make a complete sneak attack, it was planned from the very first to be a declaration first. This is what the Japanese goverment said in 1991. That is, apologize for not playing by the rules of war by delcaring war before starting attack. But apologize for the attack?? if this attack was not made, America probably would find other no reason to enter the war soon, so what to apologize?</p>
<p>I know this is the English Wikipedia but does that also mean Anglo-American point of view?</p>
<p>I would write myself now, a complementary section showing other POV but I maybe can't be NPOV right now, sorry!</p>

<dd>"Still under orders"? On what planet? By that reasoning, Japan should have attacked Russia or Germany, both doing the same... AVG didn't become operational until 12 Dec (I think), contrary to the popular myth. And I don't recall the U.S. assassinating Chinese leaders in an attempt to annex Manchuria, as far back as 1931. Apologize? No, because it's the usual American stupidity, just apologize &amp; it'll all be OK, "kiss it better"; the very idea makes me nauseous. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrekphiler_ea82.html" title="User:Trekphiler">Trekphiler</a> 08:12, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The first combat for the American Volunteer Group was 20 Dec 1941 at Kunming, China. And it was defensive in nature, the AVG shooting down three or four bombers attempting to raid Kunming as a continuation of Japan's prolonged and undeclared war upon China.

<dd><b>Forget Apologies to the Americans — How About the Chinese, Indo-Chinese, Koreans, Filipinos and Indonesians and Allied prisoners of war?</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Around 1991 was a period of rampant apology and apology demands. The issue of "apology" was not restricted to Japan for Pearl Harbor, but also covered America and slavery, America and the Indians, The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, all colonial powers and their subjects, etc. And then there was Japan and the above-cited peoples. The issue of "apology" was <i>not</i> a major part of this article. Anyway, it does not matter what the Japanese government <i>intended,</i> with respect to a war declaration before the attack. What matters is that there was not one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With respect<b>:</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Since opinionating is permitted here, this is my opinion: Apology for Pearl Harbor is no big deal<b>;</b> apology for the barbarous treatment of conquered peoples and of prisoners of war at the hands of the Japanese <u>is</u> a big deal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While you may be correct in your opinions, they remain opinions until you provide facts. The aim of <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> is <u>not</u> balance. Sometimes the truth is not fair or balanced. For example, you say "United States was arming enemies of Japan". If you mean China, then, while this may be technically correct, was it not Japan who invaded China and not the other way around? If America was arming Japan's enemies, it was doing so to aid a victim of Japanese aggression — hardly the conduct of a "snake". If Japan had continued to expand its <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_East_Asia_Co-Prosperity_Sphere_befb.html" title="Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere">Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere</a>, you are right, perhaps eventually FDR or Truman would have declared war to stop Japan from invading other countries, like England did with Germany.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's true that Japan had valid grievances against the United States and other Western powers. In particular was the bullying of Japan by these powers after the <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russo-Japanese_War_956c.html" title="Russo-Japanese War">Russo-Japanese War</a> of 1904-1905, which denied Japan colonial rights and military parity corresponding to those of the Great Powers. This can be seen as a grievance as valid as that of Germany over the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Versailles_Treaty_7f8e.html" title="Versailles Treaty">Versailles Treaty</a>. However, this article is concerned with the Pearl Harbor attack, not with the origins of the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_War_bded.html" title="Pacific War">Pacific War</a>, which may be a more appropriate place to address the issues you raise</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>About the American soldiers you see on the train, walking around "like they own my place"<b>:</b> that is your impression. It is the same impression locals have about Japanese tourists in foreign countries. Perhaps you don't like Americans anyway, so when you see them, you attribute the worst to them. Perhaps what you see are not soldiers walking around "like they own my place" but people having been in Japan long enough to be as familiar and comfortable as you are. Also consider, that it is in the nature of a soldier to act confident<b>;</b> perhaps you are confusing this with arrogance. If you were well-disposed to Americans perhaps you would see the soldiers in this way rather than the hostile way you see them. Anyway, if you compare the way American soldiers behave in Japan with the way Japanese soldiers behaved in <a href="http://www.tribo.org/nanking/" class="external text" title="http://www.tribo.org/nanking/" rel="nofollow">Nanking</a> in 1937-38, I think you would have a healthier perspective.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This article is about history, not current events. The Japan of history is different from today's Japan, which I hope you agree is a better Japan because of Japanese-American coöperation <i>after</i> the war and later, by a democratic Japan, in building a strong, humane, wealthy nation which enjoys the status of Great Power it should have had in 1905. Today, Japanese-American relations are like <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> — a <i>collaborative</i> effort. — <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_M_Rice_edba.html" title="User:J M Rice">J M Rice</a> 18:31, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This article is limited in scope to the actual attack, and we should avoid the tempation to add long explanations of the factors leading to hostilities. Does anyone know of a website, preferably an official one, which covers the attack from a Japanese perspective?

However, the author may find it useful to research the sinking of MS Automedon by the German raider Atlantis; during this assault (9/10/40 - <a href="http://www.nesa.org.uk/html/automedon-ultra.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.nesa.org.uk/html/automedon-ultra.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nesa.org.uk/html/automedon-ultra.htm</a>) the Germans captured a secret British document indicating an inability of Britain to defend her Far East colonies.</p>
<p>This document was returned thru diplomatic channels from Japan to Germany; after reviewing it, Germany turned it over to its Japanese ally on 12/12/40. This document told Japan that it would only need to fight one major power in the Pacific; the British torpedo attack on the Italian naval fleet at Taranto (11/11/40) provided a clear example of how Japan could incapacitate a rival.</p>
<p>From the link above:</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that possession of these documents profoundly affected Japanese war planning in January 1941, this intimate view of Churchill’s War Cabinet decisions and opinions enabled the Japanese to dismiss any serious fears that the British could make a worthwhile military intervention in the Far East, it also provided the Japanese with a clear picture of British knowledge of their armed forces (for example. that we were unaware that the Japanese Air Force possessed torpedo-carrying aircraft).</p>
<p>It is fair to argue, therefore, that the capture of the Chiefs-of-Staff report from the Automedon was the catalyst that sent the Japanese on the path to Pearl Harbour and precipitated the ruinous attack on America’s Pacific fleet.</p>
<p>After the fall of Singapore in 1941, Captain Rogge of the Atlantis was presented with a Samurai sword by the Japanese Emperor in recognition of his achievement, only two other Germans received such an award, Hermann Goering and Erwin Rommel, later, Admiral Kondo was to tell Wenneker on several occasions how valuable this particular document had been in planning the attacks on Pearl Harbour, the Philippines, and Singapore, on the 8th December 1941, thus opening the war between Imperial Japan and the USA"</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not the author, so apolgies for butting in with these thoughts: First, intelligence about Churchill's ruling out intervention in the East was no more than confirmation of what the Japanese already knew — that because of the European war, the British, French and Dutch colonies were indefensible. Second, as Admiral Yamamoto was well aware, the strategic threat to Japanese expansion lay with the United States alone and that no matter how successful the attack on Pearl Harbor, he could at best promise a year for Japan to engage in its expansion unchallenged <i>from the United States, not Great Britain.</i> Third, the business with the Samurai sword sounds apocryphal. In short, the Japanese were never concerned about the British, so whatever was found on the <i>Automedon</i> (and Rusbridger's page reveals less than rigorous scholarship) could hardly be considered a "catalyst".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, since this Rusbridge piece is based on eighties research, it's not much of a basis for any conclusion. Since then, the fifty-year rule has long expired, and if one thought the issue worth taking up, they would have checked the B.M. or P.R.O for the declassified docs. Frankly, I don't think it's that important. — <a href="../../../j/_/m/User%7EJ_M_Rice_edba.html" title="User:J M Rice">J M Rice</a> 20:46, 22 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">more on PH attack as self defense</span></h2>
<p>(Takatoriyama) It is interesting to read the new, long discussion here. The reason I complain about the article first, is that it implied that US was taken by suprise. Not, in the sense of the day and time of the attack (which was by all account suprising to the people there on the day), but in the sense that Japan wasn't expected to confront US in the Pacific region. Since US had been preparing for many years to improve the Pacific Fleet, since at least the time of the Manchurian Rail incident, this implication was absurd and offensive. It perpetuate the stereotypical image of Asian--and especially Japanese--people as being inscrutable, devious, underhanded and unknowable. Yet, American policy at the time was to cut off Japanese supply lines for oil, coal, metals and materials to starve and cripple the Japanese war economy while waiting for the right moment to enter the worldwide fray. Waiting from 1930s until 1941 to enter the war against an enemy which had finally overextended itself, is also a long-term devious and calculating policy. So long as the article has balance showing that confrontation in Pacific was already expected, and that the specific attack not the regional balance was the surprise, I have no argument.</p>
<p>Regarding the comment that I 'already dislike American', you are unfortunately completely incorrect. I am an American citizen, and though again residing in Japan, vote every year by absentee, and maybe return someday to the US. When I complain about Americans, I specifically talk about the soldiers and sailors who swagger around with the attitude that Japan is a country which deserve to be below them. My point about the military Americans, is that they still act like recent victors who deserve the spoils of the country. They talk loud on the train and expect that nobody understand the rude and derogatory thinks they say in English in front of everybody. These are not the Americans I know and love like my many friends, these are a special case and the only ones I complain about. Mainly, not from hatred of Americans, but from embarassment that these are the emissaries by which Japanese and other countries learn the American character. They show the wrong character, especially in a country which value respect and politeness like Japan. (Takatori)</p>
<dl>
<dd>(A.T. Cook) "Waiting from 1930s until 1941 to enter the war against an enemy which had finally overextended itself, is also a long-term devious and calculating policy." And the Pearl Harbor Attack was not "devious and calculating"? True, America was not selling its scrap iron and oil to Japan in 1941, but this was in response to the Rape of Nanking and other atrocities committed by Japanese forces in Southeast Asia. Let's go to the source of the problem: Japanese imperial expansion, for which there will certainly never be an apology. Regardless of who "knew" what, the Japanese ordered the attack, bombed the harbor, etc. The article should focus on facts, not fabricated justifications. The Germans do not resort to such revisionism, and neither should the Japanese.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Surprise attack was a long established and long admired Japanese military tactic; consider several battles in the 1905 Russian War. Yamamoto's PH plan was thus not out of line with Japanese doctrine. I have come across no hint that it was opposed on the grounds of being a sneak attack. Yamamoto himself is said to have been, privately, distressed that the delivery of the diplomatic note in Washington had been late, but that's it -- as far as I've heard. His plan was opposed in part because he proposed it; he was regarded by many in the Navy as a member of the "Treaty Faction", to be distrusted. And it was opposed on practical grounds -- how could it actually be carried off? would we be able to achieve tactical and strategic surprise? A great deal of coordinated and sustained effort went into achieving strategic surprise (surreptitious recall of merchant vessels, ONI agents on at merchant vessel calling at Honolulu that summer, keeping all -- including Japanes diplomatic personnel -- in ignorance, training pilots for the mission, manuvering the Attack Force to the North to avoid inadvertent reports to the wrong ears, arraqnging for radio spoofing by leaving behind in Japan the Attack Force's radio operators, two secret Imperial Councils before permission was given to go, lots and lots of planning for the simultaneous (and more important) moves to the South (which were directly suspected by the West (UK, US, Dutch, ...)), ... The case that PH was self defense is more than a little dubious given the months long effort needed to prepare for it and to pull it off. This arguement leads, in the extreme, to the WTC attack being in self defense as a result of Western actions taken in say, 1200CE, in the Middle East against the local Muslims there at the time. It will be of interest to recall that at the time of the Crusades, neither of the American continents were known of in the rest of hte world, except perhaps as a tale of their ancestors long before, by a few Greenlanders, exactly none of whom took part in any of the Crusades. So attacking the WTC can not possibly be, at least in some sense, the justifiable and legitimate result of long embedded hostility going back most of a thousand years. That's bogus reasoning, just as a US decision to beef up the Pacific Fleet taken well after the 1931 outbreak of war in Manchuria/China (at Japan's choice, and in a surprise attack) is a hostile action. Especially given its more or less null result by a decade later. Basing the Fleet 'forward' at Pearl was a dim political decision, protested by Adm Richardson (in command) at the cost of his career, but even so not a hostile action. Except by a kind of twisted propaganda sort of reasoning, akin to which was Goebbles defense of hitler's assorted landgrabs and war bluffing between 33 and 39. Evne the sneak attack on Poland was so structured as to be explained as a Polish attack across the border (dead prisoners in Polish uniforms scattered around the radio tower in the night...). Not credible reasoning at all, I'm afraid.</dd>
<dd>It is certainly true that the US was taking action designed to thwart Japanese policy in China and what was feared would be eventual Japanese policy in the East Indies. A well advised fear indeed, as those expectations came almost exactly true. Indeed, that summer, the Japanes pressured the French into an arrangement turning over French IndoChina. indeed, it was that action which prompted the trade (oil and scrap metal) embargo against Japan. Would you claim that the US, and the rest of the world including the League of Nations, should not have taken effective action in the case? Or perhaps it is the effectiveness of the US action (ie the embargo) which is being protested as being hostile? Short of war, what actions are acceptable in such cases? States do not always act sensibly or reasonably or morally (fuzzy words all and there is clearly dispute about all of them, but a war begun 10 years earlier at Japan's election, particularly brutally carried out, makes much of the fuzziness moot in this case), and when they do not, what should other states do? In Europe, Hitler's assorted landgrabs and war bluffs in the 30s weren't very effectively opposed by other states, nor by the League of Nations; near unanimous opinion is that this was a failure on their part and they should have been more forceful, or at least, more effective in resisting.</dd>
<dd>In any case, I find the entire issue rather moot. Japanese Naval Aviation had already taken surprise hostile action against the US in the case of the Panay, a small US ship stationed in China, some years before. People killed and all that. It was not, as claimed by the Japanese Foreign Office. Intercepted and decrypted instructions made it clear that the attack was deliberate; it was in any event unprovoked by any action of the Panay or its crew. Japanese behavior while under control of fanatic military factions (whether members held government office or not) was poor and unacceptable by any standard. It continued during the War after Dec 41 in prisoner treatment and the chemical/biological warfare station near Harbin under the command of Gen Isshi. There is indeed much for the Japanese govenrment to apologize for, and to the extent it has not done so, the rest of the world is entitled to wonder what that failure means. Reaching hard conclusions as to what it means is perhaps not warrented, but doubt and suspicion certainly are.</dd>
<dd>This article might benefit by including some account of Japanese propaganda explanations about how it really wasn't a sneak attack, not really. But is suspect such material would be best in a new article of its own with a link from here.</dd>

<p>This is a great article, but there are some organizational problems. The material is out of sequence: for example, the first shots of the attack come after the main attack and the various diplomatic messages are covered in different locations. Also, the prose would benefit from some plain old copyediting. So I am working to correct both isues without changing any of the interpretations or facts in the article (I made a couple of minor additions and no significant deletions). My motivation, apart from the usual Wiki participation, is that I am preparing to record the article for the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Spoken_Wikipedia_cba1.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Spoken Wikipedia">Spoken Wikipedia</a> project.

<dd><i>The financial crisis of 1927, which occurred in the aftermath of the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 that devastated the Tokyo area, eventually led to a long period of economic depression. In these circumstances, the power of the military increased, and it eventually gained control of the government. The Manchurian Incident of 1931 launched a series of events that culminated in Japan's entry into World War II. This war ended in Japan's defeat, with Emperor Showa accepting the terms of the Potsdam Declaration. Japan rose from the rubble of defeat, going on to achieve an almost miraculous economic recovery, which has allowed it to take its place among the world's leading democratic powers.</i> <a href="http://web-japan.org/museum/historyofjp/histjp.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://web-japan.org/museum/historyofjp/histjp.html" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">external vs wikipedia references</span></h2>
<p>I like Willmcw's recent work on this article. It's better now. And I see that he uses external references a lot. This is of course good, and in line with Taxman's request a few posts up. But in many cases I feel the refs could have been made into wiki-links to our own articles, and have the refs put there instead. Take the "Japanese preparations" section. There are 2 references regarding the various coordinated attacks occurring at the same time as the one on Pearl Harbor. But we do have articles on those attacks, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Prachuab_Khirikhan_5094.html" title="Battle of Prachuab Khirikhan">Battle of Prachuab Khirikhan</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hong_Kong_07a4.html" title="Battle of Hong Kong">Battle of Hong Kong</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_the_Philippines_%281941-42%29_5a8f.html" title="Battle of the Philippines (1941-42)">Battle of the Philippines (1941-42)</a> and maybe more. Shouldn't we be "building our web" and link to them instead?</p>
<p>Normally I would just be bolding in and wikify the hell out of that section. But I'm a bit reluctant to do that here, since Willmcw has improved upon an already Featured Article to this extent. And his 'writing with the article being read out loud in mind' is a new concern I haven't thought about before (although I probably should, sounds like excellent advice). Personally I would for instance trade the trivial links to <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> and the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippines.html" title="Philippines">Philippines</a> with more specific links to the battles in question. But, well, I'm unsure about external-internal references here and also how it plays in on the reading out loud concern. So I'm asking here now instead of going nuts in the article. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 10:41, 9 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I left those external references in as they seemed to be sources for specific assertions about the timing of the attacks. However internal links are more important and should be developed. (regarding the reading aloud- I tend to ignore external links in the text, and just read the ones listed at the end). The other battles you mentioned mostly are included at the bottom of the "battle box", but I've revised the paragraph to link to all of those that occured in the following 24 hours - (actually there's no article for the Battle of Malaya).

<p>Moreover, being a battleship sailor, why did Nagumo not use his surface assets to SHELL Pearl Harbor? Surely his six decks could hold off the American three he expected, and certainly the two he actually faced. Personally, I suspect Nagumo's disapproval of the attack plan led him to subtly undermine it and not give it his best. The other option seems to be cowardice. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrekphiler_ea82.html" title="User:Trekphiler">Trekphiler</a> 08:22, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The "sleeping US behemoth" of industrial and military capacity, once mobilized, would have made no difference. Japan was defeated by loss of control of her sea lanes through indifferent, indolent antisubmarine warfare efforts, what Adm Chihaya called "shiftless" (and it is hard to argue). American submarines cut off the Home Islands from supplies, and deliveries of weapons and supplies to island garrisons.</p>
<p>Why, then, did it take 44 months? U.S. Sub Force torpedoes were abysmally bad, and a colossally stupid decision by U.S. Customs and Intelligence men (one each) prewar caused Japan to change her merchant marine code (which OP-20-G did not have the manpower to break again until January 1943). Between them, they doubled the effectiveness of U.S. submarines when they became available--in September 1943! In short, the U.S. Sub Force drove Japan's economy to ruin in just over a year: by January 1945.</p>

<p>Yamamoto and all IJN, just like USN and RN prewar, were in the grip of the doctrine of Alfred Thayer Mahan, who advocated "decisive battle" to control the seas in his seminal, overly influential 'Influence of Seapower'. Mahan had misread the record, ignoring 'guerre de course' (commerce war), and the major navies did, too. When reduced by circumstance to rely on it, both Germany and the U.S. did--with a vengeance.</p>

<dd>Are you referring to the article title? I think "attack" is accurate and common usage. "Raid" would be accurate too, but I don't think that it is used as often. "Battle" implies a greater degree of opposition than the U.S. forces were able to muster.</dd>

<p>The British "battles" were prolonged campaigns, lasting weeks, months, or even years in the case of the Battle of Berlin. I admit that I was surprised to see this article titled as it is. Seems to me that "Pearl Harbor Attack" would put the words in better order, as well as being truer to contemporary (1940s) usage. (Indeed, the word "attack" was superfluous.

<dd>"Navy stole them (cf, Budiansky's Battle of Wits and his reporting of the slush fund held by the Office of Naval Intelligence and the black bag jobs it financed), or because of considerable inspired work (as by the Friedmann/Rowlett team that broke Purple). We didn't even begin to (illegally, for Congress had passed a law enacting Stimson's "gentlemen don't read other people's mail" attitude)"
<dl>
<dd>Red was stolen, that's true. By the time of Purple &amp; JN-25, which follow Friedman's seminal work on rotor solutions, theft wasn't needed. As for "illegal", it was, if it came from cable companies, <i>per</i> Section 605 of the Communications Act of 1934. It didn't cover interception out of the air, which is what crypto was doing, &amp; wouldn't have been considered illegal <i>per</i> SCotUS jurisprudence anyhow until 1968. (I looked it up after reading intercept officers feared it might be. A 1928 decision said to the effect possession of the cables was illegal; not until Katz would interception of the <i>signal alone</i> be prohibited.)
<dl>
<dd>Budianshi's report was in regard to the 20's mostly, as I recall. The slush fund was returned to the Treasury in a fit of acounting virtue by an ONI chief, to the irritation of his troops, sometime in the 30's, IIRC. Your points on intercepted from the air vs copies of cables are well taken, save that cables were being (illegally) copied in NY throughout the pre-War period. They only began to be copied in Hawaii after Sarnoff agreed to cooperate the week before PH. ww -- have just noticed I've been logged out by WP.</dd>

<dd>"they changed pretty regularly as is only sensible for any sane crypto system. Such success as was achieved against the Japanese military by US crypto folk was largely in China (as for instance during the Panay incident) and was largely irrelevant by mid-late 41. In particular, Stinnet says in his book (and in the Independent Institute talk whose transcript is referenced above) that the US was able to read the '5-num' JIN superencrypted code (ie, JN-25) well before 12.7.41. There is no credible evidence that this was actually so."
<dl>
<dd>Everything I've ever read on the subject suggests there were breaks into JN-25 as early as Dec '40. Not enough to read solid, N, but... That includes Kahn (who would know, I'd guess); I seem to recall Holmes &amp; Blair back it up.
<dl>
<dd>Breaks into systems like JN-25 are incremental and, until some critial mass or tipping point is reached, are not very productive. Nothing I've ever seen suggests that JN-25 was sufficiently well broken to return useful intelligence, by anyone or any combination, prior to 1.12.41 when a new addition took effect. With more traffic, a break into that edition was far enough along to produce useful intelligence in a few months. ww again -- still logged out</dd>

<dd>"battlewagon admirals (of which Yamamoto had once been one, but uncharacteristically he had seen the light early on)"
<dl>
<dd>That's the myth. I wonder. <i>Cf</i> his dispositions at Midway: classic BB sailor, CV scouts in van, heavies under strong escort behind.
<dl>
<dd>My reading of the Midway plan is two fold. 1st: JIN carriers were out ahead to take down whatever might be found including, Y hoped, any American carriers that might come to the rescue. After the British loss of capital ships off Malaysia (uncovered by aircraft), and the fight which stopped the Japanese advance in New Guinea (despite Fletcher's hesitance), it was, I think, becoming clear to all that carriers were more important as fighting ships than most anyone had appreciated, pre War. More imagination here than the usual battlewagon admiral, I think. 2nd: Y took along almost everything he could find as a result of the loss of face from the, otherwise minor, American bomber raid on Tokyo. He was in a big hurry to do <i>something</i> to get back at 'em. Y's change of mind and early advocay of aviation is reported from a translation of a biography. Lots of research in the book, and it seems credible to my eye. Others more familiar with the original book (in Japanese) would be in a better position to evaluate its report of Y's early career choices. ww again</dd>

<dd>True, but the criticism was the result of 'stick in the mud' reactions on the part of his superiors. Shut him up and we'll not have to deal with his ideas... A not unheard of bureaucratic pheomenon. ww again</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>"This further implies, I suspect, that more than a mere statement that no such conspiracy has been shown is required."
<dl>
<dd>What's req is to subject conspiracy theories to ridicule they deserve.
<dl>
<dd>Actually, what's required here at WP is to cover them, and give an evaluation of their credibility and why the evaluation. I have little sympathy with most, because I see little actual evidence for any flavor I've come across, but ridicule is, I think, not appropriate here on WP. However tempting. ww again</dd>

<dl>
<dd>FDR didn't want a total embargo, just enough to "get Japan's attention". Unfortunately, I can't source it offhand; it's Mosely, <i>On Borrowed Time</i>, I think.</dd>
