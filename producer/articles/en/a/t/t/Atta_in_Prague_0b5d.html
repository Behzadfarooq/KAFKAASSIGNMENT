<p>Until late 2004, many believed that Atta traveled to Prague for one day on May 30, 2000. Nobody claimed he had met al-Ani at that time, but conservative columnist <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_McCarthy_2e27.html" title="Andrew McCarthy">Andrew McCarthy</a> wrote in the National Review that his trip was considered suspicious. Atta was apparently detained because he did not have a travel visa but was not picked up on airport surveillance.<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/mccarthy/mccarthy200406170840.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationalreview.com/mccarthy/mccarthy200406170840.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> However, the Chicago Tribune reported in August 2004 that it was a different Atta who traveled to Prague in May 2000 -- Pakistani businessman Mohammed Atta, (who spells his name differently from the hijacker) -- and was turned away because he lacked a visa.<a href="http://www.911readingroom.org/bib/whole_document.php?article_id=321" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.911readingroom.org/bib/whole_document.php?article_id=321" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> The hijacker Mohamed Atta - whose travel papers were in order - went to the Prague airport a couple days later on his way to Newark, creating confusion for some: "On June 2, the hijacker Mohamed Atta, who had a visa, arrived in Prague by bus from Cologne, Germany, and flew to Newark the next day. Video surveillance cameras at a Prague bus terminal showed him playing slot machines at the station's Happy Days Casino before disappearing."<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2004/09/19/a_911_legacy_confusion_over_a_name_czechs_find_error_in_tracking_atta/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2004/09/19/a_911_legacy_confusion_over_a_name_czechs_find_error_in_tracking_atta/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> The confusion over the two different Attas "had serious consequences," according to Czech reporter Brian Kenety, "as it laid the groundwork for spurious claims by Czech authorities of a secret meeting in Prague between Atta the hijacker and an Iraqi intelligence agent."<a href="http://www.radio.cz/en/article/57782" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.radio.cz/en/article/57782" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>The claim Atta met with al-Ani in Prague in April, 2001 is now considered false by analysts and investigators. The source for the claim came from a contact the Czech intelligence had within the Iraqi embassy <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110007584" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110007584" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, described in the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Globe_1f5c.html" title="Boston Globe">Boston Globe</a> as "a single informant from Prague's Arab community who saw Atta's picture in the news after the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11.html" title="September 11">11 September</a> attacks, and who later told his handlers that he had seen him meeting with Ani. Some officials have called the source unreliable." <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2004/09/19/a_911_legacy_confusion_over_a_name_czechs_find_error_in_tracking_atta/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2004/09/19/a_911_legacy_confusion_over_a_name_czechs_find_error_in_tracking_atta/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>The story was first leaked to the Reuters news service on September 18, 2001. Without naming Prague, Reuters reported that "[r]ecent intelligence information received by the United States showed Atta had met with a representative of Iraqi intelligence this year". The report cited "U.S. government sources".<a href="http://nucnews.net/nucnews/2001nn/0109nn/010918nn.htm#360" class="external autonumber" title="http://nucnews.net/nucnews/2001nn/0109nn/010918nn.htm#360" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> On October 13, 2001, the story was leaked to Czech newspapers. The story was confirmed by the State Department. On October 20, the NY Times published a story by John Tagliabue saying Czech officials denied the meeting ever occurred. On October 26, Czech Republic Interior Minister Stanislav Gross responded by calling a press conference to officially state details reported regarding Atta's visit. On October 27, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> published a story by Patrick E. Tyler and John Tagliabue that refuted its story dated October 20. <a href="http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/2002question/prague.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/2002question/prague.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> Later the New York Times reported that Czech officials later backed off of the claim, first privately, and then later publicly after the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> conducted "extensive interviews with leading Czech figures."<a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40816FB34590C728EDDA90994DA404482" class="external autonumber" title="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40816FB34590C728EDDA90994DA404482" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
<p>When rumors of the Czech officials privately backing away from the claims first appeared in the Western media, according to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Prague_Post_3df4.html" title="The Prague Post">The Prague Post</a>, Hynek Kmonicek, the Czech envoy to the UN stated "The meeting took place." One senior Czech official who requested anonymity speculated that the media reports dismissing the meeting were the result of a "guided leak."<a href="http://www.praguepost.com/P02/2002/20605/news1a.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.praguepost.com/P02/2002/20605/news1a.php" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_15.html" title="March 15">15 March</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> David Ignatius wrote in the <i>Washington Post</i>: "Even the Czechs, who initially put out the reports about Atta's meeting with al-Ani, have gradually backed away. The Czech interior minister, Stanislav Gross, said in October that the two had met in April 2001. That version was altered slightly by Czech Prime Minister Miloš Zeman when he told CNN in November: 'Atta contacted some Iraqi agent, not to prepare the terrorist attack on [the twin towners] but to prepare [a] terrorist attack on just the building of Radio Free Europe' in Prague. Then, in December, Czech President <a href="../../../v/%C3%A1/c/V%C3%A1clav_Havel_1e7e.html" title="Václav Havel">Václav Havel</a> retreated further, saying there was only 'a 70 percent' chance Atta met with al-Ani."<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A29957-2002Mar14" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A29957-2002Mar14" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>
<p>But Havel later "moved to quash the report once and for all"<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/10/22/wirq22.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/10/22/wirq22.xml" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> by making the statement publicly to the White House, as reported in the <i>New York Times</i>. According to the <i>Times</i> report, "Czech officials also say they have no hard evidence that Mr. Ani was involved in terrorist activities, although the government did order his ouster in late April 2001." The <i>New York Times</i> report was described as "a fabrication" by a <a href="http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2002/02-10-22.rferl.html#39" class="external text" title="http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2002/02-10-22.rferl.html#39" rel="nofollow">Ladislav Spacek</a>, a spokesman for Czech president Václav Havel. But Spacek also "said Mr. Havel was still certain there was no factual basis behind the report that Mr. Atta met an Iraqi diplomat."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> The <i>Times</i> story was a potential embarrassment to Czech prime minister Milos Zeman after "extensive interviews with Czech and other Western intelligence officials, politicians and people close to the Czech intelligence community revealed that Mr. Zeman had prematurely disclosed an unverified report."</p>
<p>In August 2002, Czech foreign intelligence chief Frantisek Bublan publicly backed away from the claim that Atta met al-Ani, saying that rumors of such meetings "have not been verified or proven." The <a href="../../../p/r/a/Prague_Post_b49b.html" title="Prague Post">Prague Post</a> reported that "Bublan said that promoting a so-called 'Prague connection' between Atta and al-Ani might have been a ploy by U.S. policymakers seeking justifications for a new military action against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to an article in the <i><a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_Post_d2cd.html" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a></i> more recently, the Czechs backed away from the claim: "After months of further investigation, Czech officials determined last year that they could no longer confirm that a meeting took place, telling the Bush administration that al-Ani might have met with someone other than Atta."<a href="http://www.jeffooi.com/MT3/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=1532" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jeffooi.com/MT3/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=1532" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> This perception seems confirmed by an associate of al-Ani's who suggested to a reporter that the Czech informant had mistaken another man for Atta. The associate said "I have sat with the two of them at least twice. The double is an Iraqi who has met with the consul. If someone saw a photo of Atta he might easily mistake the two."<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=5N4KDX1ALIPAJQFIQMGCM54AVCBQUJVC?xml=/news/2001/12/18/wirq18.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=5N4KDX1ALIPAJQFIQMGCM54AVCBQUJVC?xml=/news/2001/12/18/wirq18.xml" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> The <i><a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Tribune_3abd.html" title="Chicago Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a></i> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_29.html" title="September 29">29 September</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> also reported that a man from Pakistan named Mohammed Atta (spelling his name with two "m's" rather than one) flew to the Czech Republic in 2000, confusing the intelligence agency, who thought it was the same Mohamed Atta.<a href="http://www.911truth.org/readingroom/whole_document.php?article_id=321" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.911truth.org/readingroom/whole_document.php?article_id=321" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> In September 2004, Jiří Ruzek, the former head of the BIS, told the Czech newspaper <a href="../../../m/l/a/Mlada_fronta_Dnes_b633.html" title="Mlada fronta Dnes">Mlada fronta Dnes</a>, "This information was verified, and it was confirmed that it was a case of the same name.

<p>Opposition leaders in the Czech Republic have publicly called this a failure on the part of Czech intelligence, and it is not clear that any Czech officials still stand by the story.<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2004/09/19/a_911_legacy_confusion_over_a_name_czechs_find_error_in_tracking_atta/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2004/09/19/a_911_legacy_confusion_over_a_name_czechs_find_error_in_tracking_atta/" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> In hopes of resolving the issue, Czech officials hoped to be given access to information from the U.S. investigation but that cooperation was not forthcoming.<a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2091354/" class="external autonumber" title="http://slate.msn.com/id/2091354/" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> In May 2004, the Czech newspaper Pravo speculated that the source of the information behind the rumored meeting was actually the discredited INC chief <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmed_Chalabi_f6aa.html" title="Ahmed Chalabi">Ahmed Chalabi</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>Shortly after September 11th, Vice President Dick Cheney asked Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet to look into the claim that Atta had met an Iraqi intelligence agent. Tenet put the Directorate of Operations Jim Pavitt on the case, who reported back to Tenet. On September 21st, 2001, Tenet told the President, "Our Prague office is skeptical about the report. It just doesn't add up." Tenet also indicated that other evidence the CIA was able to find, including credit card and telephone records, made such a meeting highly unlikely.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>According to columnist <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Novak_f400.html" title="Robert Novak">Robert Novak</a>, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld "confirmed published reports that there is no evidence placing the presumed leader of the terrorist attacks in the Czech capital." <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> According to the January 2003 CIA report <i>Iraqi Support for Terrorism</i>, "the most reliable reporting to date casts doubt on this possibility" that such a meeting occurred.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet released "the most complete public assessment by the agency on the issue" in a statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee in July 2004, stating "Although we cannot rule it out, we are increasingly skeptical that such a meeting occurred." <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/07/09/MNG267J1N51.DTL" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/07/09/MNG267J1N51.DTL" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></p>
<p>John McLaughlin, who at the time was the Deputy Director of the CIA, described the extent of the Agency's investigation into the claim: "Well, on something like the Atta meeting in Prague, we went over that every which way from Sunday. We looked at it from every conceivable angle. We peeled open the source, examined the chain of acquisition. We looked at photographs. We looked at timetables. We looked at who was where and when. It is wrong to say that we didn't look at it.

FBI Director <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_S._Mueller_III_299f.html" title="Robert S. Mueller III">Robert S. Mueller III</a> outlined the extent of their investigation into the hijacker's whereabouts in a speech in April 2002: "We ran down literally hundreds of thousands of leads and checked every record we could get our hands on, from flight reservations to car rentals to bank accounts."

<p>The Czech police chief, Jiří Kolář, "said there were no documents showing that Atta visited Prague at any time" in 2001.<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=5N4KDX1ALIPAJQFIQMGCM54AVCBQUJVC?xml=/news/2001/12/18/wirq18.xml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=5N4KDX1ALIPAJQFIQMGCM54AVCBQUJVC?xml=/news/2001/12/18/wirq18.xml" rel="nofollow">[21]</a></p>

<p>The 9/11 Commission also addressed the question of an alleged Prague connection and listed many of the reasons above that such a meeting could not have taken place. The report notes that "the FBI has gathered intelligence indicating that Atta was in Virginia Beach on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_4.html" title="April 4">April 4</a> (as evidenced by a bank surveillance camera photo), and in Coral Springs, Florida on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_11.html" title="April 11">April 11</a>, where he and Shehhi leased an apartment. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_6.html" title="April 6">April 6</a>, 9, 10, and 11, Atta's cellular telephone was used numerous times to call various lodging establishments in Florida from cell sites within Florida. We cannot confirm that he placed those calls. But there are no U.S. records indicating that Atta departed the country during this period." Combining FBI and Czech intelligence investigations, "[n]o evidence has been found that Atta was in the Czech Republic in April 2001." The Commission assessed that "There was no reason for such a meeting, especially considering the risk it would pose to the operation. By April 2001, all four pilots had completed most of their training, and the muscle hijackers were about to begin entering the United States. The available evidence does not support the original Czech report of an Atta-Ani meeting."</p>
<p>In the final analysis, the 9/11 Commission Report makes this statement: "These findings cannot absolutely rule out the possibility that Atta was in Prague on April 9, 2001. He could have used an alias to travel and a passport under that alias, but this would be an exception to his practice of using his true name while traveling (as he did in January and would in July when he took his next overseas trip)."

<p>According to the London Sunday <i>Telegraph</i>, <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohamed_Atta_e746.html" title="Mohamed Atta">Mohamed Atta</a> is mentioned in a letter allegedly discovered in Iraq handwritten by Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, former chief of the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraqi_Intelligence_Service_2b4f.html" title="Iraqi Intelligence Service">Iraqi Intelligence Service</a>. Habbush's July 1, 2001, memo is labeled "Intelligence Items" and is addressed: "To the President of the Ba'ath Revolution Party and President of the Republic, may God protect you." It continues:</p>
<dl>
<dd>’’<a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammed_Atta_1743.html" title="Mohammed Atta">Mohammed Atta</a>, an Egyptian national, came with Abu Ammer [the real name behind this Arabic alias remains a mystery] and we hosted him in Abu Nidal's house at al-Dora under our direct supervision.’’</dd>
<dd>’’We arranged a work program for him for three days with a team dedicated to working with him...He displayed extraordinary effort and showed a firm commitment to lead the team which will be responsible for attacking the targets that we have agreed to destroy.’’ <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/murdock/murdock200312150842.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nationalreview.com/murdock/murdock200312150842.asp" rel="nofollow">[22]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>The memo is widely recognized as a forgery. Newsweek noted: "U.S. officials and a leading Iraqi document expert tell NEWSWEEK that the document is most likely a forgery—part of a thriving new trade in dubious Iraqi documents that has cropped up in the wake of the collapse of Saddam's regime."<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3741646/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3741646/" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> According to the newsmagazine, "The Telegraph story was apparently written with a political purpose: to bolster Bush administration claims of a connection between Al Qaeda and Saddam's regime."</p>

<p>Even further doubt was cast on rumors of such a meeting in December 2003 when Al-Ani, who is in U.S. custody, reportedly denied having ever met Atta (<a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3540586" class="external autonumber" title="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3540586" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/13/international/europe/13INQU.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/13/international/europe/13INQU.html" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>). According to <i>Newsweek</i>, it was "a denial that officials tend to believe given that they have not unearthed a scintilla of evidence that Atta was even in Prague at the time of the alleged rendezvous."<a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3540586" class="external autonumber" title="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3540586" rel="nofollow">[26]</a></p>
<p>It is also notable that Atta's own religious and political convictions made him violently opposed to the Saddam regime; according to the 9/11 Commission Report, "In his interactions with other students, Atta voiced virulently anti-Semitic and anti-American opinions, ranging from condemnations of what he described as a global Jewish movement centered in New York City that supposedly controlled the financial world and the media, to polemics against governments of the Arab world. To him, Saddam Hussein was an American stooge set up to give Washington an excuse to intervene in the Middle East."<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>Vice President Dick Cheney, who was a proponent of the theory that Atta had met al-Ani in Prague, acknowledged in an interview on March 29, 2006: "We had one report early on from another intelligence service that suggested that the lead hijacker, Mohamed Atta, had met with Iraqi intelligence officials in Prague, Czechoslovakia.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> And that reporting waxed and waned where the degree of confidence in it, and so forth, has been pretty well knocked down now at this stage, that that meeting ever took place."<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/03/20060329-2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/03/20060329-2.html" rel="nofollow">[27]</a></p>
<p>On September 10, 2006, Cheney responded to questions from <a href="../../../t/i/m/Tim_Russert_bbee.html" title="Tim Russert">Tim Russert</a> about Atta in Prague on <a href="../../../m/e/e/Meet_the_Press_18af.html" title="Meet the Press">Meet the Press</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>MR. RUSSERT: Any suggestion there was a meeting with Mohamed Atta, one of the hijackers, with Iraqi officials?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>VICE PRES. CHENEY: No. The sequence, Tim, was, when you and I talked that morning, we had not received any reporting with respect to Mohamed Atta going to Prague. Just a few days after you and I did that show, the CIA, CIA produced an intelligence report from the Czech Intelligence Service that said Mohammad Atta, leader of the hijackers, had been in Prague in April of ‘01 and had met with the senior Iraqi intelligence official in Prague. That was the first report we had that he’d been to Prague and met with Iraqis. Later on, some period of time after that, the CIA produced another report based on a photographer—on a photograph that was taken in Prague of a man they claim 70 percent probability was Mohammad Atta on another occasion. This was the reporting we received from the CIA when I responded to your question and said it had been pretty well confirmed that he’d been in Prague. The—later on, they were unable to confirm it. Later on, they backed off of it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But what I told you was exactly what we were receiving at the time. It never said, and I don’t believe I ever said, specifically, that it linked the Iraqis to 9/11. It specifically said he had been in Prague, Mohamed Atta had been in Prague and we didn’t know...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>MR. RUSSERT: And the meeting with Atta did not occur?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>VICE PRES. CHENEY: We don’t know. I mean, we’ve never been able to, to, to link it, and the FBI and CIA have worked it aggressively. I would say, at this point, nobody has been able to confirm...<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Atta_in_Prague_0b5d.html" title="Edit section: Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq</span></h2>
<p>On September 8, 2006, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence_edd5.html" title="United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence">United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence</a> released "Phase II" of its report on prewar intelligence on Iraq. In the report, the following is stated regarding Atta in Prague:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Postwar findings support CIA's January 2003 assessment, which judged that "the most reliable reporting casts doubt" on...an alleged meeting between Muhammad Atta and an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague, and confirm that no such meeting occurred...Prewar assessments described reporting on the Atta lead as contradictory and unverified. In September 2002, CIA assessed that some evidence asserted that the two met, and some cast doubt on the possibility. By January 2003, CIA assessed that...they were "increasingly skeptical that Atta traveled to Prague in 2001 or met with IIS officer al-Ani." Postwar debriefings of al-Ani indicate that he had never seen or heard of Atta until after September 11, 2001, when Atta's face appeared on the news.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<p>The report also contains a full page of information with regards to Atta in Prague that was redacted.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> <i>Newsweek</i> reports that the blacked-out portion of the Report involved a CIA cable that lays out the controversy. According to <i>Newsweek</i>, "Democrats charged in a written statement that intelligence officials had failed to demonstrate 'that disclosing the [cable] ... would reveal sources and methods or otherwise harm national security.' The Democrats also complained that officials' refusal to declassify the cable 'represents an improper use of classification authority by the intelligence community to shield the White House.'"<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> <i>Newsweek</i> goes on to report:</p>
<dl>
<dd>According to two sources familiar with the blacked-out portions of the Senate report that discuss the CIA cable's contents, the document indicates that White House officials had proposed mentioning the supposed Atta-Prague meeting in a Bush speech scheduled for March 14, 2003... According to one of the sources familiar with the Senate report's censored portions, who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject, the tone of the CIA cable was 'strident' and expressed dismay that the White House was trying to shoehorn the Atta anecdote into the Bush speech to be delivered only days before the U.S. invasion of Iraq. The source said the cable also suggested that policymakers had tried to insert the same anecdote into other speeches by top administration officials. A second source familiar with the Senate report, however, maintained that it could be read as routine give-and-take between policymakers asking legitimate questions about intelligence reporting and field operatives giving respectful responses. Both sources familiar with the report acknowledge that there is no proof the White House saw the cable, and thus it is unclear whether the CIA document had any bearing on the fact that Bush never mentioned the Atta anecdote in a speech.</dd>
</dl>
<p>CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano asserted that the classification had nothing to do with protecting the Bush Administration: "When CIA did not agree to a specific public release, its case was based on current intelligence equities and a desire to preserve the candor essential to good internal discussion of complex issues. It's simply wrong to suggest the goal was to protect the White House."</p>
