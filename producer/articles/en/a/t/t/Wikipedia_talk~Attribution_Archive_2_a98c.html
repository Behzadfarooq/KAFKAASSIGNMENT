<h2><span class="mw-headline">Explanation</span></h2>
<p>I've put up a proposal that would involve getting rid of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> as policies, and combining them into one new policy, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>. WP:A is taken, but it would be good if we could claim it; I've also created WP:SOURCE as a shortcut.</p>
<p>I've used the word "attribution" for two reasons. First, "verifiability" confuses people because usually when we verify something, we confirm that it's true, which is not how the word is being used in the policy. Secondly, the word "attribution" allows us to summarize succinctly the difference between the V policy and NOR (as they now stand): we know something is not original research if it is attributable to a reliable source — that is, if it is capable of being attributed — and all edits must be capable of being attributed. But not all edits actually have to be attributed. "The sun will rise tomorrow" does not need to be attributed, but we all know that it could be if necessary.</p>
<p>In conjunction with this proposal, I propose:</p>
<ol>
<li>that <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> be deleted;</li>
<li>that <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> become a description of how the idea of NOR developed, with some examples of OR (not a policy or guideline)</li>
<li>that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> be renamed Wikipedia:How to find reliable sources and become just an advisory page (not a policy or guideline), with everything that duplicates material in Wikipedia:Attribution removed; and</li>
<li>that <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> be renamed Wikipedia:How to cite sources, and that everything in it that discusses why we need sources be removed. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 04:39, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>We'd have two content policies: <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>.</li>
<li>Wikipedia:How to cite sources would be a guideline but concerned only with how to format citations.</li>
<li>Wikipedia:How to find reliable sources would discuss where to find good online sources, how to use libraries etc, but for advice only, not as a policy or guideline, and it wouldn't get into any areas covered by <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> would discuss how the term NOR developed and would give examples of OR, but it wouldn't be a policy or guideline; alternatively, it could be deleted entirely.</li>

<dd>I know it sounds a bit radical, but so long as we don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, we'll end up with more streamlined, rational, easy-to-follow content policies. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 11:41, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Small technical problem. There are tens of thousands of talk page posts and edit summaries citing the existing policies by their redirect. These will cease to make sense if major changes are made without care. I'd suggest that <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> would need to point here, as the content would be here. If new 'how to' essays are needed, let's put them elsewhere to avoid confusion. The top of this poicy would need a note saying it superceeded the previous policies, and pehaps linking to an archives of them.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 11:57, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>NOR needs to remain a separate policy. Let's not get too ambitious, please, otherwise this proposal will not accepted by the wider community. Let's merge RS into V, as needed and propose this as the new <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> policy. I still think that Verifiability is a better name than "Attribution", as an attribution needs to be verifiable to a reliable source. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 14:51, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Could we set up a bot to handle updating the links? Maybe run it in the quiet periods? Whenever they are? I mean, depending on the time scale we have Christmas coming up, I assume the server load is reduced on that day so it'd maybe be able to handle that? Not that I'm a dev or anything, but maybe that's an idea? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 15:14, 11 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The easier solution would be to copy/paste this page over <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> (after we're done discussing, of course) and call it "verifiability" since that's the term that most everybody in Wikipedia refers to these days. Otherwise, we'll just get people who see some kind of artificial difference between attribution and verifiability. I think that in general it is a good idea to merge related policies such as these to discourge divergence and to make Wikispace less convoluted. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 15:30, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Comments</span></h2>
<p>Aren't <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> foundation issues? Perhaps they meaningly can be combined, but I was under the impression that these (along with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>) weren't negotiable. Perhaps that means that their effects must remain in place, but the <i>names</i> and arrangement of the policy documents which contain them can change. I'm all for reforming <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, which I think is a bit of a mess... but we should tread carefully when replacing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Few editors have issues with those.<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngineerScotty_c6c0.html" title="User:EngineerScotty">EngineerScotty</a> 05:16, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>BTW, I'm all for removing duplicate material from <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>--it should be a technical/style guide only; not a content policy. One other thing I think <i>sorely</i> should be added--either to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> or elsewhere--is an article documenting different styles of prose attribution: When to simply state something along with citation, when to attribute it to a source in prose ("So-and-so said..."), etc. This has a great deal of impact on the presentation of a Wikipedia article; many edit wars spring up when someone tries to use the more authorative voice-of-Wikipedia (no prose attribution) instead of an explicit attribution in reference to a controversial or disputed claim.<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngineerScotty_c6c0.html" title="User:EngineerScotty">EngineerScotty</a> 05:19, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with the stated goals. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 05:26, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This gets it the wrong way round, I think. The aim of Wikipedia is to be a compendium of the world's knowledge, that is why we do not conduct research ourselves but weigh and compile the research of others. The necessity for attribution stems from "No original research". <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 05:31, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The need for any content rule is to <i>choose between content choices</i>. The rules/policies only exist to help us make those choices. In particular when two groups both know they are right (cretionism vs evolution; scientology vs sane people; democrats vs republicans; etc) <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 05:40, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Other than the foundation issue above (and the existence of nearly 6 years of precedent concering WP:V and WP:RS)--how this is organized, and which policies are axioms and which are theorems (to borrow a bad analogy) isn't probably important.</p>
<p>Slim--I think the content of <a href="../../../a/c/c/Wikipedia%7EAcceptable_sources_2d50.html" title="Wikipedia:Acceptable sources">Wikipedia:Acceptable sources</a> (which like this, was composed just today) might be a useful addition. Interestingly enough, there already are questions on that article's talk page, as if it were policy...&#160;:) Thoughts?</p>

<dd>Engineer, the spirit of the policies is a foundation issue, but the spirit is adhered to in this.

<p>I am concerned that the "reliable" aspect of sourcing will be watered down. Especially since "truth" is not the requirement (and never was). Conspiracy theory cruft is shot down frequently with the "reliable" policy. If it's not a fundamental, stand-alone pillar and is only a part of the "attribution" pillar, it may be harder to enforce. Maybe "reliable attribution" would be better but I am not sure how this policy is better than the ones we already have in place.--<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 05:48, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As long as it's written in a way that citing it to removed unsourced and poorly sourced information doesn't make it vague or muddled, I think it's fine. Deleting a comment that is sourced by saying it violates "WP:Attribution" will create edit wars simply because the defintion of "Attributed" means sourced. It will be confusing to newcomers if the "reliable source" aspect of "attribution" is buried here. Imagine User:Smith citing a blog (correctly and completely) but being told that his comment was deleted because it violated "Attribution." It's much easier to explain a blog isn't reliable that therefore violates "Reliable Sources" rule. It will be harder to explain how an attributed comment violates the "Attribution" rule because of the "Reliable Source" sub-clause.--<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 06:20, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just wanted to say that I think this is an excellent idea. It is silly to have three or four policy pages where one will suffice. These issues are closely related, and having four different policy pages to deal with different aspects of it is just confusing. The current draft looks mostly good to me - the things I'd take issue with are, I think, things I already take issue with on the existing pages, and are relatively minor.

<p>Not sure why this section is called "How to format citations", but anyway, a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure all the detail on prose attributions is necessary—I say define it, give an example, and move on. Most of it is more related to NPOV anyway (evident from the fact that we link to it twice in a space of less than 100 words).</li>
<li>More important than prose attributions, I feel, is citations and <i>what</i> exactly should be cited. Perhaps the three words are sufficient (substantial, surprising, controversial), but I'd much rather see more detail here than in prose attributions. Of course, there's probably more dispute over what should be cited, which might explain the silence.</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've again removed that "well-known and reliable organization[s]" can be examples of self-published sources. A self-published source is one where there is no-one (or hardly anyone) standing between the writer and the act of publication. No fact-checking, no legal checks, no editing. Well-known and reliable organizations don't operate that way. To include those is to miss the point of what a self-published source is and why they're problematic. For example, we can't say that <i>The Washington Post</i> is a self-publisher, although of course it is, in a sense. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 09:02, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not yet fully at ease with the current distinctions w.r.t. self-published sources:</dd>
<dd>Re. "we can't say that <i>The Washington Post</i> is a self-publisher" - Correct, but I'd see it this way: an organisation that (1) has publication as its <i>core</i> business, and that (2) grants at least some minimum (or even more) of <i>journalistic freedom</i> for its reporters, that in other words does <i>not</i> have complete central control over every letter written on its pages, is not usually referred to as a "self-publisher". Common sense, no? The second point implies that the more <i>control</i> an organisation exerces over its published content ("controlling" implies it is thoroughly checked, up to the minutest detail), <i>the more</i> likely its publications might be, in a normal understanding, <i>self-published</i>. For instance, the publications by a state-owned press agency under a centralised regime, would more likely be considered <i>self-published</i> by that regime, than publications by a press agency subsidised by a state, under an agreement journalistic freedom.</dd>
<dd>Another example: suppose you want to write something on the topic of whether or not Microsoft has open source software:
<ul>
<li>If you use Microsoft as a source, you'd be able to find confirmation that they do. Microsoft has a host of legal advisers, and technical personnel, and nothing would be published by Microsoft without fact-checking and legal checks. So in the current definition <i>not</i> self-published.</li>
<li>Then there is <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_S._Raymond_ac9d.html" title="Eric S. Raymond">Eric S. Raymond</a>, who, using the website of the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_Source_Initiative_a78d.html" title="Open Source Initiative">Open Source Initiative</a> as a platform, disputes Microsoft's claims that they have open source software. Whether content published by Mr. Raymond on the OSI website is usually <i>checked</i> by anyone besides himself before publication, is an open question. Well, sure, OSI would have legal advisors if they need them. But if these play any role in the OSI <i>publications</i> is an unanswered question, and would at least require <i>original research</i> to establish. So, in the current definition, Raymond's publications on the OSI website would be <i>self-published</i>, and rejected for use in Wikipedia on a page discussing Microsoft's policies.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>IMHO, this is not how it's supposed to work.</dd>
<dd>I'd rather see it work like this: Both Microsoft and Eric Raymond <i>self-published</i> on the issue. Even if Raymond had his writings systematically checked before publication: again, it's not up to Wikipedians to do the original research on finding out whether he did or not. Even if, by now, Microsoft maybe already has filled a library's worth of "checked" publications: publishing is not their *core* business. And then, in Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, we'd have to get rid of some of the odium now rather artificially imposed on self-publications: both sides (as well Microsoft, as OSI-founder Raymond) are best placed to characterise their own viewpoint on the matter. Wikipedia shouldn't draw a conclusion who's "right" in this issue, per WP:NPOV. Muting one of the two viewpoints on the matter by an inappropriate definition of self-publication is not a good idea. --<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> 13:31, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Various definitions of self-published and problematic source are possible. Speaking as an engineer, if it were not for technical publications by organizations that are not usually thought of publishing houses, Wikipedia would not exist, because there would be no computers to host it, and no leisure time to write it because we would all be too busy hunting and gathering (well, maybe that's a slight exaggeration). So someplace in our policy we must acknowledge that technical publications issued with decent quality control over the editorial process are reliable sources; not necessarily unbiased, but indispensable in spite of any bias.</dd>

<dd>Also, the prohibition on Wikipedia being the first publisher of original research only applies to the finished article.

<dd><i>Some articles about popular culture and fiction rely on self-published primary sources (e.g. posts on bulletin boards, blogs, and Usenet) or secondary sources (e.g. fan-written web sites), because few other sources exist for them. Although they are self-published, these sources are often the best available. In such cases, the source may be used as long as the material used was posted by named, or well-known pseudonymous, individuals with known expertise in the subject. The individual need not be a professional in a relevant field. Anonymous posts should never be used. Note that these sources are the exception, not the rule—few subjects have more than one or two such sites, and many have none at all. If in doubt about how to use a source in this area, consult any relevant WikiProjects for advice.</i></dd>

<dd>I, for one, am happy with the current wording. It provides a useful way of working on articles for which the general consensus appears to be that they should exist on wikipedia (at least as far as consensus is manifested over at AfD) but for which sources are sparse. Academic courses on media &amp; culture rarely produce the kind of material that it has been generally accepted wikipedia should have about these topics, particularly detailed explanations of elements of popular works of fiction, usually combined with information about how fans of those works of fiction have reacted to them. The example cited some way above of <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoo.html" title="Spoo">Spoo</a> is a great one -- it relies on a self-published source the authority of which cannot easily be questioned, and it provides useful insight into the culture of Babylon 5 fandom by analysing how fans have reacted to the concept.</dd>
<dd>Also, I'm a firm believer that policy should describe as closely as possible how wikipedia editors work (at least when they are contributing their best material). It's pretty clear that most editors at popular culture articles already work like this.</dd>
<dd>I don't see it as a loophole. It's pretty clear from the phrasing that such sources can only be used when there is a lack of non-self-published sources, so all it does is extend the ability to have sources to articles that previously couldn't have any. If such articles aren't wanted, then they should be deleted as unsuitable material anyway; lack of available sources is a poor excuse to delete an article when a small change to policy can permit perfectly acceptable sources for it. And if the source isn't acceptable, one would have to wonder why a "named, or well-known pseudonymous, [individual] with known expertise in the subject" would post it. Inaccuracies in it would call into question the indvidual's expertise in the subject.</dd>
<dd>As for "fancruft", current rules about deciding whether content is encyclopedic or not should be adequate to remove it, if it is felt necessary. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 14:48, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>First, I disagree with this notion that policy ought to be largely descriptive. The prescriptive element is paramount. There are vast areas of Wikipedia that have no references. If people don't want to do it, why don't we just give up referencing altogether? The descriptivist argument on this is putting the cart before the horse.</li>
<li>Why stop at pop culture? What about the physics cranks, who were the original impetus behind the content policies? "Only George Looney believes The Moon is Made of Green Cheese so it's only natural that we use his Usenet postings to describe the idea." No, take the article to AfD and make sure George Looney has no place here.</li>
<li>Re "It's pretty clear from the phrasing that such sources can only be used when there is a lack of non-self-published sources, so all it does is extend the ability to have sources to articles that previously couldn't have any." This is what's sooo wrong about it. We can't find reliable sources so let's use non-reliable ones? Think about it—it turns the entire basis of the content policies on their head.</li>
<li>As with previous issues on this page, <i>that something already occurs does not mean we should encourage it</i>. A double standard in our main space presentation should not be self-fulfilling. I oppose the addition on that basis alone. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 15:11, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sorry, I meant the wording which was removed and placed in the discussion above.</dd>
<dd>Why stop at pop culture? Pop culture (and fiction, as it is stated in the wording I prefer) is a subject which the general consensus seems to be should be included in wikipedia. That is what differentiates it from the crank science articles <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">User:Marskell</a> is talking about. If consensus were that such articles should be included, we'd probably have to drop the entire self-published source rule, but clearly there is no such consensus.</dd>
<dd>If other topics emerge that have similar problems associated (i.e., consensus they should be discussed, lack of non self-published sources, availability of high-quality self-published sources, and those sources are not written by <i>professional</i> experts so would be allowed under exemption 1), they should be considered for addition too.</dd>
<dd>IMO, Wikipedia has too great a bias against using self-published sources. There are some great sources out there we could be using, but we're too frightened of losing grip on the control we currently have. It's time to experiment a little, see what we can achieve if we allow ourselves to. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 15:30, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the excised paragraph should stay out. We should recognise that the identity of authorities will be context-specific; for example a statement by Gene Roddenberry on the origin of Klingons could be accepted as gospel in a Star Trek article whereas a statement by Stephen Hawking on a cosmology topic would need to be attributed because while Hawking is <i>an</i> authority he is not <i>the</i> authority. But we should not go as far as dropping any requirement for authority where none can be found. That goes fundamentally against the principle of no original research, for a start, and it subverts the core value of Wikipedia as an encyclopaedia (i.e. a tertiary source, summary of secondary sources of known authority) and mooves us right in there with MySpace and all the others. If something is not reported and discussed by relevant authorities, we should not be afraid to walk away from that subject. Otherwise we'll have no way of excluding crank theories which are shunned by all but their proponents, for example. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 15:36, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Guy, why do you see this paragraph as "dropping any requirement for authority"? The paragraph in question contains the following requirements:
<dl>
<dd><i>[The sources being discussed] are often the best available. In such cases, the source may be used as long as the material used was posted by named, or well-known pseudonymous, individuals with known expertise in the subject.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The point is to establish that the source <i>is</i> authoritative, by virtue of being the best available authority on the subject. Known expertise means a good reputation for the source. These are all things that suggest that authority is required.</dd>
<dd>Whatever you may think, there are authoritative self-published sources. We should be able to use them when we find them. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 16:23, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And what source tells us the pseudonymous source has well-known expertise? A show of hands amongst fans? The idea that being the only available source on a subject qualifies something as a reliable source, is awfully flawed logic ("if we can't find it, lower the standard"). If everyone but you drops out of your law class are you necessarily a good lawyer? JzG is right: if there are no reliable sources available—with reliable defined by a single wiki-wide standard—then we should walk away from a subject.

<dd>I truly believe part of this policy should be to prefer the most reliable source availble. There is way too much reliance on websites when books exist on the topic. But I think equal application across the mainspace would hinder this. Basically you would end up encouraging editors to claim that all sources above a certain threshold of reliabilty (i.e. organizational website) are to be treated equally because we must apply the policly equally. I strongly oppose such results and I thik this idea will lead there. I think there is something to be said that the application of a policy depends on the subject. We must use judgement here. Unreliable sources should never be used. However a reliable source should not be excluded simply because of it's means of publication. Of course authors of self-published sources need to extra scrunity to ensure they are reliable, but don't make the rule of thumb (means of publication) of judging reliabilty become a line in the sand.--<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_e0e3.html" title="User:BirgitteSB"><font color="#F4A460">Birgitte§β</font></a> ʈ <a href="../../../b/i/r/User_talk%7EBirgitteSB_b59e.html" title="User talk:BirgitteSB"><small><font color="#778899">Talk</font></small></a> 17:11, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"And what source tells us the pseudonymous source has well-known expertise?" That is down to editors on a single article to decide. If they can't, mediation would assist. This is exactly the kind of thing we deal with on a day to day basis, and there's little or no difference between a self-published source and a disputed source published by a usually reliable publisher. We judge based on the general reaction of people with knowledge about the area. If most of them seem to think the source is good, we use it. If there is significant dissent, we use the source cautiously, being careful to attribute in the body of the document and not judge as right or wrong. If there is strong dissent, we don't use it. And this is the way it should be.</dd>
<dd>Nobody's talking about lowering the standard. We're talking about recognizing that there are perfectly good sources available, that are of more than high enough standard for us to use, but they happen to be self-published and in those cases (which are described as rare in the paragraph we're talking about, which indicates a presumption that any individual case is not covered) we should relax the rules and allow the source. This is already covered by <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. It's not *really* any change to the way things are at the moment. It's just codifying a case where rules are ignored on a day to day basis and where the majority of editors seems to accept that that is the right thing to do. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 17:13, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

Hey, that's fine by me -- but as usual, I see things a bit differently. If we're going to do over, let's do right.</p>
<p>This proposal -- and the policies on which it is based -- and the new concerns it attempts to address -- and the lengthy discussion above -- send up dozens of red flags to my eye. They always have. In a nutshell, they are mostly attempts to define a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bright-line_rule.html" title="Bright-line rule">bright-line rule</a> in an area where good, mature judgement is required. Or, as older people used to shout at me when I was young and extremely foolish:</p>
<p><i><b>It's not all black and white; it's mostly shades of gray.</b></i></p>
<p><i>Written</i> policy to the contrary, there really are places where a little OR is acceptable. Any experienced editor can drag out a dozen examples. Ideally, every single statement would be sourced <i>but</i> this is not an ideal world. Most statements in most articles are poorly sourced. This <i>should</i> improve. Much content is warred over and the quality of the textual support for various positions is questioned. To a point this is <i>essential</i>; to another, <i>destructive</i>.</p>
<p>The difficulty in trying to draw a neat line around all the permitted things which excludes all the forbidden things is that the world does not break neatly into these two components. At any moment, the borderline is going to run right through somebody's farm. So, this kind of policy -- in any organization, on any project -- becomes the occasion for bitter, pitched battles over the exact position of a tiny segment of the line. And we have seen very clearly how true this is in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Here we fight it out over what sources are reliable and which not, which topics are susceptible to <i>real</i> sourcing and which always seem to end up sourced to primaries, which passages can be removed on sight, which commented out, which tagged or flagged, which debated on talk. This leads to the misconception that we <i>can</i> draw that bright line. We can't. All we can do is <i>strive for better sourcing</i>.</p>
<p>What makes this all the more difficult is that <i>no one</i> of us has a true grasp of the <i>range</i> of topics in this project. Each of us is an individual human and this project is a reflection of the <i>sum of all human knowledge</i>. It is absurdly arrogant for anyone to say he has a handle on the whole thing. But every time I push a piece of the line to reflect my concerns in <i>this</i> general topic area, you worry that it will affect <i>that</i> area. We're both right.</p>
<p><b>Written policy has always poorly reflected actual practice</b>. I speak of <i>these</i> core content policies. These have always been written very specifically, yet they have always been applied very loosely. I feel that this is a failure of our community, as a whole, to practice self-honesty. It's a little like a fellow who says, "I only ever drink one beer a day," yet if you go through his grocery bills, you see he manages to go through 2 cases every month. I don't think we need to struggle bitterly over the number of beers drunk but we do ourselves a service (a) by being truly honest about how many beers we really do drink and (b) trying to cut back a little, when that's feasible.</p>
<div class="floatright"><span><a href="../../../s/o/u/Image%7ESource-grades-demo.png_ce1c.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/4/4f/Source-grades-demo.png/144px-Source-grades-demo.png" alt="" width="144" height="48" longdesc="../../../s/o/u/Image%7ESource-grades-demo.png_ce1c.html" /></a></span></div>
<p>What's wanted is a <b>source grading system</b>. Far better to assign letter grades to sources -- A, B, and C, no need for anything more complex and we have no interest in anything of lesser quality. These standards can be applied across the board, regardless of topic. Hard science, fancruft, religion, history, current events: anything. We can draw up a <i>list of A sources</i> and establish fairly rigid criteria for inclusion; we can even set explicit standards for B and C grade sources. These criteria do not change from field to field.</p>
<p>My first, rough stab:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="sourcegrade" style="background:#B2F0DE;"><b>A</b></span>: Major newspapers, magazines, and peer-reviewed journals with searchable online archives. Books by reputable authors, reviewed in other A sources, highly regarded by experts in the field....</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span class="sourcegrade" style="background:#FBDEA7;"><b>B</b></span>: Books by reputable publishers, regardless of other merit. Websites whose content passes over some bar or review (<i>not</i> blogs). Local newspapers and magazines. Official government or corporate publications....</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span class="sourcegrade" style="background:#FFC2C4;"><b>C</b></span>: Primary sources. Other books and websites, if there is some evidence that more than one person had some control or input....</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, that's just a half-assed stab at what needs to be defined in greater detail. Here, hard distinctions can and should be made. Now, on to application:</p>
<p>Each article contains a references section. Here is the place to display the letter grade for each source. I strongly favor a color-coded system; it makes it easy to see at a glance what you have got. There's no need for cute icons, though; simple CSS backgrounds will do nicely. All that's wanted are 3 templates: {{sa}}, {{<a href="../../../s/b/_/Template%7ESb_0666.html" title="Template:Sb">sb</a>}}, and {{sc}}. These also cat the article into A-sourced, B-sourced, and C-sourced articles. (I also have another CSS trick up my sleeve, which I promise to reveal a little later.)</p>
<p>Now, the furious pressure to defend fair sources is off. Now, we look over the sprawling corpus of this project and see that in some fields, A sources dominate. In Mathematics or Physics articles, even a B source is questionable; a C source is beneath notice. There are a few exceptions and we can wonder why. In some social fields, say, the history of silent movies made by directors of small stature, B sources predominate. Pokemon articles, not surprisingly, get by on a few B sources and a lot of C's.</p>
<p>We now have a true reflection of our inevitable compromise between <i>irresistible principles</i> on one hand and <i>immovable reality</i> on the other. Most articles in most fields rely on the <b>best available</b> sources. When they do <i>not</i>, it's time to ask questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we find better sources?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Should we delete poorly-sourced material?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Shall we permit <i>status quo</i>?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll bet this reads like a novel, radical proposal. I say it's not. <b>This is what we've been doing all along in our heads</b>. This is the <i>reason</i> for all the windy debates, all the attempts to make exceptions for this class of article or that, all the furious battles to hold the line against the hordes of bloggers and viral marketing agents. We all know that in a perfect world, all articles would be A-sourced. We also realize this is unrealistic. Source grading just makes our process transparent.</p>
<p>Our shortcoming, to date, has been that we struggle to do <i>everything all at once</i>, to draw the bright line and hold every article to that standard <i>instanter</i>. This fails us twice: by causing us to delete useful material that really is as well-sourced as possible <i>and</i> by allowing poorly-sourced articles to languish when the need for improvement could be made evident.</p>
<p>We do our readers a service by honestly indicating the strength of our material. I think letter-graded sources go a very long way toward answering our critics who claim that all sorts of whiffle oozes through the cracks around here. <i>It does.</i> Let's be honest about that second beer. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reid_d143.html" title="User:John Reid">John&#160;</a><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Reid_5801.html" title="User talk:John Reid">Reid</a> 15:27, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I really like this proposal over the current mess of categorizing sources as "problematic" or whatnot. It reflects reality, particularly at the FA level (such as the aforementioned Pokemon). At multiple points in time I've suggested to prospective FAs that "We have a NYT article, <i>use it</i>". I am a <i>little</i> concerned over displaying the source quality in the article, and how that will affect GA (where snap-judgement reviewers say "No A-class sources, fail") and to a lesser extent FAC. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 15:44, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with John Reid's main point, but I do think that it's covered by "Ignore all rules"; in other words, Wikipedia is saying, here are our guidelines, but "ignore all rules" can trump any of them, if necessary. The letter grades are likely to break down in as many quibbles as any other categories (John already has "not blogs" in brackets; some people say "but some blogs are OK" etc., and so then we disintegrate into B3(ii) etc. and we're off up one of the tubes in Terry Gilliam's <i>Brazil</i> with our backsides on fire. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 16:00, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is a problem with GA and FAC process not a problem with the proposal. I like the basic proposal at first glance. But I do not see it an alternative to a good attribution policy. I actually think that the suggested method of grading is tooo rigid and narrow. I think it would be a good idea to work at grading sources through Wikiprojects and keep the grades subjective to that particular Wikiproject. Obviously if the grades are not absolute they would need to relegated to the talk page, which I think John will dislike. But his main premise about how we need to do less talioring in the policies is an excellent point.--<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_e0e3.html" title="User:BirgitteSB"><font color="#F4A460">Birgitte§£]</font></a>&#160;? <a href="../../../b/i/r/User_talk%7EBirgitteSB_b59e.html" title="User talk:BirgitteSB"><small><font color="#778899">Talk</font></small></a> 16:04, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that "as well-sourced as possible" is not good enough. It could be taken as an invitation for people writing in obscure fields to use unvetted, essentially self-published sources where it's hard to judge the actual expertise of the sources' authors. Simply because the field has been little-examined does not mean we should allow this to take place. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 16:53, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Another person who agrees with the thrust of John's point but not the solution. The grades just give us another area to fight it out in and create division. It's definitely a grey area, and we should definitely state that front and centre. I think it's best we make that clear and try to steer and ultimately address issues through the rfc and wikiproject arenas case by case rather than attempt to legislate the clear line. We can't do it centrally, by bringing it here or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, then we're just arguing in front of a panel who may not understand the nuances of each specific instance, because these policy pages do gain a following. I think we have to keep all our guidance and policies pretty grey, I think that's the idea that Wikipedia was founded upon and why we had the <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> system, to flag issues. Centralising creates a bureaucracy, and Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy. Wikipedia is not a central entity, it's a community, there's no central power, so let's not cede power centrally.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Returning to the issue of sources, there's always been an argument that we allow all sources and let the reader decide, which is something I can sympathise with, up until the point where you hit the grey area of presenting in a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 16:47, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I think a source grading system is a good idea. I'm not sure it should be part of <b>this</b> policy; at least not without experience. Rather, I'd like to see a WikiProject to evaluate sources (and the quality of article sources), just as the Wikipedia 1.0 is doing for articles. If that <i>works</i>, perhaps it can be written into policy, but at this point I'm not prepared to support it as part of this policy. --<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngineerScotty_c6c0.html" title="User:EngineerScotty">EngineerScotty</a> 16:51, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hard to believe I've been so quickly misunderstood. I'll try to clarify:</p>
<p>Letter grades don't break down <i>as easily</i> in quibbles because it's easier to define absolute standards for sources <i>once</i> it is understood that all grades of sources are <i>permitted</i>. It's easier for me to compromise on a point if there <i>is</i> an area of compromise, rather than "winner-take-all". We fight out sources on the level of sources with hard distinctions; this allows us flexibility in evaluating an article later as <i>well sourced</i> or <i>poorly sourced</i>. Current <b>written</b> policy has the fight all in one place: <b>Is-this-article-sourced-to-our-standards-or-must-it-be-deleted-now.</b></p>
<p>Blogs may be permitted as C-sources; that's for the community to decide. I don't think it's hard to see how a blog <i>might</i> rise to the level of a B-source; I just think it's very difficult.</p>
<p>We <i>don't</i> allow unsourced cruft but some of the Pokemons come pretty close. I don't propose any loosening of restrictions <i>at all</i>. Poorly-sourced quasi-cruft exists today; source grading just makes such pages evident: <i>all C sources and not too many of them, hmm, maybe delete</i>.</p>
<p>We definitely can't set standards of inclusion <i>here</i>. The problem with current written global standards of inclusion is that they are too inflexible and attempt to draw hard lines. While this can be seen as essential to our integrity, the <i>reality</i> is that such global standards are often honored in the breach while local standards prevail. I think it's much more realistic to set global standards for sources -- <i>when</i> a range of qualities is understood. This does <i>not</i> resolve the conflict between global and local standards for <i>articles</i> but it does direct the discussion onto something previously agreed upon.</p>
<p>Source grading needs to be developed in detail. I suspect the best approach is gradual. I've already created the templates; go ahead, <b>be bold</b>, and apply them to sources as you find them. This is the "bottom-up", community-based approach to developing policy. Don't war over source grades; at present <i>no sources have been graded</i> so there's plenty of fresh turf to work. When a large number of sources have some grade attached to them, <i>then</i> will be a good time to try to write standards that reflect actual practice. Even at this point, these grades carry no "weight"; they're just "there".</p>
<p>Over time, perhaps, the overall grade of sources cited in an article will come to figure in discussions of that article's inclusionworthyness. I suspect that some fields will be quick to adopt local policies requiring a certain grade of sources; others will not. At no time is it necessary to write an exhaustive global policy to cover this. The key global principle is simple: <b>We want all articles to have the best sources possible and we'd rather not have very poorly sourced articles at all.</b></p>
<p>Source grading is only relevant <i>here</i> because it takes so much of the pressure off of this discussion. Instead of wasting energy trying to define what we mean when we say "articles must be based on reliable sources", I suggest that all our policy really needs to say is: <b>Articles must be based on reliable sources.</b> One line of text, more or less. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reid_d143.html" title="User:John Reid">John&#160;</a><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Reid_5801.html" title="User talk:John Reid">Reid</a> 17:43, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Old popular culture section</span></h2>
<p>This section has now gone entirely. This is a BIG PROBLEM. Popular culture definitely, and I'm sure many other areas I don't edit in NEED an exception for the often very high quality self-published sources that exist online. Remember - not every topic has professional experts. Many hobby and leisure topics only have dedicated fans and enthusiasts. This exception needs to be made possible. Not easy, but possible. This is a case where specific subject areas have different needs - exactly the sort of thing we have WikiProjects for. We should note that. (Or at least note SOMEWHERE on the page that specific subject areas may have particular requirements for sourcing - both more and less restrictive than this - and that you should consult relevant WikiProjects.</p>

<li>Do we need to guide that only professional experts are acceptable? And how do we decide what constitutes a professional expert?

<dd>Yes, but I'm here thinking how we define professional? I mean, someone with google ads on their blog is getting paid, yes? I agree with you that there's got to be flexibility to the point where we can say, look Tom Spurgeon is a bloody reliable source for comics commentary. We've talked around issues on sources at the comics wikiproject a tiny bit, and we seem to have roughly agreed that it depends on what you source as to what is a reliable source. I mean, <i>Wizard</i> is a publication but we're not holding to the rule that that's wholly reliable. It's all context. So yes, I agree that the concerns about this need to be met, even if a popular culture section is unacceptable people have to look at what constitutes an expert. Many fans are considered experts within the field, so why do we have to stick to a professional tag? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 17:56, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This isn't about popular culture. It's about the fact that there are over a million articles on Wikipedia, and the people weighing in on this proposal have edited a tiny fraction of them. We are not in a good position to address the sourcing needs of articles on quilting, ultimate frisbee, clockmaking, and other oddball topics. I want to make sure that editors working in those areas have the latitude to write good articles on those topics. The standards are that every article should use the best sources available for a topic. We have a good sense of what the general traits of best sources are. But we should not be in the business of imposing inflexible standards of best sourcing over a million articles. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 00:27, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Also, I'm sure if you ask those editors, you'll find that either (a) once you explain why attribution is important to them they'll understand and accept that the policy is a good idea or (b) that they already think it's a good idea, but feel that other people will add sources later, and that the most important thing to do first is to get the content down so sources can be found.

<dd>(edit conflict)You misunderstand me I am not arguing that common practice shows consensus against properly sourcing articles. I believe common practice is to constantly improve the sourcing of articles, and I have never heard of people going a round removing the sourcing of articles. SoI thik this show common practice supports the sourcing of articles. However I think common practice shows consensus is against the deletion of popular culture articles and I think it is out of line to back-door outlaw them by outlawing the only sources they could possibly use to become properly sourced.--<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_e0e3.html" title="User:BirgitteSB"><font color="#F4A460">Birgitte§β</font></a> ʈ <a href="../../../b/i/r/User_talk%7EBirgitteSB_b59e.html" title="User talk:BirgitteSB"><small><font color="#778899">Talk</font></small></a> 18:55, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think most of us, if not all, sign up to <b>Reliable sources are published materials or documents whose authors are regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand</b> I'm not sure why we have to expand beyond that, to be honest. Can we perhaps amend <i>When a professional or academic expert writing in his or her area of expertise</i> to <i>When a recognised expert writing in his or her area of expertise</i>? The onus would still be on the person using the source to demonstrate the recognition, so I think it equates to the same as the previous text. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 19:05, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm prepared to take Phil Sandifer's word for it that there need to be exceptions for popular culture, but could he give some specific examples? I'm not usually involved in that sort of article, but I love popular music and films, and it seems to me that published secondary sources other than blogs and fan websites do exist for those areas. Even the obscurest British band tends to be mentioned in NME and other British music papers, for example (the journalism may not be of the highest standard, but it would suffice, I think). There are also many film and television magazines and columns in newspapers, as well as reviews. Stepping outside my areas of knowledge, I also know of magazines and columns that review video and computer games, celebrity events etc. On all these subjects there are guidebooks and various publishing epiphenomena. I actually own a book about <a href="../../../s/u/r/Survivor.html" title="Survivor">Survivor</a>, I'm embarrassed to say, and one about the minor footballer <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Friday_25ed.html" title="Robin Friday">Robin Friday</a>. I'm not doubting Phil, but I'd genuinely like to hear of types of exception. Are they significant enough in number to merit an exception in the main policy, or could they not be treated individually as they crop up, with a touch of "ignore all rules" thrown in?<a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 19:18, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By far the best source for Babylon 5 information is the fan-run Lurker's Guide. Doctor Who information continually relies on the Reference Guide and Outpost Gallifrey. the J!Archive is by far one of the best resources for Jeopardy. And comics, don't get me started. But these are just the examples that I idly know. I assume my knowledge is not comprehensive, and that there are other areas that, like popular culture, have many of their best sources self-published online. Hence my belief that we need to clearly have an exception that defers to the WikiProjects to be allowed to identify "special case" sources. Not an "open the doors to crap" policy, but a policy that lets editors in areas bend the rules as needed for their areas. If areas become a problem, we have dispute resolution mechanisms to rein them in, but I don't anticipate that being a problem often. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 00:27, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The places I've seen this exception argued for, Qp10qp, are in articles about individual elements of a larger work of fiction. Someone writing an article on, say, a specific Pokémon or a planet featured in a <i>Star Trek</i> story arc. In these cases, often the only sources available are the source material itself (a primary source) and fan-written webpages. Some folks here are arguing that those fan-written webpages should be allowed when they are written by "acknowledged experts" or are the "best sources available". But this fails to address the point of who determines that these are the best sources available? Phil has mentioned WikiProjects, but that's hardly a solution. The fans of <i>Babylon 5</i> get to decide that a fanpage is reliable? And this assumes that WikiProjects even exist in the area. What about topics with inactive or non-existent Projects? No one is advocating "backdoor elimination" of these topics based on Reliable Sources policies. If the primary sources are the only non-self-published sources available, source the article from primary sources. It takes time for popular culture to get academic or press attention, and it takes even longer for specific elements of that popular culture to get noticed in many cases. Thirty years ago, it would have been difficult to find much information on <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speedy_Gonzales_90e3.html" title="Speedy Gonzales">Speedy Gonzales</a>. Today, there's enough information to write a Featured Article (from high-quality, academic sources) on that character. It takes time, and I don't think relaxing standards (or sanctioning widespread disregard for existing policy) is a good idea in any way shape or form. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 02:32, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not convinced that special exceptions need to be made in the policy, but, reading the comments above, I believe these articles could be written within the terms of the present wording, though, as Phil says, with perhaps a little bending of the rules here and there. The advantage of keeping the exception out would be to deny personal-opinion mongers a loophole for using certain contentious blogs and websites as sources.</dd>

<dd>The present wording has, to my delight, more or less removed the previous deprecations of primary sources, which means, for example, that <i>Speedy Gonzalez</i> films or cartoons can be used as sources for themselves, and that a planet in a <i>Star Trek</i> episode could be the basis of an article that merely recorded everything about the planet in the episode—these aren't purely primary sources, anyway, because they have gone through a process of editing and production by a large number of people. And, Phil, I don't believe that "academic" sources are required in particular, just published ones. I believe that the present text's relaxing of opposition to primary sources that come to us through a secondary medium creates far more freedom for popular-culture articles to operate than before and answers many of the needs expressed. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 12:24, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, agree with Marskell and Jimbo. We need to be hardasses about sourcing. I don't think it hurts to add a {{fact}} tag to a questionable statement and make a note on the talk page that someone needs to provide some references in the next 24 hours/48 hours/week or the information will be removed. But we do not need to hem and haw about this. Information on Wikipedia needs sources.

<li>I strongly disagree with this; problematic practice that undermines the reliability or legitimacy of the project must be changed. When I first edited Wikipedia (2003) it was very common practice to upload images from anywhere you felt like without tagging them. Now we have reformulated policy to prevent this from being done. Other existing practices that have changed in the past three years: AfDs being decided by vote; Featured articles being written without citations (later expanded to inline citations); stub categories being created without prior approval; biographies of living people being held to the same standards as other articles, instead of higher ones; and userboxes in template-space being employed to express political and religious opinions. These practices have all been amended by policies and the encyclopedia is improving every month for it. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 18:28, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>In the case of image coprights, userboxes, and BLP, policy changed in order to shape practice.

<li>Userboxes were distinctly contentious; and much of the contention arose when some editors decided to change practice without changing stated policy and other editors clung to policy.

<li>To add further, the conversation in its present form has exhausted itself. We've seen from Slim (way up there now), Phil S., and in Brigette's and Jules' replies, a kind of "descriptivist defence". And we've seen strong arguments from Taxman, Andrew L., Brian S., JzG, and myself, to the contrary. The poll at this point only invites a repetition of "A," "not-A." There's certainly enough dissent that the section as it stood should remain out; I suggest someone draft compromise wording and we go from there. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 19:54, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Marskell, I'm not sure I'd place myself in the descriptivist camp. I feel I'm between descriptivism and prescriptivism, in that what we do when we formulate policies is try to capture the spirit and letter of what the best editors already do, plus anything the Foundation regards as essential (whether good editors do it or not). Bear in mind that this is not a complete reformulation of existing policy. This is an attempt to merge two policies that already exist. We can tweak them here and there, but their essential points have to remain. If they don't, we're unlikely to get community consensus for the new policy. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:17, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My dictionary distinguishes between the two as "must" meaning "to be compelled to" and "should" as "expressing obligation or expectation". If we mean to say that we want and expect something "should" should be used. If we mean to say that we will <i>will</i> force it to be so then "must" should be used. I would rather we didn't add to existing bad feelings by deputizing source-nazis to carry out the mandate implied by "must". <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 20:33, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I share SV's concern about the change from must to should. Should implies that it is not a requirement but an expectation. Additionally, "should" is often used for things that we ought to do but for some reason don't - we need to stay far away from that implication. If the must language implies (must right now) then I would have reservations but I read must as an eventualist - it must be attributed and we are working on getting it there, removing spurious and controversial claims that are not attributed as we continuously improve the articles. --<a href="../../../t/r/%C3%B6/User_talk%7ETr%C3%B6del_2c9f.html" title="User talk:Trödel"><font color="#06C">Trödel</font></a> 21:03, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Sorry, it must have been a misunderstanding on my part. I was under the impression that we are saying that all material in Wikipedia, <i>at a certain point</i>, needs to be attributed to a reliable source. We can leave temporarily with material that is not attributed, if there is a sensible expectation that such source can be found. Only that material that is challenged, need to be attributed within a sensible period of time, otherwise it will be deleted. That is why I chose to use <i>should</i> rather that <i>must</i>. But if this opens loopholes that will be exploited by the usual suspects, I would not object to returning to the <i>must</i> version. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 21:27, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Impetus behind this proposal</span></h2>
<p>In case we lose sight of this, the reason this proposal was started is that, over the last year or couple of years, there have been a lot of complaints on the mailing list and elsewhere about the way V and NOR were developing. Many good editors felt they were too convoluted; the way RS developed was such a mess that it was being mostly ignored; and people were frequently complaining that the policies meant that many articles on pop culture couldn't exist, and that even some that were featured articles (for example, <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoo.html" title="Spoo">Spoo</a>) were actually in violation of policy. Those of you who patrol the talk pages of V and NOR know how often we were asked what editors working on pop culture were supposed to use as sources, given that we had ruled out the only sources that existed in their areas.</p>
<p>Because of all of the above, some good editors announced that they were going to ignore the policies from now on, and just use their common sense. When you reach the point where good editors are having to ignore policy so they can get their work done, the policies have to be tweaked back in the direction of the best practises of those editors. A purely prescriptivist position just isn't tenable.</p>
<p>At the same time, we can't throw the baby out with the bathwater. We have to retain the essential points (the spirit) of V and NOR, or the community and the Foundation won't support the new policy. So we have a very careful juggling task ahead of us. The new policy has to be <b>good-user-friendly</b>, while not opening up any loopholes for careless editors, bad-faith editors, newbies, and so on. This therefore has to be a cautious and conservative streamlining of V and NOR that, at the same time, takes into account the complaints we've heard over the years and accommodates those editors' concerns. If we can produce that combination, we'll have a winner. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:46, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'm still unsure about having removed the primary/secondary distinction, because a lot of editors considered that a very important part of the policy. (I found it useful, but was in two minds as to whether its usefulness outweighed the confusion it sometimes introduced.) Also, the popular culture exception seems to have been removed or reworded, which I would prefer to see back in.</dd>

<dd>Birgitte, I think you may have misunderstood my stance on V and NOR. They were under frequent assault by editors trying to change little bits here and there, but without taking into account that there had to be coherence between V, NOR, and RS. I was very conservative when it came to that kind of random tweaking, but I've been wanting to see the pages merged for quite some time. In fact, I tried to merge them and WP:CITE when I was a new editor myself, but was reverted after about three seconds.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 21:43, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Tim, maybe this will help to clarify. It's true that the individual parts of an edit can be reliably sourced and yet the edit itself is OR because it synthesizes those bits in a novel way that advances a position. That is OR, and that is your concern about this proposal: that we don't say enough to make clear that that's not allowed.</dd>

<dd>That's an insightful way to look at it. Can we police it through this page only? I encountered this exact problem early today, <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_John_W._Johnston_4da5.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/John W. Johnston">here</a> (do follow the link to the bottom—it dovetails with my point perfectly!&#160;:). I like the idea of a seperate NOR page to deal with the synthesis issue. This isn't an invitation to continue these massive, rambling policy essays (are you going to have a go at NPOV next&#160;:), but just an observation that distinct issues should be treated distinctly. I'm still not convinced that NOR shouldn't be distinct from attribution... <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 22:31, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One last suggestion: "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether the material can be attributed, not whether it is true." This is a lot like a current sentence in WP:V that has been criticised before. Changing it to either "...attributed to reliable sources..." or "...not just whether it is true" would address the criticism there, that taken by itself, the sentence makes wikipedia's reliability sound flawed: "we'll publish anything somebody has said without regard to whether it is true or not" is a valid interpretation of that sentence. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 22:06, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, my comment wasn't constructive. We could possibly just not mention the issue of truth. The reason I always liked that phrase (verifiability, not truth) is that it immediately told new editors what was going on i.e. that we don't want to know what they think is true, but we do want to know what reliable sources are saying, true or not. We don't know what is true for any given issue anyway, and usually there is no "truth" involved, just opinions. Some reliable opinions, some kooky ones.

<p>The <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_FAQ_f2c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution/FAQ">Wikipedia:Attribution/FAQ</a> still needs lots of content. I've added a section relating the what I call the <b>Wikipedia Paradox</b> (don't create that article, please, as it would be filled with OR)--why we think we're a reliable encyclopedia (or can become one) when we clearly don't meet the requirements of this policy, or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. See what you all think.</p>
<p>Also, I've put in a placeholder for primary/secondary/tertiary sources. While the distinction is confusing on the policy page, it might be useful on the FAQ.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Applying this policy</span></h2>
<p>Here is a real life example: A comment made today by an editor at <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cff4.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia_talk:Biographies_of_living_persons</a>, with this question: "I need to know whether Youtube is reliable source".</p>
<p>How our proposal stands in regard of this question? Does it provide an unambiguous answer to this question? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 22:59, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it doesn't, but WP:ATTFAQ might. The answer is that Youtube is not a reliable source because anyone can contribute to it; although if all they're doing is using it as a place that stored a reliable source (e.g. a clip from a documentary by a reliable source), then we can link to it, but Youtube is not the source in that instance; the documentary is. Lots of people get confused on that point. It's perhaps worth reiterating in the policy. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 23:05, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(edit conflict) I am a little unclear on what is being asked there. 1) You can view YouTube a a convience link to a CNN report (provided it was officially uploaded by CNN and not a copyvio). In that case YouTube is not the CNN is, this is equivalent to asking if Wikisource is a reliable source. The question is invalid because these two sites are simply a convience link to the actual source. 2) YouTube in regards to it's original content can be seen as any other self published source and evaluated per the rules on self-published sources. Which basically means it would be acceptable only it were autobiographical or a reliable expert commentating on their area of expertise. --<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirgitteSB_e0e3.html" title="User:BirgitteSB"><font color="#F4A460">Birgitte§β</font></a> ʈ <a href="../../../b/i/r/User_talk%7EBirgitteSB_b59e.html" title="User talk:BirgitteSB"><small><font color="#778899">Talk</font></small></a> 23:10, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes. That is my view as well. Providing that the authenticity of the material can be asserted (i.e. it was uploaded by MSNBC) a YouTube video would be a good convenience link, although you could also link directly to the msnbc.com website. Other reasons why a specific clip can be not used as a convenience link, is if the video clip is a copyvio (a known problem in YouTube). <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossi_3859.html" title="User:Jossi">≈ jossi ≈</a> <small><a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJossi_08ad.html" title="User talk:Jossi">t</a> • <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Jossi_2ed2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Jossi">@</a></small> 23:16, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A few questions about application</span></h2>
<p>Before I go further, I'd like to ask the editors with in-depth knowledge of this proposal how it would apply with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammerspace.html" title="Hammerspace">Hammerspace</a>, a well-established and notable <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fandom.html" title="Fandom">fandom</a> expression with zero academic presence. (I admit that the article asks for citations at the moment, but they're on the talk page - just not integrated yet.) Would <a href="http://www.sleepisfortheweak.org/articles/glossary.html#h" class="external text" title="http://www.sleepisfortheweak.org/articles/glossary.html#h" rel="nofollow">fan-made glossaries</a> and <a href="http://www.animeinfo.org/animeu/phys101-l4.html" class="external text" title="http://www.animeinfo.org/animeu/phys101-l4.html" rel="nofollow">articles on large fansites</a> be not rejectable as sources?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Assuming the term can satisfy people on notability grounds, I should think that, assuming the sources are respected in the relevent communities, they ought be usable. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 01:41, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

</dd>

<ul>
<li>A list of incidents or occurances built by editors. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_by_gory_death_scene.html" title="List of films by gory death scene">List of films by gory death scene</a> is the ur-example. All entries are verifiable by watching the movies - but should every one come with a citation of a respected source discussing the specific acts of violence?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Straightforward - the films are valid primary sources. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 01:41, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>This is probably a more complicated issue, actually. The films themselves would be suitable sources for a hypothetical list of films by death scene, but the actual list is making a value judgement—that some death scenes are gory while others are not (and, glancing through the list, there certainly seem to be a number of entries for which this is not at all obvious)—and would therefore need to be more thoroughly sourced. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 02:54, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>An uncontroversial article about an old video game, containing information gained from playing it. Does there have to be a reference to a game review saying the same things? (Some have claimed as much in the past.) Is <i><a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmo%27s_Cosmic_Adventure_88f0.html" title="Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure">Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure</a></i> allowed to have an illustrated description of the game's ending without citing a reputable publication?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Popular culture again</span></h2>
<p>I've just read through and it's looking good. The only point of real contention that I can see is the popular culture section. This was exception three in the Problematic sources section. It read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some articles about popular culture and fiction rely on self-published primary sources (e.g. posts on bulletin boards, blogs, and Usenet) and secondary sources (e.g. fan-written websites), because few other sources exist for them. Although they are self-published, these sources are often the best available for those topics. In such cases, the source may be used so long as the material used was posted by named, or well-known pseudonymous, individuals with known expertise in the subject. The individual need not be a professional in a relevant field. Anonymous posts should never be used. Note that these sources are the exception, not the rule — few subjects have more than one or two such sites, and many have none at all. If in doubt about how to use a source in this area, consult the relevant WikiProject for advice. This provision applies only to articles that fall clearly within the popular culture or fiction categories.</p>
</blockquote>

<dd>I support it strongly in a wider form - there are no doubt other areas that need this, and we shouldn't set up a paradigm of drawing endless exceptions.

Howabout:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some articles concern topics which are notable and encyclopedic, but which are not well-documented in scholarly or professional sources or literature; or which contain notable aspects which are not documented in a fashion anticipated by this policy. Examples include popular culture and fictional topics. Many articles in these areas rely on self-published primary sources (e.g. posts on bulletin boards, blogs, and Usenet) and secondary sources (e.g. fan-written websites), because few other sources exist for them. Although they are self-published, these sources are often the best available for those topics. In such cases, the source may be used so long as the material used was posted known individual (including those known by a well-known <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudonym.html" title="Pseudonym">pseudonym</a>) with established expertise in the subject. The individual need not be a professional in a relevant field. Anonymous sources should never be used. Note that these sources are the exception, not the rule — few subjects have more than one or two such sites, and many have none at all. When such sources are used, they should attributed in prose in addition to having a formal citation; sources of this nature whose reliability or applicability is disputed by editors in the topic should not be used. If in doubt about how to use a source in this area, consult a relevant WikiProject for advice. This provision applies <b>only</b> to topic areas which are not addressed in professional literature. Note that unorthodox or <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">fringe</a> theories in academic or professional subject areas, such as <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science.html" title="Science">science</a>, are not covered under this provision, even if the theory in question is not directly addressed in the mainstream literature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've generalized the wording, but added a few restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If editors in a topic object to a source, out it goes. We may want to loosen this a bit, otherwise we may get cruft-haters objecting to every source on crufty topics they don't like, then demanding deletion because what remains is OR.</li>
<li>Explicitly states that such claims should be attributed in prose; stronger evidence is required for claims of the type "<b>X</b> is true" as opposed to "<b>S</b> states that <b>X</b> is true."</li>
<li>Made it plain that scientific crackpottery does not qualify. Since science is an acadmic pursuit, all claims which fall under the rubric of science are expected to use high-quality sources; the fact that Aetherometry is largely ignored by the mainstream science literature doesn't entitle the "rise of the latrines" fellows to claim "our topic isn't covered by first-class sources" and thus self-publish their junk here.</li>
</ul>
<p>One topic area I often write in, just as an example, is <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roadgeek.html" title="Roadgeek">roadgeek</a> articles. Few professional secondary sources exist for this; though lots of informal web sites provide seocndary sources. Primary sources are better--many government road departments or DMVs have detailed web databases available--but writing a decent article on these topics requires either using web-based secondary sources or engaging in a level of synthesis which easily qualifies as "original research".</p>

<dd>As I said higher up the page, I believe that the present text has met the need of the vast majority of popular-culture articles by no longer deprecating primary sources in principle but only unpublished sources. Films, comics, songs, TV shows etc., since they come to us as produced by a large number of people through a secondary medium, can now be used as sources for themselves without contradicting the policy. In other words, an article about a planet from an episode of <i>Star Trek</i> could be constructed by describing everything about that planet in the episode, giving the episode, with its credits and broadcasting history, as the reference; no need at all to quote what people say about it on fansites. Of course, this amounts to writing from within the fictional world, perhaps, rather than through the refraction of critical or historical comment, but writing from within the fictional world has never been banned by Wikipedia, only deprecated against a more critical style where secondary sources do exist.</dd>

<dd>This exception may apply in a certain number of cases but in my opinion not a large enough number to require an exception clause in the policy; let each good-faith article in that category have its head in accordance with commonsense, critical judgement, and "ignore all rules". The above clause offers a loophole as big as a barn door for political extremists and pseudo-science nutters to justify the quoting of their pet websites and blogs on Wikipedia: and that's the real problem, not rule-oozing in odd little corners of popular culture. <a href="../../../q/p/1/User%7EQp10qp_d299.html" title="User:Qp10qp">qp10qp</a> 13:01, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone answer me this, because it wasn't answered earlier: if we can't establish that a given site is itself reliable how can we possibly determine which "named, or well-known pseudonymous, individuals with known expertise" are posting to the site?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Questionable sources should <b>usually</b> not be used...</span></h2>
<p>Having edited Stormfront.org and some other highly contentious areas of Wikipedia, I have some reservations about the following sentence.</p>
<p>“Questionable sources should usually not be used as sources except in articles about themselves.”</p>
<p>It is an unfortunate truth, IMHO, that people with extreme viewpoints, especially highly charged ones, will almost always twist any rule to justify either retaining material that supports their viewpoint, or as a means to remove material that contradicts their viewpoint.</p>
<p>If you leave in the word “usually”, you have opened the door wide open for an edit war (having many battle scars myself, I feel entirely confident in that statement.) As Admin and other potentially fair minded editors are often stretched pretty thinly, the usually outcome is for the extremist position to hold for an extended period of time, as the other editors simply get worn down and leave.</p>
<p>I hate black and white statements as much as the next person, and would like to leave some wiggle room for when cold hard logic would indicate that the rule should be set aside in a particular case. However, as currently written, at least for the areas that I frequently edit in, I can see certain people running a tank through the door that has been left cracked open.</p>
<p>I should say that overall I think Wikipedia:Attribution is a better approach than what is currently employed, and looking forward to it becoming official policy. Thanks <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrimba_6849.html" title="User:Brimba">Brimba</a> 07:03, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem is that "questionable sources" covers a huge range, including any source with no fact-checking process. To say that any such source cannot be used is taking the matter too far. For instance, during the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Frey_10b9.html" title="James Frey">James Frey</a> controversy, his publisher admitted to not performing fact checking on memoirs. Should we therefore ignore <i>all</i> memoirs published by them? That doesn't sound reasonable to me.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps moving extremist sources into a section of their own and stating that they should never be used except in articles about themselves is better. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 07:33, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am not sure that there is a perfect answer, but I think some improvement could still be made. Perhaps tweaking the section “A questionable source”.</dd>

<dd>As an example of what I mean, look at <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States_be7f.html" title="Illegal immigration to the United States">Illegal immigration to the United States</a>, it is currently a poster-child for such problems. The editor(s) involved will claim that every rule has been followed, and everything is fully cited. And yet, in truth, almost every rule has been twisted and broken, and the citations are mostly worthless and unwarranted. You have an extremist editor who is dug in and (except for Jossi), almost everyone else now avoids the edit wars that go with editing/fixing that page.</dd>

<dd>People are human beings, and we can never entirely “legislate” away such problems. People with extreme views will always exist, and the smart ones will always find a loop-hole which will allow them to do largely what they wish. The question is, can we build into the new policy enough safeguards so that at the very least, the not so intelligent ones can be rendered harmless? <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrimba_6849.html" title="User:Brimba">Brimba</a> 08:40, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we explicitly stated that a consensus of editors could deem a source unreliable and hence unsuitable for inclusion, then editors insisting on using that source afterwards could be dealt with through standard procedures for persistent policy violation (e.g. warning, then edit block, perhaps followed by a page-specific ban in cases of repeated offense). As long as the consensus were clear, it wouldn't be a "content dispute" of the kind that currently doesn't get dealt with in such ways, but something more like a 3RR violation. As this is a somewhat novel approach, I'm only suggesting it very tentatively, but it seems worth considering to me. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 12:57, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would certainly oppose any use of consensus for solving disputes. The problem with consensus is that in fringe topics, is you can easily get a “consensus” that George W. Bush was behind the 9/11 attacks; that IRS has no legal authority to tax anyone and therefore people in the know have no obligation to pay taxes; or that as it is a well established fact that the US Supreme Court error in (fill in the blank) and its holding in that case has been made moot though (fill in blank). Each of these three examples lead directly to fringe areas of Wikipedia that one point had enough editors with that viewpoint to validate them though a simple consensus. Once that occurs, anyone objecting would have to go out and round up editors to take their side, and of course the “consensus” side would do the same…. In theory, someone on a white horse will ride in from above and force through the rules that ultimately would correct the problem; However, the number of people riding white horses and willing to jump into edit wars seems to be somewhat lacking.

<dd><i>You can't legislate clue, and you can't close the door to malice.</i> Absolutely right. And trying to write instructions that legislate clue and really nail it down so you can't get a truck through some crack in the instructions (the crack is where the instructions suggest actually thinking rather than pretendimg the world is black and white) results in overgrown deformed monsters like <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWAS_4.250_1936.html" title="User:WAS 4.250">WAS 4.250</a> 15:35, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A hypothetical case</span></h2>
<p>A <a href="../../../t/h/i/Think_tank.html" title="Think tank">think tank</a> has a reputation for producing solid research in the field of <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics.html" title="Economics">economics</a>. It is widely known that it employs experts in the field to produce papers for it, which it then publishes without independent fact checking. The papers are published under an organizational banner, without the name of the individual expert author. Is this source acceptable?</p>
<p>A few points of analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>The papers are probably self-published. There is no independent review; the think tank instructs the author what to write about and then publishes the result without checking it.</li>
<li>While the author is an expert, there is no way to verify this fact.</li>
<li>Could the organization itself be called an expert? Its reputation may go some way towards this, but it seems a stretch to apply the word.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideas? <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulesH_8c63.html" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> 08:01, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The papers aren't self-published if they're being published by a respectable think tank. No respectable think tank would publish what the authors wrote without reading it to make sure they wanted to be associated with it. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:55, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm underwhelmed. A considerable number of "think tanks" are highly partisan, operating as a kind of intellectual engine for this or that political party. They have grand names and intellectual pretensions, but are blinkered. Solid research nurtured (financially and otherwise) within a good think tank can then be published after traversing the same hurdles (no higher or more numerous) as those for anyone else: the authors can submit their works to peer-reviewed journals or to reputable publishers. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:30, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
