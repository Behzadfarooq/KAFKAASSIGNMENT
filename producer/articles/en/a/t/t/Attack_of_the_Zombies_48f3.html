<p><a href="../../../x/a/n/Xana_%28Code_Lyoko%29_66e8.html" title="Xana (Code Lyoko)">Xana</a> activates a <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_%28Code_Lyoko%29_4ce5.html" title="Tower (Code Lyoko)">tower</a> in the <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyoko.html#Desert" title="Lyoko">Desert Sector</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../o/d/d/Odd_Della_Robbia_49ea.html" title="Odd Della Robbia">Odd's</a> room, one of Xana's ghosts comes out from the lamp on the desk. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Kiwi" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Kiwi</a> is the only one in the room at the moment. The cloud attacks, although the result is unseen.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Courtyard" title="Kadic Junior High School">Quad</a>, the gang is talking about their Italian test. In a rare turn of events, it seems that Odd is actually much better at the language than <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremie_Belpois_ebe7.html" title="Jeremie Belpois">Jeremie</a>. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Milly_Solovieff" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Milly</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Tamiya_Diop" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Tamiya</a> walk by at this point. They are trying to interview <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elisabeth_Delmas_1152.html" title="Elisabeth Delmas">Sissi</a> about her thoughts on the language exchange program. In the English international broadcast, they mention exchanging with France (this is ironic, since that is where the show actually occurs). Sissi just says that no one reads their silly paper. Once she's gone, both girls voice their dislike for Sissi. Odd agrees with them, but this is going to change later.</p>
<p>Later that night in the girls' showers, Milly and Tamiya find the possessed Kiwi walking around. Milly heads for the showers while Tamiya offers to take the dog back to Odd's room. Kiwi bites her when she tries to get him moving. Her eyes go completely white and her skin turns green: classic <a href="../../../z/o/m/Zombie.html" title="Zombie">zombie</a> look. In the showers Milly is attacked by Tamiya. She manages to toss her away and get out, but not before getting dressed of course.</p>
<p>Milly ends up at the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Cafeteria" title="Kadic Junior High School">Cafeteria</a>. She recounts the experience to everyone there. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Rosa_Petitjean" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Rosa Petitjean</a> chalks it up to a bad dream, but the gang, minus <a href="../../../y/u/m/Yumi_Ishiyama_c57b.html" title="Yumi Ishiyama">Yumi</a>, knows better. Upon hearing her account of what happened, the gang realizes that the cause is Xana. Jeremie runs the super scanner and finds the activated tower. <a href="../../../u/l/r/Ulrich_Stern_94b0.html" title="Ulrich Stern">Ulrich</a> calls Yumi to tell her what's happened and they head off.</p>
<p>Yumi gets the call while at dinner. Hiroki makes fun of her when he hears Ulrich name, teasing her about him being her boyfriend. She denies it and uses the opportunity to leave the table and run down the street.</p>
<p>The gang leaves the Cafeteria with Sissi, who has decided to follow them. Their trip to the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factory_%28Code_Lyoko%29_6884.html" title="Factory (Code Lyoko)">Factory</a> is waylaid by a zombie <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Moral%C3%A9s_017c.html" title="Jim Moralés">Jim</a> as well as many other zombified students. Sissi runs away in <a href="../../../f/e/a/Fear.html" title="Fear">fear</a>. Ulrich heads after her while the others barricade themselves in the Cafeteria for safety. Rosa faints upon seeing the zombies. The gang tries to escape out the back, but are stopped by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_primary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_9961.html#William_Dunbar" title="List of primary characters in Code Lyoko">William</a>. Being the oldest conscious person in the room, he sees it as his duty to protect everyone.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Park" title="Kadic Junior High School">Park</a>, Sissi has been cornered by zombies. Ulrich comes by and saves her, taking out more than a few students and even a teacher in the process by utilizing his <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pencak_Silat_e0a4.html" title="Pencak Silat">Pencak Silat</a> techniques, including a quick bow to finish the workout. They head off to find a way out of the school grounds. The sewer accessway is already guarded, so that avenue of escape is blocked.</p>
<p>In the Cafeteria, <a href="../../../a/e/l/Aelita_%28Code_Lyoko%29_7a7c.html" title="Aelita (Code Lyoko)">Aelita</a>, Jeremie and Odd are more than slightly annoyed with William's "protection". Rosa wakes up again, but just faints when she sees the zombies outside. William tries to get the city's police to help, but zombie stories don't exactly help his credibility. Jeremie even resorts to telling him about Xana to get him to ease off. It doesn't work. Kiwi eventually arrives, still possessed of course. Odd goes up to pet him and gets bitten ("Ouch! Kiwi, what's wrong with you?"). He's zombified shortly thereafter and attacks Jeremie, causing William to order Odd to be restrained. He is pinned down by Nicholas and Christophe. Despite all this, William still won't believe Aelita and Jeremie's pleas to go to the Factory and stop the attack of the reanimated corpses.</p>
<p>At the front gate, the police arrive to check out the scene. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Michel_Rouiller" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Michel Rouiller</a> is there, having been in the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Garden_Shed" title="Kadic Junior High School">Garden Shed</a> the entire time. Since he hasn't heard anything, he assumes nothing is wrong. The police chalk the call up to a prank and leave. The zombies arrive and attack Rouiller once the officers are gone. Sissi and Ulrich are there, as well, and find they've hit yet another dead end.</p>
<p>Yumi arrives at the Factory, only to find it empty. She calls Jermeie who gives her an update on the whole situation. Having no reason to stay, she heads for the school.</p>
<p>At the school, Ulrich has decided to help the others. He distracts the zombies while Sissi heads for the Cafeteria. After a short round of questions by <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Herv.C3.A9_Pichon" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Hervé</a> (to which Sissi openly admits she has a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subscription.html" title="Subscription">subscription</a> to a <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magazine.html" title="Magazine">beauty magazine</a> called <i>Pretty Girl</i> and that she still sleeps with Niny, her <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stuffed_animal.html" title="Stuffed animal">stuffed moose</a>), some forceful name-calling gets them to open the door for Yumi. This lets the zombies get in, too. William is turned into a zombie while trying to fight them off. Ulrich gets more than a little satisfaction for the opportunity to beat him up. He stays behind to help fight the zombies. Aelita and Jeremie use the opportunity to escape. Yumi is waiting at the sewer hatch, having cleared away the zombies blocking it.</p>
<p>At the Factory, Jeremie transfers, scans and <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scanner_%28Code_Lyoko%29_7363.html#Virtualization" title="Scanner (Code Lyoko)">virtualizes</a> Aelita and Yumi to <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyoko.html" title="Lyoko">Lyoko</a>. He has the Overwing ready for them almost instantly. They head off towards the activated tower.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kiwi has arrived at the sewer hatch and has some of his zombie minions remove it.</p>
<p>Once Aelita and Yumi reach the tower, they find three <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Krabes" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Krabes</a> guarding it. Yumi takes out one and leads the others into a nearby canyon. As one Krabe chases the girls, Yumi hands one of her metallic boomerang fans to Aelita. The pink-haired girl uses the fans to destroy the Krabe. As they leave the canyon, a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Kankrelats" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Kankrelat</a> shoots them down. The last Krabe arrives to take care of the two girls. Yumi sends Aelita to the tower and stays to deal with the Krabe. Some fancy footwork on the cavern walls gets her on top of the Krabe. A quick fan attack destroys it. She catches up to Aelita and they head for the tower. They run into a slight problem, though. The tower, along with everything else between them and it, is now invisible. It's still there, though, as Aelita can see it with second sight.</p>
<p>At the Cafeteria, Rosa wakes up again as the zombies break in. She's out like a light at the sight of this. All but Milly, Sissi and Ulrich are overwhelmed by the zombie hoards. Sissi is heard warning the zombies to stay away from Milly.</p>
<p>In the Factory, Jermemie notices Kiwi and his minions heading for the elevator. He asks the girls to hurry. Should he be zombified, no one will be around to activate the return trip and fix the mess Xana has made.</p>
<p>Yumi decides to use her telekinesis to float Aelita to the tower. As she does, the Kankrelat returns to stop her. After a few shots, it manages to shake Yumi's concentration enough to drop Aelita into the <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyoko.html#Digital_Void" title="Lyoko">Digital Void</a>. Lucky for Aelita, the lack of ground is only an illusion. It's still there, along with the tower. Yumi notices, too, but is taken out of play by the Kankrelat. Alone now, Aelita is faced with a Kankrelat behind her and a newly materialzed Krabe in front of her. She's told by Jermemie to run for the tower, and he is confident that she won't get shot along the way. His confidence is well placed, as she gets into the tower without incident. The Kankrelat, who was following her, bounces off of the tower and runs in a circle on the ground.</p>
<p>Jeremie is bitten by Kiwi just before Aelita shuts off the tower. In a similar situation at the Cafeteria, Sissi and Ulrich have also been overwhelmed. Sissi is surrounded while Ulrich holds back a zombified Odd. Jermeie manages to hold on long enough to start the return trip.</p>
<p>Back in time, they have the same conversation about Italian. Milly and Tamiya are also trying the same interview and express the same dislike after failing. Ulrich tells Milly that Sissi may like her more than she realizes. Aelita mentions that she can also be very brave and nice, when she wants to be. A quick look over at William has Jeremie saying that you never can guess a person's true colors. The episode ends on that note.</p>
