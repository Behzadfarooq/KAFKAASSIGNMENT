<p>You did not rationalize your edits with an edit summary (which you should do for every single edit) nor did you cite your additions.

<p>You have to win the trust of the community and show your competence. It's unlikely to happen before 3 months and 1,500 edits, and safer is 5 months and 5,000 edits as well as participation in project space, e.g. <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">AfD</a>. <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">Civility</a> is a major point, as is understanding policy, e.g. <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">NOR</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">VERIFY</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>. Edit summary usage is looked at: you can set your preferences to remind you to leave an edit summary, as you're not leaving them at the moment. Check out <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfA_0b0c.html" title="WP:RfA">RfA</a> to see how it works.</p>
<p>Please note that simply marking something as a "stub" is discouraged now and you should use something more specific, e.g. "artist-stub". See <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Stub_sorting_Stub_types_99e7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Stub types">WikiProject Stub sorting/Stub types</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Stub_categories" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Stub_categories" rel="nofollow">Stub categories</a>.</p>

<p>Nope. That's a rough guide and a minimum, which some people would oppose anyway. Also excessive keenness counts against. Why do you want to become an admin? What people are looking for is someone who is a good editor, committed to the project, knowledgeable, helping out as well with project tasks and communicates well with other editors through talk. I think you made a good judgement on those two red links, and also leaving the ice hockey one, which may well merit an article. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:53, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, I noticed you added a bit to the section on reliability in the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphite-Epoxy_Motor_2661.html" title="Graphite-Epoxy Motor">Graphite-Epoxy Motor</a> article claiming that the failure mentioned was due to sabotage. I am curious to find which source claims this, as all the sources I have state that the cause of damage was indeterminate. Please provide a source or two regarding this, and then feel free to replace the sabotage claim later. Until then, I have removed your edit. Please do not take this the wrong way, I just want to make sure that the statements in this article are all backed up by sources.</p>

<p>Howdy! I've rolled back your comments on the above page. While you had no way to know it, us admins are doing some damage control at the moment trying to determine whether or not that's an impersonation account. All evidence points towards it being one, but on the off chance that it's actually him, we put together a unified response requesting confirmation first so we don't look like a bunch of chickens running around with our heads cut off (no matter how accurate that analogy might be). Please don't be offended, a quick browse of the history of that page should show you that you're not the only person touched by this.

<p>Thanks for the info, but I don't see a merger discussed anywhere. I've put the tag back. If you object, let's discuss it in the proper place: <a href="../../../2/0/0/Talk%7E2006_Stanley_Cup_Playoffs_81f9.html#Proposed_Merge" title="Talk:2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs">Talk:2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs#Proposed Merge</a>. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 10:52, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That wasn't much of a merger discussion; I apologize for not realizing it was that to which you referred. Frankly, with no disrespect to the work you've done, I don't see anything there worth keeping beyond what's already in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Stanley_Cup_Playoffs_df35.html" title="2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs">2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs</a>. There has already been one response in support of the merger, plus the two you pointed out from the earlier discussion, while you're the only one so far arguing to keep the forked article. That's not a consensus, obviously, but I think it's too early to say there won't be one. =) <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 18:43, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I've left a note on the article talk page. If you're not happy with dialogues with other editors, check out <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">DR</a> for alternatives, such as a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">RFC</a>. However, the first thing is to get some perspective. Try editing something you've never touched before and which you are not personally involved with. Try some history! That will give you an objective view on differences that occur. Getting a less involved view is essential, and may mean backing off altogether for a while till things settle down. After all, in a year's time, will it all seem so important? It's not a bad thing to try to see the funny side of it all — it does exist... Get back to me if you want, or feel free to email. Sometimes also we have to write things off to experience, and consider the gain has been in what we have learned. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 08:20, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No problem and feel free to share again. You're a very new user (under this name at least) and there's bound to be some setbacks. One stratagem is to spread yourself over several articles, so a setback on one is not so significant. For the future, it would be a good idea in similar circumstances to put forward your proposal to sound out the reaction of other editors first. That way you know if there is going to be support or opposition. It's essential to find ways to deal with the problems on wikipedia, as they come up frequently. Detachment is key to this and emotionalism is counterproductive. No one can doubt your zeal and hardwork, but take care of yourself, and memorise <a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/~apreset1/docs/if.html" class="external text" title="http://www.swarthmore.edu/~apreset1/docs/if.html" rel="nofollow">this!</a> <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 13:54, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Attic Owl, the truthfulness (and just how would you know that Kelly Martin is what you say she is?) of a statement does not mean it's okay to say it. There's also the issue of your word choice; you used a word that is widely considered offensive, and phrased your statement in a disparaging way. Regardless of the veracity of your statement, it was still incredibly incivil. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 13:08, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would like to add that your view on Kelly Martins request for comment is inappropriate. She may have made mistakes but calling for her to be DeSYSOPed is not the way to go to resolve this issue. Even though I believe her actions to be inappropriate for a SYSOP, DeSYSOPing her or calling for her to be deSYSOPed would be and is wrong in many ways. If I were you I would retract said statement which could do more harm than good. Just my two cents. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006"><font color="green">Æon</font></a> <font color="red"><sup><a href="../../../a/e/o/User_talk%7EAeon1006_32f8.html" title="User talk:Aeon1006">Insane Ward</a></sup></font> 15:09, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you don't understand about <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">our civility policy</a>. First of all, even if you <i>did</i> have evidence that Kelly Martin was a transsexual (and I, frankly, remain dubious), the word you chose to use was obviously and incontrovertably inflammatory. Second of all, even if it's true, it's irrelevant to the conversation, and thus inflammatory. Third of all, if it is true, it's not likely to be something she'd want publicized; thus, inflammatory. Fourth, if it's <i>not</i> true, it's <i>definitely</i> not something she'd want publicized; thus... you get the idea. I hope. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 01:32, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is no double standard here. Kelly Martin is being called on her uncivility (It is in the RfC and has been commented on), but that doesn't meen you get to be uncivil right back. Please review the policy it would be a great idea if you did. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006"><font color="green">Æon</font></a> <font color="red"><sup><a href="../../../a/e/o/User_talk%7EAeon1006_32f8.html" title="User talk:Aeon1006">Insane Ward</a></sup></font> 01:59, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Frankly, I wouldn't trust WikiTruth as far as I can throw them. For all we know they <i>made up</i> that birth name given on the first link you showed me. (The second link doesn't work for me, so I can't judge that.) However, you'll note that nothing I said relies on the truthfulness of your statements. Whether what you said was true or not, it's still a personal attack. If you can't understand how something can be both true <i>and</i> a personal attack, you are going to have a rough ride here on Wikipedia. Especially since the "law of reciprocity" isn't a recognized exception to the civility policy. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 11:17, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There IS oversight on SYSOPS trust me on this, it ranges from other SYSOPS, Notification Boards, Requests for Comment, ARBCOM Jimbo Wales and the Foundation. Trust me on this they watch everything and in cases of wrong doing there are set policies in place to deal with it. Calling for a SYSOP to be deSYSOPed and coming from a semi-new editor only causes more bad issues (Mostly for the new or semi-new user who doesn't yet totaly understand Wikipedia.) SYSOPS are nomed by the community and are 'voted' into office (For lack of a better term) by users ( most of the 'votes' are from NON SYSOPs). Your comment is only going to get you a negitive image on Wikipedia by most users so I would recomend again that you retract it.

<p>Attic Owl you have been told about Personal Attacks on Kelly Martin which your last post on my talk page was. DO NOT do it again or I will report you. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006"><font color="green">Æon</font></a> <font color="red"><sup><a href="../../../a/e/o/User_talk%7EAeon1006_32f8.html" title="User talk:Aeon1006">Insane Ward</a></sup></font> 02:13, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not in the least why should I be?.....you need to abide by wiki policy that ALL users must follow. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006"><font color="green">Æon</font></a> <font color="red"><sup><a href="../../../a/e/o/User_talk%7EAeon1006_32f8.html" title="User talk:Aeon1006">Insane Ward</a></sup></font> 02:24, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let it go through and don't make personal attacks ok, your not going to change anything by making them your only going to turn the WHOLE community against you if you do. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006"><font color="green">Æon</font></a> <font color="red"><sup><a href="../../../a/e/o/User_talk%7EAeon1006_32f8.html" title="User talk:Aeon1006">Insane Ward</a></sup></font> 02:31, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You can do so by either reporting it at <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">WP:AN/I</a> (Legit issue only) or my going to another Sysop. There is also Medation and the AMA to help with disputes <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006"><font color="green">Æon</font></a> <font color="red"><sup><a href="../../../a/e/o/User_talk%7EAeon1006_32f8.html" title="User talk:Aeon1006">Insane Ward</a></sup></font> 02:43, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Like all things it depends on the issue. RfC have been very effective in the past and often in some cases lead to a ARBCOM case. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006"><font color="green">Æon</font></a> <font color="red"><sup><a href="../../../a/e/o/User_talk%7EAeon1006_32f8.html" title="User talk:Aeon1006">Insane Ward</a></sup></font> 02:46, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You have to try the other <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> Steps first. And they have Desysoped admins in the past. One was almost recently desysoped. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006"><font color="green">Æon</font></a> <font color="red"><sup><a href="../../../a/e/o/User_talk%7EAeon1006_32f8.html" title="User talk:Aeon1006">Insane Ward</a></sup></font> 03:00, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok.......Jimbo Wales doesn't usually respond to anybody (since his is running the foundation) and uscking up to him would nto help in matters. I would suggest that you get into Wikipedia a little deeper and try to understand it a little better. You are new and therefore still unsure on how things work here. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006"><font color="green">Æon</font></a> <font color="red"><sup><a href="../../../a/e/o/User_talk%7EAeon1006_32f8.html" title="User talk:Aeon1006">Insane Ward</a></sup></font> 03:05, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok that is a little true. But I still recomend that you get into Wikipedia deeper. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006"><font color="green">Æon</font></a> <font color="red"><sup><a href="../../../a/e/o/User_talk%7EAeon1006_32f8.html" title="User talk:Aeon1006">Insane Ward</a></sup></font> 03:18, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
