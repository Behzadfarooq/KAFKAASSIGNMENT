<p>Atticus is the descendant of Simon Finch, a doctor from England who settled near Maycomb. Atticus, rather than stay in the family homestead (named "Finch's Landing") went to Montgomery to study law. There he met and married the future mother of Jem and Scout Finch (who is never named, although it is mentioned that she was fifteen years younger than he), who dies of a heart attack two years after Scout, the youngest child, is born. At the start of the novel, Atticus lives in Maycomb with his two children and his maid, Calpurnia.</p>
<p><a name="Plot" id="Plot"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Atticus_Finch_3a37.html" title="Edit section: Plot">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Plot</span></h2>
<p>Atticus was is the book's most upright character, representing the moral ideal of both a lawyer and a human being: he is brutally honest, highly moral, a tireless crusader for good causes (even hopeless ones), a pacifist and, for the most part, devoid of any of the racial or class prejudices afflicting the other citizens of Maycomb. He goes to great pains to instruct his children on the importance of being open-minded, judicious, generous neighbors and citizens. He is eventually revealed to be an expert marksman, but he had chosen to keep this fact hidden from his children so that they would not in any way think of him as a man of violence. He was once the best shot in Maycomb County, but quit shooting because he felt he had an unfair advantage. Physically, he is described throughout the novel as a tall, middle-aged man with glasses to correct his failing eyesight, and hair slightly graying at the temples. He is also metioned never to take off his vest and tie, except right before changing for bed (he did loosen up his collar during his closing argument at Tom Robinson's trial).</p>
<p>The novel centers around (from the perspective of his daughter, Scout Finch) Atticus' struggle to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, convicted for the rape of a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Despite the fact that there is strong evidence suggesting that Tom is innocent, most of the town takes the side against Atticus simply because his defendant is a black man and the plaintiff is a white woman. Hence, Atticus, his children and his family continually face slander, insults, and sometimes even threats of physical violence from fellow town citizens, schoolmates of Jem and Scout, and even other members of the Finch family. Despite all this, Atticus refuses to abandon the case, and continues to urge Jem and Scout to remain unresponsive to the town's criticism, fearful that they may learn the wrong ethical lessons. Atticus shrugs off all prejudices and insults, forgiving the townspeople for their failings, and continues to work for Tom's acquittal, taking the release of the innocent man as a personal crusade.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/t/t/Atticus_Finch_3a37.html" title="Edit section: Notes on the Character">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Notes on the Character</span></h2>
<p>Just as the entire book is semi-autobiographical, Atticus Finch was based on Harper Lee’s father Amasa Coleman Lee, although the name “Finch” presumably came from her mother, Frances Finch Lee. The name of Atticus came from the Roman orator and noble <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titus_Pomponius_Atticus_fb2d.html" title="Titus Pomponius Atticus">Titus Pomponius Atticus</a>, noteworthy for never taking a side in political struggles but rather staying impartial.</p>
<p>In the film adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird, Atticus Finch was played by Gregory Peck. Lee became good friends with Peck and even gave him her father’s watch, which he used in the famous courtroom scene. For his performance, Peck received the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor_d5c5.html" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a>, and was voted in 2003 by the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Film_Institute_e524.html" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a> to be the #1 <a href="../../../a/f/i/AFI%27s_100_Years..._100_Heroes_and_Villains_ed14.html" title="AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains">Greatest Hero of American film</a>, beating out such famous film heroes as <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_Jones_9930.html" title="Indiana Jones">Indiana Jones</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gandhi_%28film%29.html" title="Gandhi (film)">Mohandas K. Gandhi</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarzan.html" title="Tarzan">Tarzan</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Bond_c2aa.html" title="James Bond">James Bond</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Hood_a190.html" title="Robin Hood">Robin Hood</a>. Peck, a civil rights activist and recipient of the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom_4a9f.html" title="Presidential Medal of Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> award, who favored the role of Finch over all his other roles, had this to say about his performance:</p>
<p>“I put everything I had into it – all my feelings and everything I'd learned in 46 years of living, about family life and fathers and children. And my feelings about racial justice and inequality and opportunity.”</p>
<p>Lee, who later became good friends with Peck and his family, loved his portrayal of Finch and said of it: "In that film, the man and the part met." <sup><a href="http://www.medaloffreedom.com/GregoryPeckMockingbird.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.medaloffreedom.com/GregoryPeckMockingbird.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.medaloffreedom.com/GregoryPeckMockingbird.htm</a></sup></p>
<p>Fittingly, Atticus is one of only two heroes among the top 10 whose goodness and courage manifest themselves in overwhelmingly nonviolent actions. Since many of the most prominent heroes and stars in American film--<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wayne_22ff.html" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clint_Eastwood_469b.html" title="Clint Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_Jones_9930.html" title="Indiana Jones">Indiana Jones</a>, the heroes of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a>--are memorable, to a great extent, for their use of fists, guns, and the like, Atticus is outstanding among iconic movie heroes as an embodiment of quiet, intelligent strength and conscience.</p>
<p>Atticus's line "If you just learn a single trick, Scout, you'll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it" was one of 400 film quotes nominated by the <a href="../../../a/f/i/AFI_27fb.html" title="AFI">AFI</a> for it's <a href="../../../a/f/i/AFI%27s_100_Years..._100_Movie_Quotes_db8d.html" title="AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes">100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes</a>, but was not included in the final list. The line was spoken exactly as it appears in the book.</p>
