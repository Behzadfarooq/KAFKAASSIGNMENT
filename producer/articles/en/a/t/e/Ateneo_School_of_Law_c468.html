<p>The Ateneo Law School offers a complete 4-year program leading to the degree of <a href="../../../j/u/r/Juris_Doctor_dd74.html" title="Juris Doctor">Juris Doctor</a> (J.D.). The J.D. degree was first conferred on the School Year 1990-1991 graduates. The Ateneo was the first law school in the Philippines to offer the J.D. in lieu of the <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Laws_a1d1.html" title="Bachelor of Laws">Bachelor of Laws</a> degree, which is still what most law schools in the Philippines offer today.</p>
<p>The Ateneo JD program covers the different aspects of legal study required for admission to the practice of law. Among the key subjects are constitutional and political law, civil law, criminal law, remedial law, commercial law, international law, tax law, and legal ethics. There is a particular emphasis on legal and judicial ethics, with subjects on legal philosophy and history, legal profession, theology and Church social teachings, and ethics being part of the core Ateneo law program.</p>
<p>In addition to these courses, students are required to undergo an apprenticeship program where junior and senior students get to appear in first level courts and work with other Ateneo law alumni on cases for marginalized sectors of the country. Students are also exposed to work with law firms, government agencies, public or private legal assistance agencies, courts in the Philippines, and work in the Ateneo's own Human Rights Center and Legal Aid Office.</p>
<p>Students also \customize a part of their studies by choosing elective courses from a pool of offerings spanning a broad range of legal and social interests.</p>
<p>As one of the final requirements, Ateneo law students are also required to prepare and defend a thesis on a novel and exigient subject of law. The work on the thesis culminates in the fourth year of studies, under the supervision of a faculty adviser.</p>

<p>The Ateneo de Manila opened its Law School on June 6, 1936, with Ateneo alumnus Manuel Lim as its first Dean. Freshmen and Sophomore classes, and eventually, junior and senior classes were opened. In 1939, the first Ateneo law graduates took the Bar Examinations. In 1940, the Ateneo Law School produced its first bar topnotcher, Claudio M. Teehankee, who would eventually become <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Justice_fa52.html" title="Chief Justice">Chief Justice</a> of the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_the_Philippines_8e88.html" title="Supreme Court of the Philippines">Supreme Court of the Philippines</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>.</p>
<p>The School closed in 1941 as a result of the outbreak of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>. The destruction of its facilities caused by the battle for the liberation of Manila delayed the resumption of classes after the war. It reopened in Padre Faura in 1948, with classes held in quonset huts.</p>
<p>The School remained at Padre Faura as other units of the Ateneo moved to Loyola Heights in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quezon_City_6fb6.html" title="Quezon City">Quezon City</a> in January, 1952. A concrete building was constructed in the Padre Faura campus, where classes were held until 1977. In June 1977, the Law School transferred to a new location at the Ateneo Professional Schools Building along H.V. de la Costa St. in Salcedo Village, Makati City.</p>
<p>In October, 1986, the Ateneo Human Rights Center (AHRC). It was formally integrated into the Law School in 1996 and began to handle the Ateneo Legal Aid Program.</p>
<p>In 1984 until 1990, the School began work on restructuring the law program under the supervision of Dean Eduardo delos Angeles, and applied for government approval to confer the degree of Juris Doctor. The development, implementation, and growth happened in the term of Dean Cynthia del Castillo, which began in 1990. In 1991, the School conferred the Juris Doctor degree.</p>
<p>In the latter part of 1998, the Law School transferred to its present location at the Ateneo Professional Schools Building at the Rockwell Center in Makati City. That same year, the Center for Continuing Legal Education (CCLE) was created as a special unit to provide a venue for continuing legal education programs for the active Bench and Bar as required by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>On July 1, 2000, the Chief Justice Claudio Teehankee Center for the Rule of Law (TCRL) was inaugurated. In the same year, constitutionalist and former Ateneo de Manila <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_President_71fa.html" title="University President">University President</a> Joaquin G. Bernas, S.J. reassumed the position of Dean, which he previously held from 1974-1976.</p>
<p>In 2004, the School formally launched the Ateneo Legal Services Center.</p>
