<p>I have removed portions that are blatant promotional material, and reworded several parts to sound less commercial. Some changes include the removal of adjectives which imply favor with Ateneo, and the removal of references to "the Ateneo" in favor of "Ateneo," so as not to sound elitist. I have also removed the terribly biased section on the elegance of Marian blue.</p>
<p>I would like to eventually remove even the phrases with adjectives that skirt the borders of objectivity, such as "Moro is the largest gymnasium in the Philippines" in favor of more concrete phrases such as "Moro measures so-and-so meters."</p>
<p>Some of the more blatantly obvious non-NPOV sections include: The whole Mission-Vision part. The section on the Blue Eagle--it sounds pretty biased to me. The section on the Cheering tradition--this is difficult to make encyclopedic without deleting most of it.</p>
<p>I will try to continue tomorrowm, but spotting the non-NPOV sentences is a difficult task, and I will have undoubtedly missed many things. Please help us out.&#160;:)</p>

<p>You will need to note that the section on Blue and White is in fact, neutral compared to previous revisions. Marian blue is an official school color. So is white.</p>
<p>The official usage of the word "Ateneo," as dictated by official university standards, uses "the" before "Ateneo."</p>
<p>In the meantime, I am restoring the previous revision.</p>

<dd>Hmm... I was worried that "the Ateneo" might be the correct usage after all. The part about Marian Blue still really seems to tilt the article in Ateneo's favor, though, with all the adjectives that assign to Ateneo an implicit greatness. Ok, for now, after you restore it, I'll go and restore mine, but I'll leave in the use of "The Ateneo" as well as the part about Marian Blue until we can get more input about those parts. <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECma_9260.html" title="User:Cma">Migs</a> 14:10, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi again, Migs. Here's some stuff that can perhaps help you:</dd>

<p>If you read the article on the school name, you'll probably figure why "the Ateneo" has been the official usage until now. It's because of quirks of translation.</p>
<p>However, there has been need for some clarification with regard to how the name is used. Perhaps this snippet from a stylebook can help:</p>
<p>"Ateneo. Popular name of Jesuit institutions of learning in the Philippines. Spanish form of the Latin word Atheneum, which the Dictionary of Classical Antiquities defines as the name of the “first educational institution in Rome” where “rhetoreticians and poets held their recitations.” Fr. James Meany, S.J. further explains that this name is derived from a Greek temple dedicated to Athena, the goddess of wisdom, where the Encyclopedia Britannica says “poets and men of learning were accustomed to meet and read their productions.”</p>
<p>The name Ateneo was adopted by the Escuela Municipal de Manila in 1865, becoming the Ateneo Municipal de Manila. The Spanish roots of the word therefore present a dilemma.</p>
<p>If the word is treated as a Spanish word, references to the school become appropriate renditions of “el Ateneo,” or literally, “the school.” Therefore, the use of “the” before the word Ateneo is appropriate. Thus, the common usage, “the Ateneo” can stand and be used liberally, as in</p>
<p>Jose Rizal graduated from the Ateneo with a degree in the arts. As a University, the Ateneo de Manila seeks to preserve….</p>
<p>However, in the Philippines, the name Ateneo is not merely a common Spanish noun, and is recognized as the official title of Jesuit institutions of higher learning. Thus, to say that one is attending classes at Ateneo is also appropriate. The use of “the” also becomes inappropriate at times, as in</p>
<p>Ateneo students often meet in the cafes along Katipunan Avenue."</p>
<p>"When mentioned for the first time, the full name Ateneo de Manila University should be used. Subsequent references can use the full name, or the abbreviated form Ateneo de Manila. When there are no other Ateneos involved, it can be referred to as the Ateneo. Otherwise, always add the qualifier de Manila for clarification. Not doing so would be an unjustified act of hubris.</p>
<p>Abbreviation into the acronyms ADMU or ADM is undesirable and should be avoided."</p>
<p>"The official title of the University is Ateneo de Manila University. The school name is Ateneo de Manila. The school's 'nickname' is Ateneo, and should only be referred to as 'the Ateneo' if it is clear that it is the Ateneo de Manila that is being talked about. Otherwise, usage of the school name (Ateneo de Manila) should be used prior to just 'the Ateneo.'"</p>

<p>The article is also in need of formatting changes, and perhaps some rewordings to make it sound less awkward. In particular, I notice a lack of several commas, quotation marks, and italicizations, where there should be some. Many Latin words, for instance, do not have quotes or italics on them. I will try to fix this tomorrow, but please feel free to correct these things yourselves.</p>

<li>Strictly speaking, the Ateneo de Manila is NOT Royal and Pontifical. It traces its roots to the educational tradition Universidad de San Ignacio (Not as an institution, though. The roots of the Ateneo are the Escuela Municipal, whereas the San Ignacio was a university established several hundred years before the Jesuit takeover of the Escuela Municipal.), which was the first university in the Philippines (and arguably, Asia), and the first royal and pontifical university in the country (and in Asia).<a href="../../../r/m/c/User%7ERmcsamson_8c93.html" title="User:Rmcsamson">Rmcsamson</a> 08:04, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In 1621, Pope Gregory XV through the Archbishop of Manila authorized the San Ignacio to confer degrees in theology and arts and elevated it to a university.

<dd>The article length's something that used to worry me, until I realized that Wikipedia's full of long articles anyway. This one's just like the articles of other universities (some are even longer). It isn't patterned after any of the articles from the Philippines, since those are rather insufficient. This is closer to, say, Boston College's article. I've restored the history and culture and traditions sections since every school article (especially if one refers to the WikiProject:Schools thing) ought to have a section on history, and what sets it apart from other articles. It has been this completeness of information which helped this article be listed as a Good Article. <a href="../../../r/m/c/User%7ERmcsamson_8c93.html" title="User:Rmcsamson">Rmcsamson</a> 10:46, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not saying that the history/culture/traditions sections should be removed.

The main article's sections features a good summary with highlights while the divided articles features everything else one would need to know about that specific section. But if you think that the current state of the article is fine then so be it.

<p>It offers a better description if Ninoy Aquino is described as a Bedan who studied in Ateneo, being a Bedan should take precedence since he actually graduated from this school and got a diploma as opposed to merely studying but not graduating....both can claim him as alumni but one should take proper precedence so as not to be deemed biased...my two cents...139.130.237.18 02:05, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Irrelevant. Ninoy Aquino's attending San Beda is irrelevant to his attending the Ateneo, and moreso with regard to this article. How San Beda considers Ninoy as an alumnus of San Beda is also irrelevant with regard to this article. <a href="../../../r/m/c/User%7ERmcsamson_8c93.html" title="User:Rmcsamson">Rmcsamson</a> 12:58, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'd agree with Rmcsamson here, Ninoy was both an Atenean and a Bedan, since this is the Ateneo article, Ninoy as an Atenean will be preeminent here, while on the SBC article, Ninoy as a Bedan would be the one's that is prominent. --<b><font color="orange"><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHoward_the_Duck_9612.html" title="User:Howard the Duck"><font color="#FFA500">Howard</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howard_the_Duck_47a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howard the Duck"><font color="#FFA500">the</font></a> <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHoward_the_Duck_380d.html" title="User talk:Howard the Duck"><font color="#FFA500">Duck</font></a></font></b> 08:32, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am tempted to edit the part of the article which speaks of the October Medal as that of our Lady of Mount Carmel. But I am not sure, so I'd like to hear from others.</p>
<p>An inspection of the one being used today in October 2006 and when I was in the grade school back in the 1960s is clearly the Medal of the Immaculate Conception, more popularly known as Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal. See for example <a href="http://www.amm.org/medal.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.amm.org/medal.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.amm.org/medal.htm</a></p>
<p>Could the one who wrote that the Ateneo's October Medal is that of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel be referring to the October Medal before the 1960s? I am sure that today and for the past few decades, the Ateneo October Medal is the Medal of the Immaculate Conception attached to a blue ribbon -- which would make a lot of sense since the Immaculate Conception is the patroness of the school.</p>
<p>Vdejesus 14:20, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>˜˜˜˜ Today, Nov 12 2006, I noticed that someone changed the reference to Our Lady of Mt. Carmel to Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal. I am happy someone agrees with my suggested change.</p>
<p>At the same time, I hope whoever said it was Our Lady of Mount Carmel would e-mail me to tell me where he/she heard that the October Medal was a medal of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel. Perhaps you heard it from a reliable old alumnus? Perhaps before the 1960s, the medal really WAS that of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel? And then perhaps later on, the Miraculous Medal was the one used? That would be historically interesting.</p>
<p>But as the text stands today, I'm absolutely sure that for forty years now, the Ateneo October medal is that of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal which is otherwise called the Medal of the Immaculate Conception. [By the way, in recent years, Xavier School in San Juan also has an October Medal but the ribbon is blue and gold.]</p>

<p>To the person who has made the personal conclusion that the tune of O, Canada was based on the Magic Flute. Where is the reference pointing to this? Did the composer actually say so?</p>
<p>Also, you should remove the bias about Ateneo adopting the melody before Canada adopting their national anthem. The facts are: O, Canada was composed in 1880, well before Ateneo adopted 'Song of Mary', and had been known to Canadians since then, whether or not it was their national anthem. So to imply that Ateneo is justified in copying the melody because they were first to make their song official is misleading and biased.</p>
<p>From the O, Canada website: "By the time the World War broke out in 1914, "O Canada" was the best known patriotic song in Canada, edging out "The Maple leaf Forever" and others less well-known today."</p>
<p>Where is the reference that the melody was in the public domain when 'Song of Mary' was composed? In wikipedia and in the Official O, Canada website, it was only in 1980, when O, Canada was adopted as the national anthem was the melody declared to be in the public domain. The way the entry is written, it seemed like the melody was already in free-for-all before that time. Where are the other popular marching tunes that you are referring to?</p>
<p>Please change it. (I've been trying to change it, but you keep on reverting it to the old erroneous text). You cannot invent facts about the Canadian national anthem here. This is supposed to be an encyclopedia not a brochure.</p>

<dd>I didn't write the text which made the reference to The Magic Flute. But this is what can be dug up:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You may wish to refer to the following entry from the Wikipedia article on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Magic_Flute_3eb1.html" title="The Magic Flute">The Magic Flute</a>:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The theme "March of the Priests" is very similar to, and may have inspired, Calixa Lavallée's music for the Canadian national anthem "O Canada". In the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta Iolanthe, Sir Arthur Sullivan included a musical homage to the Queen of the Night's aria when introducing the character of the Queen of the Fairies.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Careful reading of the text in the official O, Canada article will show that the anthem (O, Canada, with the melody and the lyrics which were adopted) was declared to be in the public domain. The melody was composed before that. Compositions and pieces enter the public domain 50 years after the owner (in this case, Lavallee) dies. The melody which was therefore adopted was already well within the public domain. The Canadian National Anthem entered the public domain in 1980 when it was adopted through the National Anthem Act, years after the melody which was used for it was already within the public domain.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, the paragraph about the Ateneo's adopting the melody before it became the national anthem of Canada is simply stating a matter of fact.</dd>

<dd>"There was no trouble with the music copyright which had by now descended to Gordon V. Thompson. They were willing to sell for $1, but the heirs of Judge Weir objected to the changes in the original version. Since Judge Weir died in 1926, the Weir version would not come into public domain until 1976. There was some doubt that the Weir family had legal grounds for objection since Thompson's apparently held copyright on both music and English words. However the committee preferred to settle the matter amicably if at all possible. The Government acquired the rights from G.V. Thompson in 1970."</dd>

<dd>Adding references to O, Canada possibly being unoriginal is not necessary in the discussion of 'Song of Mary'. The argument (again not necessary) that the melody was procured by Reuter from the public domain is also erroneous and should be removed. The statement of fact that Ateneo officially adopted their alma mater "first" is misleading because it is used in the context that O, Canada was not a copyrighted song, and it fails to mention all the points which I have discussed here.</dd>

<dl>

<dl>
<dd>I fail to appreciate the argument. The facts are simple: The Ateneo, through Col. Campana (not Reuter) adapted the melody of O, Canada for the Song for Mary. This adaptation was done BEFORE Canada's legislature passed the Act adopting O, Canada (in the form wherein it featured BOTH lyrics and a melody) as Canada's national anthem in 1980. That much is clearly stated in the article.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Reading the cited text above shows that this Gordon V. Thompson owned the copyright to the "Weir version" of O, Canada as the anthem (lyrics + melody), which is what Canada purchased. It does not say that the song as Lavallee composed it was the one outside the public domain.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Reading the article entry, it's a response to the possible point that the Ateneo copied Canada's national anthem when the Song for Mary was composed. O, Canada was not yet Canada's national anthem when the melody was adapted. That's pretty clear.</dd>

This is what it says now: "However, with the campus' move from Padre Faura to Loyola Heights, <b>the school adopted "A Song for Mary", written by Fr. James Reuter</b>, as its graduation hymn." Apparently, it is more important to the maintainers of this article to try to prove that the song's melody wasn't copied really, than to tell the world the identity of the actual composer.

<p>1. First sentence: It states that the song was adapted from "O, Canada".</p>
<p>2. Second sentence: It states that people believe that the song was copied from Canada's national anthem. But this is, as stated in the first sentence "O, Canada". I don't know why this escapes you, but the melody of "O, Canada" in 1880 and in 1903 when the current LYRICS of "O, Canada" was written, did not change.</p>
<p>3. Third sentence: It states that the melody of the copied song is a popular marching tune and in the public domain -- I think you are referring to the melody of "O, Canada" which is Canada's national anthem -- in which case you need to verify your sources that it was indeed in the public domain when 'Song of Mary' adopted it. Stating that Ateneo was 'first' to make their song 'official' is useless, because you already established that the melody was indeed copied from... surprise! "O, Canada" -- whose melody did not change from the time it was composed, when it was officially made the national anthem and until now.</p>
<p>Also, please show us your references that Col. Campana/Reuter state that this was indeed an adaptation. If you don't know, do not put your inferences as fact here. Encyclopedic content must be verifiable.</p>

<p>Greetings to all!</p>
<p>I have edited the article to read "the Blessed Virgin Mary under her title the Immaculate Conception, <i>Maria Purissima</i>, ...." rather than "Maria Purissima, Our Lady of the Immaculate Concepcion [sic]...."</p>
<p>It is inelegant and perhaps misleading to refer to Our Lady as "Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception," because she =herself= is the Immaculate Conception. As she said in her apparitions in Lourdes, "I am the Immaculate Conception". The immaculate conception is she who was conceived without original sin in the womb of Mary's mother, whom apocryphal literature names St. Anne, Santa Ana. By the eternal merits of Christ, Mary was conceived without "<i>macula</i>," without "spot" or stain, immaculate -- stainless!</p>
<p>It is correct to speak of "The Immaculate Conception of Our Lady" but it is incorrect to speak of "Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception." The Ateneo's patroness is "The Immaculate Conception," not "Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception." As a matter of fact and perhaps of interest, the Official "Catalogus" of the Philippine Province of the Jesuits lists two names referring to the same school. On top of page 28, it reads "University of the Immaculate Conception BVM" and only below it does one find "Ateneo de Manila University". BVM is the abbreviation for "of the Blessed Virgin Mary," in Latin. In other words, the official religious name, as it were, of the Ateneo de Manila University is "The University of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary." [referring to her having been conceived by her mother, St. Anne!]</p>
<p>Ateneans may be interested to know that, in the same abovementioned Official Catalogus of the Philippine Jesuits, Ateneo de Naga University is also referred to as "University of St. Francis Xavier." The various Ateneo universities, in other words, sort of have a "religious name" each. Ateneo de Davao is "The University of the Assumption BVM".</p>
<p>Finally, let me share that it is a rather common error to think that Jesus is the referent of the phrase, "the Immaculate Conception." He of course was conceived without sin in Mary's womb. But this is by his own merits. The phrase, "the Immaculate Conception" refers not to Jesus being conceived without sin, but to his mother's having been conceived without sin, not through her own merits but "by a singular grace and privilege granted by almighty Gd in view of the merits of Jesus Christ," (<i>Ineffabilis Deus</i>), Christ being the eternally contemporaneous Second Person of the Triune God. Excuse my emphasis and longish dwelling on this point. I merely want to make sure nobody thinks to undo the change I introduced and retype "Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception."</p>

<dd>Only if relevant. A lot of university articles don't even bother placing rankings. If they are to be placed here, the question is, what data should be included? The precise statistical data is available, as well as a response by the university administration with regard to the ranking. <a href="../../../r/m/c/User%7ERmcsamson_8c93.html" title="User:Rmcsamson">Rmcsamson</a> 15:21, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Members of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Good_articles_8d89.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles">Wikipedia:WikiProject Good articles</a> are in the process of doing a re-review of current <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">Good Article</a> listings to ensure compliance with the standards of the <a href="../../../w/i/a/WP%7EWIAGA_4080.html" title="WP:WIAGA">Good Article Criteria</a>. (Discussion of the changes and re-review can be found <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia_talk%7EGood_article_candidates_da1f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Good article candidates">here</a>). A significant change to the GA criteria is the mandatory use of some sort of in-line citation (In accordance to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>) to be used in order for an article to pass the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> and reference criteria. Currently this article does not include in-line citations. It is recommended that the article's editors take a look at the inclusion of in-line citations as well as how the article stacks up against the rest of the Good Article criteria. GA reviewers will give you at least a week's time from the date of this notice to work on the in-line citations before doing a full re-review and deciding if the article still merits being considered a Good Article or would need to be de-listed. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us on the Good Article project <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Good_articles_dec8.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Good articles">talk page</a> or you may contact me personally. On behalf of the Good Articles Project, I want to thank you for all the time and effort that you have put into working on this article and improving the overall quality of the Wikipedia project. <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuciferMorgan_f0d2.html" title="User:LuciferMorgan">LuciferMorgan</a> 03:00, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
