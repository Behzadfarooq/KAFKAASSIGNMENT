Formal opening of the coast to coast connection was on August 17, 1951.

<p>Before utilizing <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microwave.html" title="Microwave">microwave</a> relay, AT&amp;T used heavy-duty open-wire lines for <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_distance.html" title="Long distance">Long distance</a> service. The introduction of <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacuum_tube.html" title="Vacuum tube">vacuum tube</a> amplifiers allowed such connections to reach across North America. In the 1930s the company experimented with long-distance coaxial (<a href="../../../c/o/a/Coax.html" title="Coax">coax</a>) cable. The first long-distance coaxial link in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1936.html" title="1936">1936</a> connected <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>. After <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> it was quickly determined that microwave relay networks were less expensive and easier to build, especially over mountainous regions and rough terrain, and Long Lines evolved into a hybrid network. L-4 and L-5 coaxial systems connected all major US cities, and a digital millimeter waveguide system connected New York to Philadelphia, but the primary medium was <a href="../../../c/_/b/C_band.html" title="C band">C band</a> microwave air links.</p>
<p>A presidential address from <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Truman_9c27.html" title="Harry Truman">Harry Truman</a> inaugurated the Long Lines network, demonstrating coast-to-coast service. The Long Lines network allowed events such as <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a>’s <i><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monday_Night_Football_28c4.html" title="Monday Night Football">Monday Night Football</a></i> to be nationally broadcast live and Long Lines also permitted distribution of regional sports events, such as Saturday football games prior to the adaptation of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satellite_communications.html" title="Satellite communications">satellite communications</a> in the 1970s.</p>
<p>By the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, alternatives (including <a href="../../../f/i/b/Fiber_optics.html" title="Fiber optics">fiber optics</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satellites.html" title="Satellites">satellites</a>) were replacing microwave as the preferred network transport, but the remnants of the Long Lines microwave network can still be seen across the country-side today, in the form of abandoned relay towers, or towers being reused for other purposes (public safety communications, cellular phone sites, etc).</p>

<p>In 1950, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>'s five boroughs were dialed from various communities in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> with the digits '1-1' followed by the 7 digit telephone number. While New York City was assigned <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_code_212.html" title="Area code 212">Area code 212</a> at the very beginning of the Area Code format in October 1947, it wouldn't be until later in the 1950s when <a href="../../../e/n/g/Englewood%2C_New_Jersey_613a.html" title="Englewood, New Jersey">Englewood, New Jersey</a> customers would dial their calls to New York City using the digits 2-1-2. The use of the '11+' code from Englewood (and other parts of northeastern New Jersey) to call New York City had been in place for a while, even prior to 1951. New York City's five boroughs also had been dialing northeastern New Jersey as 11+ the two letters and five digits of the New Jersey number as well for a while prior to 1951 and until the later 1950s.</p>
<p>The telephone industry made a United States "first" in the New Jersey communties of Englewood and Teaneck with the introduction of what is known now as Direct distance dialing (DDD). Starting on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_10.html" title="November 10">November 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1951.html" title="1951">1951</a>, customers of the ENglewood 3, ENglewood 4 and TEaneck 7 exchanges (who could already dial New York City and area) were able to dial 11 cities across the United States, simply by dialing the three-digit area code and the seven digit number.</p>
<p>The use of <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_code_201.html" title="Area code 201">Area code 201</a> to call New Jersey from New York City didn't begin until the later 1950s. Englewood and Teaneck customers in 1951 didn't even know that their own area code was 201! Other cities in northeastern New Jersey, both local and toll, were dialable in 1951 (and for a few years prior) from Englewood by simply dialing the two letters of the Exchange Name and remaining five digits. In addition to New York City, the <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nassau_County%2C_New_York_358d.html" title="Nassau County, New York">Nassau County</a> part of <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Island_ec1e.html" title="Long Island">Long Island</a> was dialable from Englewood and <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teaneck%2C_New_Jersey_e7d3.html" title="Teaneck, New Jersey">Teaneck</a> using <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_code_516.html" title="Area code 516">Area code 516</a>; also <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westchester_County%2C_New_York_0dbc.html" title="Westchester County, New York">Westchester County</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockland_County%2C_New_York_b2d5.html" title="Rockland County, New York">Rockland County</a>, and portions of <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_County%2C_New_York_12f6.html" title="Orange County, New York">Orange</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/t/Putnam_County%2C_New_York_7fd0.html" title="Putnam County, New York">Putnam</a> Counties were also dialable from Englewood and Teaneck in 1951 using <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_code_914.html" title="Area code 914">Area code 914</a>.</p>
<p>Even when most users had Direct Distance Dialing, the company continued to advertise with the slogan "The voice with a smile" referring to the operators.</p>

<p>Long Lines was renamed AT&amp;T Communications in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> since it no longer consisted of the majority of the "lines", or the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_System_70d8.html" title="Bell System">Bell Operating Companies</a>.

<p>AT&amp;T divided AT&amp;T Communications up into 22 operating companies, serving the regions of each Bell Operating Company, resulting in:</p>

<p>Following the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996_bdd2.html" title="Telecommunications Act of 1996">Telecommunications Act of 1996</a>, AT&amp;T Communications began reselling <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_Operating_Company_d22a.html" title="Bell Operating Company">Bell Operating Company</a>-provided telephone service at lower prices, to compete with the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby_Bells_62f4.html" title="Baby Bells">Baby Bells</a>. Such services were done through AT&amp;T Consumer, a new sales unit created to incorporate local/long distance services provided by AT&amp;T Communications.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, AT&amp;T stopped trying to seek new traditional landline customers, following a court ruling which reversed a previous decision that allowed <a href="../../../c/l/e/CLEC_e597.html" title="CLEC">CLECs</a> to have access to the telephone lines owned by the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby_Bells_62f4.html" title="Baby Bells">Baby Bells</a>. As a result, <a href="../../../a/t/%26/AT%26T_CallVantage_24b1.html" title="AT&amp;T CallVantage">AT&amp;T CallVantage</a> was created, as a <a href="../../../v/o/i/VoIP_c2bd.html" title="VoIP">VoIP</a> alternative to companies like <a href="../../../v/o/n/Vonage.html" title="Vonage">Vonage</a>. AT&amp;T Communications would still provide services to new customers, although they would not be advertised heavily.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, SBC Communications purchased <a href="../../../a/t/%26/AT%26T_Corp._91ca.html" title="AT&amp;T Corp.">AT&amp;T Corp.</a>, the parent company of AT&amp;T Communications. SBC had already been offering its own long distance services through <b>SBC Long Distance LLC</b> in its own territory in competition with other long distance companies.
