<p>I have seen various dates for founding of the current AT&amp;T - 2005, 1984, 1885, and 1877. Which is it?</p>
<ul>
<li>According to this <a href="http://www.sbc.com/Common/files/pdf/logo_evolution_factsheet.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.sbc.com/Common/files/pdf/logo_evolution_factsheet.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF file</a>, 1885 is when the AT&amp;T was formed as a subsidary to the American Bell Telephone Co. In 1984, AT&amp;T was broken up into baby bells which contain Southwestern Bell (later became SBC when it acquired a couple of other former baby bells). I think the reason why Wikipedia is listing it as 1877 because of the original parent company of AT&amp;T was founded in that year. --<a href="../../../j/2E/_/User%7EJ._Nguyen_e461.html" title="User:J.

<li><b>Oppose</b> If there were a reference to AT&amp;T that showed a significant difference, then yes. But there isn't.

<p>The founded date shouuld be November 28,2005 because the company created in 1887 ceased to exsist on that date.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The King is Dead, Long Live the King. The original company may have ceased to exist on the financial books, but the article still refers to it, and all the assets of the AT&amp;T that existed on November 27, 2005 are now part of the new company. We need to keep history in perspective. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChadlupkes_29d5.html" title="User:Chadlupkes">Chadlupkes</a> 14:25, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article does a great job describing AT&amp;T up until the point of the merge, however it lacks enough information about the company SBC which is what AT&amp;T has become. There should be a seperate article specifically about SBC before its name change, and what it was before being combined with AT&amp;T. I suggest we pull up the old SBC article and use it for that purpose. --69.232.197.133 03:26, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't see a problem using the SBC article as a "History" article. Besides, it was SBC who bought AT&amp;T, not the other way around, and I feel this fact gets lost in the article in it's current format.<a href="../../../d/k/n/User%7EDknights411_f51b.html" title="User:Dknights411">Dknights411</a> 06:38, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why does the intro refer to "local long distance"?

<li>How about waiting a week after the proposal to gather a consensus, and flagging the article for a aplit before actually doing the split, I personally oppose the move. With AT&amp;T being aquired by SBC, the history of AT&amp;T which is also the history of SBC prior to 1984 was also aquired, but I guess it is just a little too late. <a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHypernick1980_5dcb.html" title="User:Hypernick1980">Hypernick1980</a> 20:34, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b> Sometimes its confusing when making a statement about the various stages of this company. Example.

Then AT&amp;T Consumer became SBC. Just thinking ahead, this same situation is going to happen on the Cingular article. Because it follows the path: AT&amp;T Wireless + Cingular ---&gt; Cingular --&gt; AT&amp;T Wireless(eventually) all of the old information about AT&amp;T Wireless (existing info) might become cannibalized when Cingular becomes re-merged back into AT&amp;T Wireless' article down the road. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaribDigita_7e23.html" title="User:CaribDigita">CaribDigita</a> 02:52, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>On every RBOC page, AT&amp;T, BellSouth, Verizon, and Qwest, there is a section "Comepetitors", and in each is listed the other RBOCS, as well as various independant ILECs. The independants I could see, as they may be a CLEC in various Bell areas, but the RBOCs do not compete with eachother, in other words, they don't intrude on eachother's turf for LEC service.</p>
<p>I think the competitors section on the RBOC pages are irrelevant, inaccurate, and incomplete (they list few if any of the actual CLECs that "compete" with the Bell company), and irrelevant. <a href="../../../x/5/7/User%7EX570_df8f.html" title="User:X570">X570</a> 08:38, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I <b>agree</b>, and this is how it once was. AT&amp;T and former AT&amp;T company coverage on Wikipedia is a mess, and a certain Wikiproject focused only on pre-84 AT&amp;T is doing more harm than good, for one reason is that its one man band sees more distinction than really exists between pre-84 AT&amp;T and the post-84 companies, and that pre-84 AT&amp;T was composed of many seperate subsidiaries, all of which currently exist as they always have under AT&amp;T, Verizon, Qwest, Lucent-Alcatel, Avaya, Telcordia, and Advanced American Telephones/VTech. <a href="../../../x/5/7/User%7EX570_df8f.html" title="User:X570">X570</a> 07:43, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suggest <b>keeping them separate</b> The old company has enough history that people in the future (say 50 years from now) may want to access info on the forner "Ma Bell" as it was. If you merge the two no matter how you try- eventually much of the old history will get lost in time and you may not have a resource to find info on the old "Ma Bell". Ofcourse it's not totally gone you can always pay companies like "FT.com" or "Hoovers.com" to see defunct company profiles but it would be nice if there were also free open source profiiles on major companies like AT&amp;T which did leave a huge mark on the country. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaribDigita_7e23.html" title="User:CaribDigita">CaribDigita</a> 03:12, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What do you mean, Bentoman? The article on the old company is "American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company" and the new one "AT&amp;T". Plus there's the note on top of both articles to avoid confusion ("This article describes the former AT&amp;T Corp. that existed from 1885–2005. See AT&amp;T Inc. for the current company.") <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayfordoleary_d686.html" title="User:Hayfordoleary">Sean Hayford O'Leary</a> 18:17, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I <b>agree</b> to the merging of the articles. Consolidation of information CAN BE DONE PROPERLY in such a way that the histories of all pre-merger companies can be properly preserved in a merged article. Yes, it will take some effort, but its a worthwhile effort nonetheless. Having multiple articles for different companies/corporations that has a common history and are now operating as one can lead to confusion/misunderstanding on the part of people unfamiliar to the topic.</dd>

<dd><b>No.</b> There are clearly problems with the articles as they are, but merging them will only make matters worse. The current AT&amp;T&amp;T article needs to be simplified, not made more complicated, and much of the content moved to more appropriate pages. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiggleslash_255a.html" title="User:Squiggleslash">Squiggleslash</a> 23:28, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree completely. The two companies are barely related, the original AT&amp;T has a long history that would be required for any encyclopedia covering the topic, and the new company is a diverse collection of different operations that, again, need to be covered by the encyclopedia. Merging two complex articles, about two entities that share little but a name and one being made up <i>in part</i> of <i>some of the</i> components of the other, strikes me as bound to cause even more confusion and more complexity. We need to keep them seperate, we need to simplify this article - which fundamentally is about SBC - and move much of the information out of it.</dd>
<dd>And, FWIW, if we were to merge the two, why not also merge it with <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verizon.html" title="Verizon">Verizon</a> and <a href="../../../q/w/e/Qwest.html" title="Qwest">Qwest</a>? Because neither bought the <i>name</i>? If the intent is to show where the old AT&amp;T is today, then that would make sense. But again, we're looking at turning two already complex articles into a major messfest.</dd>
<dd>I stand by <b>no</b>, it's the wrong solution to an actual problem.

<dd><b>No</b> As mentioned before, these are two different companies: AT&amp;T, Inc. and AT&amp;T Corp. Besides the technical part of this, AT&amp;T Inc., the new company, seems to be doing a lot of marketing to reimage them selves as a "new" company (i.e. "We are not your mother's Ma Bell"). Keeping the two articles separate emphasizes the difference between the old and the new.--<a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanus657_0f01.html" title="User:Janus657">Janus657</a> 21:22, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>No</b> The only reason I see to merge them is that the new corporation took a similar name as the old one. Think about it like this: when a corporation buys out another corporation, do we merge the articles? The old AT&amp;T has such a huge history, legacy, and much more. When another corporation takes over AT&amp;T's <i>assets</i>, do they take over everything else that corporation had, like its history? No. Hell, if we merged articles everytime a corporation bought out another corporation, we'd have something like two articles on telephone companies. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesuschex_d368.html" title="User:Jesuschex">Jesuschex</a> 05:07, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Strong No</b> There's a major difference between the content relating the historical AT&amp;T and current AT&amp;T.

<li>I thought the new swirling globe logo was just a rebranding for Ma Bell in the 90's, e.g. e.g. when AT&amp;T starting becoming a Cable provider and the like and needed a logo that was no longer just about the "bell" a.k.a. old long distance and POTS system. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaribDigita_7e23.html" title="User:CaribDigita">CaribDigita</a> 03:16, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think technically, the new AT&amp;T could use the Bell logo, since the logo was authorized to all the Baby Bell, and in reality the new AT&amp;T is really SBC rebranded. Just as you mention about the old AT&amp;T wanting to move away from LDT and POTS back in the 90s, I don't think we'll ever see the current company use the logo, other than in a historic sense. AT&amp;T wants customers to see them as more than just a phone company, which the Bell logo is pretty much the icon for. In addition, I'm sure AT&amp;T wants to distance itself from as many similarities of the old Bell System as possible, keeping those in government from getting any ideas of repeating 1984 all over again. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownings_b306.html" title="User:Brownings">Brownings</a> 03:35, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
