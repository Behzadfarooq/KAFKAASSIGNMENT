<p><b>A.I.M.</b>, or <b>Artists In Mind</b>, is a charity based in <a href="../../../h/u/d/Huddersfield.html" title="Huddersfield">Huddersfield</a>, <a href="../../../y/o/r/Yorkshire.html" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>. It exists to enable and promote the artistic activities of people with acute <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mental_health.html" title="Mental health">mental health</a> problems, although A.I.M. themselves tend to prefer the term "spiritual and emotional crises". This is seen to be less stigmatising than "loaded" terms like "<a href="../../../m/e/n/Mental_illness.html" title="Mental illness">mental illnesses</a>" which still, to many, bring to mind negative preconceptions of <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violence.html" title="Violence">violence</a> and inadequacy.</p>
<p><a name="History" id="History"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/i/A.I.M._%28Artists_In_Mind%29_ccd9.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>A.I.M was founded as a not-for-profit organisation and was granted <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charitable_organization.html" title="Charitable organization">charitable</a> status in 2003. It grew out of a partnership between <a href="../../../l/e/e/Leeds_University_8dee.html" title="Leeds University">Leeds University</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rampton_Hospital_560b.html" title="Rampton Hospital">Rampton Hospital</a> in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Nottinghamshire.html" title="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a>, but now operates much more widely in addition to ongoing support for Rampton Hospital.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/i/A.I.M._%28Artists_In_Mind%29_ccd9.html" title="Edit section: Intentions of A.I.M.">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Intentions of A.I.M.</span></h2>
<p>Now a rapidly developing and radical arts organisation, A.I.M. is active in the field of the arts and mental health, acting to relieve sickness and preserve and protect mental and emotional wellbeing through the use of the arts. A.I.M. is grounded in the understanding that creativity is an aspect of mind which can heal and illuminate an individual's understanding of self and the world.</p>
<p>The development of self esteem, confidence and quality for creative service users is central to A.I.M.'s values. This is largely achieved through an emphasis on <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grassroots.html" title="Grassroots">grassroots</a> <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic.html" title="Democratic">democratic</a> involvement, an avoidance of hierarchical structure and a reluctance to impose "professional" analysis / assessment. Rather than "pathologising" the art of the individual, each work is valued for its own merits and for its subjective importance to its creator.</p>
<p>The artists receiving support from A.I.M. are (the most vital) part of the organisation and are encouraged to freely develop a personal visual language, expand their interests within the broader field of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art.html" title="Art">Art</a>, and acquire the capacity to articulate their own stories. A.I.M. recognises that the artists involved each provide vital insights which contribute to the strategic development of the organisation.</p>
<p>Terms such as "Mental Illness" and "Service User" are not generally favoured by the organisation, but are retained to facilitate communication with the mental health establishment, and with funding bodies.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/i/A.I.M._%28Artists_In_Mind%29_ccd9.html" title="Edit section: SUMS">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">SUMS</span></h3>
<p>SUMS (Service User Mentor Scheme) began as a one-year project to provide five service users with acute and enduring mental health problems with a studio space, materials and ongoing mentoring by experienced mentors. This project model came from the observation that there was no support post-hospitalisation for those who found the arts a value to their mental health; SUMS attempts to provide a creative sanctuary for such artists. SUMS helps to develop their creativity, building self esteem and engagement with the wider community. Endorsements of the success of the project have been received from Mental Health professionals and the families of service users. The programme is an essential component of their continuing well-being, which is reflected by being built into the “care plans” of each service user.</p>
<p>Funding was received initially from both the Arts Council (£5000) and the National Lottery “Awards for All” (£5000). The success of this project was acknowledged by <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirklees_Metropolitan_Council_1765.html" title="Kirklees Metropolitan Council">Kirklees Metropolitan Council</a> who later contracted AIM (£23,000) to run a pilot scheme to extend and develop SUMS for 10 artists.</p>
<p>The new SUMS pilot has settled down well and the artists are actively engaged in their studios. Great new work is already being produced, (some of which I would add to this webpage if I knew how to insert graphics!) The artists are also encouraged to participate in mainstream activities; AIM organises trips to galleries and exhibitions for the artists to gain an understanding of art genres, history, techniques and styles. New studio spaces have been acquired and an expanded pool of mentors contracted. Two part time Mentor Co-ordinators have been recruited to support and facilitate the project.</p>
<p>A.I.M. is also involved in the ongoing publication and performance of “recovery stories” of service users, and in setting up exhibitions for its artists to show and sell their work. Recent venues have included an interactive outdoor painting workshop for visitors to Huddersfield <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnival.html" title="Carnival">Carnival</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mela.html" title="Mela">Mela</a>, the local collaborative event held by <a href="../../../h/u/d/Huddersfield_University_cea8.html" title="Huddersfield University">Huddersfield University</a> to celebrate <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Mental_Health_Day_40d7.html" title="World Mental Health Day">World Mental Health Day</a> on the <a href="../../../1/0/t/10th_October_c9d5.html" title="10th October">10th October</a>, and at present a 9-day show at the North Light Gallery in <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armitage_Bridge_cb85.html" title="Armitage Bridge">Armitage Bridge</a>.</p>

<p>This is a unique arts initiative in <a href="../../../r/a/m/Rampton_Secure_Hospital_d563.html" title="Rampton Secure Hospital">Rampton Secure Hospital</a>. AIM Trustee John Holt is facilitating two major arts projects within the hospital, working with <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holmfirth.html" title="Holmfirth">Holmfirth</a> sculptor Brendan Hesmondhalgh and <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackburn.html" title="Blackburn">Blackburn</a>-based sculptor Halima Cassell. Two 20-week residencies with experienced professional artists are resulting in male and female patients acquiring skills in visual research, <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drawing.html" title="Drawing">drawing</a>], and <a href="../../../s/c/u/Sculpture.html" title="Sculpture">sculpture</a>. The patients design and develop the work, which will be executed and cast to a very high professional standard. The outcome is to be two major site-specific sculptural works, which will enhance the hospital environment for staff, visitors, and most importantly patients, enriching the hospital in a permanently uplifting way. This project was made possible with funding from the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arts_Council_2fc4.html" title="Arts Council">Arts Council</a> (£28,000) and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Nottinghamshire.html" title="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a> <a href="../../../n/h/s/NHS_Trust_4126.html" title="NHS Trust">NHS Trust</a> (£9,000) and support from the staff and managers of the hospital. AIM hopes that the success of this project will lead to further partnership working with both Rampton and other <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mental_hospital.html" title="Mental hospital">high-secure and medium-secure hospitals</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/i/A.I.M._%28Artists_In_Mind%29_ccd9.html" title="Edit section: Future Plans">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Future Plans</span></h2>
<p>Spring of 2007 will see a major A.I.M. exhibition at the Piece Hall in <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halifax%2C_West_Yorkshire_5f61.html" title="Halifax, West Yorkshire">Halifax, West Yorkshire</a>.</p>
<p>In the summer of the same year, A.I.M. will be engaged with curator Robert Hall to develop a 6-month programme to be staged in Huddersfield's main town art gallery. This may include workshops, arts actiities for schools, seminars, artist residencies and public engagement events.</p>
<p>The creation of a national archive for the art of those experiencing psychic distress is another ambitious initiative that is currently being explored. It is has been acknowledged by the Arts Council and other arts and mental health organisations that there is no provision for the documentation and storage of the artworks of people with enduring mental health problems. When people get into crisis this often leads to an increase in creativity.</p>
<p>Problems occur, however, in the capacity of patients in hospitals and service users in the community to have their work recorded and stored in a suitable environment.</p>
<p>AIM intends to set up an archive that will catalogue and store work by service users and patients. Subject to their agreement, this work can be sold for them, exhibited and toured, used for valid and non-intrusive research or merely stored until they are in a position to take it back. This will require a suitable storage space and equipment to document and record the work. A web site would be set up to facilitate any exposure of work required and as an online presence for the archive. It is intended that an individual who is receiving treatment within the mental health service will be trained and employed as an archivist. AIM is already committed to the storage of artworks by service users and patients.</p>
<p>It is hoped that when suitable premises within <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirklees.html" title="Kirklees">Kirklees</a> and sufficient funding streams have been located, the archive will occupy a multi-purpose building incorporating:</p>
<ol>
<li>AIM offices</li>
<li>SUMS offices</li>
<li>Foyer meeting area with café and exhibition space</li>
<li>Archive area for documentation and storage of artworks</li>
<li>SUMS studios</li>
<li>Workshop spaces</li>
<li>Multi media space for lectures / performance / installation etc</li>
<li>Sound studio</li>
<li>Video edit suit</li>
<li>Framing and graphic area</li>
<li>Workshop areas for educational purposes</li>
