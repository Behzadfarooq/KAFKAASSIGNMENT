I believe that was in response to Zaroves threats to publish Acharya's credit info online if I didn't back off and let him have his way with the article. Procuring a credit report under false pretenses is a crime. In addition, a wanted kidnapper is known to have passed around Acharya's personal info to religious groups, suggesting that Zarove may have been in contact with this person. Where, for example, did he get the 'Melne' middle name from?? His story has been that he is a former reporter, with a "masters in journalism", and that he wrote an article about Acharya for a tennessee newspaper; he says he procured this info in his research efforts. Though he will give his full name, he will not give the name of the newspaper, the title of the article, the date it was published, nor will he back up his "masters in journalism" claim. In addition, he claims he was a physics major in 2001. Masters in Journalism, a year and half in physics, and a job as a reporter a few years ago... all by the time he was 26. <a href="../../../%5E/%5E/j/User%7E%5E%5EJames%5E%5E_807e.html" title="User:^^James^^">^^James^^</a> 04:10, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

A quick search found Couch in major media outlets for both his religious expertise and his media work during the JFK assasination.

<dd>Yep, among others, and even <i>they</i> don't always get it right...nobody's perfect, after all. Back in my "Christian days," I did a lot more writing than I do now. I submitted a couple of books to a couple of the larger publishing houses and waa turned down flat. But I was made publication offers by a couple of the religious publishers. I didn't take them up on that, though, because I was leaving the "faith" by the time they were making their offers and didn't think it would be right. Looking back at the material, I'm glad I made that decision. I'm a pretty heavy reader. Sometimes I put away a book a night (and did that in my early days in the service, too). I had a friend who owned a fairly nice Christian book store in the east county, San Diego, in the early 80s, and got a lot of reading material from him. Most of it was pretty bad. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 12:28, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I doubt that anyone really believes Gastrich is laughing, especially given his antics of the last couple of days and the scrambling that he's doing to save some articles at Wikipedia -- spending hours and hours here instead of <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/maleboge/msg/40524ec62fbd06bf?hl=en&amp;" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/maleboge/msg/40524ec62fbd06bf?hl=en&amp;" rel="nofollow">doing tangible and useful things for people</a>, as one might expect of a Christian. This is one reason many of us are quite justified in stating that Gastrich <i>is not</i> a Christian.</dd>
<dd>LBU is a diploma mill, by any <i>reasonable</i> standard. It meets two of the ten criteria in the list to which he, himself, referred (even if he foolishly and ignorantly though that a mill must meet <i>all</i> of the criteria). It, in effect, <i>sells</i> degrees for what amounts to little work and, effectively, <i>no</i> <i>education</i>. LBU expects you to parrot the party line of fundamentalist Christianity. It does not encourage critical thinking and it does not <i>educate</i>. And if we use Gastrich as an example of the system used there (as he might have us do, since he created a page of notable graduates on his web site and included himself), it also doesn't teach proper research and expository skills. Given all of that, it qualifies. It may be something of an "advanced" diploma mill (in that it has artificial writing requirements that are irrelevant with respect to the quality of work produced by students) through its pretensions, but it is still, in the end, a "university" that sells you a diploma because you don't have to really learn anything to get it.</dd>
<dd>I'll grant that that's my criteria -- that makes LBU a diploma mill, in my view -- and no one (certainly not Gastrich) has ever shown me that the criteria aren't reasonable. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 18:59, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You said, "He's also making a quite serious accusation about me personally, only he doesn't have the guts to come out and say it. All this is specifically about my nominations, so this stuff about "unbelievers" means me. Only I'm a Christian, as he was aware of before writing.

<dd>In fact, I have more guts than you know. I also see you as small potatoes, though. Certainly part of the problem, but small potatoes because anybody can nominate an article for deletion. I've assumed that you are a (misdirected) believer in Christ. Who else would nominate 12 Christian biography entries for deletion? Who else would attack a Christian institution, over 1000 students, and thousands of graduates by calling their school a diploma mill (even though they attend on campus classes, go to school for many years, and work hard to earn their degrees)?</dd>

<dd>Try not to be too amused by Gastrich's boasting and declaration of you as "small potatoes." The same phrase has been used to describe him (when compared to other ministries and his many claims about how successful his is supposed to be--see <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/maleboge/msg/40524ec62fbd06bf?hl=en&amp;" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/maleboge/msg/40524ec62fbd06bf?hl=en&amp;" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/maleboge/browse_frm/thread/0f49a216f63058f1?scoring=d&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/maleboge/browse_frm/thread/0f49a216f63058f1?scoring=d&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and any time another Christian takes issue with him (and this occurs frequently, as you have probably guessed, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Icj_tlc/Archive1" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Icj_tlc/Archive1" rel="nofollow">this recent talk page for a Christian</a> for an example), he tries to disparage that person's Christianity--as if his standards and his alone are the deciding factor.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Notice that Gastrich does not declare that the "Christian articles" that were identified for deletion are necessarily valid <i>Wikipedia</i> articles. They are, to him, <i>Christian</i> articles. Remember that Gastrich is here to make Wikipedia "more Christian," at least, according to his POV. And his claims about the "Christian institution" were answered and debunked over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Louisiana_Baptist_University#Discussion_about_protected_entry" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Louisiana_Baptist_University#Discussion_about_protected_entry" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Even by standards more objective than mine, LBU is almost certainly some kind of diploma mill, but since Gastrich was too intellectually stunted to attend a <i>real</i> college--where they expect you to think critically, conduct research, and <i>learn</i>, well, we all know about <i>that</i> by now.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure why it matters if <i>any</i> "unbelievers" vote for deletion. It simply means that a concensus is building. While some of those "unbelievers" do "dislike Christianity" (notice that Gastrich doesn't say <i>which</i>, though), it doesn't strike me as relevant. It's true that many find <i>him</i> distasteful. <i>I</i> do...I've made no bones about that. He's a fraud and a liar and he's even kinda creepy (a part of his "ministry" is directed specifically to pedophiles). And notice this talk of "taking sides." Seems to me that the side you've taken is that that improves Wikipedia as a resource. And personally, I think God is glorified (assuming that there's a God who desires glorification from us) any time someone pretending to be his messenger and minister is exposed, as Gastrich has been. Of course, the last time I looked, I wasn't aware that Wikipedia was here to glorify God--or Gastrich...or that any of the articles currently being considered for deletion glorify God. - <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarriorScribe_1eae.html" title="User:WarriorScribe">WarriorScribe</a> 16:40, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If I understand it correctly, in the UK universities are chartered by the Crown or an act of Parliament. In America we don't have that. The (legitimate) agencies that do the accrediting come in two types: regional agencies, and agencies that specialize in a particular kind of school. DTS has one of each, but it may be the case that national accreditation in the sense you're thinking of just doesn't exist in the US, in which case it doesn't make any sense to note that a college doesn't have it. <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">A.J.A.</a> 17:29, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I also found this rather counterintuitive when I first read about it, but with the size of the U.S. and the number of small, sometimes obscure but still legitimate institutions that exist, it makes sense that accreditation is done on a regional basis. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+l+and</a> 13:06, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The article had warning tags and was work in progress - I reverted as your changes were not justified by discussion on the talk page and are plain wrong in parts. I was not the only editor to undo these changes. I have no issue with improving the article but it is a well developed and complex subject that cannot be accurately reflected in a stub-type incomplete "history" section. References are needed but I am reluctant to put the work in only to see it wholescale reverted along with uncontroversial edits such as wiki links. Collaboration is the key to a NPOV accurate article and I'm afraid your current editing style is thwarting this process. <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> <a href="../../../s/o/p/User_talk%7ESOPHIA_c099.html" title="User talk:SOPHIA"><small><font color="purple"><sup><i>Gilraen</i></sup></font></small></a> <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArchola_The_Centrist_Fellowship_1c2b.html" title="User:Archola/The Centrist Fellowship"><small><font color="blue"><sup><i>of Dorthonion</i></sup></font></small></a> 22:02, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't play games - I never claimed to have just made wiki links - the edit summary was something along the lines of "first run of adding references" so that other editors would know I was adding content. There is not room in the edit summary to give a blow by blow account of what you have done. If you don't flag it minor it can be assumed to be a substantial edit. I will not be drawn from the real issue of how a large article has been reverted by you to a virtual stub that is incomplete and inaccurate.

<dd>Apparently you mean "an amalgamation of mythological figures" vs. "a reinterpretation of older <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">myths</a>". Which is trivial, has nothing to do with accuracy either way.

<dd>But let's be completely fair and include the fact that you removed "based in part on the lack of extant contemporaneous documents or other historically reliable evidence about his life". The old version openly stated that the lack of documents is an argument in its favor, so you strike out here too. <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">A.J.A.</a> 22:42, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A.J.A., I'm at a loss as to why you removed the 'totally disputed' tag from the front page when so much about the article is still in dispute. While the article is clearly still being hammered out, some form of dispute notice needs to stay at the top. Given the level of dispute we've had, I'd like to see either all recent participants agree that the tag is ready to come off, or see no more reversions or edit warring for a good solid two weeks.

<dd>I know that there's ongoing dispute about the article, but I don't think there's dispute about anything currently <i>in</i> the article except "amalgamation", which is a nit.

<p>Looking at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acharya_S&amp;curid=1752829&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acharya_S&amp;curid=1752829&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">article's history</a>, in recent weeks you two have engaged in the most reversions by far. If <i>either</i> of you revert the article <a href="../../../a/c/h/Acharya_S_da0e.html" title="Acharya S">Acharya S</a> again, I will suspend your editing privileges for a short period of time.</p>
<p>I'm tired of watching the same slow motion edit war go back and forth. Poor editing practices by one person do not justify them by another. I will not be editing the article further myself. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 16:52, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, but you <i>have</i> been edit-warring there. You <i>have</i> failed to engage on the talk page. You need to indicate failures in NPOV that you see, very clearly. It is <i>inadequate</i> to talk just in terms of notional 'balance' on a page. NPOV is not the same as everyone getting their preferred balance of this and that. It means the end result might be the result of a fair-minded person looking at the controversial aspects and coming up with a version. Therefore you need to come across not as a partisan, but as someone fixing up specific weaknesses there. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a> 17:59, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You've ignored my comment on the Talk page doing just that, illustrating the worthlessness of that particular Talk page. <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">A.J.A.</a> 18:05, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Procedures for resolving a dispute with another editor are detailed at <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes</a>. The first step is to discuss your concerns with the editor(s) involved. If that doesn't work, you can file an informal complaint about me on the <a href="../../../a/n/2F/WP%7EAN_I_9983.html" title="WP:AN/I">Administrators' Noticeboard incidents page</a>. Alternatively, you may seek comment on my actions through a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">Request for Comment</a>. If those avenues fail to resolve your concerns, you may also seek <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERFArb_d611.html" title="WP:RFArb">arbitration</a> on the issues. For what it's worth, I posted notice of my warning on the <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">Admin Noticeboard</a> immediately after I notified you and ^^James^^; I'd much rather see more third-party attention on this situation than there has been so far.</p>
<p>I'm not threatening you. I'm telling you that your recent actions at <a href="../../../a/c/h/Acharya_S_da0e.html" title="Acharya S">Acharya S</a> haven't been productive, and that you need to do more discussing and less reverting. If you choose to continue to engage in a <a href="../../../r/e/v/Wikipedia%7ERevert_war_0c13.html" title="Wikipedia:Revert war">revert war</a> then I will suspend your editing privileges because that behaviour interferes with our goal of creating an encyclopedia. In the long run, wouldn't you prefer to have a neutral article that you don't have to keep reverting? Neither you nor ^^James^^ really want to have to come back to <a href="../../../a/c/h/Acharya_S_da0e.html" title="Acharya S">Acharya S</a> every day to revert, now do you? <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 20:32, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So banning me if James does something will help so much. So much that Charles gives me this mocking psuedo-discussion because he knows I can't fix the inferior version he put up. It needs reverted. There is no valid reason it should read like it does. <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">A.J.A.</a> 21:00, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Er, there seems to be some confusion here. To be clear, I would only block the party that reverted the article.

<dd>Try <i>talking</i> on the talk page. Charles Matthews, for example, looks like he's open to discussion. Resist the urge to make personal attacks or be incivil. Try not to think in terms of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Acharya_S&amp;diff=54553695&amp;oldid=54514753" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Acharya_S&amp;diff=54553695&amp;oldid=54514753" rel="nofollow">"[your] version" versus the "bad version"</a>.</dd>
<dd>Remember that not everyone has been involved with this article for as long or as deeply as you have been. Things that may be obvious to you may be completely unfamiliar to other editors. If asked to explain your comments, please try to do so.</dd>
<dd>Finally, you're <i>not</i> barred from editing the article. It's just reversion that's off the table. (Please don't try to game that or find loopholes; I've no patience for anyone attempting such silliness.) If you're going to add, remove, or substantially edit a critic's comments, try talking it out on the talk page. Ideally, try talking about it before you make the change.</dd>
<dd>I don't like to be in the position of treating adults like children; issuing "stop bickering or I'll give you a time out" edicts is not my idea of a good time. Nevertheless, if that is what is necessary to get the parties involved here to talk – and to do so <i>politely</i> – then that is what I'll do. Don't take it personally; I will lean on anyone who fails to be civil on the talk page or in editing the article. <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">talk</a>) 23:41, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The idea is to 'edit without reverting'. If you had written, 'The sky is blue' and someone changes it to 'The sky is blue except for clouds and the sun and planes and other things in the air and at night it is black except for the stars' do not just revert it to 'The sky is blue'. Try to understand what the other person's concern was and see if there could be some new version that both of you can agree on; 'Refraction of sunlight causes open air to appear blue during the daytime'. If you can't guess what the other person's objection / intent was then <i>ask</i> on the talk page. There is <i>usually</i> some way to address everyone's concerns if people work at finding a compromise rather than just reverting back and forth. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 12:17, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, A.J.A. Hopefully we can get an NPOV article if all sides are willing to discuss things. The accusation directed at Storm Rider (even if true) wasn't helpful. If both sides present their evidence, there's no reason why we can't resolve the impasse amicably. Can we agree to go ahead with the discussion (with me mediating)? I am theologically trained and have studied Mormonism, so don't worry that I'll allow anyone to get away with imposing a Mormon POV on the article! <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_L_Rattigan_f48b.html" title="User:David L Rattigan">David L Rattigan</a> 17:52, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am kind of new to Wikipedia, so I apoligize if I incorrectly comment on your page.

I didn't think there was anything wrong with it, but you removed everything I wrote, leaving only a few sentences. If you have constructive criticism please leave it, but I really don't understand why you completely demolished my page. Please respond. Thanks!

<p>Also, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barber-Scotia_College_a41a.html" title="Barber-Scotia College">Barber-Scotia College</a> is an unaccredited college in Concord,NC. I added this college to the list of unaccredited institutes of higher learning, and you removed it. Just wondering why, since on the college page it offers the date in which it lost its accredidation. If this is supposed to be a complete listing of unaccredited institutes of higher learning, then it should list all colleges that aren't accredited including Barber-Scotia.
