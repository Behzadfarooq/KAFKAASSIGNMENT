<p>Mike Huckabee made his first run for public office in 1992, challenging <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incumbent.html" title="Incumbent">incumbent</a> U.S. Senator <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dale_Bumpers_9b1c.html" title="Dale Bumpers">Dale Bumpers</a> (<a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Democratic_Party_b5cb.html" title="United States Democratic Party">D</a>). He received about 40 percent of the vote. That same election saw Arkansas Governor <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> ascend to the Presidency, elevating Lieutenant Governor <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Guy_Tucker_745e.html" title="Jim Guy Tucker">Jim Guy Tucker</a> to Governor. The 1993 <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_election.html" title="Special election">special election</a> was held shortly after the general election; having considerable name recognition from the general election, Huckabee won the special election and became the second Republican since Reconstruction to serve as Arkansas lieutenant governor. As the only Republican in statewide office, he clashed with Democratic leaders over many issues. Nonetheless, Huckabee was re-elected to a full term as lieutenant governor in 1994.</p>

<p>Mike Huckabee served as Arkansas governor between 1996 and 2007. In 1995 <i>Governing magazine</i> recognized him as as a "Public Official of the Year", writing:</p>
<dl>
<dd>He has overseen breakthroughs in health coverage for children, education management and school finance. He also sponsored the largest tax cuts Arkansas has ever seen, as well as the state’s biggest road construction package. And the state this year racked up the largest budget surplus in its history.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Preceding Governor <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Guy_Tucker_745e.html" title="Jim Guy Tucker">Jim Guy Tucker</a> was convicted of one count of conspiracy and one count of mail fraud as part of <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Starr_1e54.html" title="Kenneth Starr">Kenneth Starr</a>'s investigation of the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitewater_%28controversy%29.html" title="Whitewater (controversy)">Whitewater scandal</a>.

<p>In November of 1998, Huckabee was elected to a full four-year term, receiving the highest percentage of votes for a Republican seeking statewide office in Arkansas history.</p>
<p>Huckabee led the campaign for a bond program to pay for road reconstruction, which passed. Before the repairs Arkansas had some of the worst highways in America. The program repaved 60% on the state's system within five years of adoption. <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>Huckabee also led a campaign to dedicate via constitutional amendment 1/8 of one cent of the state <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sales_tax.html" title="Sales tax">sales tax</a> to improvement of the state's park system and natural resources, which had fallen into serious disrepair (and was an embarrassment for a state billing itself as "The Natural State"). As part of the campaign Huckabee (an avid outdoorsman) traveled the entire length of the <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas_River_0bd9.html" title="Arkansas River">Arkansas River</a> (the part within Arkansas) by boat.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2000, Huckabee also led a campaign to funnel 100 percent of the state's tobacco settlement revenues into the state's health care system, rather than into the general fund (as other states had done, where it could be used for non-health related purposes).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._Tohu%26Bohu_Huckabee_05d7.html" title="Edit section: Second full term">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Second full term</span></h3>
<p>In November of 2002 he was reelected to another four-year term (due to <a href="../../../t/e/r/Term_limits.html" title="Term limits">term limits</a>, this was his final term as governor). By the end of that term, Huckabee owned the third-longest tenure of any Arkansas Governor (only Democrats <a href="../../../o/r/v/Orval_Faubus_3d42.html" title="Orval Faubus">Orval Faubus</a>, who served 6 consecutive 2-year terms (1955-1967), and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, who served 11 years, 11 months (1979-1981; 1983-1992), had longer tenures).</p>
<p>He was made the chair of the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Governors%27_Association_6d43.html" title="Southern Governors' Association">Southern Governors' Association</a> in 1999 and served in that capacity through 2000. He has chaired the Southern Growth Policies Board, the Southern Region Education Board, the Southern Technology Council, and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, and currently serves as Chair of the Education Commission of the States. He is also a member of the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_Governors_Association_d329.html" title="Republican Governors Association">Republican Governors Association</a> and former Chairman of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Governors_Association_4ca8.html" title="National Governors Association">National Governors Association</a>.</p>
<p>On November 21, 2002, the Arkansas State Supreme Court declared that the state's school funding procedure was unconstitutional and ordered the state to produce a fair system. Huckabee proposed a controversial plan that would consolidate many of the state's smaller school districts. School consolidation is very unpopular in rural Arkansas and may be the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_rail_%28metaphor%29.html" title="Third rail (metaphor)">"third rail"</a> of Arkansas politics. Huckabee's plan was not accepted by the legislature, and the court order has not yet been satisfied.</p>
<p>After <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> made landfall and numerous evacuees fled to Arkansas (the total number was estimated at around 70,000), Huckabee ordered state agencies to "take care of those human needs first and worry about the paperwork later". State parks offered deep discounts, waived pet restrictions, and bumped other reservations in favor of evacuees. Pharmacists were given emergency authority to dispense prescriptions and provide access to dialysis machines. Shelters opened up in nearly every portion of the state, and Huckabee requested that the entire state be declared a disaster area. Many of these shelters, either closed or set to close, were reopened or kept open to process a "second wave" of Katrina evacuees being moved from <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> in the wake of arriving <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Rita_540c.html" title="Hurricane Rita">Hurricane Rita</a>. (See also <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_disaster_relief_a5c0.html" title="Hurricane Katrina disaster relief">Hurricane Katrina disaster relief</a>).</p>
<p>In early 2006, Huckabee - along with fellow governors <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Perry_3a83.html" title="Rick Perry">Rick Perry</a> (R-TX); <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Doyle_36a0.html" title="Jim Doyle">Jim Doyle</a> (D-WI); and <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Freudenthal_b656.html" title="Dave Freudenthal">Dave Freudenthal</a> (D-WY) - travelled to the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Asia_cf77.html" title="South Asia">South Asia</a> as part of <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a>-sponsored trip to provide the state leaders with an idea of the conditions under which American forces are serving. While visiting <a href="../../../b/a/g/Baghdad.html" title="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> and <a href="../../../t/i/k/Tikrit.html" title="Tikrit">Tikrit</a>, Huckabee and the governors received briefings from Gen. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Casey_b510.html" title="George Casey">George Casey</a> and Amb. <a href="../../../z/a/l/Zalmay_Khalilzad_e03f.html" title="Zalmay Khalilzad">Zalmay Khalilzad</a>.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In November 2006, both Huckabee and his wife drew criticism for creating <a href="../../../w/e/d/Wedding_registry.html" title="Wedding registry">wedding registries</a> in conjunction with a <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housewarming_party.html" title="Housewarming party">housewarming party</a>. The <a href="../../../a/r/k/Arkansas_Times_a07f.html" title="Arkansas Times">Arkansas Times</a>, which first reported the story, noted that wedding gifts represent one of the exceptions to a $100 cap on gifts to political leaders under Arkansas law.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> Huckabee noted that the registries were intended only for those who were invited to the event, that he was not involved in organizing the event, and that they were classified as wedding registries only because those sites did not have separate categories for housewarming parties.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>Huckabee has also been criticized for his fiscal record as governor having increased state spending 65.3% from 1996 to 2004. <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup> The CATO Institute gave him an F grade for spending and tax policy in 2006, and an overall grade of D for his governorship. <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._Tohu%26Bohu_Huckabee_05d7.html" title="Edit section: Health advocacy and personal weight loss">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Health advocacy and personal weight loss</span></h2>
<p>When elected governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee was significantly overweight. During 2003, physicians diagnosed the governor with <a href="../../../t/y/p/Type_2_diabetes_mellitus.html" title="Type 2 diabetes mellitus">adult-onset diabetes</a> and informed him that he would not live more than 10 years if he did not lose weight. This diagnosis (as well as the subsequent death of former Governor <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_D._White_b39d.html" title="Frank D. White">Frank D. White</a>, whose obesity led to a fatal heart attack) shocked the governor into reflecting on his own mortality, and his ability to serve as the governor of Arkansas. Huckabee subsequently lost over 110 pounds through a disciplined diet and exercise,<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup> according to a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> article at a pace so rapid that "it was as if he simply unzipped a fat suit and stepped out." <sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup> The governor now wakes up at approximately 5 a.m. for a five-mile jog, and he and his wife routinely pack his own healthy meals for lunch and dinner in a portable cooler--even when attending political, ceremonial, or fund-raising events.</p>
<p>He has publicly recounted his previous burdens as an overweight man: the steps of the Arkansas capitol building from the entrance of the building up to the Governor's office were so long and steep that Huckabee would be out of breath and exhausted by the time he reached the top of the stairs; Huckabee secretly feared that he would be interviewed by media at the top of the steps, and that he would be unable to respond appropriately due to his overexertion and breathlessness.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Huckabee has trumpeted his weight loss and made health care reform a major component of his later tenure as governor, promoting both his own life story as well as his decision to dedicate 100 percent of tobacco settlement proceeds to health-related issues.</p>
