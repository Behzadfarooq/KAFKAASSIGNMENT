<p>Following his stint in <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Championship_Wrestling_d0d3.html" title="World Championship Wrestling">World Championship Wrestling</a>, Styles returned to Wildside and began pursuing the NWA Wildside Heavyweight Championship, then held by his trainer and <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mentor.html" title="Mentor">mentor</a>, "The Original Chosen One" Rick Michaels. He defeated Michaels for the title on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_22.html" title="December 22">December 22</a>, 2001, at <i>Christmas Chaos</i> using a top rope <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facebuster.html#Belly-to-back_inverted_mat_slam" title="Facebuster">Styles Clash</a>. While champion, Styles engaged in a rivalry with former <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manager_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Manager (professional wrestling)">manager</a> Jeff G. Bailey's copycat version of Styles, <a href="../../../j/a/s/Jason_Cross_ed86.html" title="Jason Cross">"The Role Model" Jason Cross</a>, who debuted as a total clone of Styles, all the way down to his in-ring attire and finishing move (this <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angle_%28professional_wrestling%29.html" title="Angle (professional wrestling)">angle</a> was later partially reused on a larger scale by <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring_of_Honor_71eb.html" title="Ring of Honor">Ring of Honor</a>, with <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Rave_d18f.html" title="Jimmy Rave">Jimmy Rave</a> acting as Styles's <a href="../../../d/o/p/Doppelg%C3%A4nger.html" title="Doppelgänger">doppelgänger</a>).</p>
<p>Styles lost the NWA Wildside Heavyweight Championship to <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Santo_7f67.html" title="David Santo">David Young</a> in a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_match_types.html#three_way_dance" title="Professional wrestling match types">three way dance</a> that also included Rick Michaels on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_23.html" title="March 23">March 23</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a> at <i>Hardcore Hell</i>. Shortly thereafter, Styles signed a contract with <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Nonstop_Action_Wrestling_e010.html" title="Total Nonstop Action Wrestling">NWA:TNA</a> and only returned to Wildside for sporadic special appearances due to an increase in his higher profile bookings. These special appearances reached an apex at <i>Freedom Fight</i> in <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2002.html" title="July 2002">July 2002</a>, where Styles was the final man entered into the "Holy Wars" <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steel_cage_match.html" title="Steel cage match">steel cage match</a> for the Wildside Championship. The then-<a href="../../../t/n/a/TNA_X_Division_Championship_b28d.html" title="TNA X Division Championship">TNA X Division Champion</a>, Styles was pinned by long-time rival "All That" Adam Jacobs. He made several more appearances throughout 2002, defeating <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonny_Siaki_3e86.html" title="Sonny Siaki">Sonny Siaki</a>, Jorge Estrada, and Jacey North in various one on one encounters.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_2003.html" title="March 2003">March 2003</a>, Styles defeated former rival <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ron_Killings_ef72.html" title="Ron Killings">Ron Killings</a> at <i>Hardcore Hell</i>. In <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_2003.html" title="October 2003">October 2003</a> he headlined another Wildside card, facing "The Soul Assassin" Rainman. Styles had been the <a href="../../../n/w/a/NWA_World_Heavyweight_Championship_9058.html" title="NWA World Heavyweight Championship">NWA World Heavyweight Champion</a> at the time of booking, and this was scheduled to be a title match, but <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Jarrett_f8e9.html" title="Jeff Jarrett">Jeff Jarrett</a> defeated Styles for the title just three days prior to the scheduled bout. As a result, Jarrett agreed to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in a three way match. However, Jarrett withdrew from the event at the last minute, leaving Styles and Rainman to fight one another in a non-title match which was won by Rainman following interference from Jeff G. Bailey. Styles defeated David Young at <i>Christmas Chaos</i> in <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_2003.html" title="December 2003">December 2003</a>. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_26.html" title="March 26">March 26</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> at the two-night <i>Hardcore Hell</i> event he defeated his protégé, "Kool" Seth Delay in an impromptu match, then teamed with Gabriel and <a href="../../../o/r/e/Oren_Hawxhurst_9121.html" title="Oren Hawxhurst">Altar Boy Luke</a> (with <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dusty_Rhodes_%28wrestler%29_2936.html" title="Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)">Dusty Rhodes</a> in their corner) to defeat Rainman, Azrael and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Daniels_5934.html" title="Christopher Daniels">"The Fallen Angel" Christopher Daniels</a> in a six man tag team main event on the following night.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">2002 – 2004</span></h4>
<p>Styles debuted in <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring_of_Honor_71eb.html" title="Ring of Honor">Ring of Honor</a> at their third show, <i>A Night of Appreciation</i>, in 2002. He quickly became a main event wrestler, competing against <a href="../../../l/o/w/Low_Ki_a28b.html" title="Low Ki">Low Ki</a> for <a href="../../../r/o/h/ROH_World_Championship_bb9c.html" title="ROH World Championship">ROH Championship</a> at <i>Honor Invades Boston</i>. After failing to win the title, he became the first holder of the "No. 1 Contender's Trophy", which was viewed as a second title at the time. At the <i>One Year Anniversary Show</i> in February 2003, Styles competed against Low Ki and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_London_a9df.html" title="Paul London">Paul London</a> in a three-way match, with the winner receiving a shot at the ROH Championship later that night. London won the match but failed to defeat <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Jirus_bad2.html" title="John Jirus">Xavier</a> for the championship. After the show, Styles and London agreed to form a tag team and compete for the <a href="../../../r/o/h/ROH_World_Tag_Team_Championship_e62f.html" title="ROH World Tag Team Championship">ROH Tag Team Championship</a>.</p>
<p>Set to compete for the number one contendership for the titles at the following show, London was unable to attend after having emergency sinus surgery the day before. Instead, Styles competed by himself and defeated <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Backseat_Boyz_ec28.html" title="The Backseat Boyz">The Backseat Boyz</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_S.A.T._0571.html" title="The S.A.T.">The SAT</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Carnage_Crew_82d2.html" title="The Carnage Crew">The Carnage Crew</a> to receive a title shot. He chose <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazing_Red_9389.html" title="Amazing Red">Amazing Red</a> as his partner, and the two defeated <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Prophecy_%28professional_wrestling%29_6fde.html" title="The Prophecy (professional wrestling)">The Prophecy</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Daniels_5934.html" title="Christopher Daniels">Christopher Daniels</a> and Xavier) for the championship. When London return, he was upset when Styles chose to remain a team with Red instead of forming one with him. The two would go on to wrestle against each other at <i>Night of the Grudges</i>, with the match ending in a draw.</p>
<p>Styles and Red, as the ROH Tag Team Champions, would go on to wrestle and defeat the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Briscoe_Brothers_cddb.html" title="Briscoe Brothers">Briscoe Brothers</a> on three separate occasions. However, the duo would not be so lucky against The Prophecy. At <i>Wrath of the Racket</i>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Cornette_c874.html" title="Jim Cornette">Jim Cornette</a> made his first appearance in ROH and aligned himself with Christopher Daniels and <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Maff_ff7a.html" title="Dan Maff">Dan Maff</a>. During intermission, he convinced the two to attack Amazing Red, who was already suffering from a knee injury, while he was signing autographs. With Red unable to compete, Styles chose Maff's former trainer <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Erazo_945f.html" title="Nelson Erazo">Homicide</a> as his partner, and the two defeated The Prophecy. Styles would then have to vacate the title due to Red being sidelined with his knee injury.</p>
<p>After his reign as one half of the ROH Tag Team Champions, Styles took on fellow Georgia wrestler <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Rave_d18f.html" title="Jimmy Rave">Jimmy Rave</a> as his protégé. While coaching Rave, who was competing in the "Field of Honor" tournament, Styles attempted to become the ROH World Champion. He defeated <a href="../../../b/r/y/Bryan_Danielson_88a1.html" title="Bryan Danielson">Bryan Danielson</a> at <i>Main Event Spectacles</i> to become the number one contender for the title. At <i>War of the Wire</i>, Styles challenged <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samoa_Joe_5d67.html" title="Samoa Joe">Samoa Joe</a> for the title, but was once again unable to win it.</p>
<p>ROH gold would not remain out of Styles' hands for long. At the <i>Second Anniversary Show</i>, he competed in a one night tournament to become the first <a href="../../../r/o/h/ROH_Pure_Championship_d589.html" title="ROH Pure Championship">Pure Wrestling Champion</a>. He defeated his protégé Jimmy Rave in the first round, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Stryker_292d.html" title="Matt Stryker">Matt Stryker</a> in the second, and <a href="../../../c/m/_/CM_Punk_9dee.html" title="CM Punk">CM Punk</a> in the finals to become the first championship. His title reign, however, would be short lived. Not long after the <i>Second Anniversary Show</i>, ROH's owner <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Feinstein_6956.html" title="Rob Feinstein">Rob Feinstein</a> was caught by an internet sting trying to solicit sex from a fourteen-year-old boy. This scandal caused tensions between ROH and <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Nonstop_Action_3338.html" title="Total Nonstop Action">Total Nonstop Action</a>, where Styles was under contract. Despite this, Styles returned to ROH at the following show, <i>At Our Best</i>, and defeated CM Punk in a rematch with <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Steamboat_cca9.html" title="Ricky Steamboat">Ricky Steamboat</a> as the guest referee. The match turned out to be Styles final match in ROH for 2004, as TNA withdrew all their contracted wrestlers from ROH. Styles left the company and vacated the Pure Wrestling Championship.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">2005 – 2006</span></h4>
<p>In the summer of 2004, Styles protégé Jimmy Rave was "fired" by Ring of Honor due to not winning any matches. He was brought back to the company by <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Nana_30ed.html" title="Prince Nana">Prince Nana</a>, and became known as "The Crown Jewel of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Embassy_%28professional_wrestling%29_7646.html" title="The Embassy (professional wrestling)">The Embassy</a>". He would then begin to use the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_throws.html#Belly-to-back_inverted_mat_slam" title="Professional wrestling throws">Rave Clash</a> (better known as the "Styles Clash") as a finisher, claiming AJ stole it from him. Eventually, Styles had enough and returned to Ring of Honor for one night only, at the <i>Third Anniversary Celebration: Part Two</i>, to wrestle Rave. Styles was unsuccessful in defeating Rave, who won after he sprayed air freshener in Styles’ eyes.</p>
<p>Several months later, Styles returned to wrestling for Ring of Honor full time. He made his return at <i>Death Before Dishonor III</i> defeating fellow TNA wrestler <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petey_Williams_7202.html" title="Petey Williams">Petey Williams</a>, who was brought in by Prince Nana to face Styles instead of having Jimmy Rave fight him. Styles would get a match, and a win, against Rave at the following show. However, Rave would get the last laugh when, after losing, he put a plastic bag over Styles and attempted to suffocate him.</p>
<p>During his feud with Jimmy Rave and The Embassy, Styles would form an alliance with <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generation_Next_2df2.html" title="Generation Next">Generation Next</a>, who were also feuding with The Embassy due to their former leader <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Shelley_0181.html" title="Alex Shelley">Alex Shelley</a> joining them. Styles first defeated Generation Next member <a href="../../../r/o/d/Roderick_Strong_0009.html" title="Roderick Strong">Roderick Strong</a> at <i>Fate of an Angel</i> in mid-July. The following show, Styles faced, and lost to, Jimmy Rave in a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_matches.html#hardcore_variations" title="Professional wrestling matches">street fight</a>. Following the match, Styles was attacked by The Embassy, with Rave hitting the Rave Clash on him. <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Aries_3045.html" title="Austin Aries">Austin Aries</a> and Roderick Strong attempted to come to his aid, but they were fought off.</p>
<p>Styles took a night off from his feud with The Embassy, when he was chosen by Ring of Honor to face <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobuhiko_Oshima_d8b9.html" title="Nobuhiko Oshima">CIMA</a>, who was visiting from <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Gate_ff23.html" title="Dragon Gate">Dragon Gate</a> in Japan, at <i>Dragon Gate Invasion</i>. However, Styles was unsuccessful in defeating him. The following show, <i>Glory by Honor IV</i>, Styles once again faced of against Jimmy Rave, with this match having a special stipulation: the loser could no longer use the Rave/Styles Clash in Ring of Honor. With <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Foley_9e70.html" title="Mick Foley">Mick Foley</a> in his corner, Styles hit Rave with the Styles Clash off of the second rope, through a table to win the match.</p>
<p>Styles would then take a short break from ROH before returning at <i>This Means War</i> in late October. He defeated Generation Next leader Austin Aries, who was attacked by The Embassy following the show. The following show, Aries defeated the former Generation Next leader Alex Shelley. Following the match, he was attacked by The Embassy, until Generation Next member <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Sydal_d1d6.html" title="Matt Sydal">Matt Sydal</a> and AJ Styles came to his aid. Later that night, Styles and Sydal defeated Embassy members Jimmy Rave and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Parker_a989.html" title="Chris Parker">Abyss</a> in a tag match. At <i>Vendetta</i>, Styles had his final match against The Embassy when he, along with Austin Aries, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Evans_46f6.html" title="Jack Evans">Jack Evans</a> and Matt Sydal were defeated by Rave, Shelley, Abyss and Prince Nana in an eight–man tag match.</p>
<p>Following his feud with The Embassy, AJ Styles set his sights on winning a Ring of Honor title. At <i>A Night of Tribute</i>, Styles faced Christopher Daniels and Matt Sydal in a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_matches.html#basic_non-elimination_match" title="Professional wrestling matches">triple threat match</a>, with the winner receiving a shot at the ROH World Championship later that night. Daniels won the match, but was unable to defeat Bryan Danielson for the title later that night. On the first show of 2006, Styles wrestled and defeated Matt Sydal. Following the match, the two agreed to form a tag team and challenge for the ROH Tag Team Championship, which were held by Sydal’s Generation Next teammates Austin Aries and Roderick Strong. Before receiving a shot at the tag team titles, Styles received a shot at the ROH World Championship when he was handpicked by Danielson. Despite having won both of his previous encounters against Danielson in ROH, Styles was unable to defeat him for the title.</p>
<p>At the <i>Fourth Anniversary Show</i>, Styles and Sydal received their shot at the ROH Tag Team Championships, but were unable to defeat the champions. Following the match, Aries and Strong were attacked by the Briscoe Brothers, who had made their return to ROH for the first time since 2004. Styles and Sydal came to their aid, and chased away the Briscoes. Styles and Sydal continued to team together and, at <i>Dragon Gate Challenge</i> in late March, the two defeated <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Kid_1a27.html" title="Dragon Kid">Dragon Kid</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genki_Horiguchi_c0c9.html" title="Genki Horiguchi">Genki Horiguchi</a>, members of the Do FIXER stable in Dragon Gate. The following night, the two defeated the ROH Tag Team Champions in a non–title match. However, Styles was not a successful in by himself the next night, when he was pinned by Samoa Joe in a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_matches.html#basic_non-elimination_match" title="Professional wrestling matches">four–corner survival match</a> that also included Christopher Daniels and <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Yang_8820.html" title="Jimmy Yang">Jimmy Yang</a>.</p>
<p>Styles would then appear less and less in Ring of Honor. After a four month absence, Styles returned at <i>Death Before Dishonor IV</i>, defeating ROH up-and-comer <a href="../../../d/a/v/Davey_Richards_5ac5.html" title="Davey Richards">Davey Richards</a>. Styles would return to Ring of Honor at <i>Time to Man Up</i>, losing to Samoa Joe. In a pre-taped promo, Styles said he would be taking several months off from Ring of Honor following the match. However, ROH commentators continually referred to the match as his final match, and even played a special tribute to him following the match. Since then AJ Styles has not returned to Ring of Honor.</p>
