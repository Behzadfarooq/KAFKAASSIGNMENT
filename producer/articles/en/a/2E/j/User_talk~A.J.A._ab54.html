<p>I see that you are wikistalking me again and reverting my edits. The problem this time is that you are reverting in order to re-introduce puncuation errors that I fixed. I will assume good faith that you are doing so out of ignorance of proper use of punctuation, and when you blanked material in your rv here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norman_Finkelstein&amp;diff=77650856&amp;oldid=77527894that" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Norman_Finkelstein&amp;diff=77650856&amp;oldid=77527894that" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> it was by accident. You should review the rules with comma, and stop wikistalking me. If you are not sure about the rules you should not revert others. I have reverted all your below reverts of me as they simply re-introduce the same punctuation errors:</p>

<p>I saw you did a lot of changes to the Crown College article, and it looks good. But I do have a question on the categories, you removed several of the categories, like "Christian universities and colleges", I guess this is a wiki policy question, but that seems to me to be appropriate, why do we get rid of it? <a href="../../../m/g/r/User%7EMgroop_db91.html" title="User:Mgroop">Mgroop</a> 13:48, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/j/User_talk%7EA.J.A._ab54.html" title="Edit section: Question on Almeda University">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><b>Question on Almeda University</b></span></h2>
<p>Why would you invalidate true and factual information that is validated by accurate links? You are NOT NEUTRAL, but providing only the negative comments without providing a fair and factual representation. For example, the article about a dog getting an Almeda degree is completely inaccurate. According to the BBB, Almeda has rejected (turned down) over 90,000 applicants that didn't meet the requirements. Furthermore, Almeda requires a valid identification before it confers a degree. That article has been proven false several times as the author has failed to provide a copy of Rover's diploma even after numerous requests.<br />
Next, Almeda was never closed down in Florida by legal action. The Oregon website quoted was wrong. The Florida news article quoted by Veronica was accurate. In it, it states that that in 2003, Almeda reached an agreement with the State of Florida to cease issuing degrees from within the state of Florida and to cease direct advertising to Florida residents. If you do some research, you will find this is accurate and your statement is false. There was never any legal action.<br />
Now you are threatening to block this accurate information in favor of inaccuracies. What do you require as proof that your information is inaccurate?<br />
<br />
The dog item getting a degree is not true. Perhaps I am biased, but you fail to give both sides of the Almeda argument. Only one. At least I give both sides. I am much more neutral than are you. Do you think everything in the newspaper is true? The news article has given no proof at all to the validity of the dog story. Did you know that when you get a degree from Almeda they validate your Identification? Do you want me to prove that? Where did the dog get his I.D.? It didn't happen. No "doggie diploma" has ever been produced because none exist. Yes, it has been requested numerous times. There's no doggie diploma issued by Almeda anywhere. Period!</p>

<p>Please stop removing legitimate, reliable content regarding the programs of study at Kepler College. If you don't agree with the existence of the college, that's fine, please add your opinions and comments under Criticism and Controversy. But please don't remove factual information and quotes, especially about the description and history of the college! Thank you, Gary Lorentzen</p>

<dd>While I understand your perspective – I acknowledge and agree that Lorentzen is certainly far from an impartial judge of the College or its article – I would appreciate it if you <i>wouldn't</i> slice out chunks of text with the summary '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kepler_College&amp;curid=5214249&amp;diff=79052689&amp;oldid=79039301" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kepler_College&amp;curid=5214249&amp;diff=79052689&amp;oldid=79039301" rel="nofollow">rvv</a>'. While the remarks may be biased in tone, they're certainly not vandalism.

<p>A.J.A., what do you mean it's 'unsourced ad copy'? I simply stated the facts about the founding of the college, its authorization and its mission. What source should I use to describe the college? I could copy and paste the actual catalogue description and history, and I'm authorized to do so, but a simple, short summary should suffice. True, I'm not 'unbiased.' I developed the curriculum and instructional designs and worked with the State for authorization. My post simply stated facts. I did shorten Enid Newberg's response to the criticism and controversy section--I didn't realize it was so long, sorry. But this section is for expressing opinions and pov's, is it not? As long as you keep deleting, I will keep posting. Gary Lorentzen</p>

<p>AJ, It seems that we have been butting heads, so to speak, in certain articles. I would like to take this opportunity to open up a dialogue and see if we can come to some sort of reconciliation. I am under the impression that you consider my changes either malicious or, at the least, nefarious. Let me just assure you that nothing could be further from the truth. Furthermore, let me here say that I thoroughly appreciate your spirited contributions to wikipedia, and I do look forward to working with you in collaboration. I especially am thankful that you are so knowledgeable in Calvinism and Reformed Christianity, and I think this knowledge can only help the articles we work on. I will also say that I am a bit puzzled that we have so butted heads, even more so now that I have read your bio, since we are really so similar. Christian, pro life, you take the Bible seriously, — you even like coffee. I was raised in Dixie, both in Virginia and the Deep South, so (if I may venture) I am familiar and comfortable with the same culture and values that you exhibit. Our only real difference seems to be that I am Catholic, but I will say that I find myself far more comfortable with Reformed Protestants than liberals who fancy themselves as "catholics". So, at any rate, I really think we can work together, and I would like to try and come to a fresh understanding of each other and our past differences. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 11:37, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good idea on the templates; it will take some time to implement but it seems like the best solution. I appreciate the kind words you had for me, and look forward to collaboration with you. Please don't stop keeping me honest. Your comments on my summary of Calvin were indeed off, he was speaking of the source of the authority of scripture more than interpretation, and I mistook the passage in question. I think my mistake was the source of much of our confusion in this instance. <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostcaesar_f99b.html" title="User:Lostcaesar">Lostcaesar</a> 21:28, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<br />
There has been some <b>very</b> intense abuse originating from this IP range, recently -- you had nothing to do with that, but unfortunately the IP addresses in here are very dynamic, so the only options are "block nothing" and "block everything." I've worked out a trial soft-blocking, provided that I'll be taking care of the damage that this unblock will probably cause. There's no perfect solution, here, but I didn't feel that sitting by and watching so many users blocked for things they had no part in would be appropriate. You should be able to edit, at this moment, but please do be wary of such blocks in the future -- I can't make any absolute promises, except that I'll do my best.</p>

<p>I've refuted your allegations of Plagarism. A comaprison of WIkipedia's 3 Jun 2006 version to that on that other site, which was last edited 4 Jun 2006, shows that they took Wikipedia's copy, replaced some proper noun 'Huckabee's with pronouns 'him' or 'he', as appropriate, and then posted it. They ripped off Wikipedia, not the other way around. I asked you a week ago to follow up on this. As you chose not to, I have. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuranX_db95.html" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> 18:50, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No reply or response to my investigation of plagarism, and no replies nor help on the article. I am finding that I can no longer assume good faith regarding your participation in this article. You've been asked to be clear and asked for specific information on the talk page multiple times. Both ai.kefu and myself have tried to engage you on the talk page, but your only reply is essentially a big flipping of the bird. You dismiss anything we say as either ignoring your points, which, in fact, were all addressed, or by claiming we're out to get Huckabee. You ignore us in favor of essentially vandalizing the page. Either start working on building the section, or admit your bias against anything disparaging to Huckabee, or just leave the page alone. But continuing your vandalisms is unacceptable.

<p>Hi, I wonder if I could persuade you, as a gesture of goodwill, to go back to the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Talk%7EChristianity_8d07.html" title="Talk:Christianity">Christianity talk page</a> and strike through or otherwise modify your comments. Things can get quite heated on the talk pages of controversial articles, and sometimes when you're frustrated, speaking your mind may seem to make things better for you in the short term, but in the long term, it can be counterproductive. And in any case, it was most unfair to include SOPHIA among those who "hate Christians", when she actually restored the text of the Creed, and tried to calm things down after the "prayers are offensive" remark, and when (you may not know this) she was extremely helpful and concerned last Easter when some Christian editors from the Christianity article became victims of some very nasty stalking, wich their real identities (contact details, etc.) posted on some website. If you think that SOPHIA's edits are motivated by hatred for Christians, you're the only Christian editors who thinks so. "Hate" is such a strong word, suggesting that someone is consumed with a desire to hurt and destroy, that I'd hesitate to use it about any of our editors. There are undoubtedly some editors who believe that Christianity is the root of all evil, and I suppose we just have to try and show them (as far as possible, without turning Wikipedia into a debating forum) that they're wrong.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you could soften your remarks, that would be appreciated. The people with opposing views probably feel that they're right just as much as you or I might feel that we are, and a provocative remark will invite a provocative response, making it difficult to keep the discussion on topic. I'm not going to vote either, by the way. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">Musical L</a><a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist">inguist</a> 00:03, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A.J.A., I specifically requested on the Christianity talk page last night that there would be no reference, direct or indirect, to past misbehaviour of any editor, unless there was evidence that the misbehaviour was continuing. I'm a little distressed to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=108681095&amp;oldid=108678781" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Christianity&amp;diff=108681095&amp;oldid=108678781" rel="nofollow">this</a>. As far as I recall, last summer, when Giovanni was facing the possibility of a community ban, and I and others agreed to a last chance, I gave some kind of undertaking to Giovanni that if the puppetting stopped, we would not use it against him. It was for that reason that I suggested, and other admins agreed, that the puppeteer tag should be removed from his user page, in order to make it easier for him to make a fresh start.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I suppose that the assurance I gave Giovanni was not mine to give. I could only speak for myself, in promising that there would be no ungenerous references to past incidents, no attempts to humiliate him in front of new users. I suppose the reason I felt safe making that promise was that the people who were opposing Giovanni were Christians, whom I felt I knew. It's disappointing to see that I was mistaken, and that even after a night's sleep, and time to cool down, you are still posting things that make the situation worse. The reference yesterday to "Storm Rider the Mormon" could be taken as quite offensive; certainly, it's clear that you didn't mean it as a compliment or as a neutral observation. And in bringing up another user's history of puppeting, despite the fact that that behaviour has stopped, you also took the opportunity to make a snide remark about Mormonism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I asked Str1977 to stay away from the page where so many inflammatory posts were being made, and he agreed. When he came back the next day, he apologized for his part in adding fuel to the flames. Agathoclea made the same request of Giovanni, and he agreed. Sophia, who had not been disruptive in any way, also said she would take a break from that page. In recent months, we have all worked together well, so I was hopeful that when people had had time to calm down, this would blow over. I do appreciate the small gesture you made, in at least changing "hate Christians" to "hate Christianity", though I feel that what you changed it to is still unjust and unnecessary. I would love if you could bring yourself to remove your last comment, but even if you can't I would earnestly request you not to post any more of the same. The preview button is a great way to help editors not to post inflammatory stuff. I use it myself, when I'm annoyed with another editor; it helps me not to post things that will make the situation worse. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">Musical L</a><a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist">inguist</a> 02:00, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A.J.A., I don't recall what I said to Giovanni at the time, and I don't have time to go looking for diffs. I certainly didn't make an explicitly-worded promise about exactly what people would or wouldn't say, on behalf of people who should have been consulted. I was, at the time, sending a few private e-mails to other editors. Suffice it to say that I would have felt comfortable in saying that I felt that my fellow Christians (and my fellow admins) would not stoop to taunting, or to making ungenerous references to something that I hoped would become a part of the past, and which, I think, <i>has</i> become a part of the past. It is indeed sad that I should be proved to be wrong in saying that Christians would not engage in such pettiness. I suggest that your inflammatory posts are likely to cause more damage to Christianity than Giovanni's annoying edits about Christianity being a self-styled monotheistic religion based on stories about a character called Jesus. Certainly, they are more damaging to Christianity than the removal of the Creed (replaced by a link to the full text) from the article would be, because they make Christians (and consequently Christianity) look bad — look <i>really</i> bad, in fact. I can assure you that "Storm Rider the Mormon", as you so insultingly called him, and Sophia, the atheist who "hates Christianity", as you also said (have you ever looked into the help she gave to Christians who were being stalked last Easter?), would <i>never</i> do what you have been doing in the last two days. I ask you to consider:
<ol>
<li>Have your recent posts to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Talk%7EChristianity_8d07.html" title="Talk:Christianity">Talk:Christianity</a> been in accordance with what you feel Jesus would want?</li>
<li>Do they make Christians and Christianity look good?</li>
<li>Are they helpful in calming down the situation so that we can all start working together again?</li>
<li>Do they have any advantage (other than perhaps giving you some kind of release from feelings of irritation) that you feel outweighs the disadvantage of offending others?</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I really hope that you'll agree to stop making derogatory remarks about non-Christians, regardless of your opinions of them. I'm not going to take any admin action on a page I'm active at, but another admin might become interested in this squabble, and I can tell you that people have been blocked for less. Please, don't let it come to that. I think the atheists are big enough to let this blow over and make a new effort to work together, so the question is: are the Christians? <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">Musical L</a><a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist">inguist</a> 22:29, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi.

<ul>
<li>Add the abovementioned page to your watchlist</li>
<li>Include the page on another page you look at regularly; in my case, this is my user page, since I keep my personal "todo" list there. That would look something like:</li>

<p>Why did you revert my edits on Malhotra? They were in good faith. The version you reverted to contains absolutely unsourced lies about Malhotra's being descendents of the Hindu Lord <a href="../../../y/u/d/Yudhishtira.html" title="Yudhishtira">Yudhishtira</a>, who is revered by most Hindus as a symbol of the ideal Hindu. You would thus understand the motives for wanting to say that all Malhotras are descendants of Yudhistira. The article also contains emphasis on the presence of an elite <i>Dhai Ghar</i> which rules over all other <a href="../../../k/s/h/Kshatriya.html" title="Kshatriya">Kshatriya</a> (rulers and warriors) in Punjab. This is unsourced and I believed Wikipedia relied on it's most basic policies like <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, thus I am most disappointed and disconcerted by your revert. The version you reverted to also contains the names of non-notable people who's EXISTENCE is not even referenced. My version, if you check, contains only sourced and verifiable facts. I will not revert you for now because I want no conflict, but I would aks you to review your revert and revert yourself. dishant 07:22, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The edit by A.J.A removed edits by Dishant55555 which a number of users have put down as Vandalism by Dishant55555. The article mention's a Dhai Gar but does not as you claim, say they rule over everyone in Punjab, but it is a prominent grouping within the Khatri caste and does not give it undue note. This existance of this is clearly a historical fact (Google has 1,600 articles on it)</p>
<p><br />
I have checked your other edits and note that you have made claims that <a href="../../../l/u/t/Luthra.html" title="Luthra">Luthra</a> 's (the page referes to Dishant55555 as Dishant Luthra) ruled over India with the Gupta's, and that Luthra occupy the senior army ranks and are ruling class, for which there are no sources. This is in clear violation of Wikipedia policies.</p>
<p>I note that Dishant55555 having repeatedly undone reverts from other users who have removed people who are clearly not prominent as per wiki guidelines indeed none of those listed appear to fulfil wiki guidelines -</p>
<p>Please see wiki notes on editing articles where you may have a conflict of interest such as a family link.</p>
<p>For example - You have repeatedly entered a Semma Luthra - as a politician - who another user has deleted as not being prominent citing that the link you have provided shows she is one of the losing politicians in a small municipal election.</p>
<p>Wiki guidelines state to enter a politician they must -</p>
<pre>
   * Politicians:
         o Politicians who have held international, national or statewide/provincewide office, and members and former members of a national, state or provincial legislatures.5
         o Major local political figures who have received significant press coverage.4
         o Just being an elected local official does not guarantee notability.

<p>Dishant55555 please familiarise yourself with wiki guidelines before undoing other user edits.</p>
