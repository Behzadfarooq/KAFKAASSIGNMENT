<p>Although Christianity has always had a significant diversity of belief, mainstream Christian theology considers certain core doctrines esential to <a href="../../../o/r/t/Orthodoxy.html" title="Orthodoxy">orthodoxy</a>. Mainstream Christians often consider followers of Jesus who disagree with these doctrines to be <a href="../../../h/e/t/Heterodoxy.html" title="Heterodoxy">heterodox</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heresy.html" title="Heresy">heretical</a>, or outside Christianity altogether.</p>

<p>Christians identify Jesus as the Messiah. The title <i>Messiah</i> comes from the <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> word מָשִׁיחַ (<i>mashiakh</i>) meaning <i>the anointed one</i>, for which the Greek translation is <span lang="grc" class="polytonic" xml:lang="grc">Χριστός</span> (<i>Christos</i>), the source of the English word <i><a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ_%28title%29.html" title="Christ (title)">Christ</a></i>. Christians believe that as Messiah Jesus was anointed as ruler and saviour of both the Jewish people specifically and of humanity in general. Most Christians hold that Jesus' coming was the fulfilment of <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophecy.html" title="Prophecy">prophecy</a> and the inauguration of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Heaven_a3be.html" title="Kingdom of Heaven">Kingdom of Heaven</a>. The Christian concept of Messiah differs significantly from the contemporary Jewish <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Messiah_dd7d.html" title="Jewish Messiah">concept</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Most Christians believe that Jesus is "true God and true man" (or fully divine and fully human). Jesus is believed to have become <a href="../../../i/n/c/Incarnation_%28Christianity%29_6168.html" title="Incarnation (Christianity)">fully human</a> in all respects, including <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortality.html" title="Mortality">mortality</a>, and to have suffered the pains and temptations of mortal man, yet without having sinned. From being true God he was capable of defeating death and rising up to life again, known as the resurrection.</p>
<p>According to Christian Scripture, Jesus was <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Birth_e8f9.html" title="Virgin Birth">born</a> to a <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin.html" title="Virgin">virgin</a>, after having been conceived not by <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_intercourse.html" title="Sexual intercourse">sexual intercourse</a> but by God through the power of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Spirit_e4ea.html" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>. (See <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nativity_of_Jesus_6a11.html" title="Nativity of Jesus">Nativity of Jesus</a>). Little of Jesus' childhood is covered by the Gospels compared to his ministry and especially his last week. The Biblical account of his ministry begins with his <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptism_of_Jesus_b896.html" title="Baptism of Jesus">baptism</a>, and recounts miracles such as turning water into wine at a <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage_at_Cana_1e51.html" title="Marriage at Cana">marriage at Cana</a>, exorcisms, and healings, and quotes his teachings, such as the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sermon_on_the_Mount_69ef.html" title="Sermon on the Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a>. He also appointed <a href="../../../t/w/e/Twelve_Apostles_56fc.html" title="Twelve Apostles">apostles</a>.</p>

The Crucifixion</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Most Christians consider the death and resurrection of Jesus the central events of history. According to the Gospels, Jesus and his followers went to Jerusalem for the <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passover.html" title="Passover">Passover</a> and he was greeted by a crowd of supporters, an event called the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triumphal_entry.html" title="Triumphal entry">triumphal entry</a>. Later that week, he enjoyed a <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Last_Supper_7593.html" title="The Last Supper">meal</a> (possibly the <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passover_Seder_5630.html" title="Passover Seder">Passover Seder</a>) with his disciples before going to pray in the <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garden_of_Gethsemane_c398.html" title="Garden of Gethsemane">Garden of Gethsemane</a>, where he was <a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrest_of_Jesus_82d6.html" title="Arrest of Jesus">arrested</a> by <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman</a> soldiers on behalf of the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanhedrin.html" title="Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a> and the high priest, <a href="../../../c/a/i/Caiaphas.html" title="Caiaphas">Caiaphas</a>. The arrest took place clandestinely at night to avoid a riot, because Jesus was popular with the people at large. <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judas_Iscariot_cdd5.html" title="Judas Iscariot">Judas Iscariot</a>, one of his apostles, betrayed Jesus by identifying his location for money.</p>
<p>Following the arrest, Jesus was <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanhedrin_Trial_of_Jesus_6e37.html" title="Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus">tried by the Sanhedrin</a>, which considered his answers to their questions blasphemous and wished to kill him but lacked legal authority. He was sent to <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontius_Pilate_f765.html" title="Pontius Pilate">Pontius Pilate</a>, who in turn sent him to <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herod_Antipas_f79b.html" title="Herod Antipas">Herod Antipas</a> (son of the Herod who tried to kill Jesus as an infant). Initially excited at meeting Jesus, about whom he had heard, Herod ended up mocking Jesus and sent him back to Pilate. Remembering that it was a custom at Passover for the Roman governor to free a prisoner (a custom not recorded outside the Gospels), Pilate offered the crowd a choice between Jesus of Nazareth and an insurrectionist named <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barabbas.html" title="Barabbas">Barabbas</a>. The crowd chose to have Barabbas freed and Jesus crucified. Pilate washed his hands to display that he claimed himself innocent of the injustice of the decision. Pilate then ordered Jesus to be <a href="../../../c/r/u/Crucifixion.html" title="Crucifixion">crucified</a> with a charge placed atop the cross (known as the <i>titulus crucis</i>) which read "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews." Jesus died by late afternoon and was buried by <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_of_Arimathea_57e7.html" title="Joseph of Arimathea">Joseph of Arimathea</a>.</p>
<p>According to the Gospels, Jesus was raised from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion. He appeared to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Magdalene_8dd9.html" title="Mary Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a>, and then appeared to various people in various places over the next forty days. Hours after his resurrection, he appeared to two travellers on the road to <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmaus.html" title="Emmaus">Emmaus</a>. To his assembled disciples he showed himself on the evening after his resurrection. During one of these visits, Jesus' disciple <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judas_Thomas_d874.html" title="Judas Thomas">Thomas</a> initially doubted the resurrection, but after being invited to place his finger in Jesus' pierced side, said to him, "My Lord and my God!" Before his <a href="../../../a/s/c/Ascension.html" title="Ascension">Ascension</a> Jesus instructed his Apostles to "teach all nations", known as the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Commission_a9b6.html" title="Great Commission">Great Commission</a>.</p>

Reception of salvation is called <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justification_%28theology%29.html" title="Justification (theology)">justification</a>, which is usually understood as <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divine_grace.html" title="Divine grace">Divine grace</a>, not something that can be earned. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The operation and effects of grace are understood differently by different traditions. Reformed theology goes furthest in teaching complete dependence on grace, by teaching that humanity is completely helpless (<a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_depravity.html" title="Total depravity">Total depravity</a>) and that those who are given this grace invariably put their faith in Christ and are saved (<a href="../../../i/r/r/Irresistible_grace.html" title="Irresistible grace">Irresistible grace</a>).<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> (See <a href="../../../f/i/v/Five_points_of_Calvinism_df2e.html" title="Five points of Calvinism">Five points of Calvinism</a>.) Catholicism, while still teaching dependence on grace, puts more emphasis on free will and the need to cooperate with grace. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Ancient Gnostic Christians stood out for believing that salvation came from divine knowledge, or <i>gnosis</i>, which Jesus had revealed to selected adepts. <sup id="_ref-Gnostic_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gnostic" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Most Christians believe that God is one eternal being who exists as three distinct, eternal, and indivisible persons: the <a href="../../../g/o/d/God_the_Father_5aa3.html" title="God the Father">Father</a>, the Son (or <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, or the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logos.html" title="Logos">Logos</a>), and the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Spirit_e4ea.html" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> (or <i><a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Ghost_f962.html" title="Holy Ghost">Holy Ghost</a></i>).</p>
<p>Christianity continued from Judaism a belief in the existence of a single <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> who created the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universe.html" title="Universe">universe</a> and has <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omnipotence.html" title="Omnipotence">divine power</a> over it. Against this background belief in the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christology.html" title="Christology">divinity of Christ</a> developed into the doctrine of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Trinity_1d2e.html" title="Holy Trinity">Holy Trinity</a> <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup>, which in brief considers that the three <i>persons</i> of God (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) share a single Divine <i><a href="../../../o/u/s/Ousia.html" title="Ousia">substance</a></i>. This substance is not considered divided, in the sense that each person has a third of the substance; rather, each person is considered to have the whole substance. The distinction lies in their origins or relations, the Father being unbegotten, the Son begotten, and the Spirit proceeding. <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
<p>In Reformed theology, the Trinity has special relevance to salvation, which is considered the result of an intra-Trinitarian covenant and in some way the work of each person. The Father elects some to salvation before the foundation of the world, the Son performs the atonement for their sins, and the Spirit regenerates them so they can have faith in Christ, and sanctifies them. <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Christians believe the Scriptures were written by the inspiration of the Spirit<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[9]</a></sup> and that his active participation in a believer's life (even to the extent of "indwelling", or in a certain sense taking up residence within, the believer) is essential to living a Christian life.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[10]</a></sup> In Catholic, Orthodox, and some Anglican theology, this indwelling in recieved through the sacrament called <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confirmation_%28sacrament%29.html" title="Confirmation (sacrament)">Confirmation</a> or, in the East, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chrismation.html" title="Chrismation">Chrismation</a>. Pentecostal and Charasmatic Protestants also believe the gift of the Holy Spirit is a distinct experience separate from other experiences like conversion, and some believe it will always be evident through <a href="../../../g/l/o/Glossolalia.html" title="Glossolalia">speaking in tongues</a>. Most Protestants believe that the Spirit indwells a new believer at the time of salvation.</p>

<p>Christianity adopted the practice of drawing up concise statements of belief. These statements, called Creeds, began as baptismal formulas and were later expanded during the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christology.html" title="Christology">Christological</a> controversies of the Fourth and Fifth centuries.

<p>Some non-Trinitarians condemn Trinitarian doctrine as an implicit <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tritheism.html" title="Tritheism">tritheism</a>, though Trinitarians have explicitly denied holding such a view of God <sup id="_ref-Clark_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Clark" title="">[13]</a></sup> and Trinitarian statements of faith from all traditions affirm that there is only one God (e.g., the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicene_Creed_e8a2.html" title="Nicene Creed">Nicene Creed</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athanasian_Creed_efbe.html" title="Athanasian Creed">Athanasian Creed</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalcedonian_Creed_f85b.html" title="Chalcedonian Creed">Chalcedonian Creed</a>; the Protestant confessions; catechisms of both Protestant and Catholic origin).</p>

<p>Virtually all Christian churches accept the authority of the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a>, a collection of <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_canon.html" title="Biblical canon">canonical</a> books in two parts, the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a> and the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_39c4.html" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>.</p>
<p>The Old Testament contains the entire Jewish <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanakh.html" title="Tanakh">Tanakh</a>. In the Christian canon the books are presented in a different order and some books of the Tanakh are divided into several books by the Christian canon (e.g., the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_prophet.html" title="Minor prophet">minor prophets</a> are twelve books in the Christian canon but one book called "the Twelve" in the Jewish canon). The Catholic and Orthodox canon includes the Jewish canon and other books called <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deuterocanonical_books.html" title="Deuterocanonical books">Deuterocanonical</a>, while Protestants classify the latter as <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocrypha.html" title="Apocrypha">Apocrypha</a>.</p>
<p>The first books of the New Testament are the <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospels.html" title="Gospels">Gospels</a>, which tell of the life and teachings of Jesus. There are four canonical Gospels: <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Matthew_65a8.html" title="Gospel of Matthew">Matthew</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Mark_938f.html" title="Gospel of Mark">Mark</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_Luke_fff0.html" title="Gospel of Luke">Luke</a> and <a href="../../../g/o/s/Gospel_of_John_9f92.html" title="Gospel of John">John</a>. The first three are often called <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synoptic_Gospels_5bc3.html" title="Synoptic Gospels">synoptic</a> because they share much material, while John has more unique material. Ornamental books of the four gospels are sometimes used in church liturgies.</p>
<p>The rest of the New Testament consists of the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Acts_of_the_Apostles_c9b6.html" title="Acts of the Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>, a sequel to Luke's Gospel which describes the very early history of the Church; the <a href="../../../p/a/u/Pauline_epistles.html" title="Pauline epistles">Pauline epistles</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_epistles.html" title="General epistles">General epistles</a>, which are occasional letters from early Christian leaders to congregations or individuals; and the <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Revelation_4ea8.html" title="Book of Revelation">Book of Revelation</a>, an <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalyptic_literature.html" title="Apocalyptic literature">apocalyptic</a> tract.</p>
<p>Some traditions maintain less mainstream <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_text.html" title="Religious text">canons</a>. The <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethiopian_Orthodox_Tewahedo_Church_1c2e.html" title="Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church">Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church</a> maintains two canons, the Narrow Canon, itself larger than any Biblical canon outside Ethiopia, and the Broad Canon, which has even more books. The <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latter_Day_Saints_f81e.html" title="Latter Day Saints">Latter Day Saints</a> hold three additional books to be the inspired word of God: <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Book_of_Mormon_606d.html" title="The Book of Mormon">The Book of Mormon</a>, the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctrine_and_Covenants_8b59.html" title="Doctrine and Covenants">Doctrine and Covenants</a>, and the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearl_of_Great_Price_6f45.html" title="Pearl of Great Price">Pearl of Great Price</a>.</p>
<p>The Gnostics had numerous books outside of the orthodox canon, for example <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gospel_of_Thomas_5ee0.html" title="The Gospel of Thomas">The Gospel of Thomas</a>.<sup id="_ref-Gnostic_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Gnostic" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>Though Christians largely agree on the content of the Bible, no such consensus exists on the crucial matter of its interpretation, or <a href="../../../e/x/e/Exegesis.html" title="Exegesis">exegesis</a>, an issue which dates to ancient times.</p>
<p>The earliest schools of Biblical interpretation were the Alexandrine, and the Antiochene. Alexandrine interpretation, exemplified by <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origen.html" title="Origen">Origen</a>, tended to read Scripture allegorically, while Antiochene interpretation insisted on the literal sense, holding that other meanings (called theoria) could only accepted if based on the literal meaning. <sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>Traditional Catholic interpretation admits four senses of Scripture. The literal sense is the plain meaning (which would still take account of figures of speech), so that a reference to <a href="../../../d/a/v/David.html" title="David">David</a> means the historical figure. The allegorical or typological sense teaches Christian doctrine, so that a reference to David may mean Christ. The tropological or moral sense contains ethical teaching, and the anagogical or eschatological sense teaches about the Last Things. The meanings derived from the three non-literal senses may also be stated literally elsewhere.</p>
<p>Protestantism rejects the elevation of other senses to the same level as the literal, although typology remains fairly common in Protestant interpretation.</p>

<p>Further, I'm pretty sure that it wasn't a lack of legal ability that prevented that orthodox jewish sect from killing Jesus, I though it was because of a strict Jewish belief in killing, they believed that others did not have to live by that however. Unfortuantely, the commandment wasn't as strict as an Egyptian one, "Thou shalt not kill, <i>nor bid anyone kill</i>." I made the change in Gnostic beliefs, but make sure that I am right. You had a source, and I'm not sure how much, but my understanding was that the real creator is the one that sent Jesus. If I'm wrong, feel free to revert that part back, this isn't up on the main namespace yet.</p>
<p>I like the melding of Beliefs and Differences in beliefs though....... it is much better than the current version.</p>

<dd>First, I'm fine with people tweaking this. When I wanted to wok on it by myself I kept everyone else out by the simple expedient of not announcing this page's existence.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For KV, John 18:31 says they lacked the authority to execute people. I vaguely remember reading a controversy somewhere about whether that's historically accurate -- which would fit in "Controversies" or maybe <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historicity_of_Jesus_a712.html" title="Historicity of Jesus">Historicity of Jesus</a> (it might already be there for all I know). I tried to avoid constant "most Christians believe" or "according to the Gospels" attributions, but if it's confusing something could be added right there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>About the creator in Gnosticism, it depends what you mean by "creator". What the high god created (or emanated) was the Pluroma, which the lower god was the misbegotten product of. The material world was created by the demiurge. But it's not terribly important, since it's part of the section of non-Trinitarians. The important thing is the duelism, not the doctrine of origins.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've tweaked the tweaks a little. I made "the Jewish concept" into "the contemporary Jewish concept" (the NT <i>is</i> a largely Jewish text, after all) and added a wikilink. I made the Gnostic view of salvation its own paragraph. <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">A.J.A.</a> 22:07, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I specifically agree with this last tweak. This was one of my concerns as well.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the version currently in the article, somebody moved the big monotheism reference to a place included in this revision, the part about early Christians getting belief in one God from Judaism. I don't want to be accused of removing references, but I don't see the need for it there. It seems the whole thing is focused of justifying the use of the word "monotheism". But the meaning of an English word tells us nothing about what Christianity got from Judaism. Besides, the intended audience of that reference is <i>other editors</i>, not a general readership. I'm not sure it adds anything or is needed apart from the context of that specific debate.</p>
<p>If a reference is really needed at that point I can russle up some citations from the NT and early Fathers.</p>
<p>Also I made the reference about Gnosticism into a named reference and put it in a couple more places. <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">A.J.A.</a> 15:08, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Was the mention of the Gnostic view of salvation simply removed from this? <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Vegita_0877.html" title="User:King Vegita">KV</a> 17:51, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. I moved it down to form its own paragraph. I thought it flowed better that way. <a href="../../../a/2E/j/User%7EA.J.A._7b79.html" title="User:A.J.A.">A.J.A.</a> 13:30, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here are my comments and suggestions, as implemented above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplified and refocused the "Virgin birth" issue (don't mention the place, provide more relevant links, mention the Holy Spirit instead of simply saying "miracle")</li>
<li>Simplified "wedding at Cana" reference (aside: shouldn't it be "wedding"?)</li>
<li>removed the "influence of the Church's triadic baptismal formulas" as misleading (the formulas stem from the development described, not the other way around (and BTW: triadic is wrong)</li>
<li>included baptismal formulas in the development of Creeds, also simplified the wording</li>
<li>the "Hypostatic union" was misplaced as it preceded the Chalcedonian formula (for that see below) and is actually shared by Copts and other so-called Monophysites. The HU was formulated by Cyril of Alexandria and approved of by the 3rd Ecumenical Council of Ephesus.</li>
<li>the term "Deuterocanicals" should be mentioned alonside with "Apocrypha". However, take note that these issues are also included under the "differences" section in the current Christianity article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also</p>
<ul>
<li>I have some doubts about the usage of "we" instead of "I" in the creed</li>
<li>Shouldn't the Apostles' creed be mentioned as well?</li>
<li>I know that we have a WP article of that name but "Chalcedonian Creed" is a bad wording in my book. It doesn't start "I believe" and is not a "updated version" of a creed but a formula outside of the creed (it is just as binding nonetheless)</li>
<li>I don't think that "Ancient Gnostics" have any place in this description of Christian beliefs, as it a) should focus on the mainstream (see the intro) and b) concerns matters of history and not of current Christianity - encyclopedic articles are always concerned with describing and explaining phenomena of the present and then might give an explanation how the present derived from the past or narrate the history of the phenomena.</li>
<li>For the same reasons the "less mainstream" canons shouldn't be included in a description of beliefs of mainstream Christianity. The same goes for the LDS, which are of a doubtful status. However, a mentioning that there are disputes about the canon is okay.</li>
</ul>
