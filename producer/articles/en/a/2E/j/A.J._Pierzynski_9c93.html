Pierzynski formerly played with the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Twins_4085.html" title="Minnesota Twins">Minnesota Twins</a> (1998-2003) and <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Giants_cfa9.html" title="San Francisco Giants">San Francisco Giants</a> (2004).</p>
<p>Pierzynski is well-known for several high-profile incidents on the baseball field. Incidents with players and the media have earned Pierzynski the reputation of being among the more disliked players in the league. However, his forthrightness and strong desire to win have won the hearts of many White Sox fans. Pierzynski had the longest streak of consecutive error-less games among active Major League catchers (150). A.J. made the 2002 American League All-Star Team as a reserve catcher while playing for the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Twins_4085.html" title="Minnesota Twins">Minnesota Twins</a>.</p>
<p>On Sunday, July 2, 2006 it was announced on the <a href="../../../e/s/p/ESPN_7b0e.html" title="ESPN">ESPN</a> All-Star Selection Show that A.J. Pierzynski would be one of the five <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_League_6b8d.html" title="American League">American League</a> players in the All-Star Final Vote. Soon afterwards the Chicago White Sox organization began an election campaign using the slogan "Punch A.J." Fans could vote on MLB.com or by using their mobile phones. When voting concluded, A.J. received 3.6 million votes, the most votes in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_League_6b8d.html" title="American League">American League</a>, subsequently sending him to his second All-Star appearance.</p>
<p>Fox Sports has signed A.J. to serve as an in-studio game analyst for the 2006 ALCS. <a href="http://chicagosports.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/whitesox/cs-0610060324oct06,1,2762877.story" class="external autonumber" title="http://chicagosports.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/whitesox/cs-0610060324oct06,1,2762877.story" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/j/A.J._Pierzynski_9c93.html" title="Edit section: Pierzynski and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pierzynski and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim</span></h2>
<p>On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_12.html" title="October 12">October 12</a>, 2005, Pierzynski was involved in one of the most controversial endings in baseball playoff history in Game Two of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_American_League_Championship_Series_928d.html" title="2005 American League Championship Series">2005 American League Championship Series</a> versus the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim_8ace.html" title="Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim">Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim</a>. With the score tied with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, Angels pitcher <a href="../../../k/e/l/Kelvim_Escobar_84a6.html" title="Kelvim Escobar">Kelvim Escobar</a> appeared to have struck out Pierzynski to end the inning. <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Paul_b7fb.html" title="Josh Paul">Josh Paul</a>, the Angels catcher, rolled the ball to the mound and left the infield. Pierzynski realized strike three had been called, but he had not been called out and ran to first base in case the umpire had ruled that the Angels catcher had not legally caught the strike three pitch (<a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncaught_third_strike.html" title="Uncaught third strike">Uncaught third strike</a><a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/batter_6.jsp)" class="external autonumber" title="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/batter_6.jsp)" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. In that case, the defense would have had to either tag Pierzynski or first base while in possession of the ball to record the out. Umpire <a href="../../../d/o/u/Doug_Eddings_a1fa.html" title="Doug Eddings">Doug Eddings</a> indeed ruled the catcher had not caught the strike three pitch, and Pierzynski was safe at first. A pinch-runner, <a href="../../../p/a/b/Pablo_Ozuna_ebde.html" title="Pablo Ozuna">Pablo Ozuna</a>, replaced Pierzynski and stole second base. Third baseman <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Crede_0e16.html" title="Joe Crede">Joe Crede</a> delivered a base hit three pitches later to give the White Sox the win.</p>
<p>The White Sox then swept the next three games to reach the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_10cd.html" title="World Series">World Series</a>. In the last game Pierzynski and Escobar were involved in another bizarre play with two out, when Escobar tried to tag Pierzynski out with an empty glove. Pierzynski was initially called out, then awarded the base when the umpires realized Escobar had the ball in his hand instead of his glove, and Crede again drove in the winning run, this time with a home run.</p>
<p>Escobar and Pierzynski met again on April 29, 2006, and Escobar hit Pierzynski with the third pitch he threw at him. Escobar had said before the game that he was intending to hit Pierzynski with a pitch during the game. While Pierzynski didn't score, the White Sox won the game 2-1 giving Escobar the loss.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/j/A.J._Pierzynski_9c93.html" title="Edit section: Pierzynski and the Chicago Cubs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pierzynski and the Chicago Cubs</span></h2>
<p>On May 20, 2006 Pierzynski was in an altercation with Cubs catcher <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Barrett_ef79.html" title="Michael Barrett">Michael Barrett</a> after a collision at home plate. Pierzynski was the runner on third base when <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Anderson_%28outfielder%29_4efe.html" title="Brian Anderson (outfielder)">Brian Anderson</a> hit a fly ball to left field. Pierzynski tagged from third in an attempt to score. Barrett was set up directly on the base line leading to home plate to receive left fielder <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Murton_b5e9.html" title="Matt Murton">Matt Murton's</a> throw. As Pierzynski reached home plate, he collided with Barrett. The collision knocked Barrett over and onto home plate. Murton's throw struck A.J. in the back moments before the collision. After the collision, Pierzynski enthusiastically slapped home plate. As Barrett got to his feet, the two came together again. A.J. moved to retrieve his helmet which had been dislodged in the collision and had landed behind the plate. Barrett grabbed Pierzynski with both arms and punched Pierzynski just below the left jaw with his right fist. Both benches cleared. Seconds later, Brian Anderson and Cubs first baseman <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Mabry_ca34.html" title="John Mabry">John Mabry</a> were involved in another confrontation. The four were ejected. It was later revealed by one of the umpires that <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Barrett_ef79.html" title="Michael Barrett">Michael Barrett</a> was guilty of <a href="../../../o/b/s/Obstruction_%28baseball%29.html" title="Obstruction (baseball)">obstruction</a>, blocking the plate without possession of the ball.</p>
<p>Following the game at a press conference, Barrett, Pierzynski, and Cubs Manager <a href="../../../d/u/s/Dusty_Baker_5e87.html" title="Dusty Baker">Dusty Baker</a> all commented on the play. There was some disagreement about why Barrett struck Pierzynski. Pierzynski claimed that Barrett grabbed as he attempted to pick up his helmet and said, "I didn't have the ball, bitch." Barrett did not deny this and indicated that Pierzynski stepped toward him at the end of play, and he just reacted badly. Pierzynski indicated that Barrett may have struck him because Barrett did not have the ball yet when the collision occurred; Barrett would be criticized for this by sports writers as it is not proper form for a catcher to block the plate without the ball. In baseball it is a legal play for a runner to collide with the catcher at home plate when the catcher is attempting to block home plate in order to put a tag on the runner. Pierzynski was fined a reported $2,000 for the incident which he appealed and the fine was eventually reduced to $250. Barrett was issued a 10-game suspension along with an undisclosed fine. White Sox fielder Brian Anderson and third base coach Joey Cora were also fined and suspended for the incident.</p>
<p>Both Barrett and Pierzynski later came to good terms during batting practice when the <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cubs.html" title="Cubs">Cubs</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Sox_7d59.html" title="White Sox">White Sox</a> met again at <a href="../../../w/r/i/Wrigley_Field_d92d.html" title="Wrigley Field">Wrigley Field</a> on June 30, 2006.</p>
<p>This incident led the White Sox to lead an election campaign entitled "Punch A.J." when Major League Baseball announced its fan vote to vote for the last All-Star that season.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/j/A.J._Pierzynski_9c93.html" title="Edit section: Other MLB incidents">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Other MLB incidents</span></h2>
<p>In a 2005 article <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/01/15/SPG6IAQNH81.DTL" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/01/15/SPG6IAQNH81.DTL" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> that he wrote for the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Chronicle_5d76.html" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a> newspaper, beat writer Bruce Jenkins claimed that Pierzynski had kneed Giants trainer Stan Conte in the groin during a spring training game. According to Jenkins, Pierzynski was hit on the groin, and Conte went over to see if he was alright. The article claimed that Pierzynski then kneed Conte after Conte inquired about the extent of the injury. Jenkins wrote the article after Pierzynski had left the Giants organization, so some have questioned the accuracy of the report. No other reporters have written about the incident, although Jenkins claimed that they were all conducting interviews in the Giants' clubhouse at the time. Neither Pierzynski nor Conte has commented about the allegations.</p>
<p>Former Giants pitcher <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brett_Tomko_8d9c.html" title="Brett Tomko">Brett Tomko</a> fiercely criticized Pierzynski for his brash demeanor. Tomko originally made the comments anonymously, but later confessed to making the comments after drawing fierce criticism for them. Tomko later claimed that the comments came out the wrong way. After hearing of the source of the comments, Pierzysnki was quoted as saying that he would give one hundred dollars to any Sox teammate who hit a <a href="../../../h/o/m/Home_run.html" title="Home run">home run</a> off of Tomko. Pierzynski followed up on his promise by placing a one hundred dollar bill in outfielder <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Borchard_d0d4.html" title="Joe Borchard">Joe Borchard</a>'s locker after he hit a home run off of Tomko on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_7.html" title="March 7">March 7</a>, 2005.</p>
<p>A May 2006 issue of <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports_Illustrated_9f1c.html" title="Sports Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a> featured a survey taken among 470 baseball players about what player they would most like to see get <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_jargon.html" title="Baseball jargon">beaned</a>. Pierzynski received eighteen percent of the vote, which was higher than any other player. Forty-two percent of those surveyed in the AL Central Division (which the White Sox play in) voted for Pierzynski. It should be noted, however, that the majority of White Sox players voted for Pierzynski as a team joke. This undoubtedly greatly manipulated the survey.</p>
<p>In a <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_14.html" title="June 14">June 14</a>, 2006 game versus the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas_Rangers_%28baseball%29_b4f3.html" title="Texas Rangers (baseball)">Texas Rangers</a>, Rangers pitcher <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vicente_Padilla_a65f.html" title="Vicente Padilla">Vicente Padilla</a> hit Pierzynski twice in Pierzynski's first two at-bats, both times with fastballs on the first pitch of the count. Both benches were warned after the incident, but no players were punished. Pierzynski received large bruises from the pitches, and had to sit out the next two Sox games because of them.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_19.html" title="July 19">July 19</a>, 2006 game versus the <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Tigers_a55b.html" title="Detroit Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>, Pierzynski was again involved in an altercation at the plate, this time with Tigers' designated hitter <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craig_Monroe_bdcd.html" title="Craig Monroe">Craig Monroe</a>. Following a grand slam in the bottom of the 6th inning that turned out to be the game winner, Monroe and his Tiger teammates were celebrating at the plate when Pierzynski bumped Monroe. After the incident, both players had different stories. Pierzynski said that Monroe apologized after coming up to bat again in the 8th inning. However, according to Monroe, Pierzynski elbowed him, and Monroe didn't apologize, he asked, "Was that elbow really necessary?"</p>
<p>In a series with the Twins the weekend of August 25-26-27, 2006, on two separate occasions after homering, Pierzynski "flipped the bat", instead of just dropping it, in full view of his former teammates' dugout. Flipping the bat is a gesture regarded by ballplayers as "showing up" the other team. Twins radio announcer Dan Gladden commented "That was just A.J. bein' A.J." White Sox TV announcer <a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Harrelson_488d.html" title="Ken Harrelson">Ken "The Hawk" Harrelson</a> remarked, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, "If A.J. is on the other team, you hate him; if he's on your team, you hate him a little less!"</p>
<p>Pierzynski is not unaware of his persona. At the championship celebration in October, 2005, A.J. thanked various people, including his teammates "for putting up with me."</p>
<p>On April 5, 2007 against the Cleveland Indians, in the bottom of the ninth with the bases loaded, a pitch was made that was high and inside, and Pierzynski acted as though it hit him. He turned to the umpire, and was awarded first base, driving in the winning run. However, upon closer examination, it appears that the pitch came nowhere close to hitting him, and Pierzynski was simply acting.</p>
