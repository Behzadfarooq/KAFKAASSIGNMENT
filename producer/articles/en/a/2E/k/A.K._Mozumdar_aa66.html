<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/k/A.K._Mozumdar_aa66.html" title="Edit section: A.K. Mozumdar">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">A.K. Mozumdar</span></h2>
<p><b>Akhoy Kumar Mozumdar</b> (1864-1953) was a prolific independent lecturer, writer and healer of the New Thought movement during the first half of twentieth century America. During his long career Mozumdar enjoyed a large following of students, numerous affiliated teaching centers and churches, and even more regular readers of his many books and pamphlets. Despite the fact that those writings have been out of print for some time, there are many today who still rely upon Mozumdar’s insight and credit him with <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Thought_fde3.html" title="New Thought">New Thought</a> discoveries that have since been incorporated by other teachers.</p>
<p>A.K. Mozumdar was born near <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calcutta.html" title="Calcutta">Calcutta</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, the son of an attorney father and a deeply religious mother. As a young man he traveled extensively throughout <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestine</a> in search of spiritual understanding. At the prompting of one of his teachers he left for America, arriving in <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle.html" title="Seattle">Seattle</a> in 1903 where he immediately worked to polish his English language skills and addressed large audiences of curious people. After three years in Seattle he moved 300 miles east and settled in <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spokane%2C_Washington_e57d.html" title="Spokane, Washington">Spokane, Washington</a>, where he established a center called the Society of Christian Yoga. His travels around the country began and centers were established in other cities as well. His magazine, <i>Christian Yoga Monthly,</i> was published out of the <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland%2C_California_0bc0.html" title="Oakland, California">Oakland, California</a>, Christian Yoga Center.</p>
<p>While in <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spokane.html" title="Spokane">Spokane</a>, Mozumdar wrote the first two editions of the work that would be the principal textbook throughout his teaching career, <i>The Life and the Way.</i> The 1914 leather-bound second edition was more than 700 pages long so in later years he condensed it into a series of booklets that were easier for students to study.</p>
<p>In 1913 Mozumdar became the first Indian-born person to earn U.S. citizenship after he convinced the District Judge in <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spokane.html" title="Spokane">Spokane</a> that he was, in fact, a Caucasian and thereby met the requirements of naturalization law restricting citizenship to “free white persons.” Ten years later, as a result of a <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Supreme_Court_2553.html" title="U.S. Supreme Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> decision stipulating that no East Indian citizen was to be permitted to become a naturalized American citizen, Mozumdar’s citizenship was revoked. A decision on his appeal to the <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninth_Circuit_Court_of_Appeals_abc0.html" title="Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals">Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> upheld the revocation. Shortly before his death, after some loosening of naturalization laws, Mozumdar again qualified for U.S. citizenship. These court cases are still studied today by attorneys and others seeking to trace the roots of American immigration law, especially as those laws pertained to race. See <i>In re Mozumdar,</i> 207 F. 115 (E.D. Wash. 1913); <i>United States v. Akhay Kumar Mozumdar,</i> 296 F. 173 (1923); and <i>Akhay Kumar Mozumdar v. United States,</i> 299 F. 240 (1924).</p>
<p>During <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> Mozumdar enlisted in the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Army.html" title="Army">Army</a> and was sent to officer training school at Spokane’s <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gonzaga_University_2695.html" title="Gonzaga University">Gonzaga University</a>. Shortly after his training began the armistice was signed and Mozumdar was honorably discharged.</p>
<p>In 1911 Ralph deBit (1883-1964, named “Vitvan” by Mozumdar) became a close student. After eight years of study and work with Mozumdar, deBit went out on his own and throughout his lifetime wrote many books, lectured and founded a movement that survives today as the <a href="http://www.sno.org" class="external text" title="http://www.sno.org" rel="nofollow">School of the Natural Order</a> in the state of <a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevada.html" title="Nevada">Nevada</a>.</p>
<p>After moving to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> in 1919, Mozumdar’s lecture schedule and list of publications lengthened. Each year he was on the road many months, regularly conducting classes and seminars in most major American cities. His books were read widely, worldwide. By now he was identifying his movement as the New Messianic World Message.</p>
<p>Mozumdar loved the solitude of the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Bernardino_Mountains_b74f.html" title="San Bernardino Mountains">San Bernardino Mountains</a> east of <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and he went there often to meditate. Eventually he bought a small parcel of land near present-day <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silverwood_Lake_65e1.html" title="Silverwood Lake">Silverwood Lake</a> which over the years was expanded to nearly 100 acres. A lodge was built, complete with an outdoor swimming pool, and a large amphitheater known as the "Pillars of God" was generally packed with hundreds of students each Sunday afternoon during the summer for Mozumdar’s lectures. The focal point of Camp Mozumdar was the ornate Temple of Christ designed by Mozumdar’s close friend, San Diego architect William Lodge. Most of the structures burned down during the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Fire_d349.html" title="Old Fire">Old Fire</a> of 2003. The temple, which remains, resembles those in India.</p>
<p>Mozumdar’s memorial service was conducted by his friend <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Holmes_1363.html" title="Ernest Holmes">Ernest Holmes</a>, founder of the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_Science_63ad.html" title="Religious Science">Religious Science</a> movement and author of <i>The Science of Mind.</i> He was interred at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_Lawn_Memorial_Park%2C_Glendale_d009.html" title="Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale">Forest Lawn</a> in <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glendale%2C_California_2c37.html" title="Glendale, California">Glendale, California</a>.</p>
<p>In his lectures, numerous booklets, pamphlets and eight larger books Mozumdar taught students that their human existence was intimately interwoven with a divine existence. Making conscious contact with that divine side – which he alternately termed God, the “Animating Power back of our mind and body,” “Fundamental Principle,” “All Pervading Creative Life,” etc. – was essential for achieving happiness, prosperity and solutions to all of life’s challenges. He devised simple, effective techniques to facilitate this contact, techniques based upon his fresh definition of the Animating Power back of our mind and body – i.e., God. “If man thinks and acts, is not the thinker... and actor... God?... If God is All-Life... then all lives are God... The Creative-power is the very nature of the Being of the Creator; hence the Creative-power is God.... Life is the Creator, and It will never be reduced to the level of Its own creation. The creature will forever be ensouled with the Creative-activity, and move and act according to the inner impulse of the Creator.... By thinking with the mind of the one Life, you become conscious of being the Thinker.... At the back of your every action you should find Yourself.... You are spirit and therefore spiritual.... The Permanent Substance is underneath all forms. The forms are made of the Everlasting Substance. This knowledge sets a man free....” (From Mozumdar’s <i>The Life of Man,</i> p. 1, 3, 7, 27, and <i>The Conquering Man,</i> p. 41 as synthesized by Dr. Wendell Marshall Thomas in his 1930 study <i>Hinduism Invades America,</i> published by Beacon Press, p. 253 ff] One of Mozumdar’s favorite injunctions was, “Your Power to conceive God IS God.” Establishing contact with that Superconscious Self brings all things within reach. Mozumdar achieved much success in assisting his students to use awareness of their innate divinity to obtain the good things in life such as career success, friends or spouse, health and healing. Our objective life is a reflection of our mental life; what we choose to believe shapes our experience. There was nothing supernatural about these practices, he felt; all existence is real and all phenomena will ultimately be explained by science.</p>

<p>“While Mozumdar's teaching is popular, it has unusual historic significance, for it shows us what happens when a thinker immersed in Hindu lore completely accepts a world-affirming position. What happens is an identification of the Hindu conception of a divine universal Self with the Hebrew conception of a divine creative Power. To Mozumdar the ultimate God is not uncreative Bliss, as in the view of Sankara, but creative Power, as in the Hebrew tradition. Yet this creative Power, he declares, is the same as the universal Self. Here the universal Self, we should note, is not a finite Ideal, as in Greek philosophy, but the infinite Substance of the world.” – <i>Hinduism Invades America</i> by Dr. Wendell Marshall Thomas (Beacon Press, 1930)</p>
<p>“(A.K. Mozumdar was) more spiritually advanced than any person I encountered along the metaphysical by-ways ... I feel that I got more from him than from any other (East Indian teacher) I listened to.” – <i>Sight Unseen</i> by Frederick G. Lieb (Harper &amp; Row, 1939)</p>
<p>“Mozumdar's course plunged me at once into a laboratory method of doing things with expedition and power. I had expected theory, I got practice; I looked for philosophy, I got operative science. I had shopped around with courses of instruction before. They all seemed like kindergarten work; Mozumdar's is like a postgraduate course. I cannot thank him enough for the push his lessons gave me toward action and reality, away from bookish theories.” – John Seaman Garns, author, teacher and past president of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_New_Thought_Alliance_5a8a.html" title="International New Thought Alliance">International New Thought Alliance</a></p>
<p>“(Mozumdar) is a Hindu of fine intellectual ability and great spiritual zeal, intent upon giving a clear message that all things and conditions are according to your concept. Strong, absolute statements abound in the teachings of A.K. Mozumdar.” – Annie Rix Militz (1856-1924), a prominent early leader in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Thought_Movement_e2e0.html" title="New Thought Movement">New Thought Movement</a></p>
<p>“I do not know of any spiritual teacher that I consider so close to the spirit of Christ as Mr. Mozumdar. He has that perfect transparency that is a combination of what they say are the outstanding qualities of Ghandi, humility and confidence – humility in the outer and perfect confidence in the inner. I feel that any one who perfectly comprehends his teachings and puts them into expression in his life will possess the secret of the ages.” – <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glenn_Clark_4980.html" title="Glenn Clark">Glenn Clark</a>, inspirational author, lecturer, college professor and founder of <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camps_Farthest_Out_5cd5.html" title="Camps Farthest Out">Camps Farthest Out</a></p>
<p>“Words cannot express my gratitude for what I have received in Mr. Mozumdar's class. He is one of the Illuminati whom it is a privilege to contact.” – Countess Ilya Tolstoy (daughter-in-law of Russian author <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leo_Tolstoy_eb79.html" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>)</p>
<p>“I have met all the well-known spiritual teachers in America, and I unqualifiedly place A.K. Mozumdar among the foremost in point of realization. I believe he is the highest teacher in America today.” – Mrs. C.M. Fassett (wife of the former mayor of Spokane and a friend of Mozumdar's since his arrival in America)</p>
<p>“Mr. Mozumdar is the most spiritual man and the most beautiful character I have ever met.” – Arthur Garfield Learned (an internationally-known New York City portrait artist)</p>
<p>“I know India from my years spent in that country, and I know her great spiritual message for the world. Mr. Mozumdar is one of those highly spiritualized souls who has much for America and whom we should receive with open arms.” – <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwin_Lester_Arnold_4b3f.html" title="Edwin Lester Arnold">Edwin Lester Arnold</a> (son of author <a href="../../../s/i/r/Sir_Edwin_Arnold_1a1b.html" title="Sir Edwin Arnold">Sir Edwin Arnold</a>, upon introducing Mozumdar to a Chicago audience. <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwin_Lester_Arnold_4b3f.html" title="Edwin Lester Arnold">Edwin Lester Arnold</a> was a widely published novelist and non-fiction writer while his father is best remembered for his epic poem <i>The Light of Asia.</i>)</p>
