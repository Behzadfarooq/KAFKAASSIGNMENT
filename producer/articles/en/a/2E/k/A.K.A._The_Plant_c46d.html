<p>The episode begins with Nancy and Celia campaigning door to door in Agrestic to collect the required signatures. Celia ridicules some of her neighbors for the tacky statues on their lawn, but puts on a polite face when the owners open the door. Though much to her dismay everyone on the block is voting for Doug. A talent scout spots Isabel on the sidewalk and asks for Celia's permission to let her model for the Huskaroos clothing line for "larger children", an idea which Celia promptly rejects. While Isabel argues her case, Peter calls to ask Nancy out but with her busy schedule she shoots down every date he proposes. Meanwhile Dean gets laid off from his lawfirm and causes a scene on his way out of the building.</p>
<p>Conrad provides Nancy with a fake drivers licence and social security number from Quebec under the name Lacy LaPlante. This way she can operate her grow business in relative anonymity. "Lacy" tries her new IDs out by setting up electricity in her house but the clerk is hesitant to do so with an international licence. Nancy quickly concocts a story about a sick husband who was checked by a hockey player from Moose Jaw and has cancer, and she needs to pay her deposit to get electricity in her house so that her husband's ventilator can be plugged in. The attendant seems to buy the story and "Lacy" is in business.</p>
<p>At the grow house, Doug and Andy find a hookah and proceed to get high instead of helping Nancy and Conrad clean. Andy orders internet and cable to be installed, stupidly under Nancy's real name, so Conrad has to quickly dismiss the technician and rip up the work order the bears her name. While they clean, Conrad promises that the man he has hired to install top of the line grow technology is worth every penny of Nancy's money. He vows they will be making millions a year. In his rage, Dean shows up at the grow house and punches Conrad when he answers the door. As Nancy looks on shocked, Conrad declares that they are now even about him sleeping with Celia. Later at home, Dean tries to lie but then has to break the news to an unimpressed Celia. Celia, having praised his job to Nancy earlier, voices her disappointment eventhough Dean claims to have devoted his life to the firm.</p>
<p>The boys at school ridicule Shane because he has never received a handjob from a classmate, so he turns to Andy and begs for help. Ever the caring parental figure, Andy takes him a "massage parlor" for a happy ending. The woman at the parlor refuses to service Shane because of his age, but when Shane fakes crying in disappointment, she relents. Andy praises his skills as an uncle.</p>
<p>Heylia and Nancy discuss Joseph the pie man. Heylia mentioned that her home number is listed and says that she has been waiting for his call for two days now. Nancy drops a few hints about seeing Peter when Heylia talks about being with someone who isn't right for you. After Shane's excursion, he asks to postpone movie night with Nancy and with her evening now free, she calls up Peter for a date. The two go to a shooting range where Nancy does remarkably well on her first try. They casually chat about guns, Peter's job and the undercover work he has to do for the next few weeks. At the same time, Heylia receives a phone call from Joseph. He speaks on the evils of temptation preached by Islam, but then asks if she is available for marriage in the future and promises to visit her that evening.</p>
<p>On his date with Yael, Andy learns a bit about Yael's past in the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Defense_Forces_0099.html" title="Israel Defense Forces">Israel Defense Forces</a>. She tells him that she has been with many men since her lover died because it helps her get over her pain. Andy makes a move on her but she rejects him, saying that he's sweet but too nice for her. She needs a real man who will take control instead of asking permission.</p>
<p>Back at the grow house, Conrad is supervising Victor and his men as they install the equipment. Nancy is amazed at their quick progress but they are interrupted by a visiting neighbor. The man at the door brings pastries and introduces himself as Kashishian. He tells Conrad that he knows the kind of business they're running because he recognized Victor's boxes being unloaded from the trucks. He threatens Conrad who immediately reports to Nancy and Victor. Victor explains that he set up Kashishian's grow houses and that the Armenian is very powerful. Nancy ignores Conrad's concern and tells the men to keep setting up her equipment.</p>
<p>When Nancy arrives home, Silas and Megan are waiting outside. Silas announces that Megan is pregnant and they want to keep the baby.</p>
