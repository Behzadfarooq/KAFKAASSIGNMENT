<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._A._Ames_7940.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>Ames was born in Garden Prairie in <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boone_County%2C_Illinois_0db6.html" title="Boone County, Illinois">Boone County, Illinois</a>, but left the area at age ten when his father, Dr. Alfred Elisha Ames, moved his family to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Snelling_8493.html" title="Fort Snelling">Fort Snelling</a> in <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Territory_419b.html" title="Minnesota Territory">Minnesota Territory</a>. Minnesota was young too—much of the land that would later become Minneapolis was still under control of the fort. Albert attended local <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_school.html" title="Public school">public schools</a>, which were partially run by the federal government, and eventually began working for a local newspaper before moving on to study medicine. He was largely taught by his father, but finished up his education at <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_Medical_College_d653.html" title="Rush Medical College">Rush Medical College</a> in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a> and received his <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_of_Medicine_f48c.html" title="Doctor of Medicine">M.D.</a> on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_5.html" title="February 5">February 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1862.html" title="1862">1862</a>. Soon after, Dr. Ames married Sarah Strout, daughter of Captain Richard Strout of Minneapolis, on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_21.html" title="April 21">April 21</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._A._Ames_7940.html" title="Edit section: Military career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Military career</span></h2>
<p>The new doctor wasn't able to settle down for long, however, as he soon enlisted in the 9th Minnesota Infantry Regiment and became involved in the <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakota_War_of_1862_f969.html" title="Dakota War of 1862">Dakota War of 1862</a>, a small war that erupted between the white settlers of Minnesota and the local <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakota.html" title="Dakota">Dakota</a> population. After witnessing combat at the Battle of Acton, in 1863 Ames was shipped south to provide medical service during the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. He attained the rank of Surgeon Major in 1864.</p>
<p>Following the war, he returned to Minnesota for a few years. He was elected to the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_State_Legislature_d503.html" title="Minnesota State Legislature">Minnesota State Legislature</a> in 1866 and served the next year, but soon headed out west to <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a>, where he worked as an editor for the <i><a href="../../../d/a/i/Daily_Times_d9d4.html" title="Daily Times">Daily Times</a></i> and the <i><a href="../../../a/l/t/Alta_California_1a9a.html" title="Alta California">Alta California</a></i>. He stayed out west from 1868 until 1874 when his father became terminally ill. After the funeral, he was persuaded by relatives to take over his father's medical practice. For the next 25 years, "Doc" Ames continued to live in Minneapolis.</p>

<p>In 1876, Ames was first elected mayor, but he only served a single term for one year at that time. He ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor the next year, then returned to the mayor's office in 1882 for two years. He again became the city's mayor in 1886, this time serving for two and a half years because the city elections were moved from <a href="../../../s/p/r/Spring_%28season%29.html" title="Spring (season)">spring</a> to <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autumn.html" title="Autumn">autumn</a>. For each of those mayoral terms, he served as a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Democratic_Party_b5cb.html" title="United States Democratic Party">Democrat</a>, but changed parties in the late 1890s and ended up being elected as a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Republican_Party_faa7.html" title="United States Republican Party">Republican</a> in 1900, taking office in January 1901. Ames had been implicated in some scandalous behavior of others in his early terms as mayor, but his actions in 1901 and 1902—supposedly as part of a "reform" administration—would prove beyond doubt that Ames was a very dastardly figure himself.</p>

<p>Planning for the new administration began soon after election results were known from the 1900 election. Doc Ames organized his advisers and announced he would install his brother Fred W. Ames as the city's chief of police. Once in office, the Ames brothers flushed out the police force, replacing experienced officers with known crooks. New openings were even offered up to the highest bidder. The new police force became a supporter and purveyor of <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organized_crime.html" title="Organized crime">organized crime</a>, extorting money from illegal businesses of various kinds. They also released many criminals from the city's <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_jail.html" title="County jail">jail</a>, and promoted Minneapolis to robbers across the country.</p>

<p>Illegal businesses multiplied. There were more saloons, <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opium.html" title="Opium">opium</a> joints, <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gambling.html" title="Gambling">gambling</a> parlors, and houses of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitution.html" title="Prostitution">prostitution</a> blossoming throughout the city. It was even recommended that women set up <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candy.html" title="Candy">candy</a> stores to run a legitimate business to children and workers out front, but provide sexual services to any man who would pay in the back. The head of a major gambling syndicate in the city became a <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detective.html" title="Detective">detective</a> in the Minneapolis Police Department. The police would go and collect "fines" from these businesses in a way that would more closely resemble the intake of <a href="../../../m/a/f/Mafia.html" title="Mafia">Mafia</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protection_money.html" title="Protection money">protection money</a> today. Prostitutes were said to have made monthly trips to the city court's clerk to pay $100. Vast amounts of money were taken in at all levels. However, the rampant criminal activity soon began to swirl out of control as the cops and politicians began to swindle each other.</p>

<p>In April 1902, a new grand jury came together. The jury handled many normal activities, but under the leadership of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreman.html" title="Foreman">foreman</a> Hovey C. Clarke began an investigation into the city government. Through the summer, the grand jurors paid private detectives from their own pockets, both locally known men and others from out of town, to document everything that was going on. They handed down numerous <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indictment.html" title="Indictment">indictments</a>, and when the county prosecutor proved unwilling to do his duty, Clarke excused him and took over the role. The grand jurors even succeeded in tracking down a few crooks and witnesses who had left the state. In one trial, a man thought to have been a thousand miles away in <a href="../../../i/d/a/Idaho.html" title="Idaho">Idaho</a> or <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> suddenly appeared, leading the defendant to jump to his feet in the courtroom and then, later in the evening, flee the city.</p>

<p>Mayor Ames was finally cornered, so he fired his brother as chief of police before resigning and then left for the resort town of <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Baden%2C_Indiana_7bad.html" title="West Baden, Indiana">West Baden, Indiana</a>. He was arrested in <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hancock%2C_New_Hampshire_0797.html" title="Hancock, New Hampshire">Hancock, New Hampshire</a> in February, 1903<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> and was returned to Minnesota a few months later. He ended up standing trial and was convicted of receiving a bribe. He was then sentenced to six years in State prison.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> The sentence was overturned on appeal and, after two mistrials, all legal action against him was ceased. He had served no time in jail. His brother Fred was sentenced to several years in the state prison, and many others were also put behind bars. City council member D. Percy Jones took over as acting mayor until the term was complete, and succeeded in cleaning up much of the mess in just about four months of work. The next elected mayor, J. C. Haynes, continued the cleanup process.</p>

<p>After the end of the final trial, the doctor returned to his practice of medicine in Minneapolis. He died quite suddenly on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_16.html" title="November 16">November 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a>.
