<p>I've had to deal with it enough from all the Kerry freaks; I don't need it from you. I'm goddamned proud of my heritage and don't need to prove nothing for anybody to accept me. But go ahead and be the ignorant one. This is one redneck who ain't so ignorant! Attack, I double-dog dare you! You never know what to expect, but Kerry's freaks are driving my heart to severance from my home. It is humiliating to be pressured into leaving my home and hearth, but Southrons are so welcoming and loving--in contrast to Yankee multiculturalists. I'll surely find some place to pitch a doublewide, or build my own cabin in the boonies of Appalachia. Your words seem to accept this status quo; just one more example of us rural North British being treated like we are worth nothing by aristocrats. Rob Roy was a tragic hero. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoughface_7707.html" title="User:Doughface">Doughface</a> 15:02, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course it's not personal. You have no grasp of the actual distance between what you edit and the truthful existence as life is played out. The summary is, that your facts are fictions to the world in which we live. I live a life that defies your dogma, as do those closest in my network. Please, take into account that stereotypes can have a negative effect upon people. I've already had a few ignoramouses revert my additions because I didn't follow stereotype. Now, they just sweep the issue and my own heritage under the carpet. I'm trying to stick up for it, but that apparently will not get me anywhere on such a liberal, Randian website such as this. Rednecks are just stock characters to the lot of folks here, referenced for comic relief and not dealt with seriously except for polemics against their percieved wrongs as poor whites. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoughface_7707.html" title="User:Doughface">Doughface</a> 16:17, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I certainly don't see any how I'm undertaking some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADoughface&amp;diff=64307947&amp;oldid=64282200" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADoughface&amp;diff=64307947&amp;oldid=64282200" rel="nofollow">"leftist stereotyping"</a> of your heritage.

<dd>The average Wikipedia editor probably is more liberal than you or I but I've found most make a serious effort at neutrality and good faith -- as do most of the very active group of fairly conservative editors on Wikipedia and the hundreds of editors living in states encompassing Southern Appalachia (<a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_in_West_Virginia_cdb6.html" title="Category:Wikipedians in West Virginia">1</a>, 2, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_in_Virginia_abcf.html" title="Category:Wikipedians in Virginia">3</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_in_Tennessee_30d5.html" title="Category:Wikipedians in Tennessee">4</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_in_North_Carolina_c197.html" title="Category:Wikipedians in North Carolina">5</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedians_in_Kentucky_f7d6.html" title="Category:Wikipedians in Kentucky">6</a>). Note that all of these people are also only human; like it or not, editors of any ideology or hometown become less neutral and civil when one goes at them with uncivil remarks. Take a look at:

</dd>
<dd>In the meantime, if you see <i>factual errors</i> in the talk page comment that I left, then by all means (civilly) contradict them with your own comments. Talk page comments don't have to meet Wikipedia's "No original research" policy, but if you could cite verifiable neutral data from reliable primary or secondary sources that would be great since it could also go into the article. See <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> -- the goal here is a reliable encyclopedia article on <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appalachia.html" title="Appalachia">Appalachia</a> and that kind of work on your part would help us get there. If you can prove me wrong the encyclopedic way in the process, well, that's fine by me.</dd>

<dd>You know, the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> approach works wonders on the feeble minded. I'm not looking for arguments. I had a statement to make about the light-hearted way with which you tossed aside an important issue for me; ignorance can be a degrading thing, even if unintentional. Don't go for the point-by-point thing, because that is <i>not the point</i> I am trying to make. BTW, I have already explained myself. It is up for you to pay attention to what I have said, but I will make an appendix here: I am well aware of conventional stereotypes of Appalachia, while even noting the deep end of lunacy that some of our people have taken up as a result of FDR and LBJ. I may call it lunacy, but it's because I have no use for those who rub my heritage in the mud. Perhaps they could learn some respect for the ways of Old Rough and Ready, Tippecanoe and the Hickories. I might ease up a bit, if they would but merely consider that they have fused Yankee fanaticism into their own communities as a way of getting attention or appearing enlightened. The new good ole boys co-opt Carpetbagging culture to prop themselves up; a case in point would be Wal-Mart. We don't need none of that shit in the frontier. I will suffer no polemic against my heritage; I am an apologist through thick and thin. The New South is a sham and pox on the Southern House. We do not espouse "Hippie values", nor accept them. This is just the way it is in our world, which the goddamned outsiders ought to understand. If they don't, while continuing to praise and insult in the same breath, then they must explain that they are sorry or butt out to mind their own business. I ain't even tolerated or accepted. Why would I keep trying to cash a check in turning the other cheek? It ain't been workin'! I don't need no "Whiteface" portrayed about me and mine! If you don't think so, you ain't a true-blue Appalachian! <a href="../../../o/_/b/O_Brother%2C_Where_Art_Thou__64a7.html" title="O Brother, Where Art Thou?">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forrest_Gump_3eb5.html" title="Forrest Gump">Forrest Gump</a> are totally wrong! <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoughface_7707.html" title="User:Doughface">Doughface</a> 18:43, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is all up to you; your choice on whether to have visionary empathy or bat me away like some horsefly. The thing is, I did not strike first. I merely showcased about me and mine. That was just not good enough, so the standard, outsider view comes to the fore and supplants what was added for no other reason than people understanding a bit more about my heritage. Where does one go wrong, except "violating minor technicalities" of a convention steeped in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">systemic bias</a>?

<p>Thanks for your your support + research/comments. Unfortunately people rarely seem to return to an RFA after the first couple of days to read comments and change votes, so the RFA is almost certainly doomed to failure unless several people remove their oppose and/or a lot more support. The way the&#160;!voting system on RFA works means that one oppose cancels out 4 or 5 supports. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 08:38, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear A.B.,</p>
<p>You have left repeated messages for me to stop 'spamming' with links. I read your suggestions and have responded to them appropriately.

<p>The site in question has a bookstore. The admin who looked at it agreed that it was appropriate to speedy delete it. FYI, I have nothing against any of the orgs in question, but I don't think they have references to support the type and length of article these editors are writing. I would have no problem with a short, cited article, but repeating their own version of the history of Gnosticism rather than simply link to existing articles show they are trying to use WP as a soapbox rather than an encyclopedia... -<a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> (<a href="../../../9/9/9/User_talk%7E999.html" title="User talk:999">Talk</a>) 18:02, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To put this in context, if I had noticed it was a copyvio <i>before</i> AfDing it, I'd simply have speedied it without opening an AfD. It's standard process for such a new and extensive copyvio, to keep copyvio material out of the history of the article, where it is still a copyright violation. Certainly a new stub about the org itself without any copyvio can be created, so I don't see what the big deal is. There was no original content to speak of... -<a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> (<a href="../../../9/9/9/User_talk%7E999.html" title="User talk:999">Talk</a>) 19:12, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I doubt that. It's simply that I am a very strong proponent of copyright protection and think that trumps the whole AfD process. It was my opinion that the article met the criteria for speedy deletion (wasn't it you who suggested it might), and the process page stated that the admin responding would review and make sure the criteria were met before deletion (i.e. I am not an admin and did not do the deletion myself). It would not, in my opinion, have been appropriate to leave the copyvio material in the history of the article... I've nominated a number of articles for deletion and generally have no problem with whatever the outcome is. I definitely believe in consensus, but there are certain things, like copyvios and violations of <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>, that demand prompter action... -<a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">999</a> (<a href="../../../9/9/9/User_talk%7E999.html" title="User talk:999">Talk</a>) 19:46, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>you're correct, this article looks like complete crap; frankly I'm stunned the other editors are buying it. i searched for standard town-country format "Ngaa, Nigeria" via Google and I got a whopping two pages of results.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Trust me, I've been called a "process wonk" by fellow administrators for insisting on full AfD hearings in marginal cases where a CSD might or might not apply. (Most often, these questions occur under CSD A7, re: assertions of notability, but marginal cases can occur under <i>almost</i> any CSD.) CSD A8, however, is truly a different creature. Most of the CSDs (and the deletion process in toto) are about determining whether something is or is not encyclopedic. CSD A8, on the other hand, can apply to factual, elegantly-written prose of the highest caliber, worthy of any encyclopedia: if this text infringes on a copyright, it must be deleted as <i>illegal</i> to reprint. A speedy under A8 makes no judgment on the fitness of the topic for inclusion, only that the text in the article cannot belong in a free encyclopedia.</p>
<p>AfD is a good forum that does much better than its many detractors give it credit for, and I still trust it ultimately in determining encyclopedic fitness; however, as I said, CSD A8 is in a separate domain. As you probably know, AfD has never had jurisdiction over copyright issues; as a matter of reasonably objective law, and not community <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consensus.html" title="Consensus">consensus</a>, copyright violations are really a matter not open for debate. For its own reasons (ie., to avoid getting its pants sued off and getting shut down like a latter-day Napster), the Wikimedia Foundation, our owner, has chosen to take a very conservative line in interpreting copyright law, using the narrowest of fair use exceptions. The Gnostic case, though, was not a close one. The text corresponded closely to that on another copyrighted website; you make the point that the website infringed upon was only loosely commercial, but that point is very close to irrelevant. Commercial or not, the site so offended would have a right to sue Wikipedia (the word "commercial" <i>barely</i> made it into the CSD, and is to be interpreted broadly.) A proper CSD A8 claim <i>absolutely</i> supercedes AfD, and I would make that same decision anytime.</p>
<p>The silver lining for you is that the speedy deletion says nothing about the worthiness of the topic. Write a new article in your own words, sourced and referenced according to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and the previous copyvio speedy will have no baring whatsoever on your content. If an unthinking admin treats it roughly on account of the speedy today, let me know, and I will see that your text gets a full hearing. Best wishes, <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 01:40, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the long and thoughtful note. Trust me, I have no desire to resurrect the dead on this one. It was truly a wretched article worthy of deletion the old fashioned way on a topic in which I had no interest. Furthermore, the topic seemed to draw very contentious people out of the woodwork with their legions of sockpuppets and strong POVs as to which school of thought was the righteous one. (I once asked my sister-in-law, a chancery court judge, if she ever wanted to use her gavel on one of the lawyers; her answer -- "no, but I've sure wanted to use it on some of the witnesses.")</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>My main concern was the process. I continue to think that the person who engineered this couldn't give a fig about copyright and was really just eager to shut both the article and fellow AfD participants down -- that's been his M.O. elsewhere from what I've seen. I will reflect further on what I've seen.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In any event, it sounds like you absolutely did the right thing for the right reasons, even if the person proposing it was really doing it for all the wrong reasons. I saw on your user page that you're a lawyer -- maybe you should be a judge. In the meantime, pending your appointment to the bench, thanks for being a judicious admin. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.

<p>For anyone keen on the details, they can check the edit history for this archive page and pull up the version of this section that existed before this deletion today.

Furthermore, a feeling of righteous indignation is too often a danger warning that one's headed down a very wrong path; such an emotion may lead to self-justified excesses worse than whatever led one (me in this case) to get upset.</p>

<p>Thank you for the note on my talk page. Just to repeat myself, I wanted to let you know that no was offense taken, and that I believe you have been acting in good faith the entire time.

<dd>Hi there! You're to be commended for conducting some extensive research into the matter. The information you've provided enables one to put things in perspective in terms of population and density. Ultimately, however, I think the issue here is not the notability of the place, but how people feel about an article of a place is used for an internet group's purposes. This Nigerian entity ( be it a town, region, or territory, as it seems a bit unclear how to define this place) seems to be notable for the sheer fact that it exists (albeit not heavily documented yet). I think what people are bothered by is that half of the content of the article is used to mention an infamous internet group. It's reasonable to understand why a small "town" in Nigeria hasn't been well-documented yet. If one looks to Google Earth, the Nigerian detail pales in comparison to that of a major Western city (Dublin, London, New York City, take your pick). This lends to the notion that not much attention has been paid to this region in as far as cartography and such. As this is an encyclopedia, I subsribe to the idea that any town or region carries inherent notability. Having said this, your participation in this AfD has gone beyond the call of duty and your research has been quite good. <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 13:36, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sure, good stuff. I in no way meant to call your motives into question in participating in this RfA. It wasn't my intention to pigeonhole you. You've obviously shown quite the dedication into finding out what's what. However, I feel that your research indicates that the place should be included in the Wikipedia. It's obviously a geographic place (whether it be a town, region, or territory), which I think carries inherent notability. One must ask oneself "What's the harm in leaving it as is?" Sources independent of each other have documented the place's existence, and it seems like a cool challenge to flesh out the article a bit and hopefully rid it of its stub status. In any case, you've done good work mate! <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 22:30, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just saw your note on my talk page (somehow I missed it yesterday), but I have read your painstaking analysis on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_Gnaa%2C_Nigeria_%283rd_nomination%29_b1f1.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Gnaa, Nigeria (3rd nomination)">Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Gnaa, Nigeria (3rd nomination)</a>. The discussion was closed before I could post my approval of your work there. Had I saw that to begin with, I probably wouldn't have weighed into the discussion. I also hope that you think I was simply being obstructionist in my objections: my concern is based on having successfuly pushed at least one AfD for an Africa-related subject that I later found verification that proved the article was about something true.</p>
<p>On the other hand, while I still believe in the general reliability of Fallingrain, I would never write an article based solely on material taken from there -- nor from the NGA database. The reason is simple: in most cases, this leads to nothing more than a plethora of what we used to call "sub-stubs" -- articles consisting of a single sentence or less -- that would likely never be expanded on. I've sometimes felt there is a need for a test for inclusion of non-Western small towns &amp; villages -- not for notability, but of verification. (There are any number of reasons to require a cut-off for inclusion, including the fact villages often appear, disappear, or move in parts of Asia, Africa &amp; South America.) I know with Ethiopian town &amp; village articles, I have been following a rule that I don't bother with writing an article unless I have at least 2 of the following 3 sources for it:</p>
<ul>
<li>A NGA entry;</li>
<li>A Central Statistics Agency of Ethiopia entry;</li>
<li>A third party source: travel hand book, travellers account, history text.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wondering if something similar to this rule should be adopted across the board for other countries. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 23:49, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's a great idea. I also think that a minimum size, subject to some adjustments, would be a good idea. For instance, a town of 5,000 in China is not notable, but in the Canadian Arctic, Greenland, or the middle of the Sahara, it's very notable. It might also help to have a minimum article size -- if all you can say is that "Bumpkinville is a town in Ethiopia with some coordinates" -- well maybe you should wait until you've got a little more, like population, etc. Otherwise, it's a sort of a geographical dicdef <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICDEF_eedd.html" title="WP:DICDEF">WP:DICDEF</a>. In fact, modifying notability critera is mushy enough -- maybe it would be easier get the micro-stubs policed by defining them as dicdefs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I wonder if Wikipedia allows notability consensus among sub-groups -- for instance, if everyone on the Arica agrees on certain norms, then use that in AfDs as a sort of informal consensus. I don't know enough about Wikipedia's functioning.--<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A. B.</a> 00:30, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I honestly don't think <i>anyone</i> truly knows how Wikipedia functions -- not even Jimbo. What most people do is just put their idea into practice, &amp; either other Wikipedians decide it's worth copying &amp; it catches on, or they meet resistance (or apathy) &amp; eventually abandon the idea. (Having discussions, polls &amp; the other trimmings of process help things along &amp; smooth out the bumps, but I'm constantly surprised at how much can be changed by just following <a href="../../../b/e/_/Be_bold.html" title="Be bold">be bold</a>.)</dd>

<dd>But to the matter of this discussion: I don't think the critereon should be set to the size of the community, but your second point is more workable: if one can't provide a population statistic or a reason a reader would want to know about the community (e.g., "King Cipher was killed in his bath in Bumpkinville" with a source), then the article should be deleted. Much as I appreciate the research you put into the issue of Gnaa, Nigeria, I feel most Wikipedians would agree one should not work this hard to make the point in an AfD nomination; we need some simpler, more common-sense guidelines. Since posting my message above, I've been thinking about this matter, &amp; as soon as I can express my ideas in a simple form, I'll write it &amp; ask for your input -- as well as others. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 05:18, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello A.B., thanks for leaving me the comments and explanation re the deletion process for The Gnostic Movement Incorporated It is not so much thinking of you as an enemy but more frustration with learning the ropes of wikipedia and who is an admin, moderator etc and how to absorb all the policies etc so that I can conform to them. The copyright reason, I still don't fully understand, particularly if I had approval from the copyright owner to copy it into wikipedia. Would that still have contravened wiki policy? Was there something I should have done to indicate approval and thereby absolve wiki from any potential legal action, which by reading the few entries above, seems to have been the wiki admins main concern.</p>
<p>Irrespective, the page was created rather quickly, as like yourself, time is often not available to me, to spend hours writing or rewriting articles etc. I had planned on going back into the article to amend it and make internal links etc and hopefully make it conform to wiki articles policies. However, in the few days since posting it up, I hadn't had the time.</p>
<p>I appreciate your attempts to give me some time to clean it up and acknowledge how the speedy delete took over.</p>
<p>Whilst there are many encouraging statements all over wiki, enticing people to edit articles and make new ones, it seems to me, so far, that to actually write an article that fully conforms to the wiki policies would require an experienced wiki article writer, as I suspect the majority of people would not have the time or inclination to really study all of wiki's stipulations prior to making edits or attempting to write new articles. I had originally made the post, thinking it was inevitably going to be a 'work in progress', however, I do understand the reasons for its removal. Thanks again for informing me of the full story.

<dd>I wouldn't get too hung-up on "shortcomings", become too self-conscious, or get discouraged by your RfA. Just keep doing what you're doing, maybe adjusting it by 5%, and stay at it for a while and you'll do fine. You're on a good track. I suggest getting to about 3500, then testing the waters.

<dd>Andy, call me old-fashioned or follish, but I was concerned that you weren't getting treated fairly. I understood the other editors' criticisms and they seemed valid whether or not I exactly agreed with them. I assumed the same thing of Blue Tie but I did want to see the evidence (I <i>try</i> to look at all the links cited in RfAs). Concerned about potentially abusive or stupid behavior on your part, I asked for specifics -- diffs. Then I noticed others had asked for this same evidence a long time before and had gotten a lot more criticism of the candidate (you) -- but still no links. Still assuming good faith on Blue Tie's part, I started looking for the diffs myself. The more I looked at what I found, the more I came to wonder if my assumptions about Blue Tie's good faith were correct. I also noticed that your candidacy had slipped from above 75% to below 70% as Blue Tie <a href="http://football.about.com/cs/football101/g/gl_pilingon.htm|" class="external text" title="http://football.about.com/cs/football101/g/gl_pilingon.htm|" rel="nofollow">"piled on"</a>. Call me old-fashioned, but I just didn't think that was right. I thought it important for you and the RfA process for someone to get to the bottom of things. Here's some of the later back and forth between Blue Tie/Anon 64/72.13.168.149:

</dd>
<dd>I don't know if this answers your questions. I've come to accept that, occasionally, some RfA's are just going to get scuttled by folks selectively presenting negative info. Yours is the second I've seen that happen to recently. I've concluded since then that it's probably best to just let it happen rather than make a big fuss like I did. The Wikipedia community rapidly forgives folks that are (or seem) repentant and that stay out of trouble for a few months, so I figure you'll get another crack at it after a while. In so many other aspects of life, negative memories can have half-lives of decades, but they don't here. ~~----

<dd>As I wrote the above, I thought that an often overlooked and unarticulated pillar of the "Wikipedia way" is how it makes a virtue of imperfection and "moving on". Closely related to <a href="../../../b/b/_/WP%7EBB_678a.html" title="WP:BB">"be bold"</a>, I suppose. Editors aren't asked to be perfect -- just to advance an article some today, maybe some more next week, while knowing other out there are likely to fix typos, add information, correct errors. It all relies on the collective, incremental efforts of multiple editors working over time to continuously improve articles. Producing whole pages of perfectly documented, beautifully written prose all at once -- that's Britannica's goal; it's just not way Wikipedia works. Yet the Wikipedia way usually works almost as well, and often better. I think this "moving on" thinking has probably carried over to non-editing aspects of the culture, including processes like RfAs. Bad outcomes, like bad edits, aren't permanent -- they just take a little longer to get sorted out. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.

<dd>In your desire to do good, you did bad. In particular you made a number of false accusations and injured someone who was basically innocent. Normally people feel badly about that, even if they made the accusations in error. Apparently you do not. Everyone is different. --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue_Tie_f3b4.html" title="User:Blue Tie">Blue Tie</a> 03:58, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to let you know I'm done here, RfA failed, what more can I do? Yes, it may have failed for all the wrong reasons but that's my opinion isn't it. And as there's no guidelines or policies whilst voting in users RfA's anyone is allowed to oppose for any reason, even if it is for personal reasons.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndypandy.UK_6e9d.html" title="User:Andypandy.UK"><font style="background:white">Andeh</font></a> 16:32, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the positive comments. They mean a great deal to me. I thrive by encouragement. Yes I must have started thousands of articles and improved many by now but don't think that I will leave particularly the Italian towns comunes just as starter stubs. Once they are all started I can go through and download the maps, flags and data boxes, translate the Italian articles and research each one. If I do a bit most days when I have some spare time I'm sure it will be valuable to the project.

<dd>You asked, then later retracted the question -- how did I agree or disagree with them? Your question was a good one, retracted or not:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Foundation_issues" class="extiw" title="m:Foundation_issues">Foundation issues</a> -- I agree except as noted:
<ul>
<li>Ability of anyone to edit articles without registering -- I see a lot of mischief perpetrated by unregistered users. I'd like to see at least partial restrictions on anonymous editing, although I have not thought through what would or would not be workable.</li>
<li>Copyleft licensing of content; in practice, GFDL (working on changes via GFDL 2.0) -- in general, I agree, however I am not aware of what's going on with GFDL 2.0 (nor do I desire to study this issue)</li>
<li>Jimbo Wales as ultimate authority on any matter (this is changing; see Arbitration Committee, Board) -- as a practical matter, this has worked from what I can tell. I believe, on prinicipal, that he should be accountable to the Foundation Board, if he's not already.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I also believe in playing by the rules, so to the extent that I disagree, I am content to work within them, since I'm certainly often wrong or poorly informed. I also don't think understanding the foundation issues should be a factor in RfAs unless admins have some special voice in shaping Foundation policy (I'm unaware of any such special privileges).</dd>
<dd>The page you cited on foundation issues makes mention of instruction creep and cabalism, with links to two very thought-provoking pages, especially for anyone interested in sociology or organizational behavior. I could write pages analyzing and discussing these pages.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>The trifecta has stronger relevance to the day-to-day actions of admins and editors. I can interpret your question one or both of two ways:
<ol>
<li>What do I think of this concept for "packaging" or thinking of existing policies</li>
<li>What do I think of all the individual policies, guidelines and norms covered by each of these three core principles</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>There's a lot to chew on there, which will have to wait for another day. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A. B.</a> 12:24, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Thanks for your opinions in my RfA. Ultimately, the request did not pass, with a vote of (43/16/7). But your honest opinion was appreciated and I'll just keep right on doing what I do. Maybe I'll see ya around -- I'll be here!<br />

<dd>If you were looking for anonymity, suggest you're long past the time your top-page notice should have been removed. Changing your handle moves your edits, you can even have your anom (IP) edits combined by a sysop, but mirrors will still keep pages for a long while. So if you don't want it found on google, keeping your top post notice is counter-productive! Stop shooting your own foot! &lt;g&gt; Best wishes // <b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fra</a></b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabartus_c63e.html" title="User talk:Fabartus"><font color="green">nkB</font></a> 03:38, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the advice. Fortunately I'm not looking for perfect or instantaneous anonymity. As for the user name change notice -- I thought I deleted that 12 days ago on July 17 -- where are you seeing it? --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.
