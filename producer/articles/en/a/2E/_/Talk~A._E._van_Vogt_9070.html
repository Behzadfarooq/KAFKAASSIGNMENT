<p>Isn't the Nexialist in The Voyage of the Space Beagle the inspiration for Spock on Star Trek? Shouldn't this be mentioned? Also, it's mentioned that several sci-fi films have used the idea of the carnivorous alien stalking the crew of the space ship; a mention of the names of these movies would allow searches on the movie title to find the van Vogt article, which would be good for van Vogt's fame. -- 66.239.48.29</p>
<dl>
<dd>Elliot Grosvenor, the Nexialist in the <i>Space Beagle</i>, is very unlike Spock. He is not particularly logical, relying rather on a very wide ranging scientific knowledge gained by using advanced learning techniques including hypnotism. He also has little compunction in using his techniques to defend himself against the internal politics of the ship as much as against external threats, and, in the end, he uses those same techniques to manipulate the crew of the <i>Space Beagle</i> into doing what he thinks is the right thing (and of course since he is the hero, it is the right thing). He knows something about everything, especially human motivation and emotions, a matter on which Spock seems happy to admit ignorance. I really don't think that they have much in common. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a></dd>

<dd>Which is very interesting and accurate, but doesn't seem to address the question of whether Grosvenor was the inspiration for the character of Spock.

<p>I question the characterization of General Semantics presented here, especially in characterizing it as "fuzzy logic." Seems to me GS is fundamentally about avoiding bewitchment by language, as in confusing the map with the territory, and the person today with the person tomorrow. The null-A angle is a rejection of two-valued logic, which differs significantly from fuzzy logic. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Nicoll_2923.html" title="User:Alan Nicoll">Alan Nicoll</a> 22:48, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I removed some of the "criticism" of Vogt's writings but I see Antaeus Feldspar restored them.... anyone else want to chime in about this? I feel like given the genre and the period, it's a bit pedantic to list various scientific "mistakes" in old sci-fi novels. These stories are fanciful by nature, and it's a bit like saying that <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_and_the_Great_Glass_Elevator_e56f.html" title="Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator">Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator</a> violates the laws of physics, or that <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teletubbies.html" title="Teletubbies">Teletubbies</a> have no valid physiological explanation for their abdominal television implants. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 17:54, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd suggest that some note of the issues might be in order, but not to the extent that it currently is. Perhaps simply a note to the effect "As with many authors of the period, Van Vogt's works were meant to entertain and not educate. To that end, he permitted scientific errors to enter his stories when they would help his story."<a href="../../../s/h/s/User%7EShsilver_5f57.html" title="User:Shsilver">Shsilver</a> 18:32, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>These are fairly large mistakes, however, and I don't think the genre and the period account entirely for that. I mean, can you honestly say that the two "Charlie" books or the <i>Teletubbies</i> actually fall into the same genre as van Vogt's science fiction and establish the standard by which they should all be judged? I fully support putting in notes to explain that perhaps those technical errors should be judged by a different standard due to the genre and period, but I can't support just removing them entirely and therefore making the choice <i>for</i> the reader that they're insignificant. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:54, 11 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Name me any science fiction book ever written (but especially in the 1940s-1960s) and one can pick out major glaring scientific flaws. Does this mean one should? Probably not. Most science fiction authors of his era do not have such a section in their article, and it seems rather unfair to single out Vogt. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 19:19, 11 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Whether it was fair or not (opinions differ), Knight's criticism of van Vogt's science and style was highly visible and influential at the time, so it's certainly worth mentioning, e.g., his later characterization of the magazine version of _The Worlds of Null-A_ as a <a href="http://vanvogt.www4.mmedia.is/damon.htm" class="external text" title="http://vanvogt.www4.mmedia.is/damon.htm" rel="nofollow">pretentious, foolish, wildly complicated and self-contradictory magazine serial</a>. <a href="../../../a/h/a/User%7EAhasuerus_97b5.html" title="User:Ahasuerus">Ahasuerus</a> 04:43, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also consider that while no one is likely to look on the "Charlie" books or the Teletubbies or most of the science fiction books you are counting as comparable as anything but entertainment, van Vogt gets credited for popularizing <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-Aristotelian_logic_42c3.html" title="Non-Aristotelian logic">Non-Aristotelian logic</a> through his writing (the famous "null-A" he wrote so much about).

<p>How about page 626 of "The S.F. Encycl." by Peter Nicholls (the 1979 edition), which, in the article on van Vogt states: "It was during these years that AEVV, along with Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein, and to a lesser extent Theodore Sturgeon, seemed nearly alone to create, by writing what Campbell wanted to publish, the first genuinely successful period of American sf...." Reader polls and surveys at the time also almost always put AEVV near the top. <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 16:10, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The reason I tagged it is because the phrasing seemed uncomfortably like what I'd read in the typical band-vanity page ("Their many fans would agree that Retching Lemur is one of the best bands of all time!") Of course I <i>know</i> that van Vogt did indeed have a quite significant following -- but any claim made for <i>how</i> significant, such as him being in the top three of the time, really should be backed up with more than the conditional that's there now about who fans "would have named".

<dd>Sure, we can do that.

<p>I've taken out the line, "It was the cover story of the issue of <i>Astounding</i> which ushered in the Golden Age of science fiction. " For one, this is unsourced, and a pretty grand claim. For two, it's unclear what's doing in the ushering, the story, the cover, or the issue. Wasn't germane to the subject at hand. -- <font face="georgia, times, times roman" color="#990000" size="-3"><a href="../../../p/l/e/User%7EPleather_9646.html" title="User:Pleather">P L E A T H E R</a></font> <font face="arial, helvetica" size="1"><sub><a href="../../../p/l/e/User_talk%7EPleather_f2a9.html" title="User talk:Pleather">talk</a></sub></font> 00:30, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Never thought that the oft repeated assertion needed a cite, having read versions of the story for decades on end, but since such memories do have a tendency to fade, the need for a cite is not in doubt. The other issue by Pleather, about clarifying what was being ushered in, still needs to be better addressed. The minor modification doesn't seem to do much toward that end, so a bit more editing is needed. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 03:24, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The July 1939 magazine issue ushered in the Golden Age. The reason for the claim is that both Van Vogt and Asimov had their first published stories in this issue (and Van Vogt's was indeed the <a href="http://members.aol.com/sjhkalb/gladney/ast3907.jpg" class="external text" title="http://members.aol.com/sjhkalb/gladney/ast3907.jpg" rel="nofollow">cover story</a>). Heinlein's first story was published in the next issue, August 1939, Sturgeon shortly afterwards, and things took off from there. A cite confirming this should be easy to find. As to being germane, van Vogt is one of the authors whose work is characteristic of the Golden Age, so of course it's germane. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a> | <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerek_Ross_6827.html" title="User talk:Derek Ross">Talk</a> 04:11, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please add the following: Although Van Vogt has a gigantic reputation as an sf writer, it seems that he has been allowed to get away with what I would call "the Queen's award for plagiarism" - namely his story EMPIRE OF THE ATOM which was shamelessly derived from I, CLAUDIUS by Robert Graves.</p>

<p>Almost every instance of Van Vogt's name I've seen (I have most of his books, and many magazines with his works in them) has both V's capitalized.

<dd>Well, on page 627 of the Nicholls "The Science Fiction Encyclopedia", the article about Van Vogh, which calls him AEVV throughout, has a sentence that starts: "In his autobiographical <i>Reflections of A.E. van Vogh</i> (1975), AEVV uses the term...." The article on E. Mayne Hulls says she was married to A.E. van Vogh. Later in the same article there is a reference to Van Vogh. The article on John Campbell refers to A.E. van Vogh. What Nicholls is apparently doing is referring to the full name with a small "v" and to the last name alone (Van Vogh) with a capital "V". This makes sense, as most writing about Charles deGaulle uses a small "d" for his full name but a capital "D" when the name stands alone, as in "Churchill had lunch with DeGaulle and gave him a cigar." So, I think, the article's name should be left as it is. <a href="../../../h/a/y/User%7EHayford_Peirce_5729.html" title="User:Hayford Peirce">Hayford Peirce</a> 22:26, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Probably considered Original Research, but in dealing with his widow for a book recently, she was always van Vogt, including on the contracts. I'd say A.E. van Vogt is correct. <a href="../../../s/h/s/User%7EShsilver_5f57.html" title="User:Shsilver">Shsilver</a> 01:30, 4 February 2007 (UTC)
