<p>You're doing an excellent work with spam fighting. However, I have to say that you've been anything but inactive. You may need a new template for your user page. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 04:53, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I put that up there because I'm <i>supposed to be inactive</i> and focus on catching up on some work. I suppose it's more a message to me than to the outside world. I actually did a <i>little</i> better (a very relative term in my case) in the last 36 hours.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Besides I find the ways the more competent "black hat" SEO folks work sort of fascinating. Probably we've really not spotted the really good ones yet. I know some black hats follow <a href="../../../w/p/s/WT%7EWPSPAM_5ffe.html" title="WT:WPSPAM">WT:WPSPAM</a> and all our discussions with a degree of bemusement. If there were 53 weeks in a year, I'd love to spend a week with the anti-spam unit at Google -- they've probably got some good insights.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for looking into this. I just left a note on the Peru project page about this AfD.

<p>Can you take a look at this? I am very concerned about this AfD -- I think it's a mistake to proceed now and is only going to further aggravate folks after the whole MATSES AfD contretemps. You're a neutral, third party admin -- can you maybe step in as a grown-up and help us squabbling kids out? I'm concerned I'm no longer totally objective and even more concerned that some of the other parties may be even less objective.

<dl>
<dd>There doesn't appear to be anything wrong with the AfD nomination. Articles can be proposed for deletion at any time. There is no <i>safe</i> time for an article; it is either about a notable subject and has appropriate reliable sources that conforms to policies and guidelines or it doesn't. There's no requirement for a speedy keep, so the only way to close it early would be to get the nominator to withdraw it. <a href="../../../%28/a/e/User_talk%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User talk:(aeropagitica)">(aeropagitica)</a> 16:48, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>These edits are not actually coming from accounts, they are coming from anonymous IPs. Though it is unlikely that these IPs are shared, I feel uncomfortable blocking an IP that has just made 2 edits. But if he comes back, I will definitely block it. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcademic_Challenger_1bc6.html" title="User:Academic Challenger">Academic Challenger</a> 01:55, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Try clicking on the Whois link at the bottom of an IP user's talk page -- that tells you the ISP. Then click on the traceroute link. The traceroute results show the route a packet takes to the customer; while you can't decode all the results, you can usually get useful info you can interpret:

<li>hop 10 is the last hop with an identifiable location: gbr1-p70.dlstx.ip.att.net. -- I figure that's Dallas, TX. The subsequent hops don't have geographic locations, but you can figure this person is in the Dallas region.</li>
<li>hop14 shows: 24-116-127-234.cpe.cableone.net. A quick trip to the cableone.net web site, <a href="http://www.cableone.net/about/locations.asp?STATE=TX" class="external free" title="http://www.cableone.net/about/locations.asp?STATE=TX" rel="nofollow">http://www.cableone.net/about/locations.asp?STATE=TX</a>, shows the company's Texas locations</li>

<li>Traceroute hop 13 was as far as the pings got before hitting a firewall -- probably the user's. "p9-0.dsl-06.dllstx.verizon-gni.net." can be interpreted to mean a DSL user in Verizon's Dallas region</li>
<li>Whois confirms it's a Verizon customer.</li>
<li>DSL accounts, like cable modem accounts, are almost never shared.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Traceroute and whois data requires some interpretation and common sense. For instance, some Verizon IP addresses are still registered to GTE, Nynex or Bell Atlantic, 3 predecessor companies merged to form Verizon years ago. Another example: frequently the last 5 to 10 traceroute hops for some ISPs pass through hops with gobbledy-gook nomenclature you can't get a location out of. Some companies may mean a very narrow area in Dallas proper when they use dlstx; others may mean Texas + surrounding states. I've never seen that there's any standard nomenclature ISPs use when responding to traceroute pings; one may use dlstx, another rcntx (Richardson, a suburb), another dfw-1, still another wyqz for the same town. Just the same, common sense will get you far enough to figure out what you need to know.</dd>

<dd>We already know this is almost certainly the webmaster for searchtexoma.com. Since their web site says they're based in <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denison%2C_Texas_10a5.html" title="Denison, Texas">Denison, Texas</a>, about 65 miles northeast of Dallas, these results are no surprise. Had you seen, however, that the new IP address was in Singapore, or even just Atlanta, you'd want to check out the possibility it was an open proxy using a tool such as <a href="http://www.completewhois.com/cgi-bin/rbl_lookup.cgi?query=127.0.0.1&amp;display=webtable" class="external text" title="http://www.completewhois.com/cgi-bin/rbl_lookup.cgi?query=127.0.0.1&amp;display=webtable" rel="nofollow">Completewhois</a>.

<dd>Thanks for pointing this out. This person is very troubled by my user page (I'm on an intermittent Wikibreak -- I come and go; that user happened to get me in a "here" phase instead of an "away" phase). Perhaps it's just one more way to criticize me. In any event, I appreciate your help in dealing with the person. I'm running out of ways to reword my earlier responses to address his subsequent repetitions of the same complaints and attacks. I find his theft of copyright accusation bizarre; anyone can compare those pages and see there's obviously no violation. Likewise, the furor over as-yet unnamed Texas towns (other than Quanah) I added that are supposed to be hundreds of miles from the Red River. His desperation to get a link searchtexoma.com is a commentary on the value search engines give it.</dd>

<dd>Just a quick note to say I thought your earlier efforts on this article were first-rate, and the problems lie with the WP:OFFICE process. It's a shame when a lot of hard work like yours goes away because of poorly defined policy and procedure. I'm participating in a discussion about this on the mailing list. The work you did helped a lot with the current version. Thanks for all your efforts! <a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJokestress_f864.html" title="User:Jokestress">Jokestress</a> 04:43, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for your kind comment -- I put a lot of work into fixing the problem. Naturally, I was initially put out with what happened, but when I reflect on the whole OFFICE process, I think it could be much worse -- see the comment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Office_Actions&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95021872" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Office_Actions&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=95021872" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> I wrote earlier at <a href="../../../o/f/f/WT%7EOFFICE_4a9a.html" title="WT:OFFICE">WT:OFFICE</a>. As well, read the two Danny e-mails I link to in my comment. Also, the article that was stubbed was not the article I had written -- see the chronology at <a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._Draft_Articles_7254.html" title="User:A. B./Draft Articles">User:A.

<dd>Hi A. B. - I also want to add that I really appreciate all the hard work you put in. I did read every one of your posts, which helped me a lot in creating a proposed article. I think you would enjoy reading the original version <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APacific_Western_University%2FProposed&amp;diff=94564052&amp;oldid=94534953" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APacific_Western_University%2FProposed&amp;diff=94564052&amp;oldid=94534953" rel="nofollow">here</a>. As I learned the hard way, these WP:OFFICE articles are tough nuts to crack. A key is to try to figure out why the article is on WP:OFFICE watch. I don't think the Foundation can give a reason or even respond to any inquiries because of legal liability, which means the rest of us are left guessing how to fix the problem. I think PWU was there because the cites for calling them unaccrediated were not authoritative enough. We solved that problem by using California's BPPVE to state that <i>PWU has approval to operate from the State of California through the California Department of Consumer Affairs, Bureau of Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education (BPPVE) as a California BPPVE Approved Institutions - Degree.[7] However, approval by the BPPVE is not the same as accreditation.[8] In order for a California institution to become accredited, they first must have California state approval,[8] which Pacific Western University does not.</i> I do have an idea of what you went through because I went through something similar myself. About 2/3 of my work on the PWU article were politely attacked by a sock puppet, politely disparaged by others, and then improperly closed out. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_December_16#Category:California_BPPVE_Approved_Institutions_-_Degree" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_December_16#Category:California_BPPVE_Approved_Institutions_-_Degree" rel="nofollow">Categories</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_Pacific_Western_University_people" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_Pacific_Western_University_people" rel="nofollow">List of PWU people</a>. (You really would have appreciated my List of Pacific Western University people.) In the end, my goal is to get PWU off the WP:OFFICE watch and I think PWU is in condition to have that happen. The rest of the happenings related to PWU really do not matter.</dd>

<dd>Yeah, AIV is more for the rapid movers. I can't speak for the other admins who maintiain it, but I'm to incompetent with the specifics of spam and open proxy policy to know what to do. By all means, though, continue to report the rapid-moving spammers who have gotten appropriate warnings, etc. as outlined on AIV. We'll block the stuff where a quick response is required. It sounds like you've covered all the bases with this case.

<p>I have checked through and blocked the first batch of open proxies. The vast majority were still open proxies and were blocked; a few were on less static IPs or otherwise no longer open.

<dd>Thank you:
<ul>
<li>For doing this.</li>
<li>For the feedback</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I wondered whether perhaps I would just be considered a pest for dumping that many IPs on the list.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It was a lot of work to put this together and I'm glad to know it was worth it. I used a combination of Completewhois and web searches on the IP numbers. I wanted -- within my limited knowledge of the topic -- to "pre-digest" as much of the data as possible to avoid false positives.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think what triggered it was stumbling across the <a href="../../../j/o/h/Talk%7EJohn_Lott_%28Econometricist%29_f494.html" title="Talk:John Lott (Econometricist)">John Lott (Econometricist) talk page</a> while tracking a spammer IP's "contributions". I saw the havoc OPs were wreaking on that page (see the page's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:John_Lott_%28Econometricist%29&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:John_Lott_%28Econometricist%29&amp;limit=500&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">history</a>):
<ul>
<li>Nobody, including admins, were really doing anything about it</li>
<li>When I <a href="../../../j/o/h/Talk%7EJohn_Lott_%28Econometricist%29_f494.html#Why_isn.27t_this_page_semi-protected.3F.3F" title="Talk:John Lott (Econometricist)">raised the question</a> why not? all I got was sort of this well-meaning, bullshit answer about how everything was under control: "Every time it happens it is quickly reverted, and the offending open proxy is reported and blocked indef." (By the way, I am not really criticizing that admin -- he's a good guy. I suppose I'm more critical of Wikipedia's strong values about AGF spreading inappropriately to our thinking about how well things are being handled. Our AGF policy is about other <i>editors</i>, not the effectiveness of our <i>systems</i>.).By now, I had already spot-checked some IPs and knew what he was saying was not the case.</li>
<li>I suppose if I have a skill on Wikipedia, it's digging. I should have been a terrier. After the above, I just started working through the list of vandals to compile a <a href="../../../j/o/h/Talk%7EJohn_Lott_%28Econometricist%29_f494.html#Only_25_out_of_94_open_proxies_hitting_NPOV_section_were_ever_blocked_indefinitely" title="Talk:John Lott (Econometricist)">summary</a> showing the real state of affairs.</li>
<li>As I researched that list, I became increasingly aware of just how much other damage was being done elsewhwere by people using these proxies (probably by many others besides the John Lott vandal).</li>
<li>That spurred me to go through my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:A._B./Sandbox&amp;oldid=93959013" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:A._B./Sandbox&amp;oldid=93959013" rel="nofollow">list of spammer IPs that I've warned</a> to see how many of them were really open proxies.</li>
<li>Finally, by now thoroughly concerned by what I'd seen, I just pulled a list of open proxies off the web and as time allowed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:A._B./Sandbox4&amp;oldid=94469154" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:A._B./Sandbox4&amp;oldid=94469154" rel="nofollow">worked through them</a> to see which had made edits to Wikipedia. It helps that I was downright curious -- and that I had a stack of paperwork from the office that I really was trying to put off.</li>

<dd>I did not list those IP addresses at WP:OP as some sort of spammer-tracking exercise. There are multiple lists for spammers already in existence. There's a long list programmed into <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowbot_64a7.html" title="User:Shadowbot">Shadowbot</a>. The really hard-core cases go to the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Spam_blacklist" class="extiw" title="m:Spam_blacklist">meta blacklist</a>. I have multiple user pages of my own where I track various spammers. Finally, the archives of <a href="../../../w/p/s/WT%7EWPSPAM_5ffe.html" title="WT:WPSPAM">WT:WPSPAM</a> are full of them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The IP addresses I listed at <a href="../../../o/p/_/WP%7EOP_2cfb.html" title="WP:OP">WP:OP</a> I had all checked first using Completewhois, which indicated they were all blacklisted by one or more major list. I should add that looked at probably five times as many other problematic IPs that I did not list. I thought problematic behavior on Wikipedia plus blacklisting on one of the major lists Completewhois reports should constitute probable cause for investigating further at <a href="../../../o/p/_/WP%7EOP_2cfb.html" title="WP:OP">WP:OP</a>. Somehow, I thought I was investing a many hours in doing a good thing.

<dd>That's interesting. I thought WP:OP's charter was to block those too; why on earth wouldn't Wikipedia want to block those IPs? What good edits do we think we're going to get out of them? Will they send us an occasional good-bot once in a while? I doubt it. Those are compromised computers even if they're not technically "open proxies". I'd rather see us block those addresses than some of the national firewalls in the Middle East or the proxy servers like Ultrareach in China that we've blocked before. There really are some good people stuck in some tough places trying to use those systems to get to the outside world.</dd>

<dd>Unfortunately compromised computer&#160;!= open proxy. There's no way to tell a computer is compromised externally without a) pwning the botnet, b) monitoring its behaviour or c) checking various blacklists. Compromised computers can take their orders via IRC, or a simple GET of a webpage every half hour or so. They do not need to have an open port to accept orders. As far as I'm concerned, <a href="../../../o/p/_/WP%7EOP_2cfb.html" title="WP:OP">WP:OP</a> only looks for open proxies. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMER-C_4926.html" title="User:MER-C">MER-C</a> 08:49, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It appears that the two may be competitors. I restored the first link today and, sure enough, Pebs96 removed it. You're a great investigator of link spam type abuse, so could I ask a favor of you and have you investigate it a little for me?

<dd>You agree to license what you write provided that you are given credit. The credit is given in the edit history for anyone to see. Metros, it is still her work. She maintains copyright but she license it to Wikipedia under a license giving Wikipedia the right to freely distribute it <b>including altered versions</b> as long as proper credit is given (on the history page) and a copy of the original license is included. If you look at any random source file from any randopm GPL project you will see a) a copy of the license terms and 2) proper credit given to those who contributed. Unfortunately Wikipedia does a very poor job of telling people what the GFDL is so they think it means that anything you write or upload is put in the public domain for anyone to (ab)use. With regard to the link I already explained to pebs earlier that the link is a bad idea. Not only did it lead to this whole drama, it is also waaaayyyy too easy for trolls to point fingers and scream original research if there is such a link. Citing oneself is asking for trouble. Pebs it is in your own best interest to remove the link.

<p>Hrm -- I haven't looked things over <i>too too</i> closely, but it appears they were mainly targeting <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Mary_Washington_4031.html" title="University of Mary Washington">University of Mary Washington</a> and the userpages of those who got in their way. I've re-protected UMW's article; have any other pages been targeted recently, that you can recall? Beyond that, feel free to let me know if you need any further assistance with this one. <a href="../../../l/u/n/User%7ELuna_Santin_1cab.html" title="User:Luna Santin">Luna Santin</a> 11:44, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>middlesell.com was just <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spam_blacklist&amp;curid=13107&amp;diff=502612&amp;oldid=502068" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spam_blacklist&amp;curid=13107&amp;diff=502612&amp;oldid=502068" rel="nofollow">added</a> to the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Spam_blacklist" class="extiw" title="m:Talk:Spam_blacklist">global spam blacklist</a> -- this may help. Normally blacklisting is reserved for widespread spamming but I think the meta admins saw just how much disruption this one spammer was causing in addition to adding his one link. I think his use of multiple accounts and IP addresses was also a factor.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the offer. I think the previously targetted user pages such as mine have all been semi-protected. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.
