<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._E._Backus_14bb.html" title="Edit section: Art">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Art</span></h2>
<p>Beanie was mostly self taught, although he did enjoy two summer stints at the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parsons_School_of_Design_df43.html" title="Parsons School of Design">Parsons School of Design</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. At Parsons he learned the academic principles of symmetry and design that he had previously explored instinctually. Backus always earned his living thorough his artistic talent, first as a commercial artist painting signs, billboards and theater marquees, and later encouraged by Dorothy Binney Putnam his first true patron, pursuing his landscape paintings as a full-time occupation. He painted vivid <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a> landscapes, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>'s kitsch images of the ubiquitous hibiscus and other tropical flowers, the beautiful Florida sunset, beach and river scenes and the spectacular vistas of the <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everglades.html" title="Everglades">Everglades</a>.</p>
<p>Much like a visual journal of his travels, Backus recorded his journeys through his artwork. During WWII, while in the Navy aboard the <a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Hermitage_7be1.html" title="USS Hermitage">USS Hermitage</a>, he painted in both watercolor and oils scenes of the South Pacific, the California coast and of the European ports he visited. Later in his life, he created a series of scenes of the Caribbean focusing on the Bahamas, Haiti and more prolifically of his second home in Jamaica. Backus spent his entire life studying his subjects and it is because of this passion for wildlife and plants combined with his natural talents that he was able to produce such accurate and captivating paintings.</p>
<p>Many of Backus' earlier paintings dating from the 1930's to the late 1960's are categorized as being more <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impressionistic.html" title="Impressionistic">impressionistic</a> than most of his later works, and were often done with a palette knife. Paint was applied to the canvas or board with impetuous and generous strokes. The palette knife was used deftly and with great courage. The juxtaposition of color next to color created a new and different reality for the viewer. Other than the early 20th century vacationing artists such as <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winslow_Homer_4d25.html" title="Winslow Homer">Winslow Homer</a> or the <a href="../../../h/u/d/Hudson_River_School_9692.html" title="Hudson River School">Hudson River School</a> icon Herman Herzog, Backus was the first artist to truly see the subtle beauty of Florida and to attempt to capture it on canvas. Backus was the seminal Florida landscape painter. All those who followed were in someway trying to emulate his work.</p>
<p>As Backus' career progressed, his style evolved to a more refined style that relied more heavily on the brush rather than the palette knife. He spent more time on his later, more romanticized paintings; adding more details and increasingly painting commission pieces for patrons eager to own a Backus original for themselves.</p>
<p>Backus was also credited with teaching art to a wide range of students. No one truly knows how many artists actually studied with Backus or were merely mentored and inspired by him. Estimates are in the hundreds. Backus' protegees are referred to as the Indian River School of artists. A great deal of misinformation circulates as to Backus' role in the creation of the outsider art, a phenomenon referred to as the <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_highwaymen.html" title="Florida highwaymen">Florida highwaymen</a>. To be sure, Alfred Hair, the the driving force behind the loosely allied group of African-American artists and the inspiration to create hastily rendered images of a fantasized Florida was definitely an actual student of Backus. The remaining members of the approximately 26 African-American landscape painters painting in and around <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Pierce%2C_Florida_a8b6.html" title="Fort Pierce, Florida">Fort Pierce, Florida</a>, were certainly inspired by Backus success but they were not actual students of Backus. The Highwaymen directly copied Backus' paintings with varying degrees of success; selling their paintings door to door and along the roadside at blue-collar prices.</p>

<p>Beanie was known for always having music playing in his home. He often had his <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_player.html" title="Record player">record player</a> playing, and some times even had <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">Jazz</a> musicians jamming.

They were known to be good friends and both had a passion for the youth of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Pierce%2C_Florida_a8b6.html" title="Fort Pierce, Florida">Fort Pierce, Florida</a>. Beanie was also kept company with aspiring young artists including Alfred Hair. Backus was known to keep company with people of all walks of life and all races. His house was often the half-way house for Haitians just off of the boat, friends down on their luck, or even just folks getting off of the bus from out of state. He liked to keep a lively conversation and offten quoted fellow artist Waldo Sexton "I'd rather be a liar than a bore".</p>
