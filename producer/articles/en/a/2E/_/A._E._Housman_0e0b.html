<p>Housman was born in Fockbury, <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worcestershire.html" title="Worcestershire">Worcestershire</a>, the eldest of seven children of a <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solicitor.html" title="Solicitor">country solicitor</a>. His brother <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurence_Housman_69fc.html" title="Laurence Housman">Laurence Housman</a> and sister Clemence Housman also became writers.</p>
<p>Housman was educated first at <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_Edward%27s_School_5790.html" title="King Edward's School">King Edward's School</a>, then <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bromsgrove_School_28ce.html" title="Bromsgrove School">Bromsgrove School</a>, where he acquired a strong academic grounding and won prizes for his poetry. In 1877 he won an open scholarship to <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_John%27s_College%2C_Oxford_9c84.html" title="St John's College, Oxford">St John's College, Oxford</a>, where he studied classics. He was a brilliant student, gaining first class honours in classical moderations, but a withdrawn person whose only friends were his roommates Moses Jackson and A. W. Pollard. Housman fell in love with the handsome, athletic Jackson who, being heterosexual, rejected him, though the two remained friends. This experience, reflected in some of his poems, may be an explanation of Housman's unexpected failure in his final exams (the "Greats") in 1881. Housman took this failure very seriously but managed to take a pass degree the next year, after a brief period of teaching in <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bromsgrove_School_28ce.html" title="Bromsgrove School">Bromsgrove School</a>.</p>
<p>After graduating, Jackson got a job as a <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_examiner.html" title="Patent examiner">clerk</a> in the <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_Office_b07e.html" title="Patent Office">Patent Office</a> in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> and arranged a job there for Housman as well. They shared an apartment with Jackson's brother Adalbert until 1885 when Housman moved in to lodgings of his own. Moses Jackson married and moved to <a href="../../../c/e/y/Ceylon.html" title="Ceylon">Ceylon</a> in 1887 and Adalbert Jackson died in 1892. Housman continued pursuing classical studies independently and published scholarly articles on such authors as <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horace.html" title="Horace">Horace</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Propertius.html" title="Propertius">Propertius</a>, <a href="../../../o/v/i/Ovid.html" title="Ovid">Ovid</a>, <a href="../../../a/e/s/Aeschylus.html" title="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>, <a href="../../../e/u/r/Euripides.html" title="Euripides">Euripides</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophocles.html" title="Sophocles">Sophocles</a>. He gradually acquired such a high reputation that in 1892 he was offered the professorship of Latin at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_College_London_3428.html" title="University College London">University College London</a>, which he accepted.</p>
<p>Although Housman's sphere of responsibilities as professor included both <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a>, he put most of his energy into the study of Latin classics. His reputation in this field grew steadily, and in 1911 he took the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_Professorship_of_Latin_17ad.html" title="Kennedy Professorship of Latin">Kennedy Professorship of Latin</a> at <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_College%2C_Cambridge_7df5.html" title="Trinity College, Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, where he remained for the rest of his life. It was unusual at the time for an <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oxford_2ca4.html" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a> man such as Housman to be hired at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cambridge_5f20.html" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. During 1903–1930, he published his critical edition of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Manilius_07e4.html" title="Marcus Manilius">Manilius's</a> <i>Astronomicon</i> in five volumes. He also edited works of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satires_of_Juvenal_2a17.html" title="Satires of Juvenal">Juvenal</a> (1905) and <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucan_%28poet%29.html" title="Lucan (poet)">Lucan</a> (1926). Many colleagues were afraid of his scathing critical attacks on those whom he found guilty of unscholarly sloppiness. To his students he appeared as a severe, reticent, remote authority. The only pleasures he allowed himself in his spare time were those of <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gastronomy.html" title="Gastronomy">gastronomy</a> which he also practised on frequent visits to France and Italy.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Housman always found his true vocation in classical studies and treated poetry as a secondary activity. He never spoke about his poetry in public until 1933 when he gave a lecture, "The Name and Nature of Poetry", in which he argued that poetry should appeal to emotions rather than intellect. He died two years later in Cambridge. His ashes are buried near St Laurence's Church, <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludlow.html" title="Ludlow">Ludlow</a>, Shropshire.</p>

<p>During his years in London, A E Housman completed his cycle of 63 poems, <i><a href="../../../a/_/s/A_Shropshire_Lad_f7c7.html" title="A Shropshire Lad">A Shropshire Lad</a>.</i> After several publishers had turned it down, he published it at his own expense in 1896, much to the surprise of his colleagues and students. At first the book sold slowly, but Housman's nostalgic depiction of brave English soldiers struck a chord with English readers and his poems became a lasting success. Later, <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> had a further increasing effect on their popularity. Several composers, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Somervell_008a.html" title="Arthur Somervell">Arthur Somervell</a> first, found inspiration in the seeming folksong-like simplicity of the poems. The most famous musical settings are by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Butterworth_e40d.html" title="George Butterworth">George Butterworth</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Vaughan_Williams_30b7.html" title="Ralph Vaughan Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a>, with others by <a href="../../../i/v/o/Ivor_Gurney_e3bd.html" title="Ivor Gurney">Ivor Gurney</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Ireland_%28composer%29_3137.html" title="John Ireland (composer)">John Ireland</a> and <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_John_Moeran_8ccf.html" title="Ernest John Moeran">Ernest John Moeran</a>.</p>
<p>Housman was surprised by the success of <i><a href="../../../a/_/s/A_Shropshire_Lad_f7c7.html" title="A Shropshire Lad">A Shropshire Lad</a></i> because it, like all his poetry, is imbued with a deep pessimism and an obsession with all-pervasive death, with no place for the consolations of religion. Set in a half-imaginative pastoral <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shropshire.html" title="Shropshire">Shropshire</a>, "the land of lost content" (in fact Housman wrote most of the poems before ever visiting the place), the poems explore themes of fleetingness of love and decay of youth in a spare, uncomplicated style which many critics of the time found out of date compared with the exuberance of some of his late Victorian contemporaries. Housman himself acknowledged the influence of the songs of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, the Scottish Border Ballads and <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinrich_Heine_eb51.html" title="Heinrich Heine">Heinrich Heine</a>, but specifically denied any influence of Greek and Latin classics in his poetry.</p>
<p>In the early 1920s, when Moses Jackson was dying in Canada, Housman wanted to assemble his best unpublished poems together so that Jackson could read them before his death. These later poems, most of them written before 1910, show a greater variety of subject and form than those in <i>A Shropshire Lad</i> but also a certain lack of the kind of consistency found in the earlier poems. He published them as his <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Poems_8b30.html" title="Last Poems">Last Poems</a> (1922) because he thought that his poetic inspiration was running out and that he would not publish any more poems in his lifetime. This proved true.</p>
<p>Housman's brother Laurence edited his posthumous poems which appeared in <i>More Poems</i> (1936) and <i>Complete Poems</i> (1939). In these poems, Housman appears more candid about his <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a> than in his lifetime, though the essay <i>De Amicitia</i>, published by Laurence Housman in 1967, is even more revealing. Housman also wrote a parodic <i>Fragment of a Greek Tragedy</i>, in English, and humorous poems published posthumously under the title <i>Unkind to Unicorns</i>.</p>
<p>One of Housman's most familiar poems is number XIII from <i>A Shropshire Lad</i>, untitled but often anthologized under the title "When I was one-and-twenty", taken from its first line. The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations includes no fewer than fourteen of its sixteen lines. Another well-known poem from the same volume is number XIX, "<a href="../../../t/o/_/To_An_Athlete_Dying_Young_9d26.html" title="To An Athlete Dying Young">To An Athlete Dying Young</a>", which contrasts death with fleeting beauty and physical prowess.</p>

<p>Housman's poetry ("There's this to say for life and breath, it gives a man a taste for death") supplies the title and is quoted in the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_O%27Donnell_2ca9.html" title="Peter O'Donnell">Peter O'Donnell</a> <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modesty_Blaise_82f2.html" title="Modesty Blaise">Modesty Blaise</a> thriller, <i><a href="../../../a/_/t/A_Taste_for_Death_%28Modesty_Blaise%29_eb3b.html" title="A Taste for Death (Modesty Blaise)">A Taste for Death</a></i>.</p>

<p>Housman is mentioned and quoted several times by <a href="../../../d/i/a/Diana_Gabaldon_9d7f.html" title="Diana Gabaldon">Diana Gabaldon</a> in her popular historical fiction series, starting with <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outlander.html" title="Outlander">Outlander</a>.</p>
<p>There is a reference to Housman in <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_McEwan_f326.html" title="Ian McEwan">Ian McEwan</a>'s novel <i><a href="../../../a/t/o/Atonement_%28novel%29.html" title="Atonement (novel)">Atonement</a></i>, when Robbie, an English literature graduate from Cambridge, glances at his copy of <i>Poems</i> and <i>A Shropshire lad</i>.</p>
<p>Another reference to Housman can be found in The Secret History by Donna Tartt. "With Rue My Heart is Laden" is recited by Henry during the burial ceremony of Bunny.</p>
<p>Meryl Streep, portraying Karen Blixen, quotes "To an Athlete Dying Young" at the gravesite of Denis Finch-Hatton in "Out of Africa" (1985).</p>
<p>Housman's poetry appealed to a significant number of British - and in particular English - composers in the first half of the 20th century. The national, pastoral and traditional elements of his style resonated with <a href="http://www.musicalresources.co.uk/WhatisEnglishPastoralMusic.php" class="external text" title="http://www.musicalresources.co.uk/WhatisEnglishPastoralMusic.php" rel="nofollow">similar trends in English music</a>. It is also suggested that the melancholy strain in the poems appealed to a generation of composers deeply influenced by the carnage of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">First World War</a>. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Butterworth_e40d.html" title="George Butterworth">George Butterworth</a>, <a href="../../../i/v/o/Ivor_Gurney_e3bd.html" title="Ivor Gurney">Ivor Gurney</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Ireland_6514.html" title="John Ireland">John Ireland</a>, C.W. Orr, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethel_Smyth_1981.html" title="Ethel Smyth">Ethel Smyth</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Somervell_008a.html" title="Arthur Somervell">Arthur Somervell</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Vaughan_Williams_30b7.html" title="Ralph Vaughan Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a> all wrote Housman settings. <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerald_Finzi_16f3.html" title="Gerald Finzi">Gerald Finzi</a> repeatedly began settings, though never finished any. Even composers not normally associated with the pastoral tradition, such as <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Bax_3446.html" title="Arnold Bax">Arnold Bax</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lennox_Berkeley_4303.html" title="Lennox Berkeley">Lennox Berkeley</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Bliss_1674.html" title="Arthur Bliss">Arthur Bliss</a>, were attracted to Housman's poetry.</p>
<p>While Housman's poetry had a marked impact on British music, it has not been limited in its appeal by time, place or style. The American composer <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Barber_c6ec.html" title="Samuel Barber">Samuel Barber</a> set <i>With rue my heart is laden</i>. The contemporary New Zealand composer <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Downes_e64d.html" title="David Downes">David Downes</a> includes a setting of <i>March</i> on his CD <i>The Rusted Wheel of Things</i>. And <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierre_Boulez_7c0e.html" title="Pierre Boulez">Pierre Boulez</a>'s work <i>Housman, qu'est-ce que c'est</i> is based on <i>What, still alive at twenty-two?</i></p>
