<p>An anon. contributor included the poem "To an Athlete Dying Young", and I just fixed the misformatting due to lack of Wiki experience.

<p>He seems to be generally known as A.E. Housman. My Penguin copy of his collected works refers to him nowhere by his full name (indeed I was unaware what it was).

<p>I know of a second parody of Houseman, one which has been quoted in several books of quotations, but cannot recall the author. As it follows both Housmans pre-occupations (or the popular belief of them) and style I feel it might be included; all is needed is the author. The piece (as memory serves) goes;</p>

<pre>
What, still alive at twenty-two,
A clean upstanding chap like you?
Sure, if your throat 'tis hard to slit,
Slit your girl's, and swing for it.
Like enough, you won't be glad,
When they come to hang you, lad:
But bacon's not the only thing
That's cured by hanging from a string.
So, when the spilt ink of the night
Spreads o'er the blotting pad of light,
Lads whose job is still to do
Shall whet their knives, and think of you.

<p>What on earth is Housman on about here:</p>
<pre>
Oh who is that young sinner with the handcuffs on his wrists?
And what has he been after that they groan and shake their fists?
And wherefore is he wearing such a conscience-stricken air?
Oh they're taking him to prison for the colour of his hair.
 
'Tis a shame to human nature, such a head of hair as his;
In the good old time 'twas hanging for the colour that it is;
Though hanging isn't bad enough and flaying would be fair
For the nameless and abominable colour of his hair.
 
Oh a deal of pains he's taken and a pretty price he's paid
To hide his poll or dye it of a mentionable shade;
But they've pulled the beggar's hat off for the world to see and stare,
And they're haling him to justice for the colour of his hair.
 
Now 'tis oakum for his fingers and the treadmill for his feet
And the quarry-gang on Portland in the cold and in the heat,
And between his spells of labour in the time he has to spare
He can curse the God that made him for the colour of his hair.
</pre>
<p>Is there something I should know about people sent to jail for their hair colour, or is this a veiled reference to gay men being sent to prison (<a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> etc.) --<a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlashme_49c3.html" title="User:Slashme">Slashme</a> 06:45, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is the latter. Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe quoted from this poem in the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> in 2005 in a legal case involving a same-sex couple <a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd060308/sswp-1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd060308/sswp-1.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, although they happened to be women in this case.

<p>No, it's not a veiled reference to sexual orientation; rather, it is explicit. AEH makes the point that sexual orientation is no more a matter of choice than hair colour, and therefore sexual acts between men are against the law. Whether he is right may be debated, but the current law holds that he is. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnWheater_e44f.html" title="User:JohnWheater">John Wheater</a> 21:08, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm new to this and don't know how to format for Wikipedia, but wanted to add that in the 1985 movie "Out of Africa", Karen Blixen/Isak Dinesen (Meryl Streep) read the poem To an Athlete Dying Young over the grave of Denys Finch Hatton (Robert Redford).</p>

<p>Why does David Downes have a different para to all the great composers listed in the music section? One for music, one for 'other': Either it's C20th music or it's not. It also seems an unbalanced amount of information for someone with no entry for themselves, when compared to the list of names prior. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob2000_843d.html" title="User:Rob2000">Rob2000</a> 09:55, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Whilst I am unfamiliar with Mr Downes, is it possible that he is not a composer in the <i>classical</i> style - and some individuals do not like their music tainted by those who work in the beat/popular field.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 10:10, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whoa there. The sub-title isn't <b>20th Century Music</b>. It's <b>20th Century British</b> music. The section is about the remarkable impact of Housman's poetry on composers of a particular place and time. Arguably, Housman was second only to Shakespeare in this respect. This is not to say there shouldn't also be a discussion of Housman settings from other places and/or times, such as the David Downes piece cited, or <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Barber_c6ec.html" title="Samuel Barber">Samuel Barber</a>'s <i>With rue my heart is laden</i>. If you know such repertoire, and better still can summarise and cite or link to articles on Housman's wider influence, then I'd strongly encourage you to improve an already good article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We might like to create a seperate page for repertoire lists, and keep this article for discussion of Housman's influence, and the reasons for his popularity with particular groups of composers. Also, it will help if any further comment on this topic is made on the assumption of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith" rel="nofollow">good faith</a>. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECountersubject_0a75.html" title="User:Countersubject">Countersubject</a> 11:53, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can see the point made by Rob2000, as subdivisions of a header they are unbalanced; one paragraph for a group of notable composers, one paragraph for one musician without a Wiki entry (though this in itself is no indication of &lt;lack of&gt; quality, it should be noted!). Perhaps the subheadings should be removed and placed within the text of each paragraph, and then be re-instated when the paragraphs are expanded and other examples given?<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 13:27, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Done. I've also added a couple of other examples, as part of a note on interest in the poetry from composers of other places and times.
