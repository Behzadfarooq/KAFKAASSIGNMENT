<p>Thank you for your recent comments on my page. A few responses:</p>

<ol>
<li>I do not mind if I am on your watchlist. Whenever I comment on a page it gets added to my watchlist, so I can see how that would happen to you. Futhermore, It is not unreasonable to keep an eye on odd people, like me.</li>
<li>Thank you for the complimentary remarks you made concerning my writing and conduct. It is gratifying to be appreciated. I am pleased that you find me to be a responsible and good editor, contrary to your original perceptions. Despite those perceptions, I have not considered you an enemy. I believed that you were acting in the best interests of wikipedia to the best of your ability. I only thought you were a bit intense in checking me and slow to believe me! But, though I had edited wikipedia for a few years, I had only really jumped in with both feet recently -- and made my own mistakes. So certainly I am not blameless in misunderstandings.</li>
<li>I am flattered that you feel I ought to be an admin, but I cannot see how I would add value that way. I do not think I can spend the time on such a job. I like article work.</li>
<li>Because I did not consider you to have done anything with malicious intent, I did not think I was justified in any hard feelings and I did not harbor any. But, just in case ... please know that if any forgiveness is needed, it is done and not only forgiven but forgotten. I sincerely have no negative memory.</li>
<li>I note that User:Andypandy.UK is still not an admin. He should be. Perhaps you can nominate. I would support.</li>
<li>You were traveling to find out about the mythical land of gna as I recall. How did that turn out?</li>

<p>Google results on Zorpia, show it to be a social networking site. You have to dig very hard to find the pages that relate them to selling pharmaceuticals!</p>
<p>Even searching for wikipedia+Phentermine on Google, and starting from item 700, returns many references to dodgy drug sites. Does that mean wikipedia is a drug spamming site?

<p>My original question of why such a dubious method was used has been avoided here. As to the question notability, I think this is being answered in other places well.

<p>Wikipedia has deleted Zorpia from their database. Wikipedia claims dat zorpia is some kinda drug related spam site which have got connections with pharmaceuticals. wikipedia even doubts the number of members zorpia houses. i have been a member of Zorpia.com since Oct 15, 2006 and they have really got these many members and its a genuine social networking website. how can u believe this? by joining zorpia and seeing it for ur self. All we know the reasons zorpia was got deleted off wikipedias database was due to lack of verifiable sources to assert its notability. i have got some sources for you and so please go through these sources and please make the other admins notifiable of these sources as well. Here are some sources that proves the notability of Zorpia:</p>

<p>I am a user of Zorpia. I have joined Zorpia for two years. I understand that you are on an emergency trip. Please read my comment while you have time. According to <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Zorpia_2dc1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Zorpia">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Zorpia</a>, Zorpia was deleted due to lack of verifiable sources, and the fact that it was on wikipedia blacklist. Some other Zorpia members have already requested a deletion review on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_review</a>; you can find some new verifiable sources there.</p>
<p>I do not understand why Zorpia is on wikipedia's blacklist at the first place. I am unable to find any log or request for zorpia to be added to the wikipedia. But I do see that you are against the removal of zorpia's blacklist entry here: <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Spam_blacklist/Archives/2007/02#Zorpia" class="external free" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Spam_blacklist/Archives/2007/02#Zorpia" rel="nofollow">http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Spam_blacklist/Archives/2007/02#Zorpia</a> Your very reason cited there was because zorpia has one single wikipedia spam article. And that article is exactly the entry you proposed to removed at the same time <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Zorpia_2dc1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Zorpia">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Zorpia</a>.</p>
<p>The information were put together, and presented to other wikipedia admins on the same page <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Zorpia_2dc1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Zorpia">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Zorpia</a>, supported by a google search result that is biased, starting on the 700th result. All these have unfortunately led to the blacklisting and deletion of zorpia.com. I do understand that you are just carrying out your responsibility on Wikipedia and that it has been a good faith attempt. But for the sake of wikipedia's accuracy, I wonder if there is any other information you need to reinstate zorpia on wikipedia?</p>

<dd>Dear A.B</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am writing with regards to your decision to delete the article about Zorpia from Wikipedia.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have been a member of Zorpia.com now for the last 2 or more years.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Zorpia is constantly updating its servers and testing many methods for user enjoyment and safety.</dd>
<dd>on my time on zorpia i have never seen any thing to do with selling drugs or anything of the sort.</dd>
<dd>Zorpia has over 5millions users I'm not saying that none of these users use drugs. drugs are everywhere.</dd>
<dd>And Knowing Zorpia and the way it works I'm sure if there was any hint of drug selling or anything of the sort it would have been stamped out the users banned and they're details handed over to the police of that persons area</dd>
<dd>I ask you to consider these facts that i have wrote before making your final decision. I'm also sure if you were to check with the VGT and The Australian federal police about reports made last summer they will confirm this as it is logged on they're data base.</dd>
<dd>Again the allegations of drug offences is no more then hateful rubbish if you condem zorpia with these alligations and ban them from your site then you should also ban myspace hi5 and other social networking websites because if there are drugs on zorpia im certain they are on the other sites too as many users have accounts on many sites.</dd>
<dd>It is unfair to use zorpia as a scapegoat for this problem and to make an example of them.</dd>
<dd>Are mysapce banned as 4 people have been killed from meeting people on there...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>thanks for your time</dd>
