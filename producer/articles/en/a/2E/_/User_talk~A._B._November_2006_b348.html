<p>Hi A.B., re your comment on the talk page, FYI, the normal practise if you agree with the prod is to use {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd-2_582b.html" title="Template:Prod-2">prod-2</a>}}. This helps administrators who ultimately have to decide whether to delete the article, know that at least two people concur. I hope I'm not teaching you to suck eggs or that there may have been another reason you didn't. Regards —&#160;<a href="../../../m/o/o/User_talk%7EMoondyne_51fd.html" title="User talk:Moondyne">Moondyne</a> 02:33, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for letting me know. I guess I'll just have to suck eggs for a while -- I never knew this.

<p>Hello A.B. I need some help dealing with wiki and I am unsure how to proceed, but reading your comments you seem to be a sympathetic type. Could I ask you some questions CONFIDENTIALLY? Anonypig, new Wiki member. --Anonypig 17:36, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe -- I'm pretty busy, both on and off Wikipedia. I looked at the <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Cox_f7ff.html" title="Jan Cox">Jan Cox</a> page and left a comment on the talk page. My main suggestion would be to really get familiar with Wikpedia policies and only add stuff that's totally neutral and verifiable. I also suggest putting your proposed text on the talk page first for a few days for others to look at for discussion first. As for text you want to alter or delete, I suggest posting that on the talk page for a few days first. My experience is that if you're editing a controversial article, you want to have absolutely "clean hands" per Wikipedia policies. You also want to bend over backwards to try for consensus, using the talk page. Even if all your stuff gets reversed, you've laid the ground work for making it stick. The more you stick to the rules, the more it challenges those you disagree with to either put up or shut up. Either they have to play by the same rules or appear biased. The nice thing is that this dynamic, if cultivated, ultimately forces both sides to hammer out a factual, NPOV, encyclopedic article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So what I've written here and on the article's talk page is probably pretty much what I'd write in private, but feel free to send me an e-mail if you think otherwise. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A. B.</a> 18:14, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your comments on my page. I understand what you are saying, but I'd just like to make it clear that I was not vandalising or putting unfair POV- I will try to find a citation to back up what I said.</p>
<p>Plooft</p>
<dl>
<dd>I was <i>not</i> trying to pick on you. It's just that article is a lightning rod for pro- and anti-Herbalife warfare. I've tried to get it as neutral as positive, sticking to very mainstream sources for any controversies -- SEC documents filed by the company itself, recent (last 5 years or so) articles from major newspapers, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's a ton of negative stuff out there from the 1990s but the company has had management changes at the top since then, so I'm not sure it should be included. Alternately, if it is included, it should not take up a large portion of the article and should be prefaced by something like "Under a previous management team, Herbalife was involved in multiple controversies ...."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are multiple anti-Herbalife websites. They are not appropriate references (unless they are hosting an article from a major newspaper that is otherwise unavailable elsewhere on the web). They do sometimes have links, however, to encyclopedia-quality newspaper articles that can be used. You'll notice that they don't have nearly as much stuff from recent years as from the 1990s.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The same is true of any pro-Herbalife web sites; they may point you to useful stuff, but they're not good sources themselves.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In reporting on Herbalife controversies, it's also important to be careful about who's engaging in what behaviors: is it Herbalife, a Herbalife distributor, or Herbalife distributors acting in concert with Herbalife? That's an important distinction and is central to Herbalife's West Virginia litigation. (Herbalife says the alleged misbehavior undertaken by its distributors was in violation of Herbalife policies; the state says they were in cahoots.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I'd keep the opening paragraph simple as it is now and save any controversies (or awards) for the body of the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ultimately, this is an encyclopedia, not a promote-Herbalife or debunk-Herbalife website.</dd>

<dd>Hey -- I Photoshopped it myself. Feel free to change the title and pass it on (it's not a template). You earned it. Hopefully I got the licensing on the image I created correct -- otherwise I'll get a user page warning and you'll have a NonStar! --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A.

<dd>Thanks for the spamstar! (It's even fun to say: SPAMSTAR!).</dd>
<dd>On the issue of licensing I think it might actually be problematic though: the original image contains cans of spam without them being the focus, while the spamstar uses only a can. I'm pretty sure that falls under "unlicensed derivative work" because the part being used is wholly of a copyrighted work, not just an original work that happens to have a minor element that is copyrighted (and this use doesn't fall under "fair use" doctrine). A solution would be, I think, to take those <i>lovely</i> and <i>delicious-looking</i> fanned-out slices of spam from the image and use them in the spamstar instead of the can. (And if you upload it over the current spamstar, it'll Just Work™.)</dd>

<p>A. B., thank you for your support in my RfA. In the end, it may have made all the difference. I know when I look at such things, that someone put the effort in to do their own research, and then actually changed their mind based on it, that means a lot more than supporting or opposing without explaining what made them make up their thoughts. I suspect it is the same for many others. I am proud that after looking at the complex situation you do believe I am worthy of the mop. Since we haven't really interacted much at all before, that makes the effort and opinion even more valuable.</p>
<p>As you may gather, my <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_AnonEMouse_4c06.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/AnonEMouse">Request for Adminship</a> is over, and successfully, not least due to your research and support. I hope to make it have been worth while. If there is any admin thing I can do to make your life easier, please ask, and I will do as best I can.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I will try to start the admin thing slowly, and not delete the Main Page for at least five minutes. If I mess up, make sure to come to my talk page and give me a good yell. Email also works, and is more private, but talk page will often get a more immediate response. If even that doesn't work, I am, of course, in <a href="../../../a/d/m/Category%7EAdministrators_open_to_recall_309a.html" title="Category:Administrators open to recall">Category:Administrators open to recall</a>, though I would hope you give the yell route a try first. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 23:30, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Glad to hear you've been working on the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appalachia.html" title="Appalachia">Appalachia</a> page! It's one I've long wanted to see improved, but felt it needed more than just copyediting but some larger structural reworking; thus I never got around to doing anything with it myself. Plus it is a large and sometimes complex topic, and I don't quite feel I understand the region well enough, though I'm getting a better handle on its geography and early history at least. I haven't looked at your edits closely yet, but will when I get the time, and perhaps try my hand at improving the page too.

<dd>Appalachia's about a lot more than coal, so I was sorry to only get as far as a paragraph about coal, then have to put aside more work. Feel free to take on timber, paper, manufacturing or especially tourism and real estate development. Also, while an earlier editor criticized the Appalachian Regional Commission for over-reliance on infrastructure investments, the fact is decent highway access has been an economic godsend to hundreds of formerly isolated communities, so transportation should get an important mention -- at least as big as the paragraph on coal. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A.

I made some major changes to clean up longstanding POV issues; I'm always a bit concerned when I go off and make big changes to big articles, so some peer review would be useful. Also the economy section needs further expansion -- I only got as far as cranking out one paragraph about coal after about a lot of research (on top of some pre-existing knowledge of coal mining in Appalachia). --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A.

<dd><i>"One idea I’ve had, that I’ve yet to try, is to remove all stuff like adsense ads during the time you are trying ot get the link to stay. I use wordpress, so whenever I want to temp disable adsense, I actually put it in a PHP wrapper in my template files, then comment it out with PHP comments. This prevents the ads from serving, but also removes all of the adsense code itself from the source, should the moderators look at that."</i></dd>

</dd>
<dd>Based on our research, this is not the same spammer but he is doing a <i>very</i> good job (better than "bill perry") of getting links into Wikipedia under the radar screen, usually as harder-to-spot footnotes rather than more obvious external links. He's also using other IP addresses, which some of us are still trying to figure out. The specific pages he links to on his <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scraper_site.html" title="Scraper site">"scraper sites"</a> may have no ads, but the other pages may be mostly ads with just a little article text (possibly copyright violations of others' work). He's also doing a good job of search engine postioning. He's registered <i>at least</i> <a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._To_do_list_fcd3.html#Links_to_investigate" title="User:A.

He may possibly be using open proxies to do all this, since that IP address is in Canada, but he's apparently based in Iowa. This has been going on for quite a while, but we only just learned about it in the last 24 hours.

<dd>This guy is so slick, I'll bet he never uses that IP address again and moves on to another. Trust me, he understands Wikipedia, the rules, the processes, posting and documenting better than I ever will. The only way we even spotted him is that I (one of the few active <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> volunteers) am interested in Appalachian geology and was intrigued by his post, which seems to fly in the face of everything heretofore understood about the Appalachians. He's been slipping in spam for many weeks and not getting spotted at all. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A. B.</a> 21:36, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The theory intrigued me as well, which is why I did the research to try to find the underlying source. I had been aware of the presence of some of the same rock types that are found in the Applachians in Europe and even Africa, but this was a newer twist. I must confess that most of my knowledge of geology is quite stale (I refuse to calculate how many years it has been since I studied geology as an undergraduate). In that regard, since you profess at least a passing passion for Appalachian geology and demonstrate a certain level of expertise, I will leave it to you to determine whether this "revolutionary new theory" should be incorporated in Wikipedia articles. I am unable to tell whether it is a fringe idea or one that is gaining acceptance; however, it does appear that there may have been at least one presentation of papers related to this. <a href="../../../t/l/m/User%7ETlmclain_4c55.html" title="User:Tlmclain">Tlmclain</a> | <a href="../../../t/l/m/User_talk%7ETlmclain_3ea7.html" title="User talk:Tlmclain">Talk</a> 21:47, 17 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Uhhh ... you flatter me. Interest yes, but certainly not "more" than a passing knowledge and an equally bygone undergaduate course or two myself. If there has been a peer-reviewed paper published, but that's all so far, then I would say the new theory should be mentioned, but perhaps given only one or two sentences until there is greater acceptance. I've situations sometimes occur, even with non-controversial stuff in Wikipedia, where one idea or one aspect of a topic gets higher coverage in an article not because of POV-pushing but because some editors are especially knowledgeable of or interested in a particular slice of a subject. I've seen the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Submarine.html" title="Submarine">Submarine</a> article veer from one interest to another -- women on subs, deep sea submersibles, pre-1900 subs, etc. Sometimes, you'd almost think the German U-boats were a blip in the history of submarines. So for that reason, I don't think this new theory should get a lot of space ... yet.</dd>
<dd>I've seen that you have unusually good editorial instincts and I know you'll figure it out even without a brand-new geology degree!</dd>
<dd>I'd like to research and write more articles, but I get to edit Wikipedia in little bursts. For now, I exercise my research skills mostly by trying to figure out spammers and their patterns. It's interesting. Many are dumb, but the one we found is very smooth. Google ranks Wikipedia highly, so our outward bound links are valuable and trusted. Some links left unreverted in Wikipedia for just a few weeks may be worth hundreds or thousands of dollars in increased site rankings and site traffic. The effect can linger additional weeks after reversion, too. This guy embeds his links in what appears to be useful text and adds just a link or two per week from any one address. He looks like an editor, not a spammer, until you look really closely at one edit's link, then start working backwards.</dd>

<dd>Now who is flattering whom? It is quite an overstatement to say that I have "unusually good editorial instincts." In reality, my short Wikipedia experience has been more like what you described with respect to the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Submarine.html" title="Submarine">Submarine</a> article – veering from one topic of interest to another. Its amazing how you start one article, then notice related articles that need help or need to be created and, before you know it, find yourself miles away from where you started. In any event, I have enjoyed our dialogue. I may take the weekend off and return to editing next week. Who knows, I may try to get back in touch with my geology roots and edit the Appalachian geology entry to include the “new theory.” <a href="../../../t/l/m/User%7ETlmclain_4c55.html" title="User:Tlmclain">Tlmclain</a> | <a href="../../../t/l/m/User_talk%7ETlmclain_3ea7.html" title="User talk:Tlmclain">Talk</a> 23:59, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I saw on your comment on my talk page that you read my blogpost&#160;:). I can get very annoyed by edits which screw up articles, solely on the basis of wanting to remove spam... I could provide a readinglist, but i think it would be wiser to be more prudent in editing whole articles, and start with removing the linkspam of the external link section of a great lot of those pages... It seems Wikipedia need some SEO's that are white, don't need to spam, and yet write good articles about SEO on wikipedia. IMHO, Jaimie Sirovich did just that... --<a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdevalk_c89b.html" title="User:Jdevalk">Jdevalk</a> 13:25, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>When I'm working on spam, it's usually some sort of what I would call campaigned spam -- one person with virtually no edit history except adding links to their web sites.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some embed their links with some useful text, but the goal remains spam. And they're supporting the assertions with links to their blog, which is a scaper site -- i.e., there was another site (acceptable per <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>) they could have linked to, but that wasn't their point. In fact, they were likely violating that other site's copyright. So in those cases, I just delete the link and move on to the next article they spammed. Yes, that leaves an unsupported assertion in the text, but I leave it for someone else to fix.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Again, I'm only doing this when I'm pursuing a campaign of links. When I'm editing an article under other circumstances, I'm usually a bit more circumspect. Also, as a volunteer at <a href="../../../w/p/s/WT%7EWPSPAM_5ffe.html" title="WT:WPSPAM">WT:WPSPAM</a>, I'm interested in bad faith stuff, not enforcing WP-wide adherence to WP:EL -- see my comments there about religioustolerance do org.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, if I'm pursuing one campaign's spam, I may be deleting that editor's spam links while leaving others on the page -- I'm just going from page to page fairly quickly. If anyone ever complains I'm picking on them, I encourage them to go delete their competitor's links as well, assuming they violate WP:EL.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think I've messed with the SEO articles but I might have.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I encourage you to edit away on those. I also suggest you follow <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> scrupulously there, which would probably include not linking to some useful blog posts. I'm not saying this as a "link-nazi" but rather because so many people watching those articles are so link-sensitized: either they're ready to post any dubious link they think if they see an opening ... or ... they're annoyed and touchy already that they'd delete a link to even the BBC as spam. I've got to run, but I also have some ideas on how to legitimately include significant blog content in a way that meets the letter and spirit of WP:EL. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A. B.</a> 15:01, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Your thoughts on those blogs would be appreciated, since the SEO world mainly talks through blogs. I've been going around some of the SEO articles, and could edit even "harder" but I wouldn't want to do that without some backup and regular checks, since these <i>are</i> such sensitive sections... --<a href="../../../j/d/e/User%7EJdevalk_c89b.html" title="User:Jdevalk">Jdevalk</a> 17:05, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I appreciate your frustration. The problem is that the vandalism coming from that IP just isn't that impressive. A single edit a half-hour ago, two edits five hours prior, and only a single edit in the six <i>days</i> prior to that. If you go back much further than that, you actually find some possibly useful edits: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moscow_Military_District&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86932455" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moscow_Military_District&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86932455" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_2nd_Guards_Tamanskaya_Motor_Rifle_Division&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86915494" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_2nd_Guards_Tamanskaya_Motor_Rifle_Division&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86915494" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, and even reverting vandalism xyrself: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_basic_space_exploration_topics&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86718794" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_basic_space_exploration_topics&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=86718794" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

<dd>I honestly didn't look that close. I just knew it was a bunch of people acting like idiots. When there's one person acting like an idiot, you block them - when it's multiple, protection is the way to go. (Probably short term in this case since it's hard to believe this is a common vandalism target - very odd). —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 16:47, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>With IPs you never know if they are shared or dynamically allocated. Last warnings that are more than a few days old are usually considered to have expired, unless it's evident from the edits that there is a pattern. Thus, block requests will likely fail in cases like this. There's not much we can do about these IPs if we want to remain an open wiki.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This address is registered to <i>Truro College, Truro, England</i>. I've tagged it as educational IP, it might belong to a classroom computer or even a school proxy. This means that 1. the IP won't be blocked long-term unless in extreme cases. But also 2. that instead of requiring the full series of warnings and then giving a long block, the focus should shift to more immediate but shorter slap-on-the-wrist type blocks.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Make sure these kiddy IPs got one recent (at least the same day) serious warning. If they continue (the more rapid the better in this case), request a short school block and you should find that admins may be more responsive. But be quick, anything beyond 3 hours drifts into why-bother-that-kid-is-gone land. For the really annoying IPs you can also try <a href="../../../a/b/u/WP%7EABUSE_39ee.html" title="WP:ABUSE">WP:ABUSE</a> to get someone contact the school. <a href="../../../f/e/m/User%7EFemto_bb69.html" title="User:Femto">Femto</a> 19:48, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I finally concluded that, other than referring this person back to the links I posted above, I was not going to respond to him -- it only seemed to feed something unhealthy within him. It seemed better for Wikipedia that I just lay low. Then I noticed that, in the presence of this new silence, he escalated his behavior -- he almost seemed to crave a block by the time he got one. Very strange -- likely a person with a lot of unhappiness in his life going way beyond Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.

<dd>Hi -- you did not have to go to all that work above -- I was just routinely putting the <a href="../../../a/d/w/Template%7EAdw_521e.html" title="Template:Adw">standard "Adw" notification template</a> on the various editors' pages per the WP:AfD procedure. Looking at the language now, I see the tone almost sounds vaguely like that of an indictment, which I certainly did not intend! (I just wanted to give a friendly notification.) --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A. B.</a> 01:40, 24 November 2006 (UTC)
