<p>They can't blacklist those sites without evidence that it is beyond normal admin tools. What I can do is have shadow's bot, which is taking the IRC feed from Linkwatcher deal with these links automatically. We can then see if there is more then one IP range, or other nasty stuff that we can come back and have them blacklist it.</p>

<dd><i>Have a look at the following links (<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_Sandbox_f762.html" title="User:Eagle 101/Sandbox">here</a>). They should be added to the bot. See the meta blacklist proposal, that probably won't get added due to the fact that it was not spammed by multiple IP ranges.

<p>Hello! Thank you for your respond at the whitelist-Discussion of wiener-gasometer.at. You will find a Request for Removing from the Link from the Blacklist on meta <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Spam_blacklist#wiener-gasometer.at" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Spam_blacklist#wiener-gasometer.at" rel="nofollow">here</a> and I didn't get any respond there since I have written this proposal. I am sorry, that I have posted this link on too many wikis on relevant articles and I won't do this any more and I am extremely sorry for that - I don't wanted to produce spam. This link was used in lot of wikipedias as a source and reference for articles on the topic of gasometers (gas holders), gasworks, gaslightning etc. a long time earlier than I have posted it. So it would be very helpful, if it is possible to remove the link from the blacklist in the meta-wikipedia or put at least whitelist-entry on the english wikipedia.

I asked first on the talk page if i could add it, no one had a problem with it. So i added it. Its not spam, it is a legitamite site with no ads and is a chronic fatigue community that has over 150 members. It was deleted for spam, but if you look at the site it isnt spam. Could you please reconsider the link. thanks</p>

<p>Its really really simple... and we have some tools on there that will be invaluable to you to counter spam with, especially all that hard detective work you have been doing... we have tools to assist with that. What browser are you using?

<p>Hello, A. B. Please look at <a href="../../../p/l/e/User%7EPleclech_d19c.html" title="User:Pleclech">User:Pleclech</a>'s edits in the history on the <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_D._Arnott_530b.html" title="Robert D.

I think you would agree that writing "The final line of this reference is 'ADVERTIZEMENT'." in an article and then reverting it after I removed it is blatant vandalism. I realize, looking at your talk page alone, that you are quite busy, but please look over these things a bit more carefully. By making comments that exonerate him on his talk page, before looking deeper into the matter, you justify his actions and encourage him to vandalize more. Thank you for your critical eye, though.

<p>What about "The final line of this reference is 'ADVERTIZEMENT'." and "in the journal he edits" mentioned repeatedly? Are those good edits? VivekVish 19:32, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Forgive me. The question isn't just whether those are good edits are not, since they are obviously not, but whether they constitute blatant vandalism. It's hard to see it as anything else. The <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html#What_vandalism_is_not" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism#What vandalism is not</a> page did not cover editing a page in order to degrade the subject or references of an article. However, that behavior would fall under the category of "a deliberate attempt to compromise the <i>integrity</i> of Wikipedia." VivekVish 19:45, 12 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One final point. All that is necessary for the {{<a href="../../../b/l/a/Template%7EBlatantvandal_5997.html" title="Template:Blatantvandal">Blatantvandal</a>}} tag is that the edit is clearly done in bad faith. There is no mention of multiple bad faith edits as a prerequisite, although User:Plechlech did revert to the vandalized edits even after I put the blatant vandal tag on his talkpage, which justifies Pleclech's being "blocked from editing without further warning," if I understand the policy correctly. It is difficult--indeed impossible--to argue that adding the line, "The final line of this reference is 'ADVERTIZEMENT'." is not done in bad faith--more specifically, it was meant to degrade the subject of the article and the reference in question. Therefore, I stand doubly firm behind my use of the {{<a href="../../../b/l/a/Template%7EBlatantvandal_5997.html" title="Template:Blatantvandal">Blatantvandal</a>}} tag. However, if by convention, the Blatant vandal tag tends not to be used on first-time vandals, even if the vandalism is done in bad faith, I would prefer that the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Template%7EBlatantvandal_5997.html" title="Template:Blatantvandal">policy</a> be edited such that it mentions that distinction.

<li>Please do. While we wait, allow me to revert to my edits. I really don't want "The final line of this reference is 'ADVERTIZEMENT'." and repeated mentions of "in the journal he edits" to be lying around this or any other article. I would do this on the grounds that in a dispute, it is probably better to leave out that which a user considers vandalism than to leave it in, until the issue is resolved. I don't know if there is a formal rule on this, but I believe it makes sense. In the event that this issue is resolved against me, I will happily revert to <a href="../../../p/l/e/User%7EPleclech_d19c.html" title="User:Pleclech">User:Pleclech</a>'s edits. Thank you, A. B.

<p>Have you given any thought to an RFA? I'd be more than willing to nominate you if you were interested! You've been a <i>great</i> asset to the community through your work with the spam wikiproject and I think it would benefit you (and the project) immensely if you had the ability to block spammers and delete/protect spam targets. Think about how easier life would have been on Mary Washington if we had a couple more users with admin tools (I had been given the tools myself in the first days or so of that an it was a bit overwhelming at first).

<dd>Thanks -- I'm flattered. You're about the 7th person to ask me. It would certainly make what I do easier. My concern is that I have been in a lot of disputes in the past, so I'm not sure I would make it through an RfA. I was a slow learner when it came to feeding trolls.</dd>

If candidates like them are squeaking by, it's not clear what the prospects are for mere mortals unless they're carefully avoiding any controversy until they stand for RfA. Standards seem to be rising across the board; while edit count is not a concern for me now at 7500, I was surprised to see people object to BozMo's 4500 edits. Some were concerned about his low number of article edits, but others were objecting to the total edit count. A year ago, people were talking about whether it was too picky to expect candidates have 1000 edits.</dd>

<p>Thanks for your comments. I appreciate your insight on the "vandalism or no" question. I did try to engage Plecech in a discussion because I could not see the reason for nominating for deletion, and asked that he/she assume good faith , but Plecech was nonresponsive. I eventually decided to warn Plecech for vandalism because, when I checked the history, Plecech seemed to have a history of nominating for deletion finance related pages, regardless of merit (not just the one you alluded to). Also, comments accompanying Plecech's edits for this and other pages tend not to be constructive and don't assume good faith, e.g., "another hit and run editor," "is this a joke?" and that kind of loaded language. In retrospect, I could have sent it to resolution, but as I said Plecech was nonresponsive, and he'd already decided to move forward with deletion.</p>
<p>My view is, instead of deleting every page we don't agree with, we should put our effort towards improving articles (provided they meet standards for inclusion in Wikipedia, of course).</p>
<p>That said, I'm still a fairly new (and sporadic) editor, getting used to wiki nuance. It's tough to see prolific wiki editors who appear to have an axe to grind - which is why we should all assume good faith, I suppose!</p>
<p>Thanks for your comments. I will review the vandalism standards. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsumdisc_91af.html" title="User:Netsumdisc">Netsumdisc</a> 17:26, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was very clear that you were operating in good faith for the good of the encyclopedia when you issued that warning. I appreciate your work here. I'm just keenly aware seeing some other editors' talk pages of how much a vandalism warning can become a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scarlet_letter" class="extiw" title="wikt:scarlet_letter">scarlet letter</a> for an editor.</dd>

<dd>If after reading the vandalism reference, you think the warning was inappropriate, you might <i>consider</i> leaving a note on Plecech's talk page. That doesn't mean you have to concede anything <i>editorially</i>, just comment on the warning you left. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User_talk%7EA._B._February_2007_b9bf.html" title="Edit section: Lists of utilities">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Lists of utilities</span></h2>
<p>The following is a note I left at <a href="../../../b/i/l/User_talk%7EBill_Clark_04d6.html" title="User talk:Bill Clark">User talk:Bill Clark</a>; since Bill's apparently left Wikipedia, I'm posting a copy here for others to comment on if they wish:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Bill, I'm sorry I've not gotten involved earlier in your disputes. I'm very involved with <a href="../../../w/p/s/WT%7EWPSPAM_5ffe.html" title="WT:WPSPAM">WikiProject Spam</a> and saw the reference to your cable TV-related edits but I did not interject because I was busy. I'm very interested in infrastructure-related issues and I see both sides of the issue.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>I'm inclined to think that adding a utilities section to the inline text of articles for towns is inappropriate. We're not really a directory for relocation information. A separate section within the article body for that material just adds to article's clutter.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>That leads to the idea of adding links at the end of the article, but that's an even poorer idea. If we get more than about 5 external links (not footnotes) at the end of an article, my experience has shown that the article quickly becomes a spam magnet: see the essay, <a href="../../../s/p/a/Wikipedia%7ESpam_Event_Horizon_c007.html" title="Wikipedia:Spam Event Horizon">"Spam Event Horizon"</a>. If the gas, power, cable, telephone and water utilities all get links, then you have 5 right there. In bigger towns, the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competitive_local_exchange_carrier.html" title="Competitive local exchange carrier">CLECs</a> are going to want their links, too.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Most provinces or states have WikiProjects to cover topics within their areas. Some of them have developed little information boxes for each town encapsulating basic information (population, founding date, etc.) I think utilities could be added unobtrusively to these templates but this should only be done with the consensus of the WikiProject members for that particular area. I wouldn't push it now, given the current stink over so-called cable "spam".</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The preferred approach instead is to add a link for the town to <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_Directory_Project_505b.html" title="Open Directory Project">Open Directory Project</a>, better known as <a href="http://dmoz.org" class="external text" title="http://dmoz.org" rel="nofollow">"Dmoz.org"</a> or just "Dmoz". This not just allowed but</i> specifically encouraged <i>by our <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">External Links Guideline</a>. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#MIRROR" title="WP:NOT">"Wikipedia is not a repository of links"</a> but DMOZ is and the two are very complimentary sources of information. It really helps our external links problem since now we just tell folks to take it to DMOZ and link back here from the DMOZ page for Podunk or vehicle insurance or whatever.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>So for example, instead of adding a link to the cable company in Highlands, NC, add a link to DMOZ for everything in the town:</i>
<ul>
<li><i><a href="http://dmoz.org/Regional/North_America/United_States/North_Carolina/Localities/H/Highlands" class="external free" title="http://dmoz.org/Regional/North_America/United_States/North_Carolina/Localities/H/Highlands" rel="nofollow">http://dmoz.org/Regional/North_America/United_States/North_Carolina/Localities/H/Highlands</a></i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Highlands doesn't have any DMOZ entries for its utilities but it should. If you wanted a cable TV link, you could:</i>
<ol>
<li><i>Submit suggestions to DMOZ for inclusion</i></li>
<li><i>Become a DMOZ editor yourself:</i>
<ul>
<li><i><a href="http://dmoz.org/help/become.html#how" class="external free" title="http://dmoz.org/help/become.html#how" rel="nofollow">http://dmoz.org/help/become.html#how</a></i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Perhaps work out something</i> informal <i>with DMOZ for the interested Wikipedia and DMOZ editors to share some efforts with them for the lists I suggest below. (I say "informal" because we're so anarchic here that it would take forever to herd all the cats to get formal approval and we wouldn't need it anyway).</i></li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Before I get to the lists, however, I should add that I'm not involved with DMOZ and I don't know much about how they operate. Maybe this isn't realistic.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>What I think would be very helpful on Wikipedia are lists by state of utilities along the lines of "List of cable TV companies in Ohio", "List of power utilities in Bavaria", organized by county or district and listing the multiple utilities in each county. Some provincial and state regulatory commissions publish maps of service areas; if public domain copies were available, they would be invaluable to these readers.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The people who really want to know about the cable TV operator in <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highlands%2C_North_Carolina_9939.html" title="Highlands, North Carolina">Highlands, North Carolina</a> are people in the infrastructure business and they would probably prefer to have it on a by-state basis anyway. They'd also probably love maps and Wikipedia has some people who love to generate maps.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>I think Wikipedia's coverage of utilities is poor and needs to be better. <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_Power_d8f8.html" title="Georgia Power">Georgia Power</a> is a multi-billion dollar operation yet its current article, still just a stub, was only started 5 months ago. There are thousands of readers in the U.S. who could use this information. The same is true of utilities elsewhere around the world. I also think that any utility with &gt;$10 million in revenues is notable and should have an article someday.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The demographics of Wikipedia's</i> readers <i>are much broader than those of the active Wikipedia</i> editors <i>which are still broader than those of our 1000 or so admins. That's not a criticism of Wikipedia's hard-working volunteers -- if anything, it's a call instead to get cable TV folks and others off their butts to help out here, too. Those thousands who could use the cable TV lists aren't editing here -- just reading. At least the cable TV world has one person (you) -- that's one more than some other industries have.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>It would also be helpful to have a ranking list for each country of the largest utilities ranked by size. So for the U.S. or Canada, you could have rankings like this:</i>
<ol>
<li><i><a href="../../../m/u/l/Multi_system_operator.html" title="Multi system operator">MSOs</a> ranked by number of customers and/or</i></li>
<li><i><a href="../../../m/u/l/Multi_system_operator.html" title="Multi system operator">MSOs</a> ranked by cable system revenues (to exclude other activities such as publishing).</i></li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>I'd be happy to support you if you're interested, although I could not invest large amounts of time.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>I also understand that Rome wasn't built in a day. Just in North America there are 50 states in the U.S. and 13 provinces or territories in Canada. Worldwide there are 190+ countries. Still, like all things on Wikipedia, this could start out small and incrementally grow over time, hopefully drawing in some help from others.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<dd>Thanks for the invite, A.B. I see one major problem with your DMOZ-based concept, plus a couple of more minor problems. DMOZ will not list the same link in umpty-dozen categories. First the <b>major</b> problem: As a general rule, a website can be listed in one "Regional" (geographically based) category and one "topical" category; editors are admonished to find the single best-fit category, rather than listing it everywhere it is relevant. As a result of this rule, <a href="http://www.bellsouth.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.bellsouth.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bellsouth.com/</a> (for example) is found only in <a href="http://dmoz.org/Business/Telecommunications/Carriers" class="external free" title="http://dmoz.org/Business/Telecommunications/Carriers" rel="nofollow">http://dmoz.org/Business/Telecommunications/Carriers</a> and <a href="http://dmoz.org/Regional/North_America/United_States/Regions/South_and_Southeast/Business_and_Economy/Public_Utilities/" class="external free" title="http://dmoz.org/Regional/North_America/United_States/Regions/South_and_Southeast/Business_and_Economy/Public_Utilities/" rel="nofollow">http://dmoz.org/Regional/North_America/United_States/Regions/South_and_Southeast/Business_and_Economy/Public_Utilities/</a> . About the only time a utility would be listed in a locality category is when it serves only that one locality. The minor problems are that, due to issues related to recovery from the massive server failure, editor applications are not currently being accepted and externally submitted URLs are not currently being added to the directory. (I call these problems "minor" because they are temporary and because existing editors can add URLs.) <b>Bottom line:</b> DMOZ is not the place to "send" people to find out which phone company or cable system serves a community.--<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 20:45, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Now to the more general question... Reflecting on Bill Clark's proposal, it seems to me that the identification of public utilities often is a nontrivial topic of interest in connection with a community -- not merely a service to people relocating there. For example: (1) municipally owned utilities and contractual deals between municipalities and cable operators both can be the subject of political controversy, (2) local initiatives to provide a particular type of utility service (such as city-wide Wi-Fi access or the burial of all electric lines) can strongly affect a community's character, (3) the adequacy of a community's drinking water source can be an important local issue, and (4) idiosyncrasies, such as a community's having a different phone company than the rest of the county, often are important elements in a community's "story." I see no particular value in identifying every utility serving every city, town, village, and hamlet, but I don't think this information should be banned. In most instances, naming the utility should not result in a new external link, since large companies such as <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verizon.html" title="Verizon">Verizon</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/%26/AT%26T_b74e.html" title="AT&amp;T">AT&amp;T</a>, and <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entergy.html" title="Entergy">Entergy</a> have their own articles to link to, and even many more local companies such as <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cass_County_Electric_Cooperative_844d.html" title="Cass County Electric Cooperative">Cass County Electric Cooperative</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle_City_Light_2692.html" title="Seattle City Light">Seattle City Light</a> have their own articles (all of these are findable at <a href="../../../p/u/b/Category%7EPublic_utilities_of_the_United_States_84e0.html" title="Category:Public utilities of the United States">Category:Public utilities of the United States</a>).--<a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrlady_761e.html" title="User:Orlady">orlady</a> 20:45, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just read this post and since A.B. and I are currently involved in a conflict dispute it seems appropriate that I dispell any suspicions before they start. While I am not a fan of A.B. I don't agree with 72.24.79.46's POV and I don't want people to think that user is me. I looked at 72.24.79.46's contribution log and I see that the first edit is to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_A._B._395a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/A. B.">Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/A._B.</a> at 00:11 17 February 2007 (lets call this time zero). My first contact with A.B. was 18 hours later on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Spam_459e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spam">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Spam</a> and my first conflict with A.B. on <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penton_Media_635c.html" title="Penton Media">Penton Media</a> was 28 hours later.

<dd>This is also the first I've heard of A.B.'s request for adminship. My vote is undecided at the moment. I suspect my final decision depends on how my conflict dispute with A.B. resolves itself.

<p>Hello A.B. I find the tone of your edits and comments related to <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penton_Media_635c.html" title="Penton Media">Penton Media</a> to be hostile and offensive. Do you take a certain pride in being so condescending?</p>

B.'s request for adminship</a>. As best as I can tell from comments he's been leaving around Wikipedia and Meta, he may have been threatened with legal action by a competitor (searchtexoma.com) who thinks he framed them into being blacklisted because of some <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_job.html" title="Joe job">Joe jobbing</a> he did. The reality is that both he (texomaland.com) and searchtexoma did a ton of spamming, Joe jobbing or not. 72.24.79.46's comments here and on Meta get progressively more, well, interesting as the evening wears on in Texas.

<dd>Wow, looks you spent a great deal of effort summarizing a fairly accurate account of the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penton_Media_635c.html" title="Penton Media">Penton Media</a> history log. But this dispute isn't about WP: policy. You failed to address what in my opinion are the critical issues:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Why did you feel you had to get involved in the first place? (see #4 above) I mean, why did you choose to fight this battle? What did you hope to gain? I see WP: violations all over the place on Wikipedia, but I don't go fixing all of them. I choose my battles carefully and with purpose. I don't know if you've learned this yet but Wikipedia is incredibly political.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I found the copy-n-pasting of WP:SELF (see #8 above) to be difficult to read. I've read all the WP: policy pages many times and the way you spouted policy came across as rather insincere and offensive.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Why did you feel you needed to call in external help? (see #12 above) You had the situation under control. Adminstration aid was not required. Yet again you failed to consider the political consequences of your actions. This might not of been your goal but the end effect was that you totally ticked me off.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>When JonHarder answered your call and showed up the exchange of bureaucratic WP: catch-22 was as painful as it was comical. I understand that your job as the Spam Czar is difficult work and there are rules to be followed but this self induced action paralysis only makes your job harder.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The condescending tone in your "two experienced editors have said ..." comment finally pushed me over the edge. When I mentioned NPOV earlier you should of taken a clue that I wasn't a novice Wikipedia editor. I've been an editor for more than a year and a half.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I hope you take this as constructive crictism. I feel that your two main flaws are that you have an "unwillingness to discuss" and that you have the political savy of a robot. If you can overcome and learn the difference between replying and discussing then you might actually make a good administrator since having the political savy of a robot is a plus in that field of work!

<dd>1. Maybe I truly was missing something.</dd>
<dd>2. Perhaps another opinion would help defuse what I suspected might be come awkward. Other than clear-cut spam and vandalism cases, I'm not sure I've ever gone past 1RR with regular editors.</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure I'm the Czar of anything, even my dog. I'm not an admin -- just another editor in the big anarchy of Wikipedia. I spend a lot of time helping with spam. I also edit articles for the sake of editing.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><i>"your "two experienced editors have said ..." comment finally pushed me over the edge."</i>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sorry you went over some edge. I don't think I said you were inexperienced but you sure seemed dismissive of anything I'd written. I thought it useful to point out that others agreed the material was inappropriate.</dd>

<p>Just want to send you a notice that I have added 89 new <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penton_Media_635c.html" title="Penton Media">Penton Media</a> owned domains to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Spam_2007_Archive_Feb_bfe0.html#PRISM_Business_Media_Inc." title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spam/2007 Archive Feb">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Spam/2007_Archive_Feb#PRISM_Business_Media_Inc.</a> The more I look the more domains I find so I think both the Prism and the Penton lists are still incomplete.</p>
<p>Do you know of any Internet service that allows you to make a query for all the domains owned by an enity? Also, do you know of a frozen in time read-only Wikipedia server that can do database queries? Kind of like the Wayback machine, such a server would make the deep digging and correlation easier since the majority of the link spam has already been removed.

<dd><i>"Do you know of any Internet service that allows you to make a query for all the domains owned by an entity?"</i>
<ul>
<li>No -- I think there are some services you can pay $$ for, but I don't know much about them. I stumbled across a site that let me do this once as a free trial 3 months ago but I never could do it again for free (I think they recorded my IP) and I've long since lost the address.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd><i>"Also, do you know of a frozen in time read-only Wikipedia server that can do database queries?"</i>
<ul>
<li>I think this may be possible as there are all sorts of people that take various Wikipedia statistics and analyze them. I don't know much about it however. You could go to to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStatistics_2040.html" title="Wikipedia:Statistics">Wikipedia:Statistics</a> and start following hyperlinks, leaving questions on talk pages.</li>
<li>Faster and slightly less comprehensive -- raise the question at <a href="../../../w/p/s/WT%7EWPSPAM_5ffe.html" title="WT:WPSPAM">WT:WPSPAM</a>, asking who deleted links, then go and look at their contributions. I ran into a similar situation after the big <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Spam_2006_Archive_Dec_c70a.html#Suite101_dot_com" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Spam/2006 Archive Dec">Suite101.com spam controversy</a> in December 2006. We all deleted links, then the Suite101 people came back very glibly and persuasively trying to convince the rest of Wikipedia that 90% of the links were added by neutral editors, not Suite101.com people, and that the WikiProject Spam link-nazis had run amuk. I found out who had deleted the links, then went through their contributions histories to find the articles, then the article histories to show that links in a large sample had mostly been added <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose accounts</a>.
<ul>
<li>Besides, I think a lot of WPSPAM folks would be interested in an update on what you're finding.</li>

<dd>I just finished reading that link to the suite101.com discussion, unbelievable, that CEO should win a weasel award. This company deserves to be blacklisted for life, but the problem with that is it is so easy to create 1000+ unique domains. Just look at Penton with all their domains and the appropriately placed links. We expend more than 10X the effort to hunt it down and irradicate the link spam than it does to create it in the first place. Another thing that surprised me from the suite101.com discussion was that they payout a $2 CPM to writers. That seems like an amazing amount of payout for a revenue sharing scheme. It makes you wonder how much suite101.com is making but then it explain's the CEO's persistence. I think the Wikipedia links were extremely lucrative to them. The real worry is will you be able to recognize this beast when it resurfaces?

<dd>I used to worry about spammers inventing new domain names just to bypass our blacklist. I haven't seen a lot of this except from a few long-time vandals/POV-pushers that have developed an obsession with Wikipedia. The financially-oriented guys have lots of domain names they are throwing at us, but I don't see them developing new ones just for us. If you read the open forums like Digital Point (or the closed, "black hat" forums), most of them have so many irons in the fire that even though they love those Wikipedia links, they don't have the time or money to create domains just for us. If we're seeing them throwing new stuff at us, it's because spammers are continually developing new domains anyway. First of all, it's a low margin business and secondly the aggressive ones are replacing domains that have been blacklisted by the search engines.</dd>

<dd>I'm usually an advocate for blacklisting all of a spammer's domains and not just the ones we've actually seen spammed since I figure we'll see the others soon enough. Also, they're almost never appropriate for us anyway, so we lose nothing doing so.</dd>

<dd>As for Penton, we are just a tiny, tiny blip on their screen. They don't fit any of the classic spammer profiles (other than spamming). To name just one example, Transmission and Distribution magazine is one the major global publications for the power utility industry (possibly <i>the</i> major publication). T&amp;D Expo is a gigantic tradeshow. Just those two properties alone alone rake in tens of millions in revenues for Penton and the majority of their readers/attendees are probably not big Wikipedia readers. One gauge of this is Wikipedia's pathetically light coverage of power utility transmission and distribution -- both the technology and the business. Power transmission and distribution is a critical infrastructure issue; in the U.K. it represents thousands of millions of pounds. In North America it may take in one hundred billion dollars or more (and I'm not including the even bigger generation segment). Yet by contrast, we have far better coverage of <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a> here.</dd>

<dd>Work your way through Penton's properties and you see the same story repeated over and over across many industries (although most are smaller than power). That's why I think it's so cheesy that Penton's done this to Wikipedia. For once, it's a spammer that really doesn't need us.</dd>

<dd>I'm guessing here but I believe the source of the problem with Penton is that they had an internal corporate policy of encouraging aggressive linking. I don't know if it was the marketing department or if it was individual journalists or if it went higher up the corporate ladder but they should of known better. The fallout from this has the potential to be far greater than any benefit they might of received. It just isn't smart. Unfortunately I don't think this is an isolated issue since I've caught several large corporations engaging in this sort of wiki-shenanigans.

<p>I will gladly replace the warnings. I apolagize if unblocking was innapropriate. I checked the block log and there was one previous block before the indef block so i figured another chance wouldent hurt. (I have also seen IP addresses with block logs of 12-14 blocks). SHould vandalism continue from them, i am 100% for an indef block. I also have the page watched so if they get warned again I can block. Again, I apolagize if unblocking was innapropriate.

<p>Hi A.B,</p>
<p>Good that I bumped into you. Can you please take a look at the image contribs of these two users --&gt; User:WikiRaja and <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalaripayatt_37aa.html" title="User:Kalaripayatt">User:Kalaripayatt</a>. Both of them seem to have uploaded copyvios onto wikipedia and simply continue to ignore requests for sourcing their contribs properly. Orphanbot on the other hand doesnt seem to know better and keeps giving them 7 day breathers. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Jasmine-kalaripayatt-silambam.gif" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Jasmine-kalaripayatt-silambam.gif" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

<dd>I think nominating them for speedy deletion where appropriate as you've done with that example looks like a good idea. If an image doesn't meet the speedy criteria, then you can still take it to images for deletion (<a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a>). Many of the images previously on the <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bharatanatyam.html" title="Bharatanatyam">Bharatanatyam‎</a> page have had digital watermarks -- that's grounds for removal from articles and deletion, but not for speedy deletion. For example, see Image:Bharatanatyam 3.jpg; that can and should be deleted.</dd>

<dd>I just nominated the pic you mentioned above for speedy coz not only does it have a watermark, it is also from a blacklisted site. If I've taken any shortcuts here, I think <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> will cover me.

<dd>You have my support. Also, when I nominated a bunch of these for deletion the slow way, the site had not yet been blacklisted nor had the uploader been blocked indefinitely as a sockpuppet. These additional factors may further justify "speedy" vs. "slow". Here's a list of images I was involved in looking at when I was involved in the <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bharatanatyam.html" title="Bharatanatyam">Bharatanatyam</a> spam wars last month:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._Sandbox7_43b5.html#Images_for_review" title="User:A. B./Sandbox7">User:A. B./Sandbox7#Images for review</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Once the wars died down, I moved on to more pressing issues since nobody was trying to add the images every day. I did not finish working on the list.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you like an image and it's not spammy in appearance, don't feel compelled to delete it because it came from a spammer. If they released it into the public domain for us, we can keep it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In addition to link spam, at least two different camps engaged in "image-warring":
<ul>
<li>At the time, by having a link to their web site from the image page, they indirectly linked their pages (in search engine calculations) to the <a href="../../../b/h/a/Bharatanatyam.html" title="Bharatanatyam">Bharatanatyam</a> article</li>
<li>Most of the images had digital watermarks with the web address on it -- invisible to search engines but visible to readers. Aside from issues of spam and aesthetics, watermarks complicate reuse of our content by others under our GFDL license.
<ul>
<li>A variation was to have some sign in the background with the organization's name casually displayed. I think that is probably legally allowed for licensing (but may not be desirable editorially)</li>
