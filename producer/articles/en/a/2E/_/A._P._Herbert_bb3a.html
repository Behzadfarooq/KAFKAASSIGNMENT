<p>He studied at <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_College%2C_Oxford_e952.html" title="New College, Oxford">New College, Oxford</a>, without taking a degree; and was admitted to the bar in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a>, but never practiced.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>, with the aid of <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Pakenham%2C_7th_Earl_of_Longford_0007.html" title="Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford">Frank Pakenham</a>, he became a Member of Parliament for <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_a536.html" title="Oxford University (UK Parliament constituency)">Oxford University</a>, from where he was returned until the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_constituency.html" title="University constituency">University seats</a> were abolished in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>.</p>
<p>He was sent to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newfoundland_and_Labrador_4e85.html" title="Newfoundland and Labrador">Newfoundland and Labrador</a> in 1943 with <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derrick_Gunston_c991.html" title="Derrick Gunston">Derrick Gunston</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Ammon%2C_1st_Baron_Ammon_ad66.html" title="Charles Ammon, 1st Baron Ammon">Charles Ammon</a> as part of a Parliamentary commission to investigate the future of the dominion, and supported the cause of independence over Confederation as a result.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._P._Herbert_bb3a.html" title="Edit section: Reforming the laws">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reforming the laws</span></h2>
<p>Throughout his career he lobbied for reform of several laws which he felt to be outdated, among these the legislation on <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divorce.html" title="Divorce">divorce</a> and <a href="../../../o/b/s/Obscenity.html" title="Obscenity">obscenity</a>.</p>
<p>A popular topic of his was the remarkably complex British <a href="../../../l/i/c/Licensing_laws_of_the_United_Kingdom_4ae5.html" title="Licensing laws of the United Kingdom">licensing laws</a> of the time, and in 1935 - as a protest - he became the first person to lay a criminal information against the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_House_of_Commons_bbac.html" title="British House of Commons">House of Commons</a>, for selling alcohol without a licence. (The High Court ruled that it was exempt through <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_privilege.html" title="Parliamentary privilege">Parliamentary privilege</a>.)</p>
<p>Giving his <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maiden_speech.html" title="Maiden speech">maiden speech</a> on his second day in the House, he declared rashly that he planned to introduce the Matrimonial Causes Bill, to reform divorce, and that he would have it passed before that Parliament was over. In the event, it was passed - somewhat strengthed by the House of Lords - in 1938 as the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937. This, for the first time, allowed divorce without requiring proof of <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adultery.html" title="Adultery">adultery</a>. He also advocated reform of the gambling laws and the repeal of the entertainments tax, among other causes.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._P._Herbert_bb3a.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Misleading Cases&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Misleading Cases"</span></h2>
<p>His humorous writing appeared often in <i><a href="../../../p/u/n/Punch_magazine.html" title="Punch magazine">Punch magazine</a></i>, where the work for which he is best remembered – his series of <i>Misleading Cases in the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Law_8277.html" title="Common Law">Common Law</a></i> – was first published. These were satirical pieces, in the form of "<a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_reports.html" title="Law reports">law reports</a>" or "<a href="../../../j/u/d/Judgment.html" title="Judgment">judgments</a>", on various aspects of the British legal and judicial system. They often had a sharp political point beneath their <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satire.html" title="Satire">satire</a>, and tied into his personal crusades against obsolescent legislation. Many of them featured the exploits of Albert Haddock, a tireless and veteran litigant. (Herbert often referred to himself as "A.P. Haddock" in <i><a href="../../../p/u/n/Punch_magazine.html" title="Punch magazine">Punch magazine</a></i> skits, whether or not these had a courtroom setting.)</p>
<p>Although entirely fictional, they are often quoted admiringly and with full knowledge in actual judicial decisions; and are also the subject of academic research.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Due to their realism they were on several occasions mistakenly reported by newspapers both in Britain and elsewhere as factual. One of the "cases", supposedly establishing a novel crime of "doing what you like", was sharply criticized by an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_review.html" title="Law review">law review</a> article, whose author failed to note its entire absurdity.</p>
<p>Over his lifetime Herbert published five basic collections of the <i>Misleading Cases</i>, titled <i>Misleading Cases in the Common Law</i>, <i>More Misleading Cases</i>, <i>Still More Misleading Cases</i>, <i>Codd's Last Case</i> and <i>Bardot M.P.?</i>. Stray cases also appear in his collections of miscellaneous humorous essays, such as <i>General Cargo</i>. Virtually all the cases were assembled into two omnibus volumes, <i>Uncommon Law</i> in 1935 and <i>More Uncommon Law</i> in 1982; a shorter selection, <i>Wigs At Work</i>, appeared in 1966. The <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> successfully adapted them for <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> as three series of <i>A P Herbert's Misleading Cases</i> (1967, 1968 and 1971), with <a href="../../../r/o/y/Roy_Dotrice_c6d7.html" title="Roy Dotrice">Roy Dotrice</a> as Haddock and <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alastair_Sim_c9eb.html" title="Alastair Sim">Alastair Sim</a> as the judge, Mr Justice Swallow.</p>

<p>He wrote eight novels, including <i>The Water Gypsies</i>, <i>The Secret Battle</i>, and <i>Holy Deadlock</i>; and fifteen plays.</p>
<p>In addition to his fiction, Herbert wrote <i>What a Word!</i> in 1935, continuing his campaign in <i>Punch</i> for better use of English, including a section on 'Plain English' more than a decade ahead of Sir <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Gowers_6df6.html" title="Ernest Gowers">Ernest Gowers</a>' more celebrated work. Characteristically Herbert uses humour to make his serious points about good writing.</p>

<p>A P Herbert loved the River Thames. He lived beside it at Hammersmith, West London. He was a Conservator (a member of the Thames Conservancy Board) and a Freeman of the Company of River Thames Watermen and Lightermen. In 1966 he wrote "The Thames" (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson) in which he explored the 'machinery' of the river in all its aspects.</p>
