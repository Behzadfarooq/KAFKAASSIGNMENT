<p>A.B., you are an investigatory genius. I mean that. Would you find it in your heart to begin investigating whether Jimmy Wales and Angela Beesley are (at best) engendering a Conflict of Interest, or (at worst) threatening the non-profit status of Wikimedia Foundation by fostering an environment where their for-profit venture, Wikia.com, is widely discussed, endorsed, recommended, and linked to from Wikipedia? Maybe I'm crazy, but wouldn't this be like Red Cross workers encouraging the disaster victims they aid to stock their medicine cabinet with Bayer brand analgesics -- and then it's discovered that the Director of the Red Cross has a majority ownership share of Bayer? This would be on the front cover of the Financial Times, but here on Wikipedia (for some reason), it's all swept under the rug. And, P.S., I know you're going to want to dismiss this request because it's coming from me, but please consider it with a NPOV. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossBuckle_Swami_fa57.html" title="User:JossBuckle Swami">JossBuckle Swami</a> 14:32, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm no investigatory genius -- I just ask questions and use Google. I'm hard up for compliments this week, however, so I'll gladly accept yours -- thank you.</dd>
<dd>My response, off-the-cuff, is as follows:
<ol>
<li>On the whole, I believe that if you really dug deep into Wikia, Jimmy Wales and the Foundation that Wales has put much more resources into Wikipedia than he's gotten out from Wikia.</li>
<li>The Foundation gets a clean accounting opinion from its auditors. The IRS gives it 501c3 status. If the IRS ever smelled a conflict of interest, Jimmy Wales would be in deep hot water and all his personal assets would be at risk.</li>
<li>Wales and company make no bones about making money off of Wikia. It's not secret.</li>
<li>Some of Wikipedia's critics use MediaWiki software. Some I believe are even hosted by Wikia.</li>
<li>I'm just not motivated to poke into this. If I saw something that troubled me, maybe I would, but there are already so many people like yourself or Brandt or the Wikitruth people looking for any dirt they can find -- and coming up empty. If they did, I'm sure the IRS would be all over it. I've been on the boards of a non-profit and of a publicly traded company; you can hide things for a little while (Enron) but not for long, especially when you have so many opponents.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>So basically I'm a happy camper with the Foundation. I may even make a donation later this new tax year. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A.

<dd>(emphasis mine) So, it's okay to "suggest" to other users a "more suitable wiki", especially if it's Wikia, which will put more Google ad revenues into Angela's pocket. Nobody else sees this as shameful? Just a few minutes later, another robotic Wikipedian responded, "Maybe there should be some way to mark the articles which are not notable for wikipedia, but are worthy to be included in internet.wikia.com. For example, one would include "I7W" (non-notable website) as reason for deletion and a bot would monitor the deletion log and take the deleted articles marked that way and automatically post them on internet Wikia."</dd>

<dd>Once again, I'm not sure there's a lot of malevolent greed here, but you and I see things differently. What is interesting to me is the quantity of useful (to someone) but unecyclopedic content discarded by Wikipedia. These deletions are usually done with good reasons relating to our mission as an encyclopedia, but the content may still have value for other sites that don't need strong content controls.</dd>

<dd>Assuming a discarded article is not an attack article or a copyright violation, perhaps Wikipedia could move them for a while to another site after deletion Wikipedia -- sort of like the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goodwill_Industries_bb2a.html" title="Goodwill Industries">Goodwill bins</a> for discarded clothing. After 2 weeks in the discard bin, they'd be erased, but this would give time to others site to pick up their content for use under the GFDL license.</dd>

<dd>Excellent "cleanup" of the quoted mailing list content. Thanks. I think you and Angela both don't see any "malevolence" because there probably isn't any. But, it's still a financially-beneficial conflict of interest. And such a conflict is NOT what 99% of the donors are contributing their money to support. That's why it needs to stop, and actually be policed, whether it's malevolent or not. I mention Centiare.com to maybe 12 users on their Talk pages, and I get threatened with a block. Angela broadcasts to the entire Wikipedia admin elite, and some of them trip over themselves to make the profit-making process even EASIER for her. It's wrong, A.B., and deep down, you know it. --<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJossBuckle_Swami_fa57.html" title="User:JossBuckle Swami">JossBuckle Swami</a> 05:55, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will take a look at it. Be more than happy to help. I created the ADHS entries, and a good chunk of the WV highway listing. The biggest problems being people trying to pigeon hole WV related stuff into they way they do things in California etc. That is where I believe Wiki, needs regional or category specific admins. This will prevent bad admining because they don't know the subject matter, and try to say.

<dd>I added some additional material. I'm a little weaker on the water transport than I would like. I don't like how it seems concentrated on the middle, but that is a historical accuracy. Connecting the Potomac and Ohio River valleys was very important and that reflects in the article, so I guess that is ok. I know there are typo's, but the info is accurate. I hadn't really thought about it till I put this together, transport is still fairly limited in Appalachia and still concentrated a few crossing points. --<a href="../../../7/1/d/User%7E71Demon_5555.html" title="User:71Demon">71Demon</a> 00:36, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If there are multiple pages, just link to one search term such as "ghosthunting" instead of multiple dmoz pages. Since the template above doesn't handle links to dmoz search results, just write up the link like any other. Writing this:

<p>The Atlantic Paranormal Society is pretty notable, Google returns hundreds of references regarding the org. The other, smaller "ghost hunting club" pages are problematic. Not sure what to do about them, since the article's subject is the proliferation and activities of such "ghost hunting clubs" which are typically blog/forum/self-publishing. The article on Livescience.com is by Ben Radford, and I believe the original is published on CSICOP or Skeptic Magazine, but I can hunt that down. Regarding the search engine links, if you have spare time, maybe you can help finesse the formatting.

<p>Thanks for you note. I must say I've discovered that the best thing to do after a day or two of persistent reinsertion of spam is simply to list the page at Wikiproject Spam and let others help. It can get rather frustrating when multiple users with little edit history ignore both the edit summaries and the talk page and simply insist that they are right, if they respond at all! <a href="../../../a/_/r/User%7EA_Ramachandran_bc06.html" title="User:A Ramachandran">A Ramachandran</a> 06:49, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. My only involvement so far was the talk page that you saw where I tried to reduce the vitriolic nature of the comments. I see that they are still debating the issue but at least the blatant personal attacks have stopped. Until now I haven't made any declaration either way concerning the spam-or-not-spam nature of the links. Since you asked, however... &#160;:-) I can honestly see valid points on both sides of the issue. Removing the personalities from the picture and focusing on the facts, it seems that 1) there are an excessive number of links to libsyn.com; 2) otrsite.com is a <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html#Links_normally_to_be_avoided" title="Wikipedia:External links">site that exists primarily to sell products or services</a>; and 3) the ads on freeotrshows.com are more prominent than the content link. That indicates there could be a spam problem. On the other hand, where a link leads to a completely free (no registration or payment required) service, it would be nice to be able to keep that link if such links do not otherwise violate WP policy. Relevant links that provide something more than can be contained in the article are desirable. Then again (here I am playing devil's advocate with myself) I had to <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnmizzi_5de7.html#External_links" title="User talk:Johnmizzi">inform a user</a> who wanted to link thousands of articles or article talk pages to a free service, that even without prominent ads it would still be considered spam. So yes, in short, I believe there are valid points on both sides and an investigation may be warranted. Note that I'm not pre-emptively declaring the links as spam, but I do believe that a determination by an experienced, third-party spam investigator would be useful. Now I'm left scratching my head, wondering how you can handle all of this while on a wikibreak. &#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESWAdair_e7db.html" title="User:SWAdair">SWAdair</a> | <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESWAdair_58bb.html" title="User talk:SWAdair">Talk</a> 05:58, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for your long and thoughful response. I will stay out of this for now. I think the involved parties need some sort of arbitration or mediation process first, perhaps starting with an RFC. This is a content and personality conflict as much as it is a spam concern; I believe community consensus is more effective in those situations than an indvidual such as myself just sticking his hand into the buzzsaw. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A.

<dd>I'm glad to help. A couple of comments:
<ul>
<li>Your myspace link is being reviewed for blacklisting as spam. That means you can't save a page that has that link in it. If this happens and you have it in a user page, you won't be able to save it after making any edits (you'll get a big warning box. The fix is simple -- just break the link with spaces:
<ul>
<li>http: //www. forbiddenlink. com</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don't link to your user, user talk or user subpages from any Wikipedia article or category. (That's strictly forbidden, but I can't seem to find the rule).</li>

<p>I saw your additions to the External Links section. I wanted you to know there is a huge amount of contention on that site and I have been championing those external links. I compared them to a LOT of other comparable organizational sites and they seem reasonable. The article has been under a tremendous attack by negative POV editors and it is still severely negative in its POV but it is becoming more balanced. Please let me know if you have any thoughts or comments about that! I thought when I first saw your edits that you were a sock puppet but I see now that you are a serious contriutor to Wikipedia. I look forward to hearing from you! Thanks! 20:38, 19 January 2007 (UTC)<a href="../../../a/j/a/User%7EAJackl_fc2f.html" title="User:AJackl">Alex Jackl</a> 16:51, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You don't have to explain your behavior -- if you look at other comments made about the same time, they've very consistent with yours. For instance, look at Matthew Fenton's "oppose". He said BozMo's last edit before 15 January was on 8 January -- yet several hours later, BozMo's edit history showed 200 edits during that time. Clearly, there was some sort of a technical glitch. That's why I left my comment. You did nothing wrong but I thought you'd want to know. I knew both you and <a href="../../../t/e/h/User%7ETeh_tennisman_b474.html" title="User:Teh tennisman">Teh tennisman</a>, another early opposer, were interested in becoming admins and I was concerned you might later get this thrown back in your face if you didn't have &gt;&gt;4800 edits and several years. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A.

<dd>I've been in so many disputes and made so many people mad, I'm not sure I could make it through the RfA process with &gt;65%. Also, I've become increasingly disenchanted with how tortuous the RfA process is for anyone who doesn't have a sparkling clean record -- and even for those who did, such as BozMo. I'm not talking about gnarly stuff such as 3RR or stuff that merits user talk page warnings but smaller stuff -- in my cases, mostly allegations I failed to assume good faith or was biting a newcomer. Stroll through my talk page archives and see what you think. If you disagree, let me know.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think it's harder to become an admin than it was 9 months ago when I first started watching RfAs. Fortunately my use of edit summaries is over 95% but people may quibble over whether I have too much article-writing experience and not enough process (XfD, RfA, etc) experience -- or vice versa. My user signature and use of user boxes are fortunately kosher if unimaginitive -- I've never had the time or interest to pretty up my signature or acquire enough userboxes enough to offend people.</dd>

<dd>I think WikiProject Spam desperately needs more admins. I find much of what we do cuts across so many boundaries. I find myself going to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>, <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFPP_fba0.html" title="WP:RFPP">WP:RFPP</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, <a href="../../../o/p/_/WP%7EOP_2cfb.html" title="WP:OP">WP:OP</a>, <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">WP:RFCU</a>, <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Spam_blacklist" class="extiw" title="m:Spam_blacklist">m:Spam blacklist</a> to get other people to do things. Each time, I have to make a sales pitch and start all over again from the top. Hence, I probably overdocument spammers' misbehavior on their user pages -- just so I can hopefully "close the sale" on why this guy that's spamming all over really should be blocked for more than an hour. There's a lot to be said for having as many spam-fighters as possible who can do most (if not all) of these tasks. So I'm really trying to encourage anti-spam folks to become admins.</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I also encourage existing WP:WPSPAM admins to get enough exposure at Meta to stand for adminship at Meta (adminship on another Wikimedia project is a prerequisite).

<p>Hi. I noticed you're presently opposing <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_BozMo_6414.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/BozMo">BozMo's AfD</a>: <i>"Oppose for Now per Ganfon"</i> Ganfon opposed based on inexperience, yet BozMo's got <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/Tool1/wannabe_kate?username=BozMo&amp;site=en.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/Tool1/wannabe_kate?username=BozMo&amp;site=en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">4800+ edits</a> at this point. I'm worried about the edit count threshold for RfAs continuing to creep higher and the precedent this RfA might set.</p>
<p>I also noticed several of the early comments were made when the edit history reporting function was briefly disrupted and BozMo's edit count was under-reported.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the minimum experience an RfA candidate should have? --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A. B.</a> <a href="../../../a/2E/_/User_talk%7EA._B._1d00.html" title="User talk:A. B."><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:07, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Honestly, I am well aware that Ganfon changed to Support because of the messed up edit count. For me, generally, if they are well-spread, around 2-to-3000 are good for me. However, if they are concentrated too much in, say, the Mainspace, then I may be inclined to oppose, since admins need to work mostly in the Wiki-space. The main reason I opposed on the RfA was, as you noted, that the edit count reporting function was not working correctly. Had I noticed this before the RfA closed, I would have most likele changed to a support&#160;!vote. The inexperience factor has been creeping up <i>a lot</i> in recent RfAs, and I think that it is a precedent that is not necessarily a good one. What I generally look for is my aforementioned 2-to-3000 well-spread edits, as well as where the edits are made. I believe that others do not view RfA criteria as being much beyond edit counts and the "requisite" 1FA; however, IMHO, bureaucrats should not look at counts through "Oppose per inexperience" that were agreed with; that they should look for where and how large those edits were made.

<dd>No, not a whole lot; I only mentioned it because he was on IRC before and well after you posted it. After all, his user page did say "cocks" on one time, and we ridiculed him for that. He was on IRC this morning disputing the bot edit and the one by Kukini, saying that they could both be removed because they were not relevant, and we reached community consensus supporting the blanking of his talk page. He did say he had a registered account on here, but I don't know what his user name is. The npa1 message is relevant; he probably just needs to grow up before he comes back.

<p>Thanks... I just did a quick-and-dirty; it should catch anything that has "global", then "warming", and then "awareness2007", even if there are characters between, so that gets most of them...

<p>Hi, I'm new to wikipedia and thought I was posting useful, relevant info - that you have removed and threatened with permanent removal...why? Other local info sites have not been removed, ours has good local info relevant to anyone looking on the page about our town...so what's the problem? why doesthat classify it as spam?

<p>Hey A. B.,</p>
<p>I thought I'd give you some tips on how to find spam in Wikipedia and remove it, hoping you would know the proper way to pass this on to other spam guards.</p>
<p>If you use wikiseek.com to look for viagra, like <a href="http://wikiseek.com/results.php?q=viagra" class="external text" title="http://wikiseek.com/results.php?q=viagra" rel="nofollow">this</a>, you'll find loads of pages which are apparently somehow linked from WikiPedia. For instance, take the 4th result. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALinksearch&amp;target=eurasiascout.org" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALinksearch&amp;target=eurasiascout.org" rel="nofollow">weblink search</a> will show you that this page is linked from <a href="../../../w/o/s/WOSM-Eurasian_Region_0342.html" title="WOSM-Eurasian Region">WOSM-Eurasian_Region</a>. Now, go there, go to the external link section, and click on the link to it. It will say "site is under reconstruction!!!". Now if this alone isn't enough reason to remove the link, use the Firefox webdeveloper extension, and disable CSS for that page. You will then see that it is absolutely LOADED with links for phentermine, viagra, etc. etc.</p>
<p>The lessons learned here:</p>
<ul>
<li>use WikiSeek, it sucks as a search engine because of all the spam in it, but for spam admins, it's a hell of a way to seek and destroy spam;</li>
<li><b>always</b> disable CSS and JavaScript when checking out a page, people will do their best to hide those links from you.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's a little beany, so I'm posting it here for you to remove at your discretion. Using Wikiseek is great, but what to do about a website like this: <a href="http://www.lindacroppformayor.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lindacroppformayor.com/" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. It is linked to the Linda Cropp article. When you look at the source, it is stuffed with spammy links. Should the link be removed on these grounds, or should it remain, since it might not benefit the spammed links.

<li>Possibilities:
<ul>
<li>Ms. Cropp's campaign used a web designer who had a deal going on the side</li>
<li>Someone hacked her site (I don't know how you do that)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Perhaps the nature of the source code will give you some clues (if you track the spam site ownership back to Ms. Cropp's webmaster for instance)</li>
