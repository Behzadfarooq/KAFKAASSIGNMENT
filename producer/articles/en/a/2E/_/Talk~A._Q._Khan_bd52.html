<p>i'm doubtful about</p>

<p>Why did the world best inteligence service, the CIA, kept a blind eye to Khan's activities. Was it because Pakistan was helping the proxies in Afghanistan against the former USSR?</p>
<p>Qadeer's activities was visible to all, but the question is that is he really important to waste time with him&#160;? I think not, he was just a show person, used by Government of Pakistan and American Agencies to play their dirty games, the real person was M. Qadir Hussain, who actually develope and invented the real process, that helps Pakistan and America to develope their Atomic Programm! strange, but true, why, answer can be found on the US Patent Offic's web site where the Patent's number 5417944.. all questions will be solved.</p>
<dl>
<dd>First question: yes, probably. Pakistan has been very important geopolitically for the past forty years and that is most likely why it has not come into any real problems despite all of this stuff. As for the bit about the patent: I'm pretty sure that is not a design which is used by proliferators (it is a liquid centrifuge; most uranium separation is done with gaseous centrifuges). I don't know of what use the liquid one would be for but my guess is that it is for enriching very small samples. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 21:44, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The process is in liquid form, it is correct, but why it is so important, because in normal gaseous centrifuges method, enriching uranium, is far more difficult and constly and in many thousand steps!, by this method, the uranium can be separated in just on single stage and with 100% purity, where gesious method gives almost 99% purity. It is why, during the period from 1970 till late 80s when American and other government was so sure that with the normal method Pakistan will never be able to enrich much uranium to develope a tactical weapon, but when they learned about this process and prooved that it is as simple and easy that country like Pakistan (a relatively poor country) can have many tactical nuke devices, they stoped aid and put santions. Now to your second guess, that only a small amount can be get, it is also not correct, with this I think a well equiped labortary can get as much as they want. Recently US Government signed an agreement with Indian Government to give India Civilian nuclear technology, you think why Pakistan and China have concern, it is simple, this could be handed over to India, an arch rivel of Pakistan, it is just a simple message for pakistnies that, well it will too long I guess.. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 23:43, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My point is that nobody seems to use the liquid method for large-scale enrichment, and there is probably a good reason for that that one comes up across if one actually tries to. Not being an engineer, I don't know what that reason is, but I bet if you asked at the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7EReference_Desk_Science_58c4.html" title="Wikipedia:Reference Desk/Science">Wikipedia:Reference Desk/Science</a> they would take a good guess. To my knowledge nobody has ever plausibly alleged that the Pakistanis used a liquid method; they did in fact upgrade their centrifuges to Pak-2s at some point which were much more efficient than their earlier ones, but they were still gaseous. My suspicion about why gaseous is used is because it is easier to chain it together with other centrifuges as part of a large system. Your claim of it being done in "one step" sounds nonsensical -- the reason it takes thousands of gaseous centrifuges is because of the amount of gas you have to put into it all (no matter how efficient your centrifuge is, you can't enrich more U-235 out of the sample than is actually in it). --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 23:47, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am also not an expert on subject, I tried to read between the lines, for me it is clear not to mention this method, being used by Pakistanies just to keep pressure away from them, because like said earlier with this cover no one could ever belief them, and treat them normally. Secondly it is also quit possible that nobody ever used this method before Pakistanies, or may never thaught to be possible that is why there is no effort in this matter. Hence after reveling this to us patent office, the scope and reality comes in light.. I think it is always good, as a government not to tell truth.. because it will bring no benefits to them.. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 23:53, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well alright then. I find it pretty unlikely that this would be somehow purposely kept secret despite the fact that a paper was granted for the process in 1995. The U.S. Patent Office is not usually where foreign powers store secrets. In any case, though, there were apparently a few stories about this in the <i>New York Times</i> in 1995, where Hussain was claiming that Khan stole the design from him. A number of experts quoted in the article said the liquid process wouldn't work, though. But it is interesting nonetheless, and I thank you for pointing the story out to me. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 01:33, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>One more thing i like to add here, that in order to get a US Patent Office Patent, you have to proove your claim and they just can not give you a patent with false claims.. specially in this subject, I do not belief that they did not test this.. offcourse they have issued after their satisfaction and results are written in the end.. where you can read also that this process can "<i>give 100% purity in one single step and it is much more cost effective"</i> <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 23:58, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's not entirely true. The examiner has to believe that it is possible to work, yes, but no "proof" need be demonstrated, and examiners are usually willing to give some leeway in ambiguous situations (after all, by definition the work is meant to be beyond the "state of the art"). Apparently the head of the DOE office of declassification reviewed the patent (as they do with bomb-related patents) and decided not to censor it because they didn't think it could be used for bomb-making purposes at all. (This is from that New York Times article I was referring to above.) There are lots of things patented which don't or couldn't work at all, much less as efficiently as they claim to, such as perpetual motion machines. The parts that the patent examiners care the most about are the "claims" section, not whatever hyperbolic things the author throws in to justify their invention as being different than that which came before it (all invention descriptions sound like that). --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 01:33, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I read the the patent details on the website and I do not found any details in it, for me it is quit censored artical, you just read very few fruitful details of the method, I think it was censored. Secondly, your claim that the examiners are usually willing to give some leeway is just a statement without any proove, if its work like that, then the office may had been closed for long time before, why, most patents application go through a Patent lawer and these are some of the best lawers in the country, if some one just get a patent without any problem, some one can get them in court. It is not a perpetual motion machine, which according to current physical laws, not possible, so whenever a patent claim about a possible "perpetual motion machine" come for review, the examiner naturally treat it not a perpetual motion machine, while according to his physical knowledge, it is not possible. Thats is why, I think there are no patent with perpetual motion machine or may be 1 or 2.. However, about this process, how they tested or they belief it or not, i have no information, but intresting thing was not the patent request of grant of it, but the fuss was made on it, if there is no danger then why so much fuss both in Pakistan and America.. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 23:23, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think the patent was censored—it reads like any patent does, going into detail in some places and keeping it vague at others (patents usually try to be as vague and general as possible so they cover as many specific instances of usage as possible). This is a very well-known technique in U.S. patent practices -- if you don't believe me I'd be happy to provide references. I do not mean to underestimate the difficulty of getting a patent or passing through non-working patents, but the idea that every patentee must prove that their patent actually works is not true. I have no doubt that you could, in theory, use liquid UF4 in a centrifuge of some sort, but I doubt, as do the experts, that you can use this as a means of bomb enrichment, or that it is an efficient means for doing so. There are lots of patents for things which cannot work. Our page on perpetual motion machines has a list of a few of the patents on them (<a href="../../../p/e/r/Perpetual_motion_machine.html#Patents" title="Perpetual motion machine">Perpetual_motion_machine#Patents</a>). Check them out -- they read like any other patent and managed to fool the examiner (they do not advertise that they are perpetual motion machines, of course). The fuss was made because Hussain made the fuss -- after he got the patent he made a big deal about how Khan had stolen it from him, etc. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 02:28, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ok if it was not the method Pakistanies used, then what..&#160;? It is still the only Mulsim Country with nukes in hand, and a large part of this was develope was them, may be designing a Bomb may have been provided by chines. But still the question remains&#160;? Was Pakistan able 20 years ago, with the technology available at that time with so much political and logistical problem to develope something like that. A point to mention here that they tested in 1998 urinum based devices, where India test a plutonium device. I doubt on it that the cetrefugel system was designed by Pakistanies was capable of enriching enough urenium to produce at least 10 or so devices that may be they have. Second the fuss was made by Qadir Hussain or someone else, still was noticeable. To my current knowledge he is still under a so called exit control list which allow government to block any international departure of any person. Why they are afraid him to leave the country if he is not important <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 16:14, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is a Wikipedia talk page and not a message board where issues like US intention behind a specific involvement could be discussed US has given statements (as mentioned in the article) on Dr. Qadeer's issue which proves American involvement Judging their motive behind the intention , is not the job of Wikipedia , whose purpose is to report and not to decide</p>

<p>With the inclusion of US , Pakistani governments views on the person and mention of his role in Pakistan's Iran's and Libya's nuclear programme, this article is still and truely far from being complete , until we include the views of Pakistanis on the person.</p>
<p>He might be a condemned nuclear black marketter for many , but for his own people he is still a saviour and a hero , who for them has saved them and their existence as a nation.</p>
<p>Though I do agree, that such a section would put this article at logger heads with the Wikipedias NPOV policy , but if we perhaps mention opinion polls on the matter conducted by reputable and respected agencies&#160;; then this condition of the wikipedia could be ful filled. Given the fact that the Pakistani President called him a 'national hero for an ordinary Pakistani " in the press conference mentioned in the article, inclusion of this section will be a lot more easier.</p>
<p>I could have created a section on this on my own ,but i wanted to discuss the matter with my fellow wikipedian members before doing such a thing&#160;; as I dont want to impose my will on this article but find a consenses on it.</p>

<li>Sir like you said you disagree so its mean there is a doubt on the subject. I think Wikipedia policy is clear, about personal motives and openions. If you put this section here, then it will give right for other people to add something similar here and we have whole new pendorabox. I think we can talk such things here on this page, but adding such section on this Artical will not help. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 22:55, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Personally, I'm not sure why there's a dispute in the first place. Unless the author is implying something negative, the line is a note on historical context and a legitimate statement. While I agree that a certain level of consistency is to be expected, this is a rather minor point to quibble over. Why is this a concern to you? Moonsword 02:59, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is basically my response. There are no rules for this because we don't make rules for small and arbitrary things. I think it is a useful bit of context but I'm tired of reinserting it. I will, however, continue to insist that his place of birth be included, which some nationalist of some sort (do the Pakistanis not want to acknowledge that he, like many in Pakistan, were originally born in India? Or do the Indians not want to be associated with him? I have no idea) continues to remove without comment. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 23:15, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ol>
<li>I came to the accompanying bio bcz it appeared on Cat LP to be mispiped, and i had not the slightest suspician that it is about the famous <a href="../../../a/2E/q/A.Q._Khan_d857.html" title="A.Q. Khan">A.Q. Khan</a>. No doubt he is widely known in at least Pakistan by 3 spelled out names, but that is not what article titles on WP reflect. His international significance outweighs his (obviously substantial) national significance, and his common name internationally uses the intials. The article must be <a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._Q._Khan_a5c0.html" title="A. Q. Khan">A. Q. Khan</a> and the full name a Rdr to it.</li>
<li>The piping of several of his Cats with "|Abdul Qadeer]]" appears to reflect simply misunderstanding of what the piping of Cats is for. If i am mistaken in piping all his Cats with "|Khan, A. Q.]]", fix it again, but the explanation of why i'm wrong
<ul>
<li>absolutely must appear here,</li>
<li>probably would imply the worth of some low-profile related info in the bio, and</li>
