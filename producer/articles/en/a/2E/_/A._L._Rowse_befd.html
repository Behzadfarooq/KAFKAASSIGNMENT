<p>Alfred Leslie Rowse was born in Tregonissey near <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Austell_e7db.html" title="St Austell">St Austell</a>, Cornwall, the son of Richard Rowse, a china clay worker, and Annie (née Vanson). His parents were poor and semi-illiterate but despite his humble origins, he won a place at St. Austell Grammar School and then a <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholar.html" title="Scholar">scholarship</a> to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christ_Church%2C_Oxford_3eb9.html" title="Christ Church, Oxford">Christ Church</a>, <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_9d97.html" title="Oxford University">Oxford</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>. He was encouraged in his pursuit of an academic career by fellow Cornish man of letters Sir Arthur <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quiller-Couch_5c7d.html" title="Quiller-Couch">Quiller-Couch</a> (1863-1944) who recognised his ability from an early age.</p>
<p>Rowse had planned to study English literature, having developed an early love of poetry, but was persuaded to read history. Although he had the reputation of a "swatopotumus", he was a popular under-graduate and made many friendships that lasted for life. He graduated with first class honours in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1925.html" title="1925">1925</a> and was elected a Fellow of <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Souls_College%2C_Oxford_de36.html" title="All Souls College, Oxford">All Souls College</a> the same year, the first such Fellow from a working-class background. In 1929, he was awarded his <a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_of_Arts_%28Oxbridge%29_79b7.html" title="Master of Arts (Oxbridge)">Master of Arts</a> degree, and in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a> was appointed lecturer at <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merton_College_cbf7.html" title="Merton College">Merton College</a>, where he stayed until <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>, he contested the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament.html" title="Parliament">parliamentary</a> seat of <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penryn_and_Falmouth_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_c543.html" title="Penryn and Falmouth (UK Parliament constituency)">Penryn and Falmouth</a> for the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a>, but was unsuccessful and became a lecturer at the <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_School_of_Economics_2cfc.html" title="London School of Economics">London School of Economics</a>.</p>
<p>In the general election of <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a> he again proved unsuccessful, and chose to continue his career at Oxford becoming Sub-Warden of All Souls College. In 1952, he failed in his candidacy for election as Warden against John Sparrow (1906-92) and shortly afterwards began his regular trips to the Huntingdon LIbrary in California where for many years he was a Senior Research Fellow. He received a <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctorate.html" title="Doctorate">doctorate</a> (D. Litt.) from Oxford University in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1953.html" title="1953">1953</a>. After delivering the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Academy_dea7.html" title="British Academy">British Academy</a>'s 1957 Raleigh Lecture on History about Sir Richard Grenville's place in English history he became a Fellow of the Academy in 1958. Despite his academic and social success, he remained proud of his Cornish roots. He retired from Oxford in 1973 to Trenarren House, his Cornish home, from where he remained active as writer, reviewer and conversationalist until immobilised by a stroke the year before his death. His ashes are buried in the Campdowns Cemetery, Charlestown, near <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Austell_e7db.html" title="St Austell">St Austell</a>. There is a commemorative plaque to him in <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truro_Cathedral_43e7.html" title="Truro Cathedral">Truro Cathedral</a> and a memorial stone on Black Head, overlooking <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Austell_e7db.html" title="St Austell">St Austell</a> Bay almost within sight of Trenarren.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._L._Rowse_befd.html" title="Edit section: Character">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Character</span></h3>
<p>Rowse published around 100 books. He became a celebrated author and lecturer from the 1940s and travelled widely, especially in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. He also published many popular articles in newspapers and magazines in Great Britain and the United States. His brilliance was widely recognised, and his knack for the sensational, as well as his academic boldness (which some considered to be irresponsible carelessness), sustained his reputation. His opinions on rival popular historians, such as <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Trevor-Roper_3f72.html" title="Hugh Trevor-Roper">Hugh Trevor-Roper</a> and <a href="../../../a/2E/j/A.J.P_Taylor_4208.html" title="A.J.P Taylor">A.J.P Taylor</a>, were expressed sometimes in very ripe terms.</p>
<p>In his later years, Rowse moved increasingly towards the political right, and many considered him to be part of the Tory tradition by the time he died. One of A. L. Rowse's life-long themes in his books and articles was his condemnation of the National Government's policy of <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeasement.html" title="Appeasement">appeasement</a> in the 1930s and the economic and political consequences for Great Britain of fighting a second war with Germany. Another was his horror at the degradation of standards in modern society. He is reported as saying&#160;: "This filthy twentieth century. I hate its guts".</p>

<p>Rowse wrote poetry all his life. He contributed poems to Public School Verse whilst at St Austell Grammar School. He also had verse published in <i>Oxford 1923</i>, <i>Oxford 1924</i>, and <i>Oxford 1925</i>. His collected poems <i>A Life</i> were published in 1981. The poetry is mainly autobiographical, descriptive of place (especially Cornwall) and people he knew and cared for, e.g. <i>The Progress of Love</i>, which describes his platonic love for Adam von Trott, a handsome and aristocratic German youth who studied at Oxford in the 1930s and who was later executed for his part in the July plot of 1944 to kill <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a>. Unusually for a British poet, Rowse wrote a great number of poems inspired by American scenery. He maintained that in writing poetry one could get to the truth of a matter rather more than in prose.</p>
<p>His first book was <i>On History, A Study of Present Tendencies</i> published in 1927 as the seventh volume of <a href="../../../k/e/g/Kegan_Paul_c32f.html" title="Kegan Paul">Kegan Paul</a>'s <i>Psyche Miniature General Series</i>. In 1931 he contributed to <a href="../../../t/2E/_/T._S._Eliot_4975.html" title="T. S. Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>'s quarterly review <i>The Criterion</i>. In 1935 he co-edited <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_G._Henderson_ef1a.html" title="Charles G. Henderson">Charles Henderson</a>'s <i>Essays in Cornish History</i> for the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarendon_Press_9e4f.html" title="Clarendon Press">Clarendon Press</a>. His best-seller was his first volume of autobiography A Cornish Childhood, first published by Jonathan Cape in 1942, that has gone on to sell nearly half a million copies worldwide. It describes his hard struggle to get to the bright lights of Oxford and his love/hate relationship with Cornwall. Highly readable, it contains some of his best prose.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._L._Rowse_befd.html" title="Edit section: Shakespearian Scholarship">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Shakespearian Scholarship</span></h3>
<p>Rowse's early works focus on <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixteenth_century.html" title="Sixteenth century">sixteenth century</a> England and his first full-length historical monograph, <i>Sir Richard Grenville of the Revenge</i> (1937), was a biography of a <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixteenth_century.html" title="Sixteenth century">sixteenth century</a> sailor. His next was <i>Tudor Cornwall</i> (1941), a lively detailed account of Cornish society in the 16th century. He consolidated his reputation with a one-volume general history of England, <i>The Spirit of English History</i> (1943), but his most important work was the historical trilogy <i>The Elizabethan Age</i>: <i>The England of Elizabeth</i> (1950), <i>The Expansion of Elizabethan England</i> (1955), and <i>The Elizabethan Renaissance</i> (1971-72), respectively examine the society, overseas exploration, and culture of late sixteenth century England.</p>
<p>In 1963 Rowse began to concentrate on Shakespeare, starting with a biography in which he claimed to have dated all the sonnets, identified <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Marlowe_6b85.html" title="Christopher Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a> as the suitor's rival and solved all but one of the other problems posed by the sonnets. His failure to acknowledge his reliance upon the work of other scholars alienated some of his peers, but he won popular acclaim. In 1973 he published <i>Shakespeare the Man</i>, in which he claimed to have solved the final problem - the identity of the '<a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Lady_f818.html" title="Dark Lady">Dark Lady</a>': from a <a href="../../../c/l/o/Close_reading.html" title="Close reading">close reading</a> of the sonnets and the diaries of <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Forman_307e.html" title="Simon Forman">Simon Forman</a>, he asserted that she must have been <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emilia_Lanier_18ff.html" title="Emilia Lanier">Emilia Lanier</a>, whose poems he would later collect.</p>
<p>Rowse's discoveries about Shakespeare's sonnets amount to the following:</p>
<p>1. The Fair Youth was the 19-year old <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Wriothesley%2C_3rd_Earl_of_Southampton_335f.html" title="Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton">Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton</a>, extremely handsome and very bisexual.</p>
<p>2. The sonnets were written 1592-1594/5.</p>
<p>3. The "rival poet" was the famously homosexual <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Marlowe_6b85.html" title="Christopher Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a>.</p>
<p>4. The Dark Lady was Emilia Lanier.</p>
<p>5. Christopher Marlowe's death is recorded in the sonnets.</p>
<p>6. Shakespeare was an extremely heterosexual man, who was faced with a very unusual situation when the handsome, young, bisexual Earl of Southampton fell in love with him.</p>
<p>As a result of this, Sonnet XX can now be read in a very new way. It is Shakespeare making a courtly and witty refusal of the young Henry Wriothesley.</p>
<p>Current scholarly opinion regarding Rowse's theories about the sonnets seem to fall into two camps: either a); He is absolutely wrong or b); He hasn't told us anything new and has neglected to mention the contributions of others to the solutions he presented.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, conventional wisdom continues to maintain that Shakespeare was homosexual, or bisexual, and that the publisher's dedication to a certain "Master W.H." somehow provides the name of Shakespeare's gay lover.</p>
<p>The name of Shakespeare's fair youth was "Lord H.W." -- never, ever, Master (the title of a Knight).</p>
<p>Rowse did not tolerate fools, but he also did not make such assertions without supplying reasons. In the case of Shakespeare, he noted that Shakespeare had managed to get an older woman pregnant by the time he was 18, and was consequently obliged to marry her. Moreover, he had saddled himself with three children by the time he was 21. In the sonnets, Shakespeare's explicit erotic interest lies with the Dark Lady; he obsesses about her. As anyone can figure out, Shakespeare was still married and therefore carrying on an extramarital affair. This sort of behaviour is, to put it mildly, not typical of a gay man. Human sexuality was the subject of another of his controversial books: <i>Homosexuals In History</i> (1977)</p>

<p>He wrote other biographies of English historical and literary figures and many other histories. Among his most interesting biographies are the ones of Shakespeare, Marlowe, and Southampton, the major players in the sonnets. A devoted cat-lover, he also wrote the biographies of several cats who came to live with him at Trenarren claiming that it was as much a challenge to write the biography of a favourite cat as it was a Queen of England. He also published a number of short stories, mainly about Cornwall, of interest more for their thinly-veiled autobiographical resonances than their literary merit. His last book, <i>My View of Shakespeare</i>, published in 1996, summed up his life-time's appreciation of <i>The Bard of Stratford</i>. The book was dedicated <i>"To HRH the Prince of Wales in common devotion to William Shakespeare".</i></p>

<p>Rowse was a Fellow of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Historical_Society_c522.html" title="Royal Historical Society">Royal Historical Society</a>. He was awarded an honorary D.Litt by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Exeter_eb13.html" title="University of Exeter">University of Exeter</a> in 1960 and a D.C.L. by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_New_Brunswick_1406.html" title="University of New Brunswick">University of New Brunswick</a>, Fredericton, Canada, the same year. He was elected to the <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athenaeum.html" title="Athenaeum">Athenaeum</a> under Rule II in 1972, received the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benson_Medal_63bd.html" title="Benson Medal">Benson Medal</a> of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Society_of_Literature_b27a.html" title="Royal Society of Literature">Royal Society of Literature</a> in 1982 and was made a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Companion_of_Honour_b67a.html" title="Companion of Honour">Companion of Honour</a> (somewhat belatedly) in the 1997 New Years' Honours List.

<p>One of Rowse's great enthusiasms was collecting books, and he owned many first editions, many of them bearing his acerbic annotations. For example, his copy of the January 1924 edition of <i>The Adelphi</i> magazine edited by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Middleton_Murry_df17.html" title="John Middleton Murry">John Middleton Murry</a> bears a pencilled note after Murry's poem <i>In Memory of Katherine Mansfield</i>: 'Sentimental gush on the part of JMM. And a bad poem. A.L.R.'</p>
<p>Upon his death in 1997 he bequeathed his book collection to the University of Exeter, and his personal archive of manuscripts, diaries, and correspondence. In 1998 the University Librarian selected about sixty books from Rowse’s own working library and a complete set of his published books. The Royal Institution of Cornwall selected some of the remaining books, and the rest were sold via two book dealers.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._L._Rowse_befd.html" title="Edit section: Posthumous reputation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Posthumous reputation</span></h3>
<p>Rowse was a hoarder and boasted that his unpublished diaries, journals, letters and pocket books would keep a Rowse industry going long after his death à la <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boswell.html" title="Boswell">Boswell</a> or <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horace_Walpole_6b44.html" title="Horace Walpole">Horace Walpole</a>. The full force of this industry has yet to get underway: extracts chosen from his diaries for posthumous publication in 2003 proved disappointing as it appeared that most of the more interesting material had already been quarried by Rowse himself for publication in his lifetime and the remainder seemed somewhat banal. It remains to be seen whether there is scope for a more lively (and possibly controversial) edition of diary extracts. A collected edition of Rowse's many letters has yet to be undertaken. Meanwhile, his posthumous academic reputation is on the rise. In books such as <i>Tudor Cornwall</i> and <i>The Expansion of Elizabethan England</i> he can be seen as a pioneer of the new British historiography that recognises the cultural differences of the constituent parts of the British Isles. Several of his best books remain in print or have been reprinted.</p>

<p>As well as his own appearances on radio and television, Rowse has been depicted in various TV drama documentaries about British politics in the 1930s and appeasement.</p>
