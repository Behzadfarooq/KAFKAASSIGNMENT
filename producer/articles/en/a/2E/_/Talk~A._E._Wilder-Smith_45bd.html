<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/_/Talk%7EA._E._Wilder-Smith_45bd.html" title="Edit section: NPOV tag.">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">NPOV tag.</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Duncharris</a>, the NPOV tag incorporates text that says, "See discussion on the talk page". But there's no discussion. Can you elaborate, please? I don't see anything particularly non-neutral here. I agree that Wilder-Smith's views are controversial. But the article seems quite careful to neither agree nor disagree with those views. In what way is the article biased, in your view?</p>
<p>Perhaps I should have simply removed the NPOV tag, but I'm curious to find out what the problem is. <a href="../../../a/c/w/User%7EACW_0ce5.html" title="User:ACW">ACW</a> 20:39, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The NPOV tag stays into the problems are sorted out.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Basically there are two issues, the first of NPOV and the second that the article is a load of drivel.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article does not try to explain what Wilder-Smith's alternative to the ToE might be, though from a cursory glance around the web, it's just the usual claptrap. The article then fails to mention explicitly that such nonsense it is rejected as pseudoscience.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Instead, the article goes straight into the first <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">appeal to authority</a> based on credentials. It then goes straight into a second appeal to authority based on a quote from a "professor" at a "small private academy in Germany".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now, if he was a significant player in the anti-evolution movement he would have created controversy. I have not heard of him, (and I lurk at talk.origins and so I've heard of most of them).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We have not established his importance, and it is possible that he is just another Internet kook. So what are his affiliations (AiG? ICR? Discovery Institute?) where is his publicity material, etc. <a href="../../../d/u/n/User%7EDuncharris_e9cb.html" title="User:Duncharris">Dunc</a>|<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDuncharris_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Duncharris">â˜º</a> 23:38, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So the article is not neutral because you think he is a kook and that creation science is drivel? It sounds like you are the evolutionist-extremist here who is ultra-biased. The article is fine. Stupid putting the tag on IMHO. Oh well.</dd>

<dd>The above paragraph was inserted, <i>not by me</i>, a week or so after I responded to Dunc in the following paragraph. It was unattributed, and might be mistakenly read to be part of my response. It was not, and I wish the author of the previous paragraph had made that clearer. I do not think Dunc is an extremist, biased, or stupid. <a href="../../../a/c/w/User%7EACW_0ce5.html" title="User:ACW">ACW</a> 16:39, 8 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, Wilder Smith dates back to the fifties, so he is definitely not an "Internet kook". I heard his name from creationists a few times. I actually did once read a book written by him, and it <b>is</b> drivel, but not as bad as the average creationist drivel. I'll try to improve the article soon. --<a href="../../../h/o/b/User%7EHob_Gadling_e6d2.html" title="User:Hob Gadling">Hob Gadling</a> 12:01, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I read one of his books about twenty years ago- heard him give a lecture somewhere in Houston, Texas. He was well-spoken, but seemed to me (an evolutionist) to have nothing new to say. Nevertheless, the article seems accurate to me. Whether he was as "famous" as some other creationists is hard to say; though that seems beside the point from what I understand of Wikipedia.--JohnRodgers 04:52, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The problem is that for many evolutionist there is nothing real new, because in their opinion, everything is already said - evolution is a fact, only the details have to be discussed/discovered. That is a great mistake. By the way, Wilder Smith was not a kind of scientist whose books or lectures had the kind of "nothing new", he killed evolution just at the root - and this is surely one fact why people do not want to know him.--Sebastian Hirsch (alias Seppel) 21:21, 5 February 2006</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm pretty sure that among this community of people of good will, we can come up with a description of this guy that (a) sticks to facts; (b) is informative; and (c) satisfies both evolution-supporters and evolution-skeptics as to neutrality. Can we give it a try? I remind evolution-supporters that merely describing someone's opinions does not mean that we agree with them; I remind evolution-skeptics that describing those opinions as out of the scientific mainstream does not mean we disagree with them. <a href="../../../a/c/w/User%7EACW_0ce5.html" title="User:ACW">ACW</a> 21:40, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Since the article appears non-controversial and the discussion here seems to reflect that, and since there has been no discussion in a long time suggesting further disagreement, the tag is removed.

<p>I'm on the pro-evolution side, but I agree with Steve Hart's action. Having said that, I'd like to point out some things in this article that raise my hackles a little bit. This hackle-raising is not of a sufficient level to make my NPOV-finger itch; it's just slightly annoying, and I wonder if I could get the cooperation of an evolution-skeptic or even a creationist to come up with wordings that would increase our total comfort with this article.</p>
<p>The article itself avoids stating an opinion about Wilder-Smith, because all the opinions that it contains are safely placed in the mouths of others, either explicitly (as in the extensive quote from Professor von Stockhausen), or implicitly ("widely recognized by creationists as ..."). If any of these opinions were espoused by the article itself, that would be clear NPOV; as it stands, neutrality is preserved at least in principle.</p>
<p>Notice that the article gives no <i>disapproving</i> opinions of Wilder-Smith, nor any links to sites critical of his opinions. The closest it comes is to note that Wilder-Smith's team lost a debate on votes. I should go find some countervailing quotes; I think about a hundred words on the other side would do a great deal to relieve the vague (<i>vague</i>, I said!) sense of bias that I still get from this article.</p>
<p>(Also ... that Stockhausen is really windy. Do we need all of it?)</p>

A quite disgusting citation from one of his books:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>"We know of no intermediate stages between invertebrate octopus and squid types and genuine vertebrates."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Which cannot be said to be a lie, since there are no such intermediates, but is surely dishonest, or at least, being overly optimistic, a signal of hardly believable incompentence from someone with his resumÃ© (just in case someone does not understands why, read the text in the link I gave; shortly, this specific intermediate is not predicted by evolutionary theories, but could be for creationisms, ironically). I think that we may found even creationist criticism against this sort of blatant dishonesty, more or less like AiG's site with "arguments we think creationists should not use". --<a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtremophile_092c.html" title="User:Extremophile">Extremophile</a> 04:28, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
