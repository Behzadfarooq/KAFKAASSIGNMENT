<p>Born in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Weston-super-Mare_49d9.html" title="Weston-super-Mare">Weston-super-Mare</a> and one of four children, A. V. Alexander was the son of Albert Alexander, a blacksmith and later engineer who had moved from his native <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wiltshire.html" title="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a> to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bristol.html" title="Bristol">Bristol</a> during the agricultural depression of the <a href="../../../1/8/6/1860s.html" title="1860s">1860s</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/7/1870s.html" title="1870s">1870s</a>, and Eliza Jane Thatcher, daughter of a policeman. He was named after both his father and Prince <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Victor_4d13.html" title="Albert Victor">Albert Victor</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_of_the_United_Kingdom_5e8e.html" title="Victoria of the United Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>'s eldest grandson, but he was known as "A. V." from a young age. His parents had settled in Weston when they married, but the family moved to Bristol after Albert Alexander's death in August <a href="../../../1/8/8/1886.html" title="1886">1886</a>. Alexander's mother worked as a corset-maker to provide for her children.</p>
<p>Alexander attended Barton Hill School from the age of three, at a cost of two pence per week. Against his mother's wishes, he chose not to continue to St. George's Higher Grade School in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1898.html" title="1898">1898</a>, feeling the increased weekly charge of six pence was too expensive and that he would get nothing more from school. He began work aged thirteen, first for a leather merchant, and five months later as a junior clerk with the Bristol School Board. In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1903.html" title="1903">1903</a> he transferred to <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset.html" title="Somerset">Somerset</a> County Council's newly formed <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_education_authority.html" title="Local education authority">local education authority</a>, where he worked in the School Management Department as a committee clerk. He was by this time a keen chorister and footballer, and a self-taught pianist.</p>
<p>Raised an <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican.html" title="Anglican">Anglican</a>, Alexander converted to <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptist_church.html" title="Baptist church">the Baptist movement</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a> after he married Esther Ellen Chapple, a school teacher and Baptist. They were married on 6 June 1908. Their daughter, Beatrix, was born in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a>, and their son lived from <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a>. He joined the Weston Co-operative Society and became treasurer of the local Young <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_%28UK%29_4ba9.html" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberal</a> Association in 1908, and the local <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trades_and_Labour_Council_5f3f.html" title="Trades and Labour Council">Trades and Labour Council</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a>. He was elected to the board of the Weston Co-op Society in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a>.</p>
<p>He volunteered for service when the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">First World War</a> began, but was not called-up until two years later. He joined the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artists%27_Rifles_0a51.html" title="Artists' Rifles">Artists' Rifles</a>, which principally served to train officers for assignment to other regiments. He trained in London and studied at <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magdalen_College%2C_Oxford_3b41.html" title="Magdalen College, Oxford">Magdalen College</a>, <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford.html" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, before earning his commission in December <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>. His health suffered during training, and he never saw active service, instead working as a posting officer in <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>. In November <a href="../../../1/9/1/1918.html" title="1918">1918</a> he was promoted to <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain.html" title="Captain">captain</a> and became an education officer, preparing wounded soldiers for civilian life. He was <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demobbed.html" title="Demobbed">demobbed</a> in late <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>. Within a year of returning home, he became vice-president of the Weston Co-op Society and secretary of the Somerset branch of <a href="../../../n/a/l/NALGO_01c5.html" title="NALGO">NALGO</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._V._Alexander%2C_1st_Earl_Alexander_of_Hillsborough_59a3.html" title="Edit section: Parliamentary career">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Parliamentary career</span></h2>
<p>In late <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>, Alexander applied for the position of Parliamentary Secretary to the <a href="../../../c/o/-/Co-operative_Party_e3f0.html" title="Co-operative Party">Co-operative Congress</a>. He was selected out of 104 candidates, moving to <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> that November, and would hold the job until <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a>. In this role, he directed the presentation of the Co-op's position and interests to government bodies and <a href="../../../m/p/s/MPs_cad2.html" title="MPs">MPs</a>. In July <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a> he campaigned directly to MPs to oppose a clause in the government's Finance Bill which would impose <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporation_Tax_8669.html" title="Corporation Tax">Corporation Tax</a> on Co-ops. The government, which had a large majority, was defeated by two votes. Shortly after this, the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield.html" title="Sheffield">Sheffield</a> branch of the Co-operative Party invited Alexander to be their Parliamentary candidate. He was duly elected for <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield_Hillsborough_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_e57b.html" title="Sheffield Hillsborough (UK Parliament constituency)">Hillsborough</a> in November <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1922_fe9d.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1922">1922</a>, one of only four Co-op MPs. He was re-elected in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1923_bf43.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1923">1923</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1924_0d47.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1924">1924</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1929_b015.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1929">1929</a>. He would continue to represent Sheffield, with one break, until 1950.</p>
<p>In his <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maiden_speech.html" title="Maiden speech">maiden speech</a>, Alexander criticised the Liberal Party for abandoning its progressive principles and championed economic theories that were central to the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party's</a> manifesto. The Labour leadership accepted him as a spokesman on a number of issues, though the Co-op was not affiliated to the Labour Party until <a href="../../../1/9/2/1927.html" title="1927">1927</a>. When Labour formed its first government in January <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramsay_Macdonald_871f.html" title="Ramsay Macdonald">Ramsay Macdonald</a> made Alexander <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_Under-Secretary_of_State_d572.html" title="Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State">Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State</a> to the <a href="../../../b/o/a/Board_of_Trade_7507.html" title="Board of Trade">Board of Trade</a>, under <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidney_Webb_d152.html" title="Sidney Webb">Sidney Webb</a> and <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmanuel_Shinwell_7cb8.html" title="Emmanuel Shinwell">Emmanuel Shinwell</a>. Alexander's responsibilities included the <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merchant_navy.html" title="Merchant navy">merchant navy</a>, and answering Parliamentary Questions on all trade matters. The Co-op's Parliamentary Committee had an acting secretary in Alexander's place whilst he was in government, but he continued to take part in appeals to ministers.</p>
<p>After the government fell in October 1924, Alexander returned to working for the Co-op full-time. He became well known for his testimonies before government committees, and used the Co-op's Parliamentary Committee to help co-ordinate responses to government action during the <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_General_Strike_1926_d5f3.html" title="UK General Strike 1926">General Strike</a>. In Parliament, he became a front bench spokesman on trade, staunchly criticising the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protectionist.html" title="Protectionist">protectionist</a> policies of the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer_78e8.html" title="Chancellor of the Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. He also spoke on agriculture, local government and on <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_security.html" title="Social security">social security</a>, where he called for increased welfare, citing the suffering of his own constituents during the depression. In early <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a>, Alexander applied for the position of General Secretary of the Co-operative Union, but was beaten by R. A. Palmer. Within weeks, he became a member of the <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabinet.html" title="Cabinet">cabinet</a> in the second Labour government.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._V._Alexander%2C_1st_Earl_Alexander_of_Hillsborough_59a3.html" title="Edit section: First Lord of the Admiralty">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First Lord of the Admiralty</span></h2>
<p>Although many had expected Alexander to be appointed <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_Board_of_Trade_df52.html" title="President of the Board of Trade">President of the Board of Trade</a>, this position went to <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Graham_%28UK_politician%29_49f8.html" title="William Graham (UK politician)">William Graham</a>, protege of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Snowden_29b7.html" title="Philip Snowden">Philip Snowden</a>. Instead, Alexander became <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Lord_of_the_Admiralty_bef6.html" title="First Lord of the Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>, the only Labour member to hold this position as a cabinet rank. The Admiralty was a political power in its own right, and usually able to resist pressure from the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treasury.html" title="Treasury">Treasury</a> and from <a href="../../../d/o/w/Downing_Street_d755.html" title="Downing Street">Downing Street</a>. Macdonald's primary concern was international disarmament, and Alexander persuaded the Admiralty to reduce their demands for new cruisers as a prelude to negotiations aimed at ending naval rivalry with the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S.A._a0be.html" title="U.S.A.">U.S.A.</a>. In January <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930.html" title="1930">1930</a>, a conference between the five major naval powers (Britain, the US, <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>) was held in London. This resulted in a treaty between Britain, America and Japan, to limit growth and maintain parity of their naval forces. In the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a>, Alexander and the Foreign Secretary, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Henderson_b5e4.html" title="Arthur Henderson">Arthur Henderson</a>, negotiated France and Italy's entry into the treaty. Though Alexander came into conflict with the admiralty over expansion of the fleet, he defended it against criticism of its spending and staffing levels. He also introduced a system to make it easier for working-class recruits to become officers. During the economic crisis in mid-1931, Alexander supported Snowden's defence of free trade against Macdonald and Henderson's proposals for protectionism, but sided with Henderson against Snowden and Macdonald's proposed cuts in government spending, especially unemployment benefit. He organised the cabinet opponents to the cuts, who advocated a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist.html" title="Socialist">socialist</a> economy.</p>
<p>Faced with a cabinet split, the Prime Minister formed a coalition with the Conservative and Liberal parties. Snowden and a few others Labour MPs stayed with Macdonald, but the party went into Opposition. Alexander was prominent on the Opposition front bench, leading attacks on the government's policies, but was careful not to exploit the widespread dissatisfaction with pay cuts in the armed forces (especially the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invergordon_Mutiny_d41d.html" title="Invergordon Mutiny">Invergordon Mutiny</a>), concerned that the military should not become involved in political matters. Effectively now number two after Henderson in the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_Labour_Party_d1cd.html" title="Parliamentary Labour Party">Parliamentary Labour Party</a>, he was being talked of as a future leader. Both Alexander and Henderson lost their seats in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1931_1edb.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1931">1931 General Election</a>. Henderson was succeeded by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Lansbury_537b.html" title="George Lansbury">George Lansbury</a>, and Alexander's contemporary, <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clement_Attlee_cce2.html" title="Clement Attlee">Clement Attlee</a>, became deputy leader.</p>
<p>For the next four years, Alexander's main role was again as the Co-op's Parliamentary Secretary. He led opposition to renewed government plans to impose Corporation Tax on co-op stores, a fight that was lost this time with the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a> Finance Bill. He also worked to have consumer interests represented on the new agricultural marketing boards. He was active in the Brotherhood movement (an organisation for <a href="../../../n/o/n/Nonconformists.html" title="Nonconformists">nonconformists</a>), spoke at rallies for the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Nations_d214.html" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>, wrote columns for Reynolds' News and gave lectures on the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>. Regaining his Hillsborough seat in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>, Alexander became a front bench spokesman on trade and foreign affairs. Attlee, now leader of the PLP, asked him to join a new defence committee, working with Shinwell and <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Lawson_e080.html" title="Jack Lawson">Jack Lawson</a> to reverse the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifism.html" title="Pacifism">pacifist</a> ideals which had prevailed under Lansbury. Alexander had been warning of the dangers posed by <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism.html" title="Fascism">fascism</a> for several years, and criticised the government's policy of <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeasement.html" title="Appeasement">appeasement</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>, with <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Dalton_5262.html" title="Hugh Dalton">Hugh Dalton</a> and Arnold Lees-Smith, he persuaded the PLP to put aside its mistrust of the Baldwin government and support the Service Estimates Bill which began rearmament. In October <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a>, he closed the debate on the <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munich_Pact_b810.html" title="Munich Pact">Munich Pact</a>, attacking the government's abandonment of the <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudeten.html" title="Sudeten">Sudeten</a> Germans.</p>

<p>Following the outbreak of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, Alexander, like all leading Labour figures, opposed forming a <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coalition.html" title="Coalition">coalition</a> government under <a href="../../../n/e/v/Neville_Chamberlain_8a10.html" title="Neville Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a>. Alexander firmly believed that <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> should replace Chamberlain as Prime Minister. He worked with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Greenwood_5698.html" title="Arthur Greenwood">Arthur Greenwood</a>, and against <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herbert_Stanley_Morrison_b555.html" title="Herbert Stanley Morrison">Herbert Morrison</a>, who favoured <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Wood%2C_1st_Earl_of_Halifax_d884.html" title="Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax">Lord Halifax</a> as successor, to convince Attlee and the party's <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Executive_Committee_56cc.html" title="National Executive Committee">Executive</a> to support Churchill. In the closing days of April <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940.html" title="1940">1940</a>, Churchill met with Alexander, <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clement_Attlee_cce2.html" title="Clement Attlee">Clement Attlee</a> and Sir <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archibald_Sinclair%2C_1st_Viscount_Thurso_d61b.html" title="Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso">Archibald Sinclair</a> to discuss the possibilities for a coalition government. Halifax's friend, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Channon_81d9.html" title="Henry Channon">Chips Channon</a>, described this as Churchill prematurely forming his cabinet in the expectation of becoming PM. Two weeks later, on <a href="../../../1/0/t/10th_May_703e.html" title="10th May">10th May</a>, Churchill was Prime Minister of a coalition government; after forming his War Cabinet, which included Attlee and Greenwood, he invited Alexander and Sinclair, along with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Eden_2907.html" title="Anthony Eden">Anthony Eden</a>, to head the three service ministries.</p>
<p>Alexander returned to the Admiralty as First Lord, giving the Admirals practical ways of following Churchill's inspiring leadership and acting as their advocate when they clashed with the Prime Minister. He was committed to the administrative duties of his role, often sleeping in his office, but also took a keen interest in the welfare of sailors. He joined an <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arctic_Convoys_677c.html" title="Arctic Convoys">Arctic Convoy</a> in 1942, and visited troops a few days after <a href="../../../d/-/d/D-Day_72ea.html" title="D-Day">D-Day</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1944.html" title="1944">1944</a>, the first British minister in France since the occupation in 1940. His radio broadcasts and public appearance boosted moral and made him very popular inside and outside the service. As a working-class politician in a top position, he was an important figure for national unity. He had regular meetings with Churchill when in London, acting as an advisor; they were good friends and Churchill arranged for Alexander to receive an <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honorary_Degree_5883.html" title="Honorary Degree">Honorary Degree</a> from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Bristol_9e35.html" title="University of Bristol">University of Bristol</a>, of which Churchill was Chancellor. However, Alexander firmly supported Labour's withdrawal from the coalition in May <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, following victory in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. Campaigning in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1945_2336.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1945">election in July</a>, he drew a sharp distinction between Churchill and the Conservative Party, suggesting that the Tories would sideline the wartime leader as they had done <a href="../../../l/l/o/Lloyd_George_55bd.html" title="Lloyd George">Lloyd George</a>.</p>
<p>A member of the Cabinet following Labour's victory, Alexander strongly supported the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreign_Secretary_5431.html" title="Foreign Secretary">Foreign Secretary</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Bevin_13aa.html" title="Ernest Bevin">Ernest Bevin</a>, sharing his goals of maintaining Britain's influence and opposing the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. Britain's wartime ally was admired at the time, and his outspoken criticisms of Russia lessened Alexander's popularity. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a> he deputised for Bevin at the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Peace_Treaties%2C_1947_2efe.html" title="Paris Peace Treaties, 1947">Paris Peace Conference</a>, and was part of the Cabinet delegation to <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, under <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stafford_Cripps_72db.html" title="Stafford Cripps">Stafford Cripps</a>, exploring possibilities for independence. At the end of 1946 he became Minister of Defence, a role previously held only by Prime Ministers. Responsible for all three armed services, he often clashed with the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_of_the_Imperial_General_Staff_0c5c.html" title="Chief of the Imperial General Staff">Chief of the Imperial General Staff</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Montgomery_2915.html" title="Bernard Montgomery">Lord Montgomery</a>. He was responsible for formulating the system of <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Service_0445.html" title="National Service">National Service</a> and faced a protracted fight against Labour backbenchers who opposed the continuation of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscription.html" title="Conscription">conscription</a> in peacetime. In January <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a> he was one of six ministers on the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gen_75_Committee_c907.html" title="Gen 75 Committee">Gen 75 Committee</a> that secretly authorised Britain's <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_nuclear_weapons.html" title="History of nuclear weapons">nuclear programme</a>; in March he was in the negotiations for the Treaty of Dunkirk, laying the foundations for <a href="../../../n/a/t/NATO_bffc.html" title="NATO">NATO</a>. As the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> began, Alexander's criticisms of the USSR gained wider acceptance. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> he became a <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_the_City_8ba4.html" title="Freedom of the City">Freeman</a> of the City of <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheffield.html" title="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/_/A._V._Alexander%2C_1st_Earl_Alexander_of_Hillsborough_59a3.html" title="Edit section: Leader in the Lords">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Leader in the Lords</span></h2>
<p>A. V. Alexander decided not to seek re-election in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1950_5ee5.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1950">1950 General Election</a>. He retired from the Commons and was created <b>Viscount Alexander of Hillsborough</b>, of Hillsborough in the City of Sheffield, three months before his sixty-fifth birthday. For practical reasons, the Minister of Defence needed to be a member of the Commons, and Emmanuel Shinwell succeeded to this role. However, Alexander retained a seat in the cabinet as <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chancellor_of_the_Duchy_of_Lancaster_89d9.html" title="Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster">Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster</a>. Although he never made it into the "top five" of the Labour government (Attlee, Bevin, Morrison, Dalton and Greenwood, later replaced by Cripps), he remained an influential member throughout. Out of office following Labour's defeat and his health starting to decline, Alexander retired from front-bench politics after the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1951_ec18.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1951">1951 General Election</a>. He bought a farm in <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essex.html" title="Essex">Essex</a> and, although he continued to attend the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>, he did not hold any front-bench briefs for the next four years. In November <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a>, following the resignation of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Jowitt_a2b5.html" title="William Jowitt">Lord Jowitt</a>, Alexander was asked by <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Gaitskell_6976.html" title="Hugh Gaitskell">Hugh Gaitskell</a> to take over as leader of the small group of Labour <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Peerage_49fc.html" title="British Peerage">peers</a>. His appointment was strongly supported by Labour's faction in the upper House, and he served in this role for the next nine years.</p>
<p>Alexander spoke on virtually every topic whilst leading the Opposition in the Lords. He supported the introduction of <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_Peers_f5ca.html" title="Life Peers">Life Peers</a>, calling for them to be paid so that such appointments would be practical for working-class people. He also supported <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Benn_8b3c.html" title="Tony Benn">Tony Benn</a>'s campaign to renounce his peerage, and opposed Britain's early attempts to join the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Economic_Community_18c5.html" title="European Economic Community">European Economic Community</a>. Now a celebrity within the Co-op movement, Alexander continued to lobby for it in Parliament and with members of the government. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1956.html" title="1956">1956</a> he became President of the UK Council of Protestant Churches. He often spoke on religious matters in the Lords, fiercely opposing closer relations between the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> and the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a> and often quoting scripture at <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiritual_Peer_c541.html" title="Spiritual Peer">Spiritual Peers</a>. He was created <b>Baron Weston-super-Mare</b>, of Weston-super-Mare in the County of Somerset, and <b>Earl Alexander of Hillsborough</b> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1963.html" title="1963">1963</a> â€” the last politician to be made an <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl.html" title="Earl">Earl</a> until <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Macmillan_7e10.html" title="Harold Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a> became <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Stockton_c98c.html" title="Earl of Stockton">Earl of Stockton</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> â€” and was appointed a <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_Garter_59cd.html" title="Order of the Garter">Knight of the Garter</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a>. He finally stood down as leader of the Labour peers in the run-up to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1964_dac5.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1964">General Election in November 1964</a>. His last appearance in the Lords was shortly before Christmas that year, when he fiercely defended <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Wilson_2456.html" title="Harold Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>'s foreign policy from Tory accusations of disloyalty. Aged eighty, Lord Alexander of Hillsborough died early in the new year, fourteen days before Winston Churchill.<br />
