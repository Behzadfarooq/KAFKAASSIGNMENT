<p>I'm not so sure about that last line. I've been under the impression from interviews I've read with ADV employees (including Matt Greenfield) that the "AD" in "ADV" is a closely-guarded secret (either purposefully or as an elaborate company inside joke). Could be wrong. Don't follow the con circuit as much as I'd like.</p>

<dd>I'm sure. I own a lot of early ADV stuff. The whole "closely guarded secret" shtick got its start on the con circuit some years back, at a point in time when most in attendance were not old enough to have consumed anime during the days of $40 VHS tapes. It's cute, but the company did indeed get its start as "Animation Dubbing Vision", and it's not hard to see why they would want to distance themselves from that name. - <a href="../../../t/z/a/User%7ETzaquiel_22c8.html" title="User:Tzaquiel">Tzaquiel</a> 14:13, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"David L. Williams often jokes at some conventions that ADV stands for "Army of Darkness Video" (stated at AnimeExpo NY)." Does not point out the significance of Mr. Williams to the topic, should be made into a Wikilink if the person is the same man as on the <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_L._Williams_f858.html" title="David L. Williams">David L. Williams</a>. It doesn't say anything on that page about him being into anime, though, and the statement should then be clarified as to how he's relevant to anime. "Conventions" should also be Wikilinked, either to <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime_convention.html" title="Anime convention">anime conventions</a> or to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convention.html" title="Convention">conventions</a> in general — <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERaijinili_d513.html" title="User:Raijinili">Raijinili</a> 14:43, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, despite many other websites being victim to the attacks of the hackers, it still feels worthy since somewhat well known sites especially those that are seen or appear on wikipedia, should have a dangerous incident mentioned if it happens, since the fighters/hackers did attack something that was known to many(?) (ex: well known) somehow triggering a necessary mention of sorts. Plus look at Conan's post too. 24.188.203.181 03:43, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Re: Conan's reason, Having it "coming to them" doesn't make the incent noteworthy. Also ADV website itself doesn't appear to be that notable as an entity. So I completely fail to see how the hack is notable. --<a href="../../../j/i/f/User%7EJiFish_180b.html" title="User:JiFish">JiFish</a>(<sup><a href="../../../j/i/f/User_talk%7EJiFish_ceec.html" title="User talk:JiFish">Talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JiFish_b9a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/JiFish">Contrib</a></sub>) 13:37, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I may not understand why, but it somehow remains being a notable event on Wikipedia. Why? that's just how it seemed or seems to work for some reason. 24.188.203.181 16:42, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree that there should be an article including the parent company of ADVision with listings for its sub groups and think this page should continue to act as that page. However I feel it is important that <b>ADV Films</b> has its own article. The company itself is noteworthy enough and has more that enough information to warrant it. Furthermore it would allow this new article to also hold the ADV releases listings as well as improving this to include foreign territories like the United Kingdom which has its own branch of ADV. <a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButch-cassidy_450c.html" title="User:Butch-cassidy">Butch-cassidy</a> 16:13, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
