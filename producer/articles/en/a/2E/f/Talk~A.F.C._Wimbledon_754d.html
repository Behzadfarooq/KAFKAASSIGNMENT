<p>I'm starting to have second thoughts about reverting the edit a couple of days ago which contained <i>However AFC Wimbledon decided not play in there home town and moved some miles away to Kingston (hence the nick name Kingston Dons).</i> There is a conflict here, though one which it is difficult to find references for: whilst committed to playing in Merton the club spend a huge sum on a stadium in Kingston. Also the sum was paid when there were no other concievable purchasers for the stadium. Suggestions for a section of the article covering this please. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterGrecian_eb47.html" title="User:PeterGrecian">PeterGrecian</a> 16:00, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I note that the relationship between the two clubs is now listed as <i>"paternalistic"</i>. My definition of paternalistic is <b>"benevolent but intrusive"</b>. Also, do you feel you've given an entirely honest/neutral view of the situation <i>"seen by both clubs fans as securing both clubs futures and an example of a mutually beneficial relationship in a sport so often perceived as being riven by greed and self-interest"</i> Most Ks fans would tell you this was a pretty straightforward piece of SELF interest, tempered with a gesture in our direction... <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrince_Philip_of_Greece_04e5.html" title="User:Prince Philip of Greece">Prince Philip of Greece</a> 11:26, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did a lot of work on the ground purchase article to include some of the reasons for the purchase, including circumstancial factors outside of <a href="../../../a/2E/f/A.F.C._Wimbledon_c474.html" title="A.F.C. Wimbledon">The Dons</a> ie the financial decline of K's, which I hope was acceptable to all. The slightly sickly sentance added about a <i>"paternal relationship"</i> was <b>not</b> however mine and I would not protest if it were removed - lets be honest, while <a href="../../../a/2E/f/A.F.C._Wimbledon_c474.html" title="A.F.C.

<p>I propose; removing the line "However, many fans...Wonderful World" from the section "Ownership and Legal Status", reinstating the section on "Youth and Womens Football" and reinstating the AFC Wimbledon Ladies link in the section "Official sites".

<p>The pre-season friendly against the fledgling FC United of Manchester is noted, but wasn't this also for the Supporters Direct trophy? If this was the case, and as Wimbledon won 1 - 0, the trophy would presumably need to be added to the honours section at the bottom.</p>

<p>I'd be interested in a sentence or two about the original players for AFC Wimbledon. It's suggested that the Women's Team transfered over from the old professional Wimbledon and continued playing under AFC colours. Did the same happen for the men's team? or was the team started from scratch? Did the fans' collaboration generate enough money for a committee to buy in a team, or was it made up of fans? I'd be interested to read in the Foundation section how the new team was formed. (MarkG)</p>

<p>OK I've put in a bit about the Khosla debt as I feel its important with regards to the history of the club so far. Of course its still a current issue as well as its not being fully paid off yet.</p>
<p>OK I've put in a bit about the Barclays loan. Not too sure if it needs a seperate sub heading or not, as its still connected to the debt. What do others think?</p>

<p>I'd like to add some information on the players, similar to the way I've done it at <a href="../../../f/c/_/FC_United_of_Manchester_4bdb.html" title="FC United of Manchester">FC United of Manchester</a>. I realise that the player info is in the style that's recommended at WikiProject Football, but I think the system used at FC United is more appropriate for non-league clubs as it's often not possible to get enough info about each player to justify a standalone article and such articles haven't done well on AfD recently. For players where there is enough info to give them their own article, we can always use <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">summary style</a>.

<p>The majority of my latest edit merely reverts much of the vandalism done by 195.93.21.136; 80.41.8.5; 86.130.22.94; and 80.229.221.14. The edit includes the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed pejorative edits under club's nickname;</li>
<li>Removed offensive edits to a reserve player's name;</li>
<li>Reverted deletion of <b>Rob Ursell</b> since he has not actually been released by the club (despite clearly not having a future at AFC Wimbledon);</li>
<li>Retained insertion of <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_P._Fitzgerald_bd6a.html" title="Scott P. Fitzgerald">Scott Fitzgerald</a> to squad, and added <i>"on loan"</i>;</li>
<li>Removed line: <i>"although the club never actually owned the ground"</i> as <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingstonian_F.C._6b91.html" title="Kingstonian F.C.">Kingstonian F.C.</a> <b>did</b> own their ground at one stage;</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm not particularly for or against having dots in the article name, but we should be consistent. Also, the fact that other organisations don't use dots is irrelevant. The dots signify that the "A.F.C." part of the article is an <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acronym_and_initialism.html" title="Acronym and initialism">initialism</a>.

<p>I would have to query the use of "representating/representative" in the opening paragraphs of this article. It suggests a mandate or authorisation by the people for this club to represent them, and I do not believe that any club has that status: I have not seen such a claim on the article for any other football club I have seen on Wikipedia. I do not feel in any way represented by the team of the town in which I live, and would consider it inappropriate for them to claim that they do: AFCW's record attendance, even if everyone at the game was a AFCW supporter and lived in the Borough of Merton, is less than 1 in 40 of the borough's population. A football team can be said to represent its own traditions, the interests of its owners and stakeholders, and the hopes of its supporters, but I think it presumptiou in the extreme to say that it represents its local area (unless it has qualified in some tournament for the right to do so, or is selected exclusively from the local population by some authority in that area, such as a district schools team). Sorry if this appears excessively pedantic, but I think that the supporters of the old WFC, for whom I have every sympathy, are overstepping the mark if they are claiming the right to represent the district of Wimbledon. Bearing the name is not the same as representing the district: I am not represented by Colchester Skip hire Ltd! <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_McE_a4a1.html" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> 20:27, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>"Bearing the name is not the same as representing a district: I am not represented by Colchester Skip hire Ltd"</i>. So you are not represented by the <a href="../../../e/n/g/England_national_football_team.html" title="England national football team">England national football team</a> then?!! (There is no "mandate" from the people of England which says that the national team has the right to represent them; there is no tournament which the players have competed in to gain the right to represent the country; certainly England attendances vs national populations wont be anywhere near as successful as 1 in 40!) What a load of non-sense!!</dd>
<dd>Your post doesn't at all come across as pedantic, just erroneous. Suggesting that a sporting team bearing the name of an area represents that area is not at all presumptious. It is simply a matter of fact and suggests no such "mandate" or "authorisation". Whether you identify with the football team of your town or not is irrelevant, that team still <b>represents</b> the town - there is no need for some kind of referendum on whether it has permission to do so.</dd>

<dd>There was no more abuse in my rebuttle than sarcasm in your initial post; just a dismissal of an argument which, at its strongist, is mere pedantry! (And by the way, I noticed you made the change without any discussion first.)</dd>
<dd>I reiterate: AFC Wimbledon is a sporting representative of the area of Wimbledon. Fact. Just as the other Wimbledon teams, mentioned above, are also representatives of Wimbledon. Fact. If you are looking for some kind of "mandate" (which is a total red herring) how about that the club is directly owned by over 3,000 members of the local community. AFC Wimbledon is founded on the ethos that a football club is a community and the club has strong ties with its local community, running local coaching sessions and community football courses for kids in Merton, and even promoting community recycling schemes &amp; local health issues!! If <b>any</b> sports team is representative of its area, then AFC Wimbledon is. --&#160;<b><a href="../../../m/l/d/MLD_b5b6.html" title="MLD">MLD</a></b>&#160;<small><b>·</b>&#160;<a href="../../../m/l/d/User_talk%7EMLD_aa63.html" title="User talk:MLD">T</a>&#160;<b>·</b>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MLD_8977.html" title="Special:Contributions/MLD">C</a>&#160;<b>·</b></small>&#160;<font face="Courier">@:</font>&#160; 15:35, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I found your reply extremely abusive: did you intend <i>"are you just content to follow some identikit global franchise like Chelsea or Man Utd on Sky from the comfort of you</i> (sic) <i>sofa?!"</i> to be a compliment? Your arrogance in assuming my nationality and telling me what team I should support was equally unwelcome. I presented my reasons (please note, reasons, not mere assertion) on this talk page <b>two weeks</b> before my initial edit, and at the time of making the change to the article stated that yours had been the only counter-opinion raised. At that time, you had not addressed my response to your first contribution to this thread. I look forward to receiving your retraction of the accusation that I edited the article without prior discussion. I am sorry that you found that initial posting sarcastic, but on reviewing it I cannot see anything that merits that description. I do not accept that the need for some kind of mandate to be accurately described as representative is a red herring: I believe it is semantically justified, and I would be interested in what definition of representative you would cite to refute that. Indeed, you almost make the point for me:"<i>If <b>any</b> sports team is representative of its area, then AFC Wimbledon is</i>": I contend that <b>no</b> club has the right to call itself representative. I have no beef with AFC Wimbledon: I wish them well, and, as I said previously, I have chosen not to attend matches of my team against MK Dons. The team I support also has about 3,500 shareholders: I do not believe that that makes them representative of their district. Wikipedia is not the place to try to be stubborn about old arguments: indeed, if use of the word "representative" has been contentious, I would suggest that the best way of remaining NPOV is to avoid it. Community-based football is often used as an outlet for information by local groups: it's good to hear that AFCW fulfil that role well, but that is not the same as being representative. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_McE_a4a1.html" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> 19:01, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>How come AFC started their first season in the Combined Counties Football League Premier Division? why not one of the lower leagues. Would be interested to know, a sentence on this in the article would be great. Excuse my ignorance of how teams get placed in leagues, was it because AFC asked to start at this level, was there a vacancy, was it something to do with the team being semi-pro and not amateur, or the history of the club? --mgaved 23:43, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
