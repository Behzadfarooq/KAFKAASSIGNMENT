<p>AS Roma is one of the best clubs in Italy and is followed by millions of supporters worldwide. Que?????</p>
<p>They boast a wide variety of talented players through out the ages. None more than Francessco Totti. The eternal golden boy of the Romanista and the Italy, his ingenious vision for the game, he is able to play the ball to his playmates in patterns that seem inconcievable to even some of the world's finest. Add his powerful shot and his natural leadership makes him one of the most covetable players in the world.</p>
<p>Roma has won the scudetto 3 times even though it is not run by one of the rich companies that often finance other northern clubs like AC Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus. This club is very loyal to it's fans and they have a rich history with supporting the team.</p>
<p>Roma also compltely overshadows the other roman team that wears blue. SS Lazio tries their best to compete with us, but they aren't just good enough and some people just never know when to quit.</p>
<p>Roma's colors are Red and Yellow which refer to the colors of Gillarossi. Their symbol is a mother wolf feeding Regalus and Ramos. Roma plays at the Olympic stadium and their training headquarters are at the Trigora</p>

<p>I thought it would be better if I took the Roma article from the italian wikipedia and just translated it to english and replaced this article...the italian version is quite extensive and would do us romanisti proud, as no other football club on english wikipedia would have such an awesome article...sangue e oro per sempre &lt;3</p>

<li>Uhmmm do you want a propaganda piece for the club or do you want something remotely factual?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll weed out anything blatant..its really not that bad though</p>
<p>I'm having some problems getting things arranged properly ... the table of contents needs to be higher up, and the text needs to wrap around the "list of presidents" table a little better. Any help would be great&#160;:)</p>

<p>Is Leandro Greco still on AS Roma? I've verified he was on the roster for the 04-05 season and was a sub in one game, but he's not even on the official site's roster for 05-06: <a href="http://www.asroma.it/LaSquadraList.aspx" class="external text" title="http://www.asroma.it/LaSquadraList.aspx" rel="nofollow">La Squadra</a> There also doesn't appear to be a picture of him anywhere online, unless I'm missing an accent or something like that.

<dd>I have to stress the fact that this tranfer seems to be higly possible, but not really completed: no italian sport site, nor newspaper, nor tv/radio sport report, nor Roma or Lecce blog or supporter' site, nor official sites have yet confirmed - after ten days - this transfer; instead they are continuing to speak about it in terms of "possibility" and "future". Please note that, since <a href="../../../a/s/_/AS_Roma_87b7.html" title="AS Roma">AS Roma</a> quotes are negotiated on the <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borsa_Italiana_9e96.html" title="Borsa Italiana">italian stock market</a>, the club <u>must</u> promptly declare any player acquisition (in the past, the main channel for such advices beeing the AS Roma official site).

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/2E/s/Talk%7EA.S._Roma_83f5.html" title="Edit section: Club Foundation Date (S.S. Lazio 1900/A.S. Roma 1927)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Club Foundation Date (S.S. Lazio 1900/A.S. Roma 1927)</span></h2>
<p>Anyone who is familiar with football in Rome knows that 1900 versus 1927 distinction between Lazio and Roma is a particularly sore point for romanisti - the manipulation of dates and irrelevant information in this article testify to this. Why are the foundation dates of clubs that don't exist anymore of any relevance to an article about a club founded in 1927? Is this Roman FC's or Fortitudo's Wikipedia entry?</p>
<p>Soccer played in south central Italy before 1910 is not officially recognized by the Italian FA (FIGC). This is the reason that 1910 is sometimes used as the year that Lazio's football section was founded, however the club was founded in 1900 and football was played by its members in 1901, with official matches starting in 1902. 1910 is in fact the year that the club was affiliated to the Lega Centromeridionale (South Central League, roughly translated) and participated in the first official Italian FA-sanctioned championship.</p>
<p><i>Therefore if Lazio has allegedly only been active since 1910 the other clubs mentioned could not have started prior to that date, as is misleadingly stated in the main article! What we are looking at here is club foundation dates, and Lazio's is 1900, whether you like it or not.</i></p>
<p>As far as Roman FC's beginnings are concerned, historical sources are inconclusive and contradictory. Some say that it was founded in 1901, some in 1903, others go as far back as 1895, 1897 or 1899. In any case, it would appear that Roman FC did not play soccer initially but more of a hybrid between the latter and rugby.</p>
<p>One thing which is certain as far as Lazio's footballing activity is concerned, is that there is ample testimony and documentation from the first decade of the 20th century regarding its football "activity" whereas similar information regarding other teams is sorely lacking. In addition, the difference in level between Lazio and other teams, evidenced by the thrashings inflicted on rivals, is another clue as to Lazio's dominance by being a precursor in Rome..</p>

So I am asking you, what is the point to put the flag of Italy next to the word "Italy", used as a section title, in bold and alone? My answer is none, so I consider it useless.

<p>The inaccuracies regarding Lazio's foundation date purported by BaldClarke in the main article is another issue which I would appreciate being addressed while we're at it. It is well-known fact that Lazio was founded in 1900, that the football section was added in 1901 and that it started playing matches in 1902. This claim can easily be corroborated by a neutral and reliable source like Panini's Almanacco del Calcio, yet BaldClarke continues to misleadingly insist on using 1910 (?!) as the actual foundation date and quotes sources without providing anything concrete to back his claim up. Any subsequent changes which rectify the erroneous claim are dismissed by using the three revert rule. In other words, one can go around Wikipedia editing articles to one's liking and claim that users who correct disinformation are actually at fault because of 3RR. This is simply unacceptable.</p>
<dl>
<dd>My dear unknown user,</dd>
<dd>understanding English is a prerequisite of contributing to English Wikipedia. This capability would have let you understand that the article claims that Lazio was founded in 1900, that some matches were played among Lazio members in 1902 (possibly in 1903), but that a football section partecipating to an official tournament is recorded only in 1910.</dd>
<dd>Until somebody comes with a proof of an official tournament played by a football section of S.S. Lazio <i>before</i> 1910, the text must stay that way, not for <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, but for <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>.</dd>

<dd>This 1910 date which you have pulled out of a hat is not a reference to a tournament, but in actual fact to when the Italian FA began officially recognizing championships in central southern Italy for <u>all teams</u>, including lesser ones like Roman and Fortitudo. If that is the approach you want to use, you will have to use exactly the same date (1910) with the other teams mentioned in the article. It is chronologically impossible to claim that a team like Lazio, which was the most dominant one in Rome, started to play in official league championships after everyone else!?</dd>

<dd>Look at the SS Lazio official website; there is a page dedicated to the team history <a href="http://www.sslazio.it/it/InfoPage.aspx?id=33753" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sslazio.it/it/InfoPage.aspx?id=33753" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, where it's explicitly stated that Lazio as "società podistica" was founded on "9th of January, 1900", and started football activities in 1902. Never cited 1910 in this page. I hope you understand Italian in order to read it, but I think you do, since you're citing an Italian-language book. And your claim that, since football divisions started in 1910, therefore Lazio's foundation year must be considered as 1910, is completely wrong. In fact, should it be true, all <i>scudetti</i> assigned before 1910 would not be valid, and we all should impose 1910 as foundation year for teams such as AC Milan, Juventus, Genoa and Inter. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngelo.romano_5e58.html" title="User:Angelo.romano">Angelo</a> 11:08, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Even Angelo romano, an etablished Wikipedian who I don't think can be suspected of having sympathies for Lazio, easily debunked your reasoning above. In addition, you have put your own foot in your mouth as you yourself refer to foundation dates in the same line when referring to lesser clubs like Alba and Audace! If that is indeed what we are talking about, and I believe that it is, Lazio's is 1900 - whether you like it or not and regardless of whichever you will attempt to use Wikipedia to disinform others.

<dd>I hope that the Almanacco Panini is good enough for you? Speaking of references, where are yours on Roman FC? You state that it was 1901, but there is so little documentation on the club's beginnings that it would appear that you are pulling that one out of a hat as well. Just drop this business on the foundation dates because you know you are wrong. I suggest that we ask outside parties to have their say in case you'll insist on going on and on with this.

<dd>Almanacco Panini says that Lazio was founded in 1900 and football was being played as of 1901. You find a source that debunks that. Remember you are making an extraordinary claim, therefore the burden is on you to provide the evidence. I really would like to see this obscure book you keep on quoting!?

<p>What I find interesting is your deliberate and deceiving use of double-standards. On the one hand you continue to claim that Lazio's only possible foundation date is 1910 because that is when the club allegedly <i>played in official tournaments for the first time</i>, a statement which is clearly false and has already been debunked, yet at the same time you use the alleged <i>foundation date</i> of Roman FC to make your point, in the loosest sense of the word, that Lazio was not Rome's "first" team. What are we talking about here? When the team was founded or when it started playing tournaments? In either case you lose, because it is common knowledge that Lazio was the first team to play in Rome, and there is no concrete evidence proving Roman FC's foundation date, let alone whether they even played football in the beginning, and that this 1910 date which you continuously refer to is an <b>erroneous</b> reference (it was actually 1912) to when the Italian FA started recognizing and organizing teams in the center and south of Italy into official championships. Therefore, as Angelo Romano said, if 1910 is Lazio's foundation date, then so is every other team's in the region. <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllipsis4677_a5e3.html" title="User:Ellipsis4677">Ellipsis4677</a> 13:49, 12 October 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../e/l/l/User%7EEllipsis4677_a5e3.html" title="User:Ellipsis4677">Ellipsis4677</a> 13:49, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I changed the connection of AS Roma foundation with fascist regime because there is not any evidence of a political willing. Many clubs of center and south merged to become professional and competitive; in 1926 Fiorentina, Bari e Napoli were founded and so Roma in 1927. Basicly it was an economic need.</p>
<p>There is not any evidence about a political willing to create a club named Roma in serie A. Moreover Mussolini's sons were lazio supporters and lazio executive Vaccaro, who fought the merger and was Football association important member, was a fascist militia chief.</p>
<p>moreover i don't think that ss lazio activities and foundation is relevant in this page</p>
