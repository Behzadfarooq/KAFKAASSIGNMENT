<dd><i>Hi, i didn't notice someone removed it. Before you go jumping the gun i'd remind you that it was me who added that section that was removed, also it was me who expanded the section into politics which gave it far more information than would otherwise have been included in history. I'm also struggling to see four lines about armenian terrorism, what section are you refering to? --E.A 10:12, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>Yes, I know that you added the lines and I think you did a good job, I also saw that you reinserted the info. I believe the Armenian terrorism is mentioned as the 19th point on the section on post-1923 history.

<p>I'm preparing some comments to submit to the TRNC (<a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus_c705.html" title="Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus">Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus</a>) discussion page and would apprecite you feedback/comments. Here it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The article (<a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus_c705.html" title="Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus">Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus</a>) is far from being NPOV and reads like biased political commentary emphasizing and focusing on issues that have more to do with the <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus_dispute.html" title="Cyprus dispute">Cyprus_dispute</a>. For example: there is no section describing the People of the TRNC, but there is an entire section devoted to <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus_c705.html" title="Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus">Property Issues</a> (surely, this section should be in the <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus_Dispute_23a8.html" title="Cyprus Dispute">Cyprus Dispute</a>). The section on <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus_c705.html" title="Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus">Communications and Transport</a> has three paragraphs and each paragraph describes problems such as visa issues rather than giving facts and figures about airports, roads and so on. The <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus_c705.html" title="Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus">History</a> section is factually wrong (see below) and focuses on the non-recognition of the TRNC, rather than giving useful information on why and how the TRNC came into existence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is factually wrong and misleading to say that (quote) <i>The independence of northern Cyprus was proclaimed in 1975 under the name Turkish Federated State of Northern Cyprus</i> (unquote). In 1975 Northern Cyprus declared its federated status as part of the Republic of Cyprus. It did not declare its independence until 1983, and that was after years of failed negotiations with South Cyprus and the international community. The article continues (quote) <i>The name was changed to its present form on 15 November 1983</i> unquote. This is misleading. It was a lot more than a name change. It was the creation of a newly declared independent political entity called the TRNC. The Turkish Federated State of Northern Cyprus was a different political entity. The article needs to be corrected.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If the aim is to create a NPOV objective description of the TRNC, which describes its Geography, People, Economy and so on, then such an article must include a <b>History</b> section which helps us understand how and why the TRNC came into existence; and a <b>People</b> section that explains who the Turkish Cypriots are and where they came from.</li>

<p>I've completed that nomination for you. You have to edit the section that links to the afd. You can either save it and <i>then</i> edit it, or copy past the whole afd header from another page and edit it in one go. I do the first because I'm lazy and it gives me the old afd without any extra work. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 00:38, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Recently there has been a lot of interference with this article. I appologize for my actions but I forgot that there were the other more in depth sections. I was trying to counter arguments that were being written in the body of this article, which now I have seen, did not belong in this article. Finally, I am monitoring all these articles for Turkish POV and Greek POV and skillful literary remarks which quite frankly should be kept out (and as a corollary, I should not have added what I put because it was counter to something someone else tried to write in a POV way - as a point of honor and with my heart I appologize). As a point any future changes to this article should be reverted and relegated to the appropriate subsection or new subsection.

<dd>Thanks, unfortunately as free as that might sound, there seem to be one critical problem. They do <i>not</i> allow <b>commercial use</b> without permission (so it is in fact not free for <b>any purpose</b>), and images uploaded to the Wikipedia <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-May/023760.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-May/023760.html" rel="nofollow">must allow for commmercial use</a>.

Replace the cc-at or free use templates and whateer with <code>{{fairusein|whatever}}</code> for example.

<p>First off, are you neutral and do you use NPOV?? Just kidding and hello. I am VERY late to the table on the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a> article but was wondering about if there was ANY, even remotely, consensus for how to deal/link the Armenian Genocide or WHATEVER you want to call it to this article. This very understandable is VERY sensitive. MY point of view is that there should be at least SOME link/discussion of the ongoing issue of recognition or lack there of concerning the events. I am trying to go through past aurguments and it seemed like you were involved. This really isn't my battle but I feel "sucked" in now that ONE link to the Armenian Genocide won't be included. Is there a link to the ongoing contraversy regarding recognition of the events even that could be included. Anyways, I have already spent WAY WAY to much time on this issue and will probably go quietly into the night and let the people with an agenda win out. Thanks for letting me post my ramblings in here and have a pleasant day!<a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeafterthree_41a1.html" title="User:Threeafterthree">Tom</a> 14:21, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi A.Garnet, thanks for your response. I have actually given up trying to edit anywhere NEAR Turkey or Amenia since it really isn't my battle and seems like banging your head against a wall.

<p>Hi im a greek wikipedia user. I just checked the discussion of the "pontian genocide" and saw that you were the one who added the neutrality contested tag- IMO you did well as</p>
<ul>
<li>the article is quite a mess and offers statistics only from the greek side.</li>
<li>at times it is not clear whether it refers to the Greek Orthodox population of the Ottoman Empire in general or specifically to Pontian Greeks.</li>
<li>wikipedia is an encyclopedia and not a web site where everybody can post his political claims and ideas.</li>
<li>at least one greek journalist (iakobos pretenteris) has claimed that there is no such thing as a pontian genocide, as there was not a <b>systematic</b> effort by the turkish<b>state</b> of eliminating the pontian population, but of course nobody took his claims seriously in greece.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the article is more or less controlled by the "greek patriotic lobby" it will be very difficult to make any sort of corrections. In any case, thx for contributing and trying to correct it. best regards--<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreece666_00f8.html" title="User:Greece666">Greece666</a> 04:14, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>

<li>I find your point of view very interesting- especially given that you are from Northern Cyprus and I cannot fail to notice that this is often the moderate half of the island (in terms of public opinion). Unfortunatelly, most young ppl in Southern Cyprus have adopted an overly nationalist stance. Older Greek Cypriots who remember the common past of the two communities usually have a more moderate opinion (except of course from the supporters of EOKA).</li>
<li>IMO the article should be renamed- the Greek <b>opinion</b> that a genocide took place could be exposed in a separate part of the article- the fact that the <b>greek</b> parliament and two american states recognized it as such is not enough to make it a fact. of course, as i have pointed out previously this is impossible to do given the zeal of gr patriots.</li>
<li>by the way, the mention of elias <a href="../../../v/e/n/Venezis.html" title="Venezis">venezis</a> in the article on pontian greek genocide is unfortunate: he was not a pontian and his book is autobiographical. thus, he writes mainly about what took place in ayvali(his birthplace) and the <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_camps.html" title="Labour camps">labour camps</a> in anatolia.</li>
<li>i suggest you simply ignore the comments of gr patriots- calling you or anyone else names is more suitable to kindengarten than wikipedia.</li>
<li>you could also check the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_cuisine.html" title="Greek cuisine">greek cuisine</a> article: i and <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">user:macrakis</a> maintain that <a href="../../../g/y/r/Gyros.html" title="Gyros">gyros</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Doner_kebab.html" title="Doner kebab">doner kebab</a> are one and the same thing. however, gr patriots simply revert. check the discussion page, it is a good exercise in modern gr surrealism!</li>

<p>i thought you might find this interesting, since it has been written by one of the best historians on contemporary greece:</p>
<p>"Had the British not retreated in March and turned instead to the ill-fated Gallipoli landings, the capital must surely have fallen. Indeed, the Young Turk leadership had planned for an emergency evacuation to continue the war from Anatolia - much as actually happened in 1919. But this in turn raised the question of the security of the Anatolian heartland, inhabited not only by Turks but also by Greeks, Armenians, Kurds and others. The Ottoman leadership was deeply uncertain of the loyalty of these groups, especially with a Russian offensive looming. It had already deported Greek civilians from the Anatolian shoreline into the interior (the Russians were doing much the same with Russian Jews in Tsarist Poland, the Habsburgs with their border Serbs). <b>But these deportations were on a relatively small scale and do not appear to have been designed to end in their victims' deaths</b>. What was to happen with the Armenians was of a different order."</p>
<p>You can find the rest <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n03/mazo01_.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n03/mazo01_.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>; it might interest you since it is about the armenian genocide.--<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreece666_00f8.html" title="User:Greece666">Greece666</a> 06:26, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>"Some have questioned for example whether Europe would have intervened in the Balkans in the 90's quicker had the massacres been against Christians." - i think it would have been more probable. consider the support croatia and slovenia received from the very beginning from austria and germany. the yugoslavia wars are a good example of states acting along religious/cultural lines- i dont think it's a coincedence that (orthodox) greece and russia supported serbia.</li>
<li>i also found the article quite interesting. mazower is arguably the best (living) historian on the balkans.</li>
<li>in the conclusions of his book "the balkans"he discusses once again the issue of the treatment of muslims and especially ottomans. it is almost always forgotten that between 20 and 30% of the population of the balkans was once muslim; most of them had to leave their houses as refugees a short time after their territory was "liberated" by a christian state.</li>
<li>to give but one example, consider the muslims/turks of the peloponnese who left their homes after the 1821 revolution (never to return and never to receive a compensation for their lost property- above never to be remembered, as from what i know in greece there is very little research on the issue).--<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreece666_00f8.html" title="User:Greece666">Greece666</a> 23:43, 31 May 2006 (UTC)--<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreece666_00f8.html" title="User:Greece666">Greece666</a> 23:44, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>the book by <a href="../../../m/a/z/Mazower.html" title="Mazower">mazower</a> ("the balkans") deals little with turks and muslims per se as it focuses on balkan history (19-20th); having said this, IMO its a great book.</li>
<li>about turkish cretans: i think they all left with the population exchange of 1922-3, as did all turks/muslims in greece (except for thrace). there was a book about them in greek recently.</li>
<li>about sampson- yes. and ioannides had ideas similar to his.</li>
<li>as a matter of fact i know that some turkish cypriots were killed in reprisals in 1974, but dont know a number (not even an approximate one).</li>
<li>there was recently a documentary in greece about turkish cypriots in the 1960s and 1970s, entitled "the other side". it met various obstacles but in the end they showed it on TV.</li>
<li>i dont know the book by McCarthy but it sounds really interesting. do you know when was it written?--<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreece666_00f8.html" title="User:Greece666">Greece666</a> 01:00, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It should be sufficient for wowturkey.com to release a few images to Wikipedia under one of the free licences in <a href="../../../i/c/t/WP%7EICT_6197.html#Free_licenses" title="WP:ICT">WP:ICT#Free licenses</a>. The other images in their site might be released under whatever licence they want. How could we ever control that?</p>
<p>Also, the same image can be licenced under some terms to Wikipedia and under some other terms to others, e.g. the readers of wowturkey.com. Again, how could we ever control what happens between wowturkey.com and some other party (e.g. reader of wowturkey.com)?</p>
<p><b>But they should realise that if they do this, then the readers of wowturkey.com could still come to Wikipedia and get the image under a free licence instead of wowturkey.com's normal licence</b>. Since Wikipedia content is <b>licenced to everybody</b> under free licences, anybody anywhere in the world can use Wikipedia content freely without asking anybody's permission. Hence this kind of dual licencing only seems to make sense to me if both the licences are similar in spirit, e.g. {{<a href="../../../c/c/-/Template%7ECc-by-sa-2.5_49da.html" title="Template:Cc-by-sa-2.5">cc-by-sa-2.5</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGfdl_246d.html" title="Template:Gfdl">gfdl</a>}}, but if wowturkey.com wishes to have unrelated licences, it is upto them.</p>
<p>An important thing that I'd like wowturkey.com folks to realise is that Wikipedia content is not only free for copying and distribution but also for <b>modification and commercial exploitation</b>. It wouldn't be fair to have wowturkey.com licence the images to us unless we make sure they realise every aspect of the licence we're proposing to them.</p>
<p>BTW in order to maintain a good relationship with wowturkey.com, I'd say it would be best to ask them to licence to us only a few images instead of nagging them over every image in their site -- from your question, they don't seem to be willing to licence everything freely to everyone and we should respect that. Partially forgoing copyright interests in a few images among thousands is one thing, partially forgoing copyright interests in thousands of images is another.</p>

<dd>hey thanx for your concern we have the same feelings on the matter. Dont worry i will do the talking but i need to know what exactly i should tell them to write there. I need to know which kind of licence and which kind of related permission is needed. if they write there for wikipedia the images are free, would that be enough or do they have to write these images are free for any kind of commercial use. The first possibility is easier for me to accomplish but i will do my best for the second one too. I also need to know if we paste the permissions from the photograph owners like they ask right now, would that be also useful? thanx <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetb82_7d6c.html" title="User:Metb82">Metb82</a> 23:15, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>ok i see but i dont think they will understand this because people will already use and copy the image from wikipedia and they are happy with that as long as wowturkey logo is on. what im afraid of is, if i tell them that the images will be free for modification, they will think that people will try to remove their logos. there must be a simple way of asking them to do something because i can see that they are confused about the non commercial part. they are saying wikipedia is already not commercial and why do they need something like this. i explained to them but its not very easy for them to just release all commercial rights thats why they havent given me a solid answer yet. im saying again we should ask for a simpler or more specific way and honestly i dont really understand this licence thing too well either. The agencia brasil licence perfectly fits wowturkey i think but there must be an expert on wikipedia on licences that will help me be a connection between each question they will ask me and wikipedia asks for them. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetb82_7d6c.html" title="User:Metb82">Metb82</a> 20:35, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Because wikipedia is not a commercial site, and because the name of our site is clearly mentioned, ofcourse you can use the photos as much as you want. thats the ambition of our site!</i> I personally would be honoured to see my own photos there.</p>
<p>But i dont understand why "all commercial rights of the photos should be released". In wikipedia, the rights to use are given only, not to sell."</p>

<p>Greetings. Sadly, I'm not sure whether to remain in this project at all. There is a group of editors that I feel are set out to drive out editors such as myself (and have already succeeded in driving out six other active admins) in the intereditorial battleground that Wikipedia has become. I'll get back to you if anything changes in the near future, but I'm beginning to hold less and less hope.

<p>Hey, I've uploaded some new pics, please don't remove them! Just Izmir, Istanbul and Antalya's views arent genereal seems of those cities. So, If you would like just remove them.</p>
<p>You think that there are so many pictures, see another countries images, they are even more alot than Turkey's.

<p>I have noticed that you are urging for to say "put general photos of Turkey for 'cities'" See the Adana photo that you are put, it's not a GENERAL view!

Now, I have uploaded so GENERAL a Istanbul photo and Bursa's general seems by day. Is it ok? And I have removed some pics of Images of Turkey gallery. I'm urging for to say they are much cooler and quality.

<p>Please refrain from undoing other people's edits repeatedly. If you continue, you may be blocked from editing Wikipedia under the three-revert rule, which states that nobody may revert an article to a previous version more than three times in 24 hours. (Note: this also means editing the page to reinsert an old edit. If the effect of your actions is to revert back, it qualifies as a revert.)

<dd><s>Even if 3 and 4 are not considered reverts, 1, 2, 5 and 6 might be taken as reverts and you would still have violated.</s> BTW it would be better if you can reduce your reverts. Note that there were others too with the same intention as you so you need not be the only person reverting.</dd>
<dd>Also, if you want to strike a compromise you should use the talk page of the article/his talk page/your talk page to decide on the compromise. I'm not sure what is generally done about partial reverts intended to strike a compromise, but doing these things in the talk page would be the safest. If the person you're edit-warring with refuses to discuss, you could space out your reverts in time and point others to the talk page in the edit summary.

<p>The name is problematic, not that I don't believe it is a genocide, but rather for the notability of the term and it being based on wide range of peer reviewed publications. I also have a problem with the article as a whole, because it mixes different events with what happened to the Pontian Greeks, what happened to them is very special and if the article is supposed to discuss about them, it should discuss about them and not trying to connect various events. Alternative? I really don't know. This is even more difficult than the Assyrian cases, because while the Assyrian cases can be incorporated to the Armenian genocide article, which was what I said at the beginning should be done, the Pontian massacre was an event by itself which does not have a clear defined word to discribe it. My intention is not to undermine what happened, but rather impose standards on name conventions. The ideal would be to creat a page on the condition of minorities in the last years of the Ottoman Empire, we won't have to expend any Armenian section but redirect it to the main article, while we could developpe the Pontian Greeks cases without having to deal with the issue of having to find a difficult name for an article and wondering about the notability of the subject.--<i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 16:17, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks a lot, the article looks a lot more neutral than when I first found it. BTW, I was talking to an elderly Greek man from Cyprus, and he said that a long time ago, before the governments got involved, Greek and Turkish Cypriots lived together in peace for the most part. Is this completely true? —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi"><font color="">Khoikhoi</font></a></span> 22:02, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Concerning the discussion about this article in <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi"><font color="">Khoikhoi</font></a>'s talk page, i'd like to tell u that the Republic of Cyprus differentiates between Cypriot Greek and mainland Greek. Cypriot greek is quite distinct from mainland greek. Personally, i have some problems to understand greek cypriots when they speak in their dialect, and i know that this is the case with every Greek in Greece. I am 100% sure that the official language of the R. of Cyprus is <i>standard</i> Greek (and Turkish). I am pretty much sure that TRNC has standard turkish as official language as well. so, i am going to make a minor change in that article. in addition, i would like to point that the number of speakers in Cyprus includes both TCs and Anatolian Turks. since the differences between the TC dialect and standard turkish as quite important, i think that the number of turkish-cypriot speakers should refear only to the turkish cypriots in TRNC. but i am not willing to make any further changes (if i'll get more involved in turkish related articles, some users may think that i hate the turks-something that really is not the case:)...). lastly, neither the GCs nor the Greeks in Greece say that both communities lived in harmony in Cyprus till 1974. we are perfectly aware of what was happening during the 50s-60s, or even prior, when the British took control of the island, or maybe even earlier, in 1821.

<p>No, i do not suggest that the RoC and TRNC's position is different in this case. i am saying exactly the opposite: that they have standard greek and standard turkish respectively as official languages, and not their own dialects-with the addition that R. of Cyprus also has standard turkish as co-official. if we include the anatolian turks in cyprus as turkish-cypriot speakers, i think that we cannot include the TCs abroad as well: in the same way that they were 'cypriotised', the later became -...ized. as for the past, the GCs are perfectly aware of all the things that have happened (i would not expect the official governmental website to state this, but i know they do). after all, these things happened just 40 years ago... in tet-a-tet conversations GCs go even further, and although they still primarily blame Turkey for the division of the island, they also accuse Greece (the <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junta.html" title="Junta">junta</a>)... sometimes i have the feeling that they feel more connected with the TCs, than with us, mainland Greeks! but still, the names <a href="../../../r/a/u/Rauf_Denkta%C5%9F_ef4c.html" title="Rauf Denktaş">Rauf Denktaş</a> and <a href="../../../b/%C3%BC/l/B%C3%BClent_Ecevit_74a1.html" title="Bülent Ecevit">Bülent Ecevit</a> serve as a <i>red piece of cloth</i> for them...

<p>I agree with you on Cyprus, it needs to be reworded even though for most analysts some form of division is permanent. But the following needs to be included, albeit with clarifications if necessary. If you disagree, I would find your comments and reasons very helpfull. thanks.</p>

<p>Merhaba A.Garnet. Nasılsınız? In case you haven't noticed already, there's a dispute over at the <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus_c705.html" title="Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus">TRNC</a> article. The latest issue is that Aristovoulos changed the intro today from this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The <b>Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus</b> (TRNC) (<a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_language.html" title="Turkish language">Turkish</a>: <i>Kuzey Kıbrıs Türk Cumhuriyeti</i>) or <b>Turkish Cypriot State</b> (<a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_language.html" title="Turkish language">Turkish</a>: <i>Kıbrıs Türk Devleti</i>) is a <i>de facto</i> <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secession.html" title="Secession">break-away</a> state in the northern third of the island of <a href="../../../c/y/p/Cyprus.html" title="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>to this:</p>

The <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_0433.html" title="UN">UN</a> considers "TRNC" as legally invalid and calls for the withdrawal.

<p>Can we again discuss the title issue? It is really not fair to accuse a nation of genocide just on a whim.. It is a serious allegation that must be backed-up by serious academic research. The definition of the United Nations and the international law must be taken into account. Pls let's not use Wikipedia to fuel ethnic hatred. The article still doesn't have even one impartial source or citation. Pls reply...

<p>Hi. Note: I'm neither Greek nor Turkish, nor do I have any knowledge <i>whatsoever</i> about the alleged incidents. I do agree with your points, however, on the talk page of <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontian_Greek_Genocide_8ec9.html" title="Pontian Greek Genocide">Pontian Greek Genocide</a>. I read through the talk page, and there was one suggestion that was mentioned that seemed to be overlooked by all parties: "Pontian Greek Genocide Thesis". The word "thesis" is extremely neutral, and I'd have a hard time believing that (to give an overused example) either Jews and Neo-Nazis would object to "Holocaust thesis". I've added my points to the most recent discussion there, but bear in mind that I won't discuss the issue any further on that page. Please, however, feel free to discuss on my talk page. --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorkk_d740.html" title="User:Storkk">Storkk</a> 12:10, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear A. Garnet.</p>
<p>The concept of democracy is a very contested one with many different connotations. The meaning of the term has changed significantly during time, and it still has many contradictory meanings. As Robert Dahl, one of the leading theorists on democracy puts it: "’democracy’ has meant different things to different people at different times and places". Thus to label an entire country as democratic or not is highly problematic. For this reason 'democracy' is rarely used in attempts to operationalize an analysis of the nature of a polity - rather terms such a polyarchy is used. In its Copenhagen criteria the EU requires "stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities". These ideas are well alligned with the dominating idea of liberal democracy, but however vague and open for interpretation - thus judging a country democratic is a subjective assesment. Sorry for this whole lot - I certainly hope you dont find my comments patronizing, I simply prefer to explain my thoughts rather than embarking on a stupid edit-war.

<p>The problem is that it is always a judgement, and can never be hard facts, whether a country is democratic or not. When the European Commission published its 2005 Progress Report on Turkey, the Commission’s top representative in Turkey, Ambassador Hansjoerg Kretschmer, said there were still major areas in which Turkey lags behind European standards and that “Turkey today can certainly not be considered as a mature liberal democracy.” (See Turkish Daily News, "Ankara welcomes tone of EU reports, vows more reforms", November 11, 2005, p. 3.) This is his view. But in order to stick to NPOV policy I believe that Wikipedia should not make contested judgements. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 14:46, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In fact I was just about to write you to ask you about the article :)) Although not about the restructering.. I have taken a look at other articles, I think you do have a point.. I hadn't looked at those articles.. I will switch them back right now, dont worry.. I was just going to reply to you about what you told me before about wikiproject Turkey and FA. I was wondering the same thing, we really need to get an article up there! So which article do you think has the best chance of reaching FA status? I mean we would like to get Turkey up there, but that might take a long time and, as u said earlier, it might not be that easy even if the article was perfect! <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>? I don't know, that article also needs tons of work.. Otherwise what do you think we need to do to get Turkey FA? As for all the POV stuff out there, I am also not interested so much, but as u said, there is so much we can do.. I don't blame u for having had enough!! Otherwise I hope that u had a good weekend.. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 23:47, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, all it needs is a lot of work to <i>polish</i> what is already there overall.. I took back the restructreing.. I am sorry about that, I hadn't taken a good look at other articles.. I said <i>origin and history of the name</i> instead of etymology.. What do you think? In any case, if you are ok, I would also like to try to get it to FA.. Obviously we cannot be present here all the time, we have stuff to do in real life, but I am also willing to consecrate time into this and at least try to get it FA.. So count me in.. :) Another problem we have is that some articles that are linked by the article are not in the best state (foreign relations for ex), would that be a problem? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 00:32, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, no problems.. The only problem that I have is that I don't have access to certain academic servers, Jstore etc.. Therefore sometimes it is extremely hard for me to dig up references and sources, particularly ones relating to specific issues - in contrast to news reports for example.. In any case we will see what we can do :) regards <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 22:10, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wanted a favor. It seems that <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafa_Akalp_5e6f.html" title="User:Mustafa Akalp">User:Mustafa Akalp</a> has been perma-blocked for Khoikhoi's RfA vote spamming. I had filed a relative incident at <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html#RfA_vote_spamming" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI#RfA vote spamming</a>. I really didn't think and didn't intend at that point that such a grave punishment should be inflicted on him. Both I as reporting user, and Khoikhoi as the victim, agree that his permanent block should be lifted. Khoikhoi filed a <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_feeb.html#Requesting_consensus_to_unblock_Mustafa_Akalp" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard">request for consensus to unblock him</a> in WP:AN. Other users are concerned about him not accepting the fact that he did something wrong, and willing to do the same thing again (he indicates so in his e-mail responses). As it seems, the only solution would be for someone to mentor him, and explain the relative policy <i>in his own language</i>, since his level of English probably doesn't help him understand. Could you possibly undertake that responsibility?</p>
<p>In case you could, you need to explain to him that what he did was wrong for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>He made his objection evident. This is not allowed, because it signifies <i>what</i> to vote.</li>
<li>He addressed these messages to a <i>selective</i> group of users, that he thought would agree with him. Again, this is not allowed, because consensus has to be reached by <b>all</b> WP proportionately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the fact that we may share different POVs from time to time, I saw that you and Baristarim supported Khoikhoi too, which means that you acknowledge Mustafa was wrong in this action for one more reason. If he could understand those reasons and indicate he apologizes, that would definitely help in unblocking him.

<p>Hey, I am sorry for getting back a bit late. Have been busy :)) Yes, I had been away for a while because I got really stressed because of some of the stuff out there. And I also had some real stuff to do, so I just spontaneuosly avoided Wiki for a while. I was getting into situations where seeing them through would have cost me too much time with too little result. But this time my real life became too stressful so I took refuge here :)) Kinda funny when you think about it. Ama daha bismillah demeden gelir gelmez yine edit-war. :)) The usual, really :) Otherwise I hope that everything has been fine with you and let me know if there is something I can lend a hand with.

<p>AG, thanks for your message. I wish I could help, but in my experience some issues are just too charged for me to be able to make a useful contribution, and especially a useful contribution that has some chance of 'sticking', so I avoid them. Not only are feelings high around these issues, but there are many people who feel strongly enough about them that they spend huge amounts of time edit-warring and discussing them, something I'm not willing to do.</p>
<p>What I <i>can</i> do that might be helpful is to make some procedural suggestions. In a quick look at this article, I see that both the Greeks and the Turks have very weak documentation (if any) for many of their claims. A good start would be to find <i>reputable, third party</i> sources for all claims, and to avoid deleting content that you disagree with, instead inserting {{fact}} tags for unsupported claims. This is a sign that other editors need to find better sources. It would also be good to make a positive effort to find sources that disagree with your point of view. For example, you might have non-Turkish sources that support the position that the Turkish invasion was justified under international law and the relevant treaties. In that case, you should also try to find serious non-Greek sources that oppose that position, and present them fairly.</p>
<p>That is exactly what I have tried to do in the case of the <a href="../../../b/a/k/Baklava.html" title="Baklava">Baklava</a> article. I have looked for the best sources I can find, regardless of their conclusions, and reported on them. It is perfectly possible that someone will come along with good sources disagreeing with them, which will be fine. But in the meantime, I feel very comfortable reverting arguments supported only by links to random Web pages, since there is solid documentation of what <i>is</i> in the article.</p>
<p>Good luck, --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrakis_14b1.html" title="User:Macrakis">Macrakis</a> 17:59, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
