<p>Hey s'up. There has been a debate going <a href="../../../t/e/n/Talk%7ETenedos_6523.html" title="Talk:Tenedos">here</a> about a possible move to its official name.

Dear A.Garnet, It is up to you, what you edit in Turkish speaking Template. I understand you, but remember that Turkish is official language in CYP so we have to right that MUST be accepted as official language in EU also. Please consider this. Kolay gelsin.

<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> YOU made a point? And thus whatever you say goes irrespective to international law, treaties and resolutions. No one said about redirecting to the RoC page dude. Do not put words in other people's mouth.</p>

<dd>First, inclusion of both "entities" using the word you use should be there - one legally has three languages English, Greek and Turkish, and the other has only Turkish. Because of the issue, it is required to say that the UN and the EU recognize the Govenment of Cyprus jurisdiction over the whole island and the "tRNC" as a separatist administration. (Your viewpoint will be at odds with this of course and this is to be expected)</dd>
<dd>Second, Adding the word "entities" and thus playing word games has allowed you to go forth and put the "TRNC" there in the list. This vagueness is well thought out but unfortunately one must mention the facts about the whole issue by saying it is a separatist entity as well.</dd>
<dd>Third, I think the real solution is to not include both the RoC and the "TRNC" at all until the Cyprus problem is solved by the diplomats. If you think that international law does not apply to wikipedia as far as to the inclusion of valid and truthful information (like the "TRNC" is a separatist administration and the territory of which legally is part of the Republic of Cyprus) then wikipedia will turn into the internet which is full of nationalistic webpages.</dd>
<dd>Bottom line, either leave this to the diplomats to solve, and take out both TRNC and RoC or put both in with parentheses. Believe it or not a parentheses in the english language goes a long way in confering meaning to the reader. Unfortunately not too many people understand this in wikipedia and brush it aside. Your solution says according to your logic, that both the "TRNC" and the "RoC" are turkic entities or states. In terms of logic that is a false statement. Parentheses and words should state clearly that the RoC has turkish as an official language and that the "TRNC" is a separatist entity.</dd>

<p>Hi, I could not see who else to contact other than you. The Turkish government section doesn't exist anymore, I don't know exactlly what are the reasons of this, but obviously it should be back, I must admit I never liked the previous version, which gave much too importance to Halacoglu. A Turkish user has translated the Turkish article, but I don't find much material that can be retrieved from it.(see his translation on my talkpage) See what you can do about it, maybe you and that guy could work together on it. I'm waiting your answers. <i>Fad</i> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 02:03, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I protected it, and I guess I'll leave a comment on the talk page later.

<dd>Ok, thanks. I guess what the problem we have seems to be the <i>criteria</i> of what belongs in the template. Also what the definition of "Turkic states" are. I'll try to check it out when I have the time. <tt class="plainlinks"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></tt> 06:57, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess I understand how you feel. I suppose the Greek editors look at things from the <i><a href="../../../d/e/_/De_jure.html" title="De jure">de jure</a></i> perspective, while you and the other Turkish editors look at things from the <i><a href="../../../d/e/_/De_facto.html" title="De facto">de facto</a></i> POV.

<p>By the way.. I am sorry I couldn't get back to you earlier. Been running around as usual&#160;:) Pity that Kanuni article didn't make GA, but it's ok. We will eventually get around to it some day! As for the Turkey article, I think it is nearing completion. That's good because I am starting to get tired of looking at the same photos and sentences, I might start dreaming of the Dervishes or the Turkey-EU map at night! <s>I just rewrote the foreign relations section, so have a look and tell me what you think. Obviously there is more room there for disagreement than, say, economy section.</s> In any case, when all of the sections are done I will ask pretty much everyone who has been "hasir nesir" with the article to take a quick review of the article. It should seriously have no problem making FA shortly, there are only minor things left. Hopefully the same will be done for Ataturk one day, its GA was put on hold btw. Thanks for showing interest in the Turkey article recently, sometimes I feel like I am walking in no-man's land&#160;:)) It's ok though, I got nothing to complain about!</p>
<p>I just saw your note on talk:Turkey, so I will take a look there. Cheers! <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 06:23, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I accepted that the article was extremely POV, and, consequently, I proposed its renaming, rewriting and the adoption of a broader prespective. But I do believe - and I insist on this position - that the violations of Kurds' human rights in Turkey is a notable topic deserving a seperate article. I think this was a reasonable stance, and, therefore, it prevailed. After all, a user you regard as more "reasonable" than me was warned for his uncivil comments. Or did you neglect to perceive this last incident?--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 17:38, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"more than understable". This last comment of yours proves your objectivity. I expected something better of you, taking into consideration the content of these outbursts (there were more than one). And what matters in the end is what efforts we make to compromise a tense situation. Whatever I may have initially voted, I proposed and accepted what I regard as a reasonable solution. And I think that this is some proof of "seriousness". Although I really don't think that I have to prove anything to anybody.

<p>So, having fun?&#160;:) Yeah, the AfD wasn't good. Neither was it one of my proudest moments in Wikipedia, nor was it one of my most "keyifli" moments. But you know the story, so let's forget it for a while. Just wanted to let you know that Turkey made GA, with the GA reviewer making clear that he would support the FA pending very minor fixups like making sure that all images were license-free, some typos in the references section, and a few more basic references. Thanks for finding some refs for the history section, I was not able to get my hands on them. However the GA, and the imminent FA, made me actually forget about the whole, well, you know what! <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 08:36, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing out and I'm sorry for the mistake. I really regret that I did not have access to any good sources when I made the map. I just did my best to combine a few existing bad looking images in a better looking, high resolution version. In a week's time I will be in Ankara for a while, then I hope I will have access to good resources in the library to renew the map with better detail and accuracy. But before that, I will correct the Cyprus mistake as soon as possible.

As for the templates, I am trying to look into it. I watch a lot of related articles in that end even though I get less often than I used to. That template was a simple and short "History of Iran" template in the beginning, then it morphed into Greater Iran (?), then it started spanning nearly every single entity that existed in that part of the world. Obviously, it is to be taken with a grain of salt when one hears that "Greater Iran" is <i>only</i> a geographical region and that there is no political innuendo that comes along with it.</dd>

<dd>The template wars, eh?&#160;:) Check this one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Indo-Iranian-speaking&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Indo-Iranian-speaking&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and see what happened between 6-8 Jan, or the flare-up at this article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ottoman_architecture&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ottoman_architecture&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> that led to its protection. I tried to edit it as best as I could and should be ok for the moment.</dd>

<li>Barış is quite right on his comments about the template. This template is getting quite absurd in any sense. There is no geographical designation as Greater Iran. This is a production of Persian revisionists as in the case of Iranian Cultural Continent claim. This is nothing but negationism.

<ul>
<li><i>"... These Ottoman sultans received a good education during their youth, in which they learned Arabic as a scientific language and Persian as the perfect language for literary expression.

<dd>I think you misunderstand the meaning of "Persianate". It does <b>not</b> mean "Persian", it means <i>"influenced by Persian"</i>. The Ottomans <b>were</b> strongly influenced by Persian language and culture, to an extent that until the 17th century, Persian was the court language of the dynasty, and that the Ottoman kings and princes wrote poetry in Persian. This, however, changed with the advent of Shiism in Persia, and the growing influence of the Europeans. On one side, the Ottomans did not want to be identified with the "language of the Shia" anymore, on the other side, they could not prevent the growing influence of their European subjects (especially Greeks). But still, the Ottoman Empire <b>may be</b> regarded as <i>Turkic Persianate</i>, meaning a <i>Turkic dynasty strongly influenced by Persian culture and language</i>. <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tājik</a> 21:47, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The <i>Turkish identity</i> of the Oghuz Turks has always been questioned, most of all by other Turks. And that of Islamizied and Persianized Oghuz, such as the Ottomans, even more. 1000 years ago, Mahmoud Kashgari wrote in his "Lexicon of Turkish words":
<ul>
<li><i>"... We do not consider [those who have mixed to be] among the Turks, since they insert into the speech of the Turks what does not belong to it. ..."</i> -Dīvān ul-Lughat at-Turk 24-26</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Turkology-expert N. Light comments on this in his <i>Turkic literature and the politics of culture in the Islamic world</i> (1998):
<ul>
<li><i>"... It is clear that he [al-Kashgari] `a priori´ <u>excludes the Oghuz, Qipchaq and Arghu from those who speak the pure Turk language</u>. These are the Turks who are most distant from Kâshghari's idealized homeland and culture, and he wants to show his Arab readers <u>why they are not true Turks</u>, but contaminated by urban and foreign influences. Through his dictionary, he hopes to teach his readers to be sensitive to ethnic differences <u>so they do not loosely apply the term Turk to those who do not deserve it</u>. ..."</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>N. Light further explains:
<ul>
<li><i>"... Kashgari clearly distinguishes the Oghuz language from that of the Turks when he says that Oghuz is more refined because they use words alone which Turks only use in combination, and <u>describes Oghuz as more mixed with Persian</u> ..."</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The Oghuz Turks have been <i>Persianized</i> or at least strongly influenced since they entered written history. That's why they are known as "Turkoman" - from Persian <i>"Turk mānand"</i> - <i>like Turks</i>.</dd>
<dd>Now, we are talking about a dynasty that existed 500-800 years later, had adopted Persian life-style, Persian literary standards, Persian poetry, and even the religion of Central Asian Persians (<a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanafi.html" title="Hanafi">Hanafi</a> Sunniism in contrast to the Hanbali and Shafi Sunniism of Arabs). They looked up to Persian saints (i.e. <a href="../../../r/u/m/Rumi.html" title="Rumi">Rumi</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Ghazali_18fe.html" title="Al-Ghazali">al-Ghazali</a>), they wrote Persian poetry themselvs. The Ottomans were simply <i>Persianate</i>. In fact, along with Ghaznavids, Seljuqs, and Mughals, they are the classical examples of a <i><a href="../../../p/e/r/Persianate_society.html" title="Persianate society">Persianate society</a></i> that was of Non-Persian origin. <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tājik</a> 22:22, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Noone claimed that the Ottomans were not Turks. This is a fact that no serious historian would reject. The problem is that you misunderstand the meaning of the word "Persianate". It does NOT mean "Persian in origin", it means "culturally Persianized", and this is another fact that no serious historian would deny. Keeping in mind that the Ottomans are labled "culturally Persianized" and "Persianate" in scholarly works (unfortunately, you deleted those sources), there is no reason not to mention that in the article. In no way does the word "Persianate" deny the Turkish origin and identity of the Ottomans. But it is a well-known fact that the Persian culture had the most important influence on the Ottomans. That's why still, Turks gave their children Persian names (Bahar, Cem, Bahadir, etc), use Persian vocabulary without really knowing their true meaning (gül, "canim", zincir, hafta, zaman, carsamba, persembe, hava, etc), identify themselvs with Persian saints (Baktash Wali, Rumi, and others), etc etc etc. The <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_language.html" title="Ottoman language">Ottoman language</a> was a mixed language, with most of its vocabulary being Persian (the Arabic words were also taken from Persian, as evident in the Persian intonations still used in Turkish, for example in the name "Reza" - Atatürk's father - instead of the correct Arabic <a href="../../../r/i/d/Ridha.html" title="Ridha">Ridha</a>). That's why the Ottomans were a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persianate_society.html" title="Persianate society">Persianate society</a>, despite other influences from Greece, Arabic societies, Western societies, etc. <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">Tājik</a> 18:19, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Re the name change - can you provide sources to suppoort the idea that this period was (or is) referred to as a "civil war" by English sources?

<dd>Well, the TRNC claims to be a European government, and for many years resisted efforts to allow investigators into its territory to look for mass graves. I don't recall Turkey prosecuting officials responsible for massacres in the Kurdish regions. Turkey still hasn't allowed independent historians access to many files concerning the Armenian genocides. Greek Cypriots were responsible for evil, terrible things during the period we're discussing, but let's not pretend any country (and here I include the UK) has clean hands. Except for a couple of small weak Pacific island nations, virtually every country's government is guilty of covering-up atrocious goings-on from its own military or associated paramilitaries at some point or another.</dd>
<dd>Cyprus desperately needs its own Truth and Reconciliation Commission and I believe that making the truth about atrocities committed against innocent civilians by both sides known is more important now than punishment. But that won't come about until there is a solution (which I can;t see any time soon: can you?) <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 21:07, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm confused - do you, personally, recognise the Cypriot government as the legal government of the whole of Cyprus, or not? Strikes me that you're engaged in exactly the same sort of position-of-convenience argument that you're accusing the Republic of. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 17:24, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The Greek Cypriot propaganda would have the Republic's case for legitimacy as being based on morality. Meanwhile, back in the real world, most countries base it on not being terribly keen to allow new countries to be created through invasion of other countries' sovereign territory. The argument you're using might confuse a Cypriot nationalist, but I'm afraid I'm rather more of a believer in realpolitik (or, possibly, cynic). And as far as I can see, your position is that the TRNC should be equal to the Greek Cypriots, but that until the Greek Cypriots recognise this the TRNC government is under no obligation to jail murderers on its own side. Simply a mirror image of the Greek Cypriot argument.</dd>
<dd>My family (by marriage) were innocent of involvement in Turkish Cypriot massacres, being peaceable Leftists. The grandfather was beaten up by the British, my father-in-law was held up against a wall with a gun in the back of his head by EOKA-B supporters (and was only saved because he supported the right football team), and my brother-in-law went through hell in the Greek Cypriot army. Oh, and everyone was nearly killed by invading Turkish forces. As far as I can see, the Greek Cypriot, Turkish Cypriot, Greek, Turkish, British and American governments should none of them be able to pretend to any kind of moral authority. And I'm not a believer in any possible reunification plan. De facto separation will become de jure. (The only question is: why on earth would any Greek Cypriot government ever give up its advantage over the North?) When separation finally happens, then both sides will have a moral obligation to investigate the atrocities carried out in their name: until then, the issue is too tricky for either democratically elected government to justify to its voters. <a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EVizjim_a2a8.html" title="User:Vizjim">Vizjim</a> 22:56, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
