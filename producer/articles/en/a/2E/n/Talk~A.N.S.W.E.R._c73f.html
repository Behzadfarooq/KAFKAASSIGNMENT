<p>Do we know how many of their leaders are actually from the WWP?</p>
<p>Are the WWP _actual_ Stalinists or just described by their opponents as such? <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 13:06, Jan 15, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>you actually don't have to support Stalin to be called stalinist. You just have to do politics as Stalin has... see: <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stalinism.html" title="Stalinism">Stalinism</a></p>
<p><br />
But we also know that stalinist is a general insult thrown around the left. I've seen Trotskyist groups described as Stalinist, for example. I think that use of stalinist is POV.</p>
<p>This article also needs some evidence as to how many of the leaders are actually WWP. It looks like an unsubtantiated slur otherwise. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecretlondon_1805.html" title="User:Secretlondon">Secretlondon</a> 13:14, Jan 15, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>It has been established by several knowlegeable activists that ANSWER is a front organization for the Workers World Party. The domain registration uses the same address as the New York offices of the WWP. The spokespeople for ANSWER, at their press conferences and rallies, have consistently been WWP cadre members. These are people who are known to be leaders within the WWP, activists who lead their other front groups, and people who write for the WWP's newspaper.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know if they're really Stalinist so much as Maoist. The WWP does, after all, exhibit strong support for China, even going so far as to laud the Tiananmen Square Massacre, characterizing it as a battle against counterrevolutionary elements that were rightfully put down by the "People's Government," an odd choice for a protest group.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But that's neither here nor there. The discussion of the WWP's exact political leanings within the Marxist-Leninist system should probably go in the WWP article. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogue_9_6eb1.html" title="User:Rogue 9">Rogue 9</a> 02:50, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I disagree, as many have demonstrated that ANSWER is just a front-group for the radical WWP. Maybe the articles should be joined instead. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorton_devonshire_9599.html" title="User:Morton devonshire">Morton devonshire</a> 20:32, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The fact that people made these remarks at a meeting is not encyclopedic.

<dd>Hi, the above user is me. I apologize for all this. I didn't really understand how the site worked, and thought that my revisions were somehow being reverted automatically. I finally did some investigation, and realized I could just explain it. I hope I haven't agitated you too much.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding my revision, I deleted the reference to the International Action Center in the opening paragraph about A.N.S.W.E.R. because although the IAC was a founding member of the ANSWER Coalition - among a few others - it no longer is a member. In fact it belongs to an entirely different antiwar coalition, the Troops Out Now Coalition. It therefore is an inappopriate sentence for an introduction to ANSWER. If you go the ANSWER website for instance, you will not find any mention of the International Action Center. None of the ANSWER groups refer to it as an "IAC" or "Ramsey Clark" initiative. Of course, if one were to write a history of ANSWER, on the other hand, it would be necessary to describe the IAC's past involvement.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Likewise, I removed the International R.E.S.P.O.N.S.E. criticism of ANSWER, because after a little investigation, that does not appear to be the name of any functioning social justice organization. In fact, it appears simply to be a webpage satirically created to slander and criticize ANSWER. We are, after all, talking about one of, if not the largest, antiwar coalitions in the country, so it has been involved in many meaningful debates, polemics, and discussions. The Wikipedia entry instead unduly highlights a criticism from a made-up group, which could have been thrown together in a few minutes. It doesn't really shed any light on the history of the organization or its involvement in the antiwar movement. It could be listed in the "criticisms" of ANSWER section of the page, but it's hardly the authoritative, or even credible, voice when it comes to describing ANSWER's organizational approach. Really the entry needs to be thoroughly expanded, because at the present time, "International RESPONSE" and the "Lerner incident" - receive an inordinate amount of attention considering everything that ANSWER has done in its 4-year (to the day) history. The "Lerner Incident" really is less than 1% of ANSWER's history - no antiwar coalition backed his claim of antisemitism, and the issue soon disappeared. It shouldn't be written out of the history, but it shouldn't be half the entry. I attempted to cut it down, but had the revision reverted once again.</dd>

<li>I have no problem with cutting the International R.E.S.P.O.N.S.E. material. I agree, it is at best a fringy group, at worst one guy with a computer.</li>
<li>This article, like any encyclopedia article, is in equal doses about the present and the past. If WWP, IAC, and Ramsey Clark were just two unconnected groups and an individual who happened to be among the founders, I would agree that it was not important. But, in fact, IAC was a WWP front pure and simple, and Ramsey Clark (who, by the way, I respect quite a bit) has a history of close work with them going back at least to the 1980s. And they didn't just happen to be among the founders: in the early days of A.N.S.W.E.R. they were utterly dominant. They provided nearly all of the group's impressive logistical capability, and leveraged that to effectively dictate the group's line. They are <i>the reason</i> A.N.S.W.E.R. was able to get up and going so amazingly fast after 9/11 when no one else in the U.S. peace movement could achieve anything of the sort. But they are also the reason so much of the U.S. peace movement distrusted A.N.S.W.E.R. from the get-go. This is absolutely central to the story of this group. To leave it out would be like writing an article about the U.S. Civil War and leaving out slavery, or an article about Oscar Wilde and leaving out that he was an incredibly popular playwright.</li>
<li>The word I've heard is that the Party for Socialism and Liberation plays almost exactly the role in A.N.S.W.E.R. previously played by the WWP, and that it is in large measure the same people, organized in a similar manner. I have no idea how accurate this is, and I'd be interested in seeing citation in either direction. I think the article probably needs to have a paragraph on that, and would hope it would be <i>well</i> covered at <a href="../../../p/a/r/Party_for_Socialism_and_Liberation_0078.html" title="Party for Socialism and Liberation">Party for Socialism and Liberation</a>. Frankly, I haven't been paying that much attention to A.N.S.W.E.R. now that they are not "the only game in town" (although I probably will be at their Seattle rally a week on Saturday 9/24, because on that day they are "the only game" in <i>my</i> town).</li>
<li>I seems disingenuous to say that "no antiwar coalition backed his claim of antisemitism". "Coalition" narrows it down to A.N.S.W.E.R. itself, NION, and UFPJ. Quite a few organizations and important journals of opinion on the left felt he was quite mistreated, although most viewed this as political narrowness rather than anti-semitism. Since Lerner himself urged people nonetheless to support and attend the rally in question, the lines were not drawn as sharply as they might have been. The incident may have been chronologically "less than 1% of ANSWER's history", but only in the sense that shooting wars have been "less than 1% of the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict": you can't explain the bitterness on both sides without telling that part of the story.</li>

<p>Thanks for your thoughtful response. I think most of your points about the history of ANSWER and the Lerner Incident are on the money, and therefore could be expounded in the way you’ve laid them out above.</p>
<p>The reason no other peace organizations could "achieve anything of the sort" after 9/11 is not just the organizational abilities of WWP, which certainly existed before 2001. Many peace organizations and anti-globalization groups were at a virtual standstill in the period after 9/11 because of the country's rallying cry of unity. Every antiwar organization was bombarded with calls and hate mail - they were called traitors at worst, heartless and narrow-minded at best. In the face of all that, many peace groups took the year off. This is the other side of ANSWER’s ascendancy—the willingness to immediately take on the Afghanistan war. Rather than some innate propensity for “sectarian” behavior, ANSWER was a coalition based on the groups left standing, and there were very few. Now that’s clearly a position more suited for a subjective work, than for an encyclopedia entry, but if we have the one position, we have to have the other. On the same token, the peace groups’ resistance to ANSWER (which didn’t really solidify until the October 2002 formation of UFPJ) can be attributed not merely to tactical or organizational questions, but political differences that in many cases predate the formation of both coalitions. We can’t simply say that other peace groups criticized ANSWER as being hard to work with, if we don’t take into account those political differences.</p>
<p>I think it’s fine to have the criticisms of ANSWER in the entry, which label it a “front group,” as long as we give the rebuttal as well. I know, for instance, that the label deeply offends the other organizations in the coalition, who put in their energies and resources as well. Those organizations are by no means “front” organizations. I would agree that the label may be applicable for the IAC’s (which never claimed to be a coalition) relationship with Workers World, but that same relationship did not carry over into ANSWER.</p>
<p>You stated, “[WWP] provided nearly all of the group's impressive logistical capability, and leveraged that to effectively dictate the group's line.” To include this in the entry, in my opinion would need a source from a member group of the ANSWER Coalition. How do we know that the group’s political program was arrived at through crude leveraging, as opposed to thoughtful internal discussion? As it stands, it’s an assumption.</p>
<p>I did not delete the IAC passage with the intention of erasing its involvement in ANSWER. I figured that was addressed in the comments about ANSWER being a front group. As far as laying out what the group is about currently—which the first paragraph aims to do—it would serve much better to describe its political stances, its place on the political spectrum, its initiative, etc., not its organizational lineage. Yes, it’s part of ANSWER’s development, but if picked up in a cursory way, it’s misleading.</p>
<p>I’m going to work on a basic history of ANSWER—which explains why it became and remains a force, what it has done, and where it has been criticized. The point is not simply to explain how some movement forces view ANSWER, but what objective political role ANSWER has played. Hopefully you can take a look at it, and we can find enough common ground to come away with an entry that explains these important debates in their proper contexts.

<dd>That, and A.N.S.W.E.R. got a very early start. The organization formed on what, September 14, 2001? 72 hours later? As a note, this fact is found suspicious by several people; A.N.S.W.E.R. is good at organizing, no doubt, but that's a really short time to throw together an entire organizational platform.

<dd>I made that edit. The news reports on that demo cited a turnout of 8,000 for the ANSWER protest and 2,000 for the Anti-Capitalist Convergence protests held earlier that morning. I was an organizer with the ACC. I also run a news website on activism and have some experience estimating crowd sizes. It is well known among activists that ANSWER routinely inflates crowd sizes for its protests. While many activist groups routinely double the size of the actual crowd numbers, ANSWER has been known to triple the actual crowd count. They claim that their September protest last year attracted 300,000 when most observers put the crowd size at around 100k. The Washington police doesn't issues official estimates anymore, but they unofficially estimated the September protests at around 150,000. There was a lot of fudging going on and people weren't taking into account the large numbers of people attending the National Book Expo which was being held on The Mall at the same time. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 17:54, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"As former leaders and members of Workers World Party, we defend that group's historical tradition and mission, particularly that of its founder Sam Marcy. Although we believe that the Workers World Party leadership is no longer capable of fulfilling that mission, we still consider it to be a progressive organization with many honest activists."</p>
<p>As of about April of 2004, there were no leaders or organizers in ANSWER who were in WWP. They resigned from WWP and started PSL, as this founding statement indicates. The above might be useful to put in the article as the ANSWER/WWP meme still floats around. Also, PSL might more properly be called a "revolutionary socialist" party, rather than Marxist-Leninist, as they are not toed to any particular Marxist interpretation.</p>

<dd>It's certainly one of the bigger stories within the antiwar movement right now. Yes, the split is mostly interesting to people active within the movement. But non-activists and those people uninterested in the politics within the antiwar movement would also be less likely to look up an encyclopedic entry for a particular antiwar group. I don't see how "criticisms of ANSWER" or "the Lerner incident" or even the origins of ANSWER are in and of themselves more "interesting" than the major political debate within the antiwar movement.

Note that most of the pictures of rally attendees on that page are of signs mentioning organizations that are not part of ANSWER, e.g. "International Bolshevik Tendency" and the "One Korea" people. And yes, ANSWER members deny that it's a "front group." That's a hostile term. If there are one or two who don't, I'm not sure why they work for ANSWER, but regardless it's a perfectly fair general statement, as, say, "Democrats deny that they are in favor of appeasement" would be, Zell Miller notwithstanding. <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 22:42, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>At the least, this group needs to be scrutinized because there are shadow extremist groups that exist in the US. I do not categorize them based on the typical "far left" or "Right wing extremist," that's like differentiating between coke and pepsi. It must be understood that liberals tolerate (in the true sense, you can be against a war without going as far as this group) these sort of groups just as conservatives tolerate theirs. A bottled example would be the difference between the Christian Coalition and the Aryan nations for a complete "opposite" comparison. Progressive Democrats of America and ANSWER would be the "other side." The methods are the same however, despite the labels. These groups change all the time too as shown by the continual splitting and reformation. It's hard to agree on anything when no one is willing to compromise at all. RMartinez</p>

<p>FACTS ABOUT ANSWER</p>
<p>A.N.S.W.E.R. is a cover up for the Workers World Party, a Stalinist organization. According to Stephen Zunes, chair of the Peace and Justice Studies Program at the University of San Francisco,”Basically, A.N.S.W.E.R. is dominated by the IAC, which is largely a front for the Workers World Party.” David Corn, a writer for the liberal publication Common Dreams, stated, “A.N.S.W.E.R. is run by W.W.P. activists, to such an extent that it seems fair to dub it a W.W.P. front.”</p>
<dl>
<dd>Entirely false now, largely false before. The WWP split, and many of its members joined a new group, the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Party_for_Socialism_and_Liberation_0078.html" title="Party for Socialism and Liberation">Party for Socialism and Liberation</a>. The remaining WWP no longer participates in ANSWER. IAC is pretty much a WWP front, yes; ANSWER is considerably wider, though the WWP had a lot of influence and now the PSL has somewhat less.</dd>
</dl>
<p>A.N.S.W.E.R.’s director, Ramsey Clark, has served as the spokesman for the W.W.P since the early 1990s. Ramsey Clark is currently part of the legal defense team for Saddam Hussein, and was part of the legal defense team for Serbian dictator Slobodan Milosevic in the International Criminal Court. Another director of A.N.S.W.E.R., Brian Becker, is part of the W.W.P. Secretariat.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think <a href="../../../r/a/m/Ramsey_Clark_7775.html" title="Ramsey Clark">Ramsey Clark</a> is the "director" of ANSWER - no such position exists as far as I know. The rest is true, except that Brian Becker's with the PSL now.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Slight further correction: while Clark and WWP are (very) close, he is not in any formal sense a "spokesman" for the WWP. I don't think he has ever even been officially a member. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:20, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The former FBI Director under President Clinton, Louis Freeh, included W.W.P. in a talk about “domestic terrorist groups” on May 10, 2001 when speaking to Senate committees. He also denounced “Anarchists and extremist socialist groups - many of which, such as the Workers World Party, have an international presence and, at times, also represent a potential threat in the United States.”</p>
<dl>
<dd>Which suggests that Freeh is operating in the proud tradition of <a href="../../../c/o/i/Cointelpro.html" title="Cointelpro">Cointelpro</a>, and is an argument for why charges like these against ANSWER ought to be taken with a huge grain of salt.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The W.W.P. does not want to participate within the American political system, it wants to overthrow our democratic form of government and eliminate private property. LeiLani Dowell of the W.W.P. said at their conference in November, 2004, “I think that these elections proved to many that there is no choice between Democratic and Republican–and essentially no choice for working people under capitalism.” A document on the A.N.S.W.E.R. website entitled “Who is the A.N.S.W.E.R. Coalition” states, “The global anti-war movement must be a movement of international solidarity against the U.S. empire.”</p>
<dl>
<dd>The WWP is Marxist. No shit; no secret.</dd>
</dl>
<p>A.N.S.W.E.R. supports the Iraqi resistance against US troops. “Having achieved their victory [the US in Iraq], however, the occupiers now confront a people who have a long and proud history of resistance. The anti-war movement here and around the world must give its unconditional support to the Iraqi anti-colonial resistance.” Richard Becker, A.N.S.W.E.R. Steering Committee, Downloadable flyer on “Counter-revolution and Resistance in Iraq,” May 2003. A recent Workers World editorial stated, “Iraq has done absolutely nothing wrong.”</p>
<dl>
<dd>False. ANSWER has not taken a position on the resistance. The WWP and PSL both support the resistance, however.</dd>
</dl>
<p>A.N.S.W.E.R.’s steering committee and endorsers include the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a Marxist-Leninist organization, and the Freedom Sociality Party, a Trotskyite group. A.N.S.W.E.R. supports Fidel Castro and communist Cuba.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Now the PSL enters, finally. The Freedom Socialist party is a multi-tendency Marxist group with Maoist roots, not Trotskyist ones. It is not on ANSWER's steering committee. ANSWER does not support Castro; the WWP and PSL both do, I believe.

<li>FSP "endorses" ANSWER, but I don't think they have much influence inside the group, except maybe when it comes to organizing events in Seattle where they are headquartered and where they far outnumber PSL/WWP. They certainly are not large enough nationally to influence the national platform. But your basic point holds, despite your confusion: FSP supports both ANSWER and the Cuban government, but that doesn't mean ANSWER supports the Cuban government.<br />
<br />
From past experience at times organizing rallies and dealing with WWP (and I would presume that the same would now apply to PSL) one of their standard arguments is that there will be a broader coalition by strictly limiting the points of agreement as to what the umbrella group stands for. In practice, this does usually mean that they don't try to get umbrella groups, even their own front groups, to adopt some of their own loonier stands, but the flip side is that they oppose the adoption of "points of agreement" that reach out to the mainstream. For example, during the Gulf War era of '90-'91, they refused to be part of any umbrella group that spoke out against Saddam Hussein as well as against the U.S. Needless to say, most of us were not interested in working closely with a group that wanted to soundly condemn the U.S. but take no stand on Saddam.<br />
<br />
(By the way, nothing but positives to be said about FSP in terms of organizing: they may fight with others in advance about what the event is supposed to be, but on the day they are there and working to support the agenda that was agreed upon. In my experience, unlike most "vanguard" parties, they understand the notion of endorsing someone else's action without taking it over. Probably part of why their candidates for office in Seattle have sometime received double-digit percentages in elections, pretty remarkable for Trotskyists running in the U.S.) -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 18:43, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A.N.S.W.E.R. sends its professional demonstrators to rallies in order to further its own agenda, not the agenda of the participants. Students were warned by the University of Michigan Daily about the real force behind a January 2003 anti-war rally put on by A.N.S.W.E.R. - “many who read about the rally afterward will assume the crowd showed up to support A.N.S.W.E.R.’s agenda rather than to learn about or participate in the anti-war movement.”</p>
<dl>
<dd>ANSWER sends organizers to rallies. They try to further their agenda. Insofar as their agenda conflicts with that of other participants, those participants have no reason to endorse ANSWER. The fact that "many... will assume" otherwise is the product of right-wing red-baiting, and relevant to serious politics as a phenomenon to study, not a valid theory.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The W.W.P. supports the Chinese communist government, and encouraged its use of tanks against students demonstrating in favor of democracy in Tiannamen Square in 1989, where many died. In the past, it defended Soviet suppression of worker rebellions in eastern European countries, and in 1991 supported the KGB coup against former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev. The W.W.P. is a staunch advocate of Kim Jong II.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. The WWP has terrible politics. It split from the Trotskyist movement in 1956 because it (and it alone) supported the Soviet invasion of Hungary.</dd>

<p>Hey, I don't have the time/resources to update the article, but I was just thinking the critiques of ANSWER section is a little weak. I think most of the problem activists have with ANSWER are there organizing tactics at rallies. For example the most common complaint is that they stack the speakers list at anti-iraq war marches with pro-palistine speakers. although the two conflicts are connected, the complaint is that they monopolize and confuse the message being projected to the media.</p>
<p>Also another complaint recently I have heard is about ANSWER trying claim credit for the immigration protests that are going on and trying to dominate the issue. Thats a completely unsubstantiated rumour, but I thought I'd put it out there because there are probably articles written about it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 204.52.215.101 (<a href="../../../2/0/4/User_talk%7E204.52.215.101.html" title="User talk:204.52.215.101">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_204.52.215.101_85cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/204.52.215.101">contribs</a>) 25 April 2006.</small></p>

<p>I've reverted from an incompletely-fixed version of the article to a better earlier one. The first removal of the vandalism by PlagueRat wasn't a revert, it was partial, and so the subsequent reverts didn't go all the way back.</p>
<p>Some of what I've restored by going back to this earlier version may be controversial. (Some, e.g. removing the characterization of ANSWER as "deliberately misportraying" the Minutemen, won't be.) I've removed all uses of the term "illegal aliens." This is a POV term; "undocumented immigrant" is much more accurate. One of the major slogans of the immigrant rights movement, which is itself a force capable of bringing millions of people onto the street, is "no human being is illegal." Thus for Wikipedia to assert that some people are accurately described as "illegal" violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. "Undocumented" is a neutral term which factually describes the behavior which is illegal and which is alleged to make a person illegal.</p>
<p>I've seen people argue that using "undocumented" is POV because it disguises the illegality in a way that separates immigrating without proper documents from other crimes - we wouldn't use the phrase "undocumented drug dealer" or "undocumented murderer." Well, for one, even if this were the case it wouldn't make "illegal" less POV, given the existence of substantial, documentable controversy about the use of that word. But more directly, we wouldn't use the phrase "illegal drug dealer" or "illegal murderer" either. We normally characterize criminal behaviors by describing the behavior; the fact that they are illegal is not an essential part of the description. We also normally characterize the <i>behavior</i> as illegal, not the <i>person</i> who behaves. There is no serious objection to the accuracy or appropriateness of the term "undocumented." However, if someone has something more likely to be acceptable to everyone, please substitute.

<dd>You're joking right? The correct term is illegal. If you search for "undocumented immigration," you get redirected to "Illegal Immigration". That means "illegal immigrant" is the standard on Wikipedia. If you google "Illegal Immigrants", you get 18.4 million results. "Undocument immigrants" only yields 1.8 million. The United States government uses "Illegal" in its publications referring to the issue.</dd>

<dd>Also: you say <i>One of the major slogans of the immigrant rights movement, which is itself a force capable of bringing millions of people onto the street, is "no human being is illegal."

<dd>No, I'm not joking. Please <a href="../../../a/s/s/WP%7EAssume_good_faith_cd17.html" title="WP:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>.

Within articles, where referring to people cannot be avoided, Wikipedia's use is inconsistent - many articles use many terms, and there is no place for a central policy to be worked out that I know of.</dd>
<dd>The fact that people oppose something does not mean that using it requires bias in their favor. I don't have to be Black or love Black people to avoid using the word "nigger." The internet suffers from many biases and is not authoritative. The same is true, even if to a lesser degree, of the U.S. government. "The abominable and detestable crime against nature" was until recently a term legally defined in Massachussetts referring to anal sex. Nevertheless it was not an acceptable phrase for a Wikipedia article.</dd>
<dd>You have yet to give a positive reason for the biased nature of "undocumented." You have given reasons why "illegal" might be neutral, though none of them addresses the problem of referring to humans as illegal. What is wrong with "undocumented"?</dd>

<dd>To put in my two cents, I personally see "illegal" as hopefully POV here. "Undocumented" comes across to me as closer to neutral, and more politically correct, because it doesn't include the stigmas associated with the word "illegal". <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 02:11, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't agree with that. Illegal simply means not in accordance with the laws at the time. The immigrants in question came into the country in a manner inconsistent with the law. Undocumented immigrants would need to be documented to be legal immigrants; they're not, so therefore they're illegal. There's no NPOV problem here. It doesn't really matter whether the law's just or not when you describe something as illegal; that's a real pov issue. For example, you could talk about "Illegal speech in China" Which is a real concept. The fact that most Americans hold that speech shouldn't be illegal doesn't change that fact.--71.141.160.5 10:35, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But no one here has been arguing that Wikipedia shouldn't talk about "illegal immigration." The problem is precisely that the phrase applies "illegal" to the people, not to their acts. "Illegal speech in China" - fine, yes. "Illegal speakers in China" - at minimum, a very weird way of putting it. <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 14:52, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>MagicKirin has a point, but expressing it badly.

<dd>I'm fine with that. My question is, how correct is the ADL? Should we be adding a response to that charge? I mean, how many people were seriously chanting things about bombing Tel Aviv? I wasn't at any of those rallies (I wouldn't be caught dead at an ANSWER rally except in a breakaway march). I do however doubt it was <i>that</i> screwed up. I could understand some of the leaders of ANSWER taking those positions, but I doubt a lot of the rank and file (ie, the people <i>not</i> involved with the WWP/PSL) would be that stupid. I tend to not trust the ADL on issues regarding <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_anti-Semitism_dc04.html" title="New anti-Semitism">leftist "anti-Semitism"</a>. Although there are some currents of anti-Semitism within the left, it's pretty ridiculous to characterize <i>any</i> opposition to Israeli policy as anti-Semitic like the ADL often does. IMO, Israel <i>is</i> a racist state (like just about any other one) and it only has it's own actions to blame for the intifada. At the same time, groups like Hamas and Hezbollah are incredibly reactionary and although they may be justified in resisting oppression, they do have a lot of serious problems themselves, and would probably be doing the same things themselves if the tables were turned. How many people at these marches really <i>were</i> offering uncritical support for these groups? That sort of position does smack of anti-Semitism in my opinion, but I wouldn't be surprised if the ADL was blowing things way out of proportion. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><sup>Got something to say?</sup></font></a> 05:26, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The PSL people who are much of ANSWER's leadership do tend towards uncritical support for Hamas &amp; Hezbollah, though it's not a matter of anti-semitism particularly; they also uncritically supported Milosevic, for example.

<dd>It's pretty simple. The links belong in these entries, because that's what the "Related Links" section is for. That's where you put links to external websites. The person who keeps censoring these links refuses to understand that Wikipedia policies do not apply to content on other websites. External websites should be included if they have content--opinion, factual or otherwise--which is relevant to the subject entry on Wikipedia. The Infoshop pages contain critical information and opinion about these groups. In the case of the Infoshop page on ANSWER, this page has been widely cited around the Internet. I'm pretty frustrated with this continued censorship by a petty authoritarian who can't handle criticism of his precious groups. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 04:46, 15 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So we basically agree. I'm all for including it as an external link. I'd be leery about using it as a citation, but I think it's a great external link. I actually found that page way back in 2003, and what it speaks of has been demonstrated quite well, particularly at ANSWER's May 20, 2006 demonstration at Malcolm X Park, which was definitely not the ANSWER that I used to know at the forefront of the anti-war movement. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 10:31, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Munson's frustration aside: plain facts are simple. This unsigned and unsourced piece of polemical doggeral is unverifiable by its very nature. Should this piece be signed, and its cowardly authors take credit for it – on the linked page in question – then there is no dispute. In that case, the author would assume legal liability for the claims made, rather than hiding behind a political identity or an invented Wikiality. Several similar pieces are no doubt of utility to those who post them: poltiical cowards who are afraid to take the cheers and jeers for their handywork. Further, ANSWER has no ongoing relationship to the WWP. Attempts to imply various guilts by association, by anonymous hacks are not "criticism." I have made no effort to remove external links because I disagree with them. That is not what is at issue. Basic intellectual integrity is, and by the standards of wikipedia: "encyclopedic content must be verifiable." Claims of "front groupsk," and other POV garbage of that ilk are NOT verifiable, and the anonymous authors of this (and similar Infoshop.org hosted) pieces prefer it that way. It makes passing lies off as truth all the easier. Well, this "petty authoritarian" believes that veracity is no imposition, but the very least we can expect. So, that said, there is no consensus here for the inclusion of this link. <a href="../../../i/n/_/User%7EIn_the_Stacks_e052.html" title="User:In the Stacks">In the Stacks</a></p>

<dd>I'd also like to hope that Munson can put his attitude back in his pants and keep the issues in dispute. This is not an anarchist meeting, and his use of pejoratives (petty authoritarian, etc) are really beside the point. In point of fact, I am not the one trying to impose lies and distortions as "relevant," which to my understanding of the term is exactly what not-so-petty authoritarians like Karl Rove do for a living.

<p>At this point I'm amused at In the Stacks' obsession with using Wikipedia to censor any criticism of groups that he supports. In fact, In the Stacks has shown a single-minded devotion to protecting these groups from criticism and he has shown that he will make up the wildest stuff about other Wikipedians. That's all beside the point, because these links clearly belong in the "Related Links" section of these entries. If you follow the argument that In the Stacks is making, he is basically saying that Wikipedia should vet the accuracy of every external link. And links to opinion and criticism are verboten too, unless he has written the criticism. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChuck0_00fb.html" title="User:Chuck0">Chuck0</a> 05:21, 17 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Considering your calls to boycott Wikipedia, your new fangled identity as a "Wikipedian" is thoroghly amusing. This is not "censorship," it's intellectual integrity. You don't even bother <i>claiming</i> that what <i>you</i> are trying to post (which is for <i>your own website</i>, speaking of original research) is <i>true</i>. Cyncial isn't even the word for it.

<p>For the better part of a month, there has been some back-and-forth reverting of a link from infoshop.org listed under the "Criticism" subheading of the external links section (link in question <a href="http://www.infoshop.org/texts/wwp.html" class="external text" title="http://www.infoshop.org/texts/wwp.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>).

<li>Sorry I also don't see any reason why the link should be added in the first place.

<li>The link basically, in many words, say two things: 1. ANSWER is a part of WWP. 2. WWP are totalitarian. Both claims appears to be basically correct, but the page in question are written in a rather hysterical style which I think is detrimental to the point they are making. That ANSWER is a part of WWP is already mentioned in the article, and that WWP aren't exactly democratic is quite evident from the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workers_World_Party_a1b4.html" title="Workers World Party">WWP</a> page.All in all I don't think the link adds any significant information to what is already available on the ANSWER and WWP pages, so it doesn't need to be included. --<a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7ERegebro_5b16.html" title="User:Regebro">Regebro</a> 15:36, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>How can this article not include at least some info on ANSWER's support of Mumia?

<dd>I do not believe ANSWER as such has engaged any work around Mumia. That there are "half a dozen signs" in the massive protests ANSWER has organized does not seem a defining feature – and confuses what coalition members do besides formal ANSWER activities, as well as what people who just show up have to say.

<dd>Hi Stacks. One of the "Free Mumia" campaigns is 'part of' ANSWER. I'll try to find out which one. As someone who attends at least half-a-dozen anti-war protests a year, it's a gripe of mine. Several ANSWER organized protests I attended had speakers in support of Mumia, The following quote sums it up for me. <i>"In addition to the Palestine question, ANSWER has been repeatedly criticized for espousing the cause of Mumia Abu-Jamal, the journalist and former Black Panther on Death Row in Pennsylvania. In the October issue of Rolling Stone, writer Tim Dickinson quotes Paul Rieckhoff, director of the Iraq veterans group Operation Truth, which boycotted the September 24 march. "It's not about Palestine, it's not about Mumia, it's about one focused message: Let's find a way to end this war."</i> <a href="http://www.peaceworkmagazine.org/pwork/0604/060414.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.peaceworkmagazine.org/pwork/0604/060414.htm" rel="nofollow">Linky</a> - <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairness_And_Accuracy_For_All_6573.html" title="User:Fairness And Accuracy For All">F.A.A.F.A.</a> 23:14, 26 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's fine, but this demand in some quarters for issues like domestic political prisoners to be banned from the stage of mass mobilizations is distinct from the basis of unity or practice of ANSWER.

<p>Not exactly on the topic of Mumia (so I'm starting a new section), but this leads to something that I am wondering if we can find a way to take up (that is, whether we can come up with reliable sources for this). Two related things seem to me to distinguish ANSWER from UFPJ or even NION, and were also evident in the WWP-sponsored coalition during the 1990 leadup to the 1991 Gulf War; this divide had parallels in U.S. left politics at least as far back as the Vietnam War and groups centered on the PLP, for example. First, the WWP-sponsored coalitions inevitably allow for what Alex Cockburn once famously dubbed the WWP's Marxism-Leninism-Bonkerism: finding good things in Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosevic, Kim Jong Il. Second, given as a justification for this inclusion, is the argument that by having a very limited set of consensus planks—typically, only opposition to certain U.S. government actions or views, bu nothing about the actions of any enemy of the U.S.—one can in theory build a "broader" movement, because one can include both people who condemn the likes of Saddam, Milosevic, and Kim and those who do not. UFPJ, notwithstanding its CPUSA ties, has firmly rejected this (as have many other U.S. antiwar coalitions over the years), arguing instead (and, to my mind, much more plausibly) that one can build a far larger, stronger, and more principled movement by insisting that this be among the basic points of agreement include forthright condemnation of these dictators, so that great mass of people who are not willing to be associated with Bonkerists will feel comfortable joining. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 07:15, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I have some sympathy personally with the points you are making here (more than a little, btw) – it seems a very slippery slope towards POV writing. eg "bonkerism," which, however clever (and true) is tricky to incorporate. ANSWER's position on this is (formally) that opposing imperialism is the task of "antiwar" activists within the USA, and that this is distinct from "upholding" any given foreign regime. This dispute is quite old. In its more particular forms, including the same personel, it goes back to the first Gulf War when the antecedents to UFPJ demanded sanctions against Iraq, sanctions that went on to kill hundreds of thousands of people (according to both UN estimates and US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright). Without turning this page into a debate on the relative merits, or lack thereof, of these arguments – how could this be incorporated without POV exchanges? Would adding something like this to the external links help clarify matters? <a href="http://burning.typepad.com/burningman/2005/12/ufpj_rejects_fu.html" class="external free" title="http://burning.typepad.com/burningman/2005/12/ufpj_rejects_fu.html" rel="nofollow">http://burning.typepad.com/burningman/2005/12/ufpj_rejects_fu.html</a><a href="../../../i/n/_/User%7EIn_the_Stacks_e052.html" title="User:In the Stacks">In the Stacks</a> 18:00, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, that might be a useful addition, I think it mostly gets it right, and it seems like Jacobs ought to qualify as citable on this. Still, I'm wondering if somewhere—probably not within this article, but linked from here—we can get into more about this particular split within the American anti-war movement. As I said, it goes back <i>at least</i> to the Vietnam era, so presumably by now some reputable historians have written about it. I would think it would make an interesting article. Obviously, my use here of Cockburn's "bonkerism" indicates which side of the divide I am on, and while I think the Cockburn quote belongs in the (proposed) article, so would something from the other side, ideally something equally pithy and scathing from the WWP/Clark/etc. side would also belong. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:57, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As ANSWER is very selective in who and what they protest. For instance when have they protested Cuba's prisons or the beheading of hostages? Should we mentioned this in the heading?65.96.132.149 16:50, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would dare to say that most groups are very selective as to who and what they protest. So therefore, no, I don't think it warrants a mention. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">SchuminWeb</a> (<a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">Talk</a>) 17:38, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The first sentence in the intro "Formed within three days of the September 11th attacks, and officially founded on September 14, 2001 by Ramsey Clark and members of the International Action Center" is quite emphatic, but uncited. Could someone point to a NPOV reference that describes the early history of ANSWER and details Clark and IAC's involvement?
