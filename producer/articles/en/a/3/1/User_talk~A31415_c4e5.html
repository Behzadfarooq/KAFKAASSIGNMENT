<p>You still haven't justified why this info is here. Just because you get hits on a Google News search doesn't mean that it should be included; your user's main page seems to contradict your stance. Justify including this info and I'll leave it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>My justification is that the incident was published about in a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, the story according to the writer involves both H-A alumni and a senior administrator, and took place in the area. It is a notable occurrence that took place with regards to the school, and was the subject of nontrivial coverage- that is my justification for including it. I would do the same to any other school if such an incident garnered media coverage. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 20:10, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't think you read the article closely, then. If you want this in wp, maybe it should go over to First_Baptist_Church_of_Hammond. All the references in the article point to the pastor and lawyer for the church. The rape charges were dropped. One article in one - small - newspaper does not 'nontrivial coverage' make.</p>
<dl>
<dd>As a matter of fact, the fact that two columns were written specifically about the incident <i>does</i> "nontrivial coverage" make. The size of the newspaper is irrelevant. I am not entirely sure why it would belong in the First Baptist Church of Hammond's article other than the stolen goods were stored in a trailer rented from the church (as I understand it)- the article implicated that the former students were the subject of the court proceedings and that Jack Schaap was involved in getting a confession from the two. It would (obviously) be inappropriate to mention that on his page, but that does not decrease the notability of this story or the appropriateness of listing it on this page, I think. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 20:26, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
There's my point then: you are not looking at the article. College's don't have pastors and that is who Jack Schaap is titled in the article. It was the church that got involved, not the college.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Nevertheless, as I understand it, they were students of the college at the time, not just involved in the FBC of Hammond. Being that it was covered in the news by a reliable and verifiable source, it is entirely appropriate for it to be covered if well-sourced and attributed, in the article. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 20:38, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
No, that is not correct. They were not students at the time, "former" in this frame of reference being at the time of the burglaries as explained in the link. Weren't you lecturing me about sources? <a href="http://nwitimes.com/articles/2004/02/27/news/lake_county/9d6557f4f6d947db86256e47000260bb.txt" class="external free" title="http://nwitimes.com/articles/2004/02/27/news/lake_county/9d6557f4f6d947db86256e47000260bb.txt" rel="nofollow">http://nwitimes.com/articles/2004/02/27/news/lake_county/9d6557f4f6d947db86256e47000260bb.txt</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>As I said, the way I understood the article was that they were students and were suspended or otherwise put aside when the charges were brought against them, and that's the reason why some of them are now facing internal hearings within the school, per the second link in the article which you removed. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 20:51, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Read the link in my last response. Two of the three - the ones charged - were not students at the time. I'm willing to offer a compromise, though. Since everything about every action that Hyles-Anderson college did with regards to this even was positive, I'd be willing to repost this event as long as it gets a new heading that is not under Controversy and Criticism. Jack Schaap, the chancellor of Hyles-Anderson College, directed his staff and legal counsel to intervene in this event. Through the influence exerted by Hyles-Anderson College the prosecutors secured convictions against the perpetrators and some of the stolen goods were recovered. That sounds above and beyond the call of duty for an education institution.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have no problem with including the information under a new section. I'm not out to make anyone or anything look bad- the only reason I reverted your edits were because the information was well-sourced and seemed notable in the context of the small towns in and around which it happened. If you think it would be better served by putting it under a different heading, that would be keen. --<a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a><sup>-<a href="../../../k/u/z/User_talk%7EKuzaar_098a.html" title="User talk:Kuzaar">T</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kuzaar_6d24.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kuzaar">C</a>-</sup> 15:14, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
