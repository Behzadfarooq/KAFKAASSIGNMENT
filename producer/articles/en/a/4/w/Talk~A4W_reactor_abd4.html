<p>The shaft horsepower does not have anything to do with the A4W reactor. The shaft horsepower is determined by the turbines that are on the various Nimitz class aircraft carriers. The specification that is on all of the US Navy VNimitz Class Carriers is 260,000, but even that is incorrect. I do not think that the Navy will disclose the actual #s, so citing reliable references is going to be nearly impossible.</p>
<p>The fuel lifespan is not set for each of the A4W reactors in the US Navy fleet. Most are rated at 30 years, but they all vary due to different designs. The reactors themselves do not have a rating for lifespan.</p>
<p>In the design section, I took out all of the metals and percentages because they are just plain wrong. The design of the fuel is not correct either.</p>
<p>I also do not believe that BAPL or KAPL actually built the reactors. I believe that Westinghouse actually built them, with technical input from BAPL and KAPL, but I can not prove that. Nly8nchz 11:24, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the past, we have -when possible- tried to put information on shaft horsepower in the reactor article. This is in part because while any particular reactor design may be used on a variety of ship classes, the reactor normally produces a certain amount of steam which is then fed into the steam turbines designed for that particular reactor. Hence why the <a href="../../../d/2/g/D2G_35aa.html" title="D2G">D2G</a> reactor produces 30,000 shp regardless of if it is installed on the <a href="../../../b/a/i/Bainbridge_class_cruiser.html" title="Bainbridge class cruiser">Bainbridge</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truxtun_class_cruiser.html" title="Truxtun class cruiser">Truxtun</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_class_cruiser.html" title="California class cruiser">California</a>, or <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia_class_cruiser.html" title="Virginia class cruiser">Virginia</a> class cruisers. As long as the information in question is properly <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cited</a> and from a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>, I am sure we are fine. Thanks for removing the incorrect info on the reactor lifespans and composition. BAPL was operated by Westinghouse until 1999, when Bechtel took over the government contract. --<a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKralizec%21_e8c2.html" title="User:Kralizec!">Kralizec!</a> (<a href="../../../k/r/a/User_talk%7EKralizec%21_c54e.html" title="User talk:Kralizec!">talk</a>) 12:41, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Kralizec, you are 100% wrong in your statement "This is in part because while any particular reactor design may be used on a variety of ship classes, the reactor normally produces a certain amount of steam which is then fed into the steam turbines designed for that particular reactor." The reactor does indeed exchange heat to make steam, but the actual SHAFT HORSEPOWER is dedicated to the steam turbines, not the Reactor. Shaft horsepower is driven from the design of the turbines, which any reactor can drive the steam production. This is not to say that just any reactor can keep up with the steam demands of the 140KShp that the turbines "might" make.</p>
<p>Please stop putting the power that the reactor can make. Not only is the # cited a guess, the website that it is supposed to cite does not even have a MW rating. The website that is cited only has the shaft horsepower referenced at 140KShp, it does not mention the power that the reactor can make.</p>
<p>Once again, the shaft horsepower HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE POWER OF THE REACTOR. If you are going to talk about shaft horspower, talk about the steam side of the power plant, not the reactor.</p>
<p>On another note, if you do the calculations, the 140KShp is not equal to the 550MW that was cited on this page. www.onlineconversion.com</p>
<p>The power that each reactor can produce IS NOT ON THE WEBSITE IN THE LINK. If you are going to cite references, make sure that the info on the website is actually there. I operated an A4W reactor for 4 years in the Navy, I know what I am talking about, but it seems that Kralizec does not. This is not a slam, just making sure that people do not put up information that is not properly cited.Nly8nchz 04:51, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Nly8nchz, thank you very much for your work to ensure accuracy in this article. People working together on topics they have interest in is one of the best ways to improve our encyclopedia. However while I share some of your frustrations on this topic, I would caution you to remember our rules on <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a>. Statements like "Kralizec, you are 100% wrong" and "I know what I am talking about, but it seems that Kralizec does not" do nothing to resolve what is essentially a content dispute and only serve to ratchet up emotions on all sides.</p>
<p>A few items of note on this issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "550 MW" number was added to the article by an anonymous editor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A4W_reactor&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=109185363" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A4W_reactor&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=109185363" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> earlier this month and no one caught the vandalism. Before that change, the article listed 104 MW, which is the correct metric conversion of 140,000 shp.</li>
<li>Official wikipedia policy (<a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">WP:VER</a>) is verifiability, not truth. The power produced by the A4W reactor is properly <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cited</a> from the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federation_of_American_Scientists_19aa.html" title="Federation of American Scientists">Federation of American Scientists</a> website, which clearly indicates that the "power per reactor" is "140,000 shp."</li>
<li>You stated "I operated an A4W reactor for 4 years in the Navy, I know what I am talking about." While I have no doubt that you are an expert on A4W reactors, please remember that official wikipedia policy states that <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> (including personal experience) is strictly forbidden. Wikipedia articles should only contain <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVER_2bf3.html" title="WP:VER">verifiable</a> content from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks again for your interest and hard work on the article. Between the two of us, I am sure we will make this article the best, most accurate article it could possibly be! --<a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKralizec%21_e8c2.html" title="User:Kralizec!">Kralizec!</a> (<a href="../../../k/r/a/User_talk%7EKralizec%21_c54e.html" title="User talk:Kralizec!">talk</a>) 13:47, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
