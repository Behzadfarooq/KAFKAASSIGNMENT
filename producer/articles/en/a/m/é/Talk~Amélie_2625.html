<p>Re: Criticism section - You can see Afro-French people in the film. One of the shots in the train station, there are 3 black people walking behind her. On the old man's tv there is black and white footage of a black woman singing, and two of the photos in the scrapbook are of a black man. What is with the criticism of no Afro-French people in it? <a href="../../../l/a/p/User%7ELapinmies_aa85.html" title="User:Lapinmies">Lapinmies</a> 19:06, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>People have to politicize everything nowadays. It's all very sad. If every ethnic group isn't represented in exact proportions to the real-world ones then it's racist. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.186.43.161 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.186.43.161_4867.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.186.43.161">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<dd>My wife and I just watched the film again with this criticism in mind, and we've decided that the criticism is <a href="../../../h/o/g/Hogwash.html" title="Hogwash">hogwash</a>. Aside from the principal players (one of whom is apparently North-African), there are very few other people of <b>any</b> notable ethnicity really visible in the film; there are very few "crowd" scenes. Amelie leading the blind man to Abessess is the one that I recall. The scenes in the train station that show crowds are almost always very far shots. And Amelie appears to live towards the Abessess side of the butte, not the Barbès-Rochechouart side, so that attempt to prop-up this criticism doesn't hold water either.</dd>

<p>Re: "But while she is looking after others, no one seems to be looking after Amélie, and internally, she recognizes that this unrequited devotion to the other people in her life is going to lead to her eventual death from despair." Could someone, perhaps the author of the above statement, clarify whether Amelie died in this film from despair?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think this refers to a brief clip where Amélie is watching the news and, somewhat surreally, sees an old-fashioned news report of her death, where it praises her achievements in helping people but points out that she died lonely. I do reckon this could be altered a bit, though, as it is a bit confusing.--<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoseph_Q_Publique_03c8.html" title="User:Joseph Q Publique">Joseph Q Publique</a> 07:34, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that this movie is about a girl who was helping others trying to fix their lives but she couldn't fix her own. Amelie could have lived and died that way if she did not overcome her own "issue" with life. She's like a fixer and figured that maybe she's going to die that way just trying to fix other people's lives and she had to give up her own when in fact it didn't need to be the case. I think she was just this girl who couldn't get out of her shell and lived vicariously through others by doing what good she tried to do for them. But of course in the end the reverse happened because she was able to allow the man she fancied to step into her world.(Jonarvs 08:54, 25 November 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<dd>Colour was definitely on the director's mind. (I don't recall if our article mentions it, but) you can see that the entire film has an overall greenish tint to it (and the director has stated that this was deliberate), so red would be a very good contrasting colour to draw attention to objects.</dd>

<dd>I recall hearing (as in a friend telling me) that the director's intention was to make the movie look like a painting come to life. Don't quote me on that, though, as I have nothing accept my friend's assurance that this is case - no direct quotes from the director or anything.--<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoseph_Q_Publique_03c8.html" title="User:Joseph Q Publique">Joseph Q Publique</a> 07:35, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just watched the film again, and I paid particular note to the colour scheme. <a href="../../../p/o/k/User%7EPokrajac_5e12.html" title="User:Pokrajac">Pockey</a> has it correct; the scenes that are green-tinted do almost always have a number of bright-red objects in them. A notable contrast to the entire colour-scheme is Amelie's apartment; themed almost entirely in red, she has an obvious bright blue table lamp and she is often wearing a bright-green dress. Again, very high colour contrast.</dd>

<dd>Color is a a medium of communication not only in paintings but in all art form. Color always means something. A director does not smack an object into a scene simply because it looks good. Every detail is calculated from the camera angle to lighting. A good director never misses that. If something catches your attention, it's not because it just happened to but because it was intended to.</dd>

<p>When this film was released, I recall a major critic (I believe <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Ebert_1ae7.html" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>) making mention of how the film proved the current MPAA ratings system was unrealistic in that it was given an R rating even though the film was virtually devoid of violence and had very little sex in it (indeed except for the orgasm sequence, there's more explictness in your average episode of CSI). I think it might be worth mentioning how this film sparked this discussion, perhaps in the Trivia section, but unfortunately I can't find any online source to back up my memory. Does anyone else recall this debate? <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 06:50, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I do not know if there's some policy on wiki, but French and Italian movie titles are always written devoid of capital letters.

<li>The naming policy on the article title is to use the English title, capitals and all. Like <i>"Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain"</i> becomes <i>"Amélie"</i>.

<dd><i>"Cinema Paradiso"</i> is capitalised, so is <i>"Malena"</i>, both are Italian films. They may be uncapitalised in the Italian language but this is the English version of Wikipedia so the titles should stay as they are.<a href="../../../g/i/l/User%7EGillean666_e844.html" title="User:Gillean666">Gillean666</a></dd>

<dd>First letter is obviously capitalized in any language&#160;:) And both <i>Cinema Paridiso</i> and <i>Malena</i> are proper names! On IMDb it's written <i>Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulin</i>. Now what I'm asking is about policy not your patriotic views of the English language, since IMO a title should be kept in its original format (as is the case for <a href="../../../s/e/7/Se7en.html" title="Se7en">Se7en</a>). Now if it's policy / practice to use the title released in English speaking countries (which, may I add, was actually <i>Amélie of Montemartre</i> not <i>Amélie</i>) it's another story and I'm not going to go against that. Thing is, the title is already the "English" version, but in the text the original title is given (and is fully capitalized). Now, throwing an argument against myself, the poster actually capitalizes all words.</dd>

<dd>I don't think so as the words as written are original to this article (as far as I can tell from a bit of Googling on samples of text). Also, in the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">Copyright</a> article, it says <i>"Copyright law covers only the particular form or manner in which ideas or information have been manifested, the "form of material expression". It is not designed or intended to cover the actual idea, concepts, facts, styles, or techniques which may be embodied in or represented by the copyright work. Copyright law provides scope for satirical or interpretive works which themselves may be copyrighted."</i> My interpretation is that a "form of material expression" would mean the actual words and sentences used (or ones very close), and doesn't apply if you're doing a freshly-written synopsis. If you were to hawk this synopsis round film studios as an idea for a screenplay, then I reckon that would be different.

<dd>By narrative of the story, I meant that the words that the narrator is saying in the story. I apologize on my part for the lack of unclarity. Most of the synopsis, while not quite word for word with the script, follows the lines recited in the narration throughout the movie <i>extremely</i> closely, which I'm pretty sure must qualify as a copyright violation of some kind.--<a href="../../../w/h/s/User%7EWHS_187f.html" title="User:WHS">WHS</a> 21:07, 8 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was referring to the subtitled English, at least in my copy of the movie. But if no one else agrees with me then I suppose I'm wrong. Here's a copy of the script, just for reference. <a href="http://amelie.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Script" class="external autonumber" title="http://amelie.xwiki.com/xwiki/bin/view/Main/Script" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>--<a href="../../../w/h/s/User%7EWHS_187f.html" title="User:WHS">WHS</a> 07:19, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To be honest, I'm not quite sure at what point something becomes a copyright violation, and I wouldn't have a clue how to determine it. So I'm only going on my gut feeling which is that, as I'm sure that the writing of the sysnopsis here is original, then there isn't a copyright violation. I'm sure that the writing here is original because I can see from the history it's been built up gradually. It's possible some contributors have used the script to construct parts of the article, but the texts are quite different in my opinion. The sequence of events described in this article and occurring in the film appear to be the same, but I doubt if reporting a sequence can be construed as violation of copyright. So sorry, WHS, I still don't agree! All the best, --<a href="../../../a/_/b/User%7EA_bit_iffy_397a.html" title="User:A bit iffy">A bit iffy</a> 07:53, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

Also, I just wanted to comment on the wonderful symbolism of the gnome... that her father is so quirky and antisocial that he spends his time heaping love and attention upon the inanimate object, rather than people; Amelie says she is better than him in that she at least spends time on people... but at the same time, she doesn't come to terms with her own avoidance of emotional investment and has to live vicariously through others until the end.
