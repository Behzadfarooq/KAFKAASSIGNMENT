	    <p>In refactoring this out of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_and_British_English_differences_6ac2.html" title="American and British English differences">American and British English differences</a>, I've added a lot of new individual words and rearranged the material. Most of the additions I made were from Wells, especially words he's marked with an asterisk as being different. I cross-referenced against various dictionaries, and generally where there was disagreement I cut the Gordian knot by just removing the word. No doubt I've added many shiny new mistakes. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoestynes_50e7.html" title="User:Joestynes">Joestynes</a> 02:53, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've removed <i>raspberry</i>, because I'm pretty sure it is in fact a <i>trap</i>/<i>bath</i> word. (I haven't checked this, but it's not easy to check; British dictionaries don't generally show the short vowel pronunciations of BATH words, in spite of how common they are in the UK.) I think we should use phonemic transcriptions in many places, partly because it's what dictionaries (in Britain) generally do, partly because then we don't need to mention irrelevant detail like dark L, and partly because it allows for regional variation a bit better (though not perfectly): for example the short A /æ/ is actually [a] in much of the UK. But I should say that this page looks a lot better than the pronunciation section of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_and_British_English_differences_6ac2.html" title="American and British English differences">American and British English differences</a> used to look.--<a href="../../../j/h/j/User%7EJHJ_006a.html" title="User:JHJ">JHJ</a> 17:34, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some people say it with /s/ (well, I do, anyway). But regardless of that, the vowel variation in <i>raspberry</i> is presumably inherited from that in <i>rasp</i>, which is a straightforward BATH word. Maybe there should be some mention of <i>raspberry</i> (and also <i>Glasgow</i>, which also has BATH-type vowel variation before /z/) on the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trap-bath_split.html" title="Trap-bath split">trap-bath split</a> page, but I don't think it's needed here.--<a href="../../../j/h/j/User%7EJHJ_006a.html" title="User:JHJ">JHJ</a> 12:19, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't really think these can be thought of as British/American differences; there's too much variation on both sides of the Atlantic for that. I've left the GOAT one in with a comment on the variation because of the difference in the commonly used symbols, but I've deleted FACE, where /eɪ/ is commonly used for both RP and GA.--<a href="../../../j/h/j/User%7EJHJ_006a.html" title="User:JHJ">JHJ</a> 19:42, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In GAm, realisations of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʌ]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ə]</span> are more similar than in RP, and are sometimes viewed as stressed and unstressed variants of a single <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ə/</span> phoneme.

<dd>I think there may be something worth mentioning here. Some Americans seem to perceive the vowel of <i>cut</i> and schwa as allophones of one phoneme, but in an RP context they're usually treated as separate phonemes <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʌ/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ə/</span>. For example, the OED 3rd edition transcription scheme <a href="http://www.oed.com/help/pronunciation-3e.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.oed.com/help/pronunciation-3e.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> uses different symbols for the vowel of <i>strut</i> and the first vowel of <i>another</i> in its "British" transcriptions, but the same symbol <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ə/</span> in its "American" transcriptions. The OED even has a minimal pair: <i>muzz</i> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/mʌz/</span> and one of the pronunciations of <i>Ms</i> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/məz/</span>. --<a href="../../../j/h/j/User%7EJHJ_006a.html" title="User:JHJ">JHJ</a> 21:38, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That was the basis for the original para (which I wrote). My instinct was to revert the edit; however I cross-checked the replacement para against other Wikipedia articles and it seems to check out. It's possible that GAm "allophones" are phonetically more distinct than RP "distinct phonemes"; that would be a statement about phonetic tradition rather than objective reality, but still worth mentioning. I don't believe the new version's info merits inclusion, even if it is accurate. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoestynes_50e7.html" title="User:Joestynes">Joestynes</a> 11:08, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm the one who did the recent change but I agree with Joestynes because I had never noticed the distinction between the two until I read about it. Since the article is about the actual pronunciation differences (presumably noticeable differences) and not how dictionaries consider the phonemes, the deletion seems appropriate. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 06:20, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

(This is reflected in the common American use of <i>uh</i> as a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pronunciation_spelling.html" title="Pronunciation spelling">pronunciation spelling</a> for schwa.)

</dl>
</dd>

<dd>That seems like a good idea, but I'd suggest dropping the phonetic symbols <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʌ]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ə]</span>, which are a bit confusing here, and using example words instead. After all, the vowels may not be <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʌ]</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ə]</span>; it's just that <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʌ/</span> and <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ə/</span> are the usual transcriptions of the two RP phonemes.--<a href="../../../j/h/j/User%7EJHJ_006a.html" title="User:JHJ">JHJ</a> 12:17, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't like it. It's taking a pronunciation distinction and changing it to, basically, a spelling one. "uh" is simply the closest thing in GAm spelling that comes to indicating a schwa; whereas in RP, they have "er." It also seems to <i>imply</i> that the two sounds are closer in GAm without stating it.<a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 20:44, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>However, there is some evidence (e.g. the OED transcriptions) that there is a tendency to regard the <i>strut</i> vowel and schwa as the same phoneme in GAm but not in RP and other British accents.--<a href="../../../j/h/j/User%7EJHJ_006a.html" title="User:JHJ">JHJ</a> 21:05, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>True, but that is not a pronunciation difference; it's a transcription one. OED only shows the ideology of a British editor, grammarian or linguist who noticed the difference or considered them different and I'd hardly consider the view of experts trained to notice the difference between schwa and wedge as indicative of regular speakers' ability to do so.</dd>
<dd>This can probably go in another article about RP and GAm differences but using only the OED reference to come to the conclusion that we're making seems a bit of a stretch.</dd>
<dd>I knew a fellow who had trouble telling the difference between scwha and wedge until he was told that schwa only appeared in unstressed syllables. Maybe a non-linguist RP-speaking editor could verify the other half of what we're talking about. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 21:33, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

I'd like to know how standard his analysis is, though, so I'm not suggesting basing anything entirely on the OED pronunciations.--<a href="../../../j/h/j/User%7EJHJ_006a.html" title="User:JHJ">JHJ</a> 21:51, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all, for both RP and GA the stressed vowel is a low mid central vowel, though lower in RP than in GA, that is more accurately transcribed <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɐ]</span>. (In RP it needs to be lower to remain distinct from <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɜ]</span>, while in GA these vowels are distinguished by rhoticity, and there is greater leeway in height.)</p>
<p>I (GA speaker) generally hear schwa as being either <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɐ]</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɪ]</span> (or maybe <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɨ]</span>). I believe the difference is allophonic, being decided by environment, but I understand this difference is phonemic in RP. Perhaps this is part of the reason for the different transcriptions? Either way, if we don't use distinct symbols for obscure vowels, then they will need to be transcribed as two vowels, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɐ]</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɪ]</span>. <a href="../../../k/w/a/User%7EKwamikagami_11b6.html" title="User:Kwamikagami">kwami</a> 22:51, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here's what Wells (1982: 132) has to say about it: "GenAm characteristically has a somewhat backer quality of <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʌ/</span> than present-day RP, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʌ+]</span> as against <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ɐ]</span>; Scottish and Canadian speech are usually like GenAm in this respect, but southern-hemisphere accents like RP. ... Even in GenAm it may well be considered that stressed <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ʌ]</span> and unstressed <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ə]</span> are co-allophones of one phoneme." --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr">t</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Angr_14a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Angr">c</a>) 17:33, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why don't you just speak English instead of jotting down a haphazard hodgepodge of weird punctuation marks? Half-kidding. Anyways, that's what Webster's third has to say about the issue pronunciation issue:</dd>
<dd>/'i(,)shü, 'ish(,)yü, 'i(,)shůə, 'ish(,)yů, <i>before a vowel often</i> -_sh(y)əw; <i>chiefly in the southern US</i> -_sh(y)ə <i>before a consonant or pause or before a vowel in a following word; chiefly Brit</i> 'i(,)syü <i>or</i> 'i(,)syů <i>or</i> 'isyəw/.</dd>

I pronounce <i>tissue</i> as a perfect rhyme of <i>issue</i> but I honestly wouldn't notice if someone epenthisized a [j] right after the <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/ʃ/</span>. I'm not saying that GA does one or the other, I just don't think that it's all that marked or even noticeable. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 20:13, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The somewhat cumbersome transcription of Webster's 3rd actually highlights your point, AE—some nuances are really hard to catch. "Tissue" &amp; "issue" rhyme in my own speech too. Not surprisingly, W3 transcription of "tissue" goes exactly like "issue" (except for allowing for a dialectal "tishee" in the phrase "tissue paper.")--<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber">JackLumber</a> 18:28, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Or are a lot of these entries seemingly written for linguists? In order to effectively read this entry, chances are, you are already aware of the content. It's fairly incomprehensible to someone not already well versed in linguistics. I think more examples should be given to make this article useful for laypersons.</p>
<p>I agree completely. Whereas the other articles on differences between British and American English (e.g. the one on spelling differences) are extremely clear, this one is incomprehensible to the non-linguist. I think this article should be a candidate for a complete re-write to make it useful for non-specialists. ~~</p>

<p>Can't see this mentioned anywhere. There's a marked difference between RP and GAm of loanwords with the letter 'o'. For example the penultimate vowels in ris<b>o</b>tto and gn<b>o</b>cchi are pronounced with <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ɒ</span> in RP but <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">oʊ</span> in GAm. Also applies to French and Spanish loanwords.</p>
<p>(Curiously, both RP and GAm agree on the use <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">oʊ</span> of for the final vowel.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm not a trained linguist so maybe someone else could write this up properly if it's not buried in there already.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That sounds fairly accurate, but I don't know if it's OK with others yet. Your observation on the "different" British vowel is simply to do with the normal pronunciation of "o" before two or more consonants, eg. <i>doting</i> (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">oʊ</span>) vs. <i>dotting</i> (<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ɒ</span>). -- <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreatgavini_d482.html" title="User:Greatgavini"><font face="Paris"><strong>THE GREAT GAVINI</strong></font></a> {<a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGreatgavini_058f.html" title="User talk:Greatgavini">T</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Greatgavini_c5ec.html" title="Special:Contributions/Greatgavini">C</a>|<span class="plainlinks" style="color:#002bb8"><a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~essjay/edit_count/Count.php?username=Greatgavini" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~essjay/edit_count/Count.php?username=Greatgavini" rel="nofollow">#</a></span>} 19:10, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some examples are already in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_and_British_English_pronunciation_differences_5537.html#Single_differences" title="American and British English pronunciation differences">Miscellaneous pronunciation differences</a> table; there is a remark "(And A in many other foreign names and loanwords)" in the chianti-gulag-pasta row in the table.

<dd>In American English, stress is usually on the second syllable; in British English traditionally on first.

<dd>I've heard both ['h<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">æ</span>r<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ə</span>s] and [h<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ə</span>'r<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">æ</span>s] (or [h<span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ɑ</span>'ræs]) in native American English speakers.
