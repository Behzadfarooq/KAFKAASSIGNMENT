<p>They're currently having an election with several new candidates running who hope to revitalize the organization, so we should see what happens with that before deleting the page. -<a href="../../../r/o/r/User%7ERory096_e5c4.html" title="User:Rory096">Rory096</a> 14:41, 23 January 2006</p>
<p>This organization appears to have gone quiet. The last "long term goal" of the PA state chapter is to accomplish something by 2002, ands the Yahoo group of the other chapter has only 28 members, and only 5 posts in 2005. I'm not sure that this groups was ever notable enough for Wikipedia, but now that it is inactive it is even less notable. Any other thoughts? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 20:50, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Rory, you are attempting to use what's left of ASFAR's page to attack me. Your writing is full of ambiguity and bias. Please refrain from publishing (and republishing) this unbalanced information. -Shane</p>
<p><br />
Perhaps the fact that a supposed member of ASFAR continues to post what seems to amount to a personal smear campaign is a sign that many young people lack the maturity to be considered equal to adults in society. It is this immaturity which the laws ASFAR protests are meant to keep in check.</p>
<p>The main idea that young people are individuals with varying potentials and capabilities still holds true. The actions of Rory, "BadLands," and other youths acting in a similar manner speak about -their- character and maturity, not necessarily the character of youth as a whole. I do criticize some youth rights activists for reinforcing the stereotypes against them, though. It's hard to change society's generalizations about a group you're in if you just reinforce what it currently believes by behaving in a manner that meets the stereotypes. - Shane</p>
<p>Removed the quotation marks from "dedicated to protecting and advancing the legal civil rights of youth"; I see no reason for them to be there. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECameoAppearance_b323.html" title="User:CameoAppearance">CameoAppearance</a> 00:20, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If this organization even exists, it presumably has like six members. Can be merged into a single sentence in <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_rights_movement.html" title="Youth rights movement">Youth rights movement</a>. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 04:31, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>ASFAR has over 1,000 members. ASFAR forms one of two major arms of the <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_rights_movement.html" title="Youth rights movement">youth rights movement</a>, and has been more active than its webpage would indicate. Communications is one of the main areas of improvement of ASFAR in the near future, and that should undergo large-scale revitalization. <a href="../../../s/v/e/User%7ESvendlarose_94eb.html" title="User:Svendlarose">Svend la Rose</a> 19:32, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Well I'll be... I used to belong to ASFAR a decade or so ago. I honestly couldn't say it would strike me as being "notable", in its own right (unless I somehow missed something it did while I was some manner of "member")... but, if the information at <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youth_rights_movement.html" title="Youth rights movement">Youth rights movement</a> is accurate, it may be notable enough for a mention there, if only there. But I doubt it's notable in its own right. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomnior_029d.html" title="User:Somnior">Somnior</a> 09:54, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Er... Maybe it is notable in the realm of youth rights (which is admittedly something not notable to most people, I suppose). The <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Youth_Rights_Association_d570.html" title="National Youth Rights Association">NYRA</a> seems notable enough (I may be wrong) in its own right (and it does indeed have an article), and if the article is accurate, ASFAR may be notable enough for its own article. If so, it probably requires inclusion of history found on the articles referenced. <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomnior_029d.html" title="User:Somnior">Somnior</a> 09:58, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Youth_Rights_Association_d570.html" title="National Youth Rights Association">National Youth Rights Association</a> looks to pretty active, it and its chapters seem to have active web sites at any rate, and so NYRA deserves its own article, probably. But the Americans for a Society Free from Age Restrictions seems to have gone almost dead, and wasn't active enough long enough to rate its own article. I can't say for sure without more research, though. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 16:09, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I say we give the children of the corn at least six months- there aren't a lot of groups like this, so to be notable in the field doesn't take much. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResonanteye_ae53.html" title="User:Resonanteye">Resonanteye</a></p>
<p><b>Don't Merge</b> I agree with <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResonanteye_ae53.html" title="User:Resonanteye">Resonanteye</a>. The organization may not be very large, but ageism is a major issue in modern society, and very few groups seem to be addressing the issue as it applies to people who are under legal age. As a side note, I noticed that there is no article Youth rights movement--it redirects to Youth rights, and has been a redirect since 19 September 2006. <a href="../../../t/o/y/User%7EToyalla_9067.html" title="User:Toyalla">Toyalla</a> 07:25, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree with resonanteye.</p>
<p>There are VERY few groups in this movement and FAR MORE opposing it. Giving this it's own page would be quite beneficial as info instead of merging it with the page for the youth rights movement, I think a link from the youth rights movement article would be good however, the site itself says it was last updated December 21st, 2006.</p>
<p>So i don't think it can be considered 'extinct' quite yet........ <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENateland_dd34.html" title="User:Nateland">Nateland</a> 06:53, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
