<p>The <b><a href="../../../4/6/_/46_defense.html" title="46 defense">46 defense</a></b> (known also as the <b>Bear defense</b>) is an <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a> <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football_defensive_schemes.html" title="American football defensive schemes">defensive scheme</a> popularized by <b><a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy_Ryan_bc15.html" title="Buddy Ryan">Buddy Ryan</a></b> when Ryan was <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defensive_coordinator.html" title="Defensive coordinator">defensive coordinator</a> for the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Bears_3f7c.html" title="Chicago Bears">Chicago Bears</a> and later implemented by Ryan as <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_coach.html" title="Head coach">head coach</a> of the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Eagles_04d3.html" title="Philadelphia Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a>. The defense, which reached the height of its popularity in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">National Football League</a> when the Bears captured the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XX_ee0e.html" title="Super Bowl XX">Super Bowl XX</a> title, is employed to varying degrees by several extant franchises, most notably the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baltimore_Ravens_9241.html" title="Baltimore Ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a>, for whom Ryan's son <b><a href="../../../r/e/x/Rex_Ryan_4ceb.html" title="Rex Ryan">Rex</a></b> is defensive coordinator.</p>

<p>The scheme relies on the ability of the defensive squad, for which two <i>outside</i> linebackers play on the same side of the defensive formation, quickly to reach the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_of_scrimmage.html" title="Line of scrimmage">backfield</a>, either to disrupt <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_%28American_football%29_8e53.html" title="Rush (American football)">rushing</a> plays or to pressure the quarterback.

The original WLAF was an American football league partially backed by the National Football League and, like the current NFL Europe, was a spring developmental league.

<p>The 49ers began play in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a> as a charter member of the <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-America_Football_Conference_b7f2.html" title="All-America Football Conference">All-America Football Conference</a> and joined the NFL in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a> after the AAFC merged into the older league.
