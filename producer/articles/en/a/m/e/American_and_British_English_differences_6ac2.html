<p>This is one of a series of articles about the differences between <b><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a></b> and <b><a href="../../../b/r/i/British_English_ebb4.html" title="British English">British English</a></b>, which, <i>for the purposes of these articles</i>, are defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>American English (AmE)</b> is the form of English used in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.</li>
<li><b>British English (BrE)</b> is the form of English used in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and the rest of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>. It includes all English <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialects</a> used within the British Isles.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>American English in its <i>written</i> form is standardized across the U.S. (and in schools abroad specializing in American English). Though not devoid of regional variations, particularly in pronunciation and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vernacular.html" title="Vernacular">vernacular</a> vocabulary, American speech is somewhat uniform throughout the country, largely because of the influence of mass communication and geographical and social mobility in the United States. After the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, the settlement of the western territories by migrants from the east led to dialect mixing and levelling, so that regional dialects are most strongly differentiated in the eastern part of the country that were settled earlier. The <i><a href="../../../g/e/n/General_American_db80.html" title="General American">General American</a></i> <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accent_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Accent (linguistics)">accent</a> and dialect (sometimes called 'Standard Midwestern'), often used by <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_presenter.html" title="News presenter">newscasters</a>, are traditionally regarded as the unofficial standard for American English.</p>
<p>British English has a reasonable degree of uniformity in its formal written form. On the other hand, the forms of <i>spoken</i> English – dialects, accents and vocabulary – used across the British Isles vary considerably more than in any other English-speaking areas of the world, and more so than in the United States, because of a much longer history of dialect development in the English speaking areas of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. Dialects and accents vary, not only between <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_English_545c.html" title="English English">England</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Mid-Ulster_English_d875.html" title="Mid-Ulster English">Northern Ireland</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_English_ce86.html" title="Scottish English">Scotland</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh_English_3947.html" title="Welsh English">Wales</a> (which constitute the United Kingdom), and the <a href="../../../h/i/b/Hiberno-English_4eb6.html" title="Hiberno-English">Republic of Ireland</a>, but also within these individual countries. There are also differences in the English spoken by different socio-economic groups in any particular region. <i><a href="../../../r/e/c/Received_Pronunciation_c480.html" title="Received Pronunciation">Received Pronunciation</a> (RP)</i> (also referred to as <i>BBC English</i> or <i>the Queen's English</i>) has traditionally been regarded as 'proper English' – 'the educated spoken English of south-east England'. The <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> and other <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcasting.html" title="Broadcasting">broadcasters</a> now intentionally use a mix of presenters with a variety of British accents and dialects, and the concept of 'proper English' is now far less prevalent.</p>
<p>British and American English are the reference norms for English as spoken, written, and taught in the rest of the world; for instance, the English-speaking members of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commonwealth_of_Nations_38fc.html" title="Commonwealth of Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a> often (if not usually) closely follow British orthography, and many new Americanisms quickly become familiar outside of the United States. Although the dialects of English used in the former <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> are often, to various extents, fairly close to standard British English, most of the countries concerned have developed their own unique dialects, particularly with respect to pronunciation, idioms, and vocabulary; chief among them are, at least for number of first-language speakers, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_375b.html" title="Australian English">Australian English</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_English_79ce.html" title="Canadian English">Canadian English</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_and_British_English_differences_6ac2.html" title="Edit section: Historical background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Historical background</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a> was first introduced to the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">Americas</a> by <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_colonization_of_the_Americas_065e.html" title="British colonization of the Americas">British colonization</a>, beginning in the late <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a>. Similarly, the language spread to numerous other parts of the world as a result of British colonization elsewhere and the spread of the former <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>, which, by <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>, held sway over a population of about 470–570 million people: approximately a quarter of the world's population.</p>
<p>Over the past 400 years, the form of the language used in the Americas – especially in the United States – and that used in the United Kingdom and the rest of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a> have diverged in many ways, leading to the <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dialect.html" title="Dialect">dialects</a> now commonly referred to as American English and British English. Differences between the two include <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pronunciation.html" title="Pronunciation">pronunciation</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammar.html" title="Grammar">grammar</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/x/Lexis_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Lexis (linguistics)">lexis</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/e/Spelling.html" title="Spelling">spelling</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punctuation.html" title="Punctuation">punctuation</a>, <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idiom.html" title="Idiom">idioms</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Format.html" title="Format">formatting</a> of <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calendar_date.html" title="Calendar date">dates</a> and <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number.html" title="Number">numbers</a>, and so on, with a small number of words having completely different meanings between the two dialects or even being unknown or not used in one of the dialects. One particular contribution towards formalizing these differences came from <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noah_Webster_882a.html" title="Noah Webster">Noah Webster</a>, who wrote the <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webster%27s_Dictionary_d964.html" title="Webster's Dictionary">first American dictionary</a> (published <a href="../../../1/8/2/1828.html" title="1828">1828</a>) with the intention of showing that the United States spoke a different dialect from Britain.</p>
<p>This divergence between American English and British English once caused <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Bernard_Shaw_f7b2.html" title="George Bernard Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> to say that the United States and United Kingdom are "two countries divided by a common language"; a similar comment is ascribed to <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Churchill_74d2.html" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. Likewise, <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Wilde_3590.html" title="Oscar Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> wrote, "We have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, the language" (<i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Canterville_Ghost_8b77.html" title="The Canterville Ghost">The Canterville Ghost</a></i>, 1888). <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Sweet_f54c.html" title="Henry Sweet">Henry Sweet</a> predicted in 1877 that within a century, American English, Australian English and British English would be mutually unintelligible. It may be the case that increased world-wide communication through <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio.html" title="Radio">radio</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a>, the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a>, and <a href="../../../g/l/o/Globalization.html" title="Globalization">globalization</a> has reduced the tendency to regional variation. This can result either in some variations becoming extinct (as, for instance, <i><a href="../../../t/r/u/Truck_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Truck (disambiguation)">truck</a></i> has been gradually replacing <i><a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorry.html" title="Lorry">lorry</a></i> in much of the world) or in the acceptance of wide variations as "perfectly good English" everywhere. Often at the core of the dialect though, the idiosyncrasies remain.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it remains the case that although spoken American and British English are generally mutually intelligible, there are enough differences to cause occasional misunderstandings or at times embarrassment – for example, some words that are quite innocent in one dialect may be considered vulgar in the other.</p>

<p>In BrE, <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_collective_nouns.html" title="English collective nouns">collective nouns</a> can take either singular (<i>formal agreement</i>) or plural (<i>notional agreement</i>) verb forms, according to whether the emphasis is, respectively, on the body as a whole or on the individual members; compare <i>a committee was appointed ...</i> with <i>the committee were unable to agree ..</i>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> Some of these nouns, for example <i>staff</i>,<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> actually combine with plural verbs most of the time.</p>
<p>In AmE, collective nouns are usually singular in construction: <i>the committee was unable to agree ...</i> AmE however may use plural pronouns in agreement with collective nouns: <i>the team take their seats</i>, rather than <i>the team takes its seat(s).</i> However, such a sentence would most likely be recast as <i>the team members take their seats</i>.</p>
<p>The difference occurs for all collective nouns, both general terms such as <i>team</i> and <i>company</i> and proper nouns (for example, where a place name is used to refer to a sports team). For instance,</p>
<p>BrE: <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Clash_8395.html" title="The Clash">The Clash</a> are a well-known band</i>; AmE: <i>The Clash is a well known band</i>.<br />
BrE: <i>Indianapolis are the champions</i>; AmE: <i>Indianapolis is the champion</i>.</p>
<p>Proper nouns which are plural in form take a plural verb in both AmE and BrE; for example, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> are a well-known band</i>; <i>The <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianapolis_Colts_aabe.html" title="Indianapolis Colts">Colts</a> are the champions</i>.</p>

</dl>
<ul>
<li>The past tense and past participle of the verbs <i>learn</i>, <i>spoil</i>, <i>spell</i> (only in the word-related sense), <i>burn</i>, <i>dream</i>, <i>smell</i>, <i>spill</i>, <i>leap</i>, and others, can be either irregular (<i>learnt</i>, <i>spoilt</i>, etc.) or regular (<i>learned</i>, <i>spoiled</i>, etc.). BrE allows both irregular and regular forms, but the irregular forms tend to be used more often by the British (especially by speakers using <a href="../../../r/e/c/Received_Pronunciation_c480.html" title="Received Pronunciation">Received Pronunciation</a>), and in some cases (<i>learnt</i>, <i>smelt</i>, <i>leapt</i>) there is still a strong tendency to use them; in other cases (for example, <i>dreamed</i>), in current British usage, the regular form is more common. The forms with <i>-ed</i> are preferred by many careful writers of English since they are <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weak_verb.html" title="Weak verb">regular verbs</a>. In AmE, the irregular forms are never or hardly ever used (except for <i>leapt</i> and <i>dreamt</i>).<br />
Nonetheless, as with other usages considered nowadays to be typically British, the <i>t</i> endings are often found in older American texts. However, usage may vary when the past participles are actually adjectives, as in <i>burnt toast</i>. (Note that the two-syllable form <i>learnèd</i> <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/'lɜːnɪd/</span>, usually written simply as <i>learned</i>, is still used as an adjective to mean "educated", or to refer to academic institutions, in both BrE and AmE.) Finally, the past tense and past participle of <i>dwell</i> and <i>kneel</i> are more commonly <i>dwelt</i> and <i>knelt</i> on both sides of the Atlantic, although <i>dwelled</i> and <i>kneeled</i> are widely used in the U.S. (but not in the UK).</li>
<li><i>Lit</i> as the past tense of <i>light</i> is more common than <i>lighted</i> in the UK; the regular form enjoys more use in the U.S., although it is somewhat less common than <i>lit</i>. By contrast, <i>fit</i> as the past tense of <i>fit</i> is much more used in AmE than BrE, which generally favours <i>fitted</i>.</li>
<li>The past tense of <i>spit</i> "expectorate" is <i>spat</i> in BrE, <i>spit</i> or <i>spat</i> in AmE.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></li>
<li>The past participle <i>gotten</i> is rarely used in modern BrE (although it is used in some dialects), which generally uses <i>got</i>, except in old expressions such as <i>ill-gotten gains</i>. According to the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compact_Oxford_English_Dictionary_88ab.html" title="Compact Oxford English Dictionary">Compact Oxford English Dictionary</a>, "The form <i>gotten</i> is not used in BrE but is very common in North American English, though even there it is often regarded as non-standard." In AmE, <i>gotten</i> emphasizes the action of acquiring and <i>got</i> tends to indicate simple possession (for example, <i>Have you gotten it?</i> versus <i>Have you got it?</i>). Interestingly, AmE, but not BrE, has <i>forgot</i> as a less common alternative to <i>forgotten</i> for the past participle of <i>forget</i>.</li>
<li>The past participle <i>proven</i> is frequently used in AmE, although some speakers avoid it, and it remains<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> <i>proved</i> in BrE (except in adjectival use; and usage is different in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scots_law.html" title="Scots law">Scots law</a>).</li>
<li>AmE further allows other irregular verbs, such as <i>dive</i> (<i>dove</i>) or <i>sneak</i> (<i>snuck</i>), and often mixes the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preterite.html" title="Preterite">preterite</a> and past participle forms (<i>spring</i>–<i>sprang</i> (U.S. also <i>sprung</i>–<i>sprung</i>), sometimes forcing verbs such as <i>shrink</i> (<i>shrank</i>–<i>shrunk</i>) to have a further form, thus <i>shrunk</i>–<i>shrunken</i>. These uses are often considered nonstandard; the <a href="../../../a/p/_/AP_Stylebook_0322.html" title="AP Stylebook">AP Stylebook</a> in AmE treats some irregular verbs as colloquialisms, insisting on the regular forms for the past tense of <i>dive</i>, <i>plead</i> and <i>sneak</i>. <i>Dove</i> and <i>snuck</i> are usually considered nonstandard in Britain, although <i>dove</i> exists in some British dialects and <i>snuck</i> is occasionally found in British speech.</li>
<li>By extension of the irregular verb pattern, verbs with irregular preterites in some variants of colloquial AmE also have a separate past participle, for example, "to buy": past tense <i>bought</i> spawns <i>boughten</i>. Such formations are highly irregular from speaker to speaker, or even within <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idiolect.html" title="Idiolect">idiolects</a>. This phenomenon is found chiefly in the northern U.S. and other areas where immigrants of <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">German</a> descent are predominant, and may have developed as a result of <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> influence.<a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61/72/B0417200.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61/72/B0417200.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Even in areas where the feature predominates, however, it has not gained widespread acceptance as "standard" usage.</li>

<li>BrE uses the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Present_perfect.html" title="Present perfect">present perfect</a> tense to talk about an event in the recent past and with the words <i>already</i>, <i>just</i> and <i>yet.</i> In American usage, these meanings can be expressed with the present perfect (to express a fact<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>) or the simple past (to imply an expectation<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>). This American style has become widespread only in the past 20 to 30 years; the "British" style is still in common use as well.
<ul>
<li>"I've just got(ten) home." / "I just got home."</li>
<li>"I've already eaten." / "I already ate."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Recently the American use of <i>just</i> with simple past has made inroads into BrE, most visibly in advertising slogans and headlines such as "Cable broadband just got faster".)</p>
<ul>
<li>Similarly, the <a href="../../../p/l/u/Pluperfect_tense.html" title="Pluperfect tense">pluperfect</a> is occasionally replaced by the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preterite.html" title="Preterite">preterite</a> in the U.S.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>; this is generally regarded as sloppy usage by those Americans who consider themselves careful users of the language. U.S. usage sometimes substitutes the conditional for the pluperfect ("If I would have cooked the pie we could have had it for lunch")<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.</li>
<li>In BrE, <i>have got</i> or <i>have</i> can be used for possession and <i>have got to</i> and <i>have to</i> can be used for the modal of necessity. The forms which include <i>got</i> are usually used in informal contexts and the forms without <i>got</i> in more formal contexts. In American speech the form without <i>got</i> is used more than in the UK. AmE also informally uses <i>got</i> as a verb for these meanings, <i>for example,</i> "I got two cars," "I got to go"; but these are nonstandard and will be considered sloppy usage by most American speakers.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subjunctive_mood.html" title="Subjunctive mood">subjunctive mood</a> is more common in AmE in expressions such as: "They suggested that he apply for the job". BrE would have "They suggested that he should apply for the job" (or even "They suggested that he applied for the job", although this last sentence can be ambiguous). However, the British usage ("should apply") is also heard in the United States, but is often regarded as erroneous in writing.</li>

<p>The following verbs show differences in transitivity between BrE and AmE.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>agree</i>: Transitive or intransitive in BrE, usually intransitive in AmE (<i>agree a contract</i>/<i>agree to</i> or <i>on a contract</i>). However, in formal AmE legal writing one often sees constructions like <i>as may be agreed between the parties</i> (rather than <i>as may be agreed</i> to <i>between the parties</i>).</li>
<li><i>catch up</i> ("to reach and overtake"): Transitive or intransitive in BrE, strictly intransitive in AmE (<i>to catch sb up</i>/<i>to catch up with sb</i>).</li>
<li><i>cater</i> ("to provide food and service"): Intransitive in BrE, transitive in AmE (<i>to cater for a banquet</i>/<i>to cater a banquet</i>).</li>
<li><i>claim</i>: Sometimes intransitive in BrE (used with <i>for</i>), strictly transitive in AmE.</li>
<li><i>meet</i>: AmE uses intransitively <i>meet</i> followed by <i>with</i> to mean "to have a meeting with", as for business purposes (<i>Yesterday we met with the CEO</i>), and reserves transitive <i>meet</i> for the meanings "to be introduced to" (<i>I want you to meet the CEO; she's such a fine lady</i>), "to come together with (someone, somewhere)" (<i>Meet the CEO at the train station</i>), and "to have a casual encounter with". BrE uses transitive <i>meet</i> also to mean "to have a meeting with"; the construction <i>meet with</i>, which actually dates back to Middle English, appears to be coming back into use in Britain, despite some commentators who preferred to avoid confusion with <i>meet with</i> meaning "receive, undergo" (<i>the proposal was met with disapproval</i>). The construction <i>meet up with</i> (as in <i>to meet up with someone</i>), which originated in the U.S., has long been standard in both dialects.</li>
<li><i>provide</i>: Strictly monotransitive in BrE, monotransitive or ditransitive in AmE (<i>provide sb with sth</i>/<i>provide sb sth</i>).</li>
<li><i>protest</i>: In sense "oppose", intransitive in BrE, transitive in AmE (<i>The workers protested against the decision</i>/<i>The workers protested the decision</i>). The intransitive <i>protest against</i> in AmE means "to hold or participate in a demonstration against". The older sense "proclaim" is always transitive (<i>protest one's innocence</i>).</li>
<li><i>write</i>: In BrE, the indirect object of this verb usually requires the preposition <i>to</i>, for example, <i>I'll write</i> to <i>my MP</i> or <i>I'll write</i> to <i>her</i> (although it is not required in some situations, for example when an indirect object pronoun comes before a direct object noun, for example, <i>I'll write</i> her <i>a letter</i>). In AmE, <i>write</i> can be used monotransitively (<i>I'll write my congressman</i>; <i>I'll write him</i>).</li>

<ul>
<li>Where a statement of intention involves two separate activities, it is acceptable for speakers of AmE to use <i>to go</i> plus bare infinitive. Speakers of BrE would instead use <i>to go <b>and</b></i> plus bare infinitive: thus where a speaker of AmE might say "I'll go take a bath", BrE speakers would say "I'll go <i>and</i> have a bath". (Both can also use the form <i>to go to</i> instead to suggest that the action may fail, as in "He went to take/have a bath, but the bath was full of children.") Similarly, <i>to come</i> plus bare infinitive is acceptable to speakers of AmE, where speakers of BrE would instead use <i>to come <b>and</b></i> plus bare infinitive: thus where a speaker of AmE might say "come see what I bought," BrE speakers would say, "come and see what I've bought" (notice the present perfect tense: a common British preference).</li>
<li>Use of prepositions before days denoted by a single word. Where British people would say "She resigned on Thursday", Americans often say "She resigned Thursday", but both forms are common in American usage. Occasionally, the preposition is also absent when referring to months: "I'll be here December" (although this usage is generally limited to colloquial speech). The first of these two examples of omitting prepositions may be seen as yet another German influence on American English.</li>
<li>In the UK, <i>from</i> is used with single dates and times more often than in the United States. Where British speakers and writers may say "the new museum will be open from Tuesday," Americans most likely say "the new museum will be open starting Tuesday." (This difference does not apply to phrases of the pattern <i>from A to B</i>, which are used in both BrE and AmE.) A variation or alternative of this is the mostly American "the play opens Tuesday" and the mostly British "the play opens on Tuesday".</li>
<li>The verb <i>prevent</i> can be found in two different constructions: "prevent someone <i>from</i> doing something"; "prevent someone doing something." The latter is well established in BrE, but not in AmE.</li>
<li>Some verbs can take either a to-infinitive construction or a gerund construction (e.g., <i>to start to do something</i>/<i>doing something</i>). Although both constructions are accepted in both dialects, their actual distribution may vary. For example, the gerund is more common:
<ul>
<li>In AmE, with <i>start</i><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> and <i>begin</i><sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup>;</li>
<li>In BrE, with <i>love</i><sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A few 'institutional' nouns take no <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definite_article.html" title="Definite article">definite article</a> when a certain role is implied: for example, <i>at sea</i> (as a sailor), <i>in prison</i> (as a convict), and <i>at/in college</i> (for students). Among this group, BrE has <i>in <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospital</a></i> (as a patient) and <i>at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">university</a></i> (as a student), where AmE requires <i>in <b>the</b> hospital</i> and <i>at <b>the</b> university</i>. (When the implied roles of patient or student do not apply, the definite article is used in both dialects.) Likewise, BrE has <i>in future</i> and American has <i>in the future</i>.</li>
<li>In BrE numbered highways usually take the definite article (for example "the M25", "the A14") while in America they usually do not ("I-495", "Route 66"). Southern California is an exception, where "the 5" or "the 405" are the standard. A similar pattern is followed for named roads, but in America there are local variations and older American highways tend to follow the British pattern ("the Boston Post Road").</li>
<li>AmE distinguishes <i>in back of</i> [behind] from <i>in <b>the</b> back of</i>; the former is unknown in the UK and liable to misinterpretation as the latter. Both, however, distinguish <i>in front of</i> from <i>in the front of</i>.</li>
<li>The use of the function word <i>out</i> as a preposition to denote an outward movement, as in "out the door" and "out the window", is standard in AmE, but not quite in British writing, where <i>out of</i> is generally the preferred choice, although the "American" usage, usually considered regional or dialectal by British dictionaries, is gaining ground in UK speech.</li>
<li>American <a href="../../../l/e/g/Legislator.html" title="Legislator">legislators</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawyer.html" title="Lawyer">lawyers</a> always use the preposition <i>of</i> between the name of a legislative act and the year it was passed, while their British equivalents do not. Compare <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990_73ee.html" title="Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990">Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990</a></i> to <i><a href="../../../d/i/s/Disability_Discrimination_Act_1995_e418.html" title="Disability Discrimination Act 1995">Disability Discrimination Act 1995</a></i>.</li>
<li><i>Dates</i> usually include a definite article in UK spoken English, such as "<b>the</b> 11th of July", or "July <b>the</b> 11th", while American speakers say "July 11".</li>

<ul>
<li>In the United States, the word <i>through</i> can mean "up to and including" as in <i>Monday through Friday</i>. In the UK <i>Monday to Friday</i>, or <i>Monday to Friday inclusive</i> is used instead; <i>Monday through to Friday</i> is also sometimes used. (In some parts of Northern England the term <i>while</i> can be used in the same way, as in <i>Monday while Friday</i>, whereas in Northern Ireland<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> <i>Monday till Friday</i> would be more natural.)</li>
<li>British athletes play <i>in a team</i>; American athletes play <i>on a team</i>. (Both may play <i>for</i> a particular team.)</li>
<li>The word <i>heat</i> meaning "<a href="../../../o/e/s/Oestrus.html" title="Oestrus">mating season</a>" is used with <i>on</i> in the UK and with <i>in</i> in the U.S.</li>
<li>The intransitive verb <i>affiliate</i> can take either <i>with</i> or <i>to</i> in BrE, but only <i>with</i> in AmE.</li>
<li>The verb <i>enrol(l)</i> usually takes <i>on</i> in BrE and <i>in</i> in AmE (as in "to enrol(l) on/in a course") and the on/in difference is also used when <i>enrolled</i> is dropped (as in "I am (enrolled) on the course that studies....").</li>
<li>In AmE, one always speaks of the street <i>on</i> which an address is located, whereas in BrE <i>in</i> can also be used in some contexts. <i>In</i> suggests an address in a city street, so a service station (or a tourist attraction or indeed a village) would always be <i>on</i> a major road, but a department store might be <i>in</i> <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_Street_63ad.html" title="Oxford Street">Oxford Street</a>. Moreover, if a particular place on the street is specified then the preposition used is whichever is idiomatic to the place, thus "<i>at</i> the end of Churchill Road", and thus also the lyric "our house, in the middle of our street" from "Our House" by the British band <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madness_%28band%29.html" title="Madness (band)">Madness</a>, whose intended meaning is "halfway along our street" but is confusing to many Americans—in AmE, the lyric suggests that the house is literally <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2005/2/3moe.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/2005/2/3moe.html" rel="nofollow">in the middle of the <i>roadway</i></a>.</li>
<li>The preposition used with the word <i>weekend</i> is <i>on</i> in the U.S. and <i>at</i> (sometimes <i>on</i>; the ratio in the British National Corpus is about 9:1) in Britain - for example, in "at the weekend/at weekends" vs. "on the weekend/on weekends". Such usages as "this weekend", "over the weekend", etc. are found in both dialects, but the use of "weekends" adverbally (and also "Mondays", etc.), with no preposition, is AmE rather than BrE.</li>
<li>After <i>talk</i> American can use the preposition <i>with</i> but British always<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> uses <i>to</i> (that is, "I'll talk with Dave / I'll talk to Dave". The American form is sometimes seen as more <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politically_correct.html" title="Politically correct">politically correct</a> in British organisations, inducing the ideal of discussing (with), as opposed to lecturing (to). This is, of course, unless talk is being used as a noun, for example: "I'll have a talk with him" in which case this is acceptable in both BrE and AmE.</li>
<li>In both dialects <i>from</i> is the preposition prescribed for use after the word <i>different</i>: "American English is different from British English in several respects." However, <i>different than</i> is also commonly heard in the U.S., and is often considered standard when followed by a clause ("American English is different than it used to be"), whereas <i>different to</i> is the alternative common in BrE.</li>
<li>It is common in BrE to say <i>opposite to</i> as an alternative to <i>opposite of</i>, the only form normally found in AmE. The use of <i>opposite</i> as a preposition ("opposite the post office") has long been established in both dialects, but appears to be more common in British usage.</li>
<li>The noun <i>opportunity</i> can be followed by a verb in two different ways: <i>opportunity</i> plus <i>to</i>-infinitive ("the opportunity to do something") or <i>opportunity</i> plus <i>of</i> plus gerund ("the opportunity of doing something"). The first construction is the most common in both dialects, but the second has almost disappeared in AmE and is often regarded as a Briticism.</li>
<li>Both British and Americans may say (for example) that a river is named <i>after</i> a state, but "named <i>for</i> a state" would rightly be regarded as an Americanism.</li>
<li>BrE sometimes uses <i>to</i> with <i>near</i> ("we live near to the university"), while AmE avoids the preposition in most usages dealing with literal, physical proximity ("we live near the university"), although the "to" reappears in AmE when "near" takes the comparative or superlative form, as in, "Of all of us, she lives nearer/nearest to the deranged axe murderer's house."</li>
<li>In BrE, you <i>call</i> (or <i>ring</i>) someone <i>on</i> their telephone number; in AmE, you <i>call</i> someone <i>at</i> their telephone number.</li>

<ul>
<li>In the U.S., forms are usually but not invariably <i>filled out</i>, but in Britain they can also be <i>filled in</i>. However, in reference to individual parts of a form, Americans may also use <i>in</i> ("fill in the blanks"). In AmE the direction "fill it all in" (referring to the form as a collection of blanks, perhaps) is as common as "fill it all out."</li>
<li>Britons facing <a href="../../../r/i/p/Rip-Off_Britain_ed6b.html" title="Rip-Off Britain">extortionate prices</a> may have no option but to <i>fork out</i>, whereas Americans are more likely to <i>fork (it) over</i> or sometimes <i>up</i>; both usages are however found in both dialects.</li>
<li>British <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thug.html" title="Thug">thugs</a> will <i>beat</i> someone <i>up</i>, while their American counterparts will also <i>beat on</i> (as both would for an inanimate object, such as a drum) or <i>beat up on</i> their victim, though "beat up on" is only used in some locations, and would generally be avoided by Americans who consider themselves well-educated. Both <i>beat on</i> and <i>beat up on</i> are often considered slang in AmE.</li>

<ul>
<li>In AmE, some prescriptionists feel that <i>which</i> should not be used as an antecedent in <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restrictive_clause.html" title="Restrictive clause">restrictive relative clauses</a>. According to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Elements_of_Style_1107.html" title="The Elements of Style">The Elements of Style</a></i> (p. 59), "<i>that</i> is the defining, or restrictive pronoun, <i>which</i> the nondefining, or nonrestrictive." This distinction was endorsed by <a href="../../../f/o/w/Fowler%27s_Modern_English_Usage_c05f.html" title="Fowler's Modern English Usage">Fowler's Modern English Usage</a>, but the use of <i>which</i> as a restrictive pronoun is common in great literature produced on both sides of the Atlantic<a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000918.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000918.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>.</li>
<li>In names of American rivers, the word <i>river</i> usually comes after the name (for example, <i><a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado_River_4ec7.html" title="Colorado River">Colorado River</a></i>), whereas for British rivers it comes before (as in <i><a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Thames_9174.html" title="River Thames">River Thames</a></i>). One exception present in BrE is the <i><a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet_River_c322.html" title="Fleet River">Fleet River</a></i>, which is rarely called the <i>River Fleet</i> by <a href="../../../l/o/n/Londoner.html" title="Londoner">Londoners</a> outside of official documentation. Exceptions in the U.S. are the <i><a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Rouge_ea27.html" title="River Rouge">River Rouge</a></i> and the <i><a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Raisin_ca20.html" title="River Raisin">River Raisin</a></i>, both in <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a> and named by the French. This convention is mixed, however, in some Commonwealth nations, where both arrangements are often seen.</li>
<li>In BrE the word <i>sat</i> is often colloquially used to cover <i>sat</i>, <i>sitting</i> and <i>seated</i>: "I've been sat here waiting for half an hour." "The bride's family will be sat on the right-hand side of the church." This construction is not often heard outside the UK. In the 1960s, its use would mark a speaker as coming from the north of England but by the turn of the 21st century this form had spread to the south. Its use often conveys lighthearted informality, as many speakers intentionally use an ungrammatical construction they would probably not use in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formal_written_English_9187.html" title="Formal written English">formal written English</a>. This colloquial usage is widely understood by British speakers. Similarly <i>stood</i> can be used instead of <i>standing</i>. To an American these usages are passive, and may imply that the subject had been involuntarily forced to sit or stand, or directed to hold that location.</li>
<li>In most areas of the United States, the word <i>with</i> is also used as an adverb: "I'll come with" instead of "I'll come along". However, in some British Dialects, 'come with' is used as an abbreviation of 'come with me', as in "I'm going to the office - come with" instead of "I'm going to the office - come with me". This particular variant is also used by speakers in <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota.html" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> and parts of the adjoining states: "Want to come with?" This is another expression possibly arising from German (<i>kommst du mit?</i>) in parts of the United States with high concentrations of <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_American_f845.html" title="German American">German American</a> populations. It is similar to <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_African_English_1893.html" title="South African English">South African English</a>, where the expression comes from <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrikaans.html" title="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a>, and is also used by <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_language.html" title="Dutch language">Dutch speakers</a> when speaking in English.</li>
<li>The word <i>also</i> is used at the end of a sentence in AmE (just as <i>as well</i> and <i>too</i> are in both dialects), but not so commonly in BrE, although it is encountered in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. Additionally, sentence-ending <i>as well</i> is more formal in AmE than in BrE.</li>

<ul>
<li>Directional suffix <i>-ward(s)</i>: British <i>forwards</i>, <i>towards</i>, <i>rightwards</i>, etc.; American <i>forward</i>, <i>toward</i>, <i>rightward</i>. In both dialects, distribution varies somewhat: <i>afterwards</i>, <i>towards</i>, and <i>backwards</i> are not unusual in America; while in Britain <i>forward</i> is common, and standard in <a href="../../../p/h/r/Phrasal_verb.html" title="Phrasal verb">phrasal verbs</a> like <i>look forward to</i>. The forms with <i>-s</i> may be used as adverbs (or preposition <i>towards</i>), but rarely as adjectives: in Britain as in America one says "an upward motion". The <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a> in 1897 suggested a semantic distinction for adverbs, with <i>-wards</i> having a more definite directional sense than <i>-ward</i>; subsequent authorities such as <a href="../../../f/o/w/Fowler%27s_Modern_English_Usage_c05f.html" title="Fowler's Modern English Usage">Fowler</a> have disputed this contention.</li>
<li>AmE freely adds the suffix <i>-s</i> to <i>day</i>, <i>night</i>, <i>evening</i>, <i>weekend</i>, <i>Monday</i>, etc. to form adverbs denoting repeated or customary action: "I used to stay out evenings"; "the library is closed Saturdays". This usage has its roots in Old English, but many of these constructions are now regarded as American (for example, the OED labels <i>nights</i> "now chiefly N.Amer. colloq."; but <i>to work nights</i> is standard in BrE).</li>
<li>In BrE, the agentive <i>-er</i> suffix is commonly attached to <i><a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a></i> (also <i><a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a></i>; often <i><a href="../../../n/e/t/Netball.html" title="Netball">netball</a></i>; occasionally <i><a href="../../../b/a/s/Basketball.html" title="Basketball">basketball</a></i>). AmE usually uses <i>football player</i>. Where the sport's name is usable as a verb, the suffixation is standard in both dialects: for example, <i><a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf.html" title="Golf">golfer</a></i>, <i>bowler</i> (in <a href="../../../t/e/n/Ten-pin_bowling.html" title="Ten-pin bowling">Ten-pin bowling</a> and in <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowls.html" title="Bowls">Lawn Bowls</a>), and <i><a href="../../../s/h/o/Shooting_sports.html" title="Shooting sports">shooter</a></i>. AmE does, however, sometimes use <i>baller</i> as slang for a basketball player, as in the video game "<a href="../../../n/b/a/NBA_Ballers_60f6.html" title="NBA Ballers">NBA Ballers</a>."</li>
<li>English writers everywhere occasionally (and from time immemorial) make new compound words from common phrases; for example, <i>health care</i> is now being replaced by <i>healthcare</i> on both sides of the Atlantic. However, AmE has made certain words in this fashion which are still treated as phrases in most Commonwealth countries. For example, Americans write <i><a href="../../../t/r/a/Trademark.html" title="Trademark">trademark</a></i>, but some other countries write <i>trade-mark</i> or <i>trade mark</i>.</li>
<li>In <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_compound.html#Compound_nouns" title="English compound">compound nouns</a> of the form &lt;verb&gt;&lt;noun&gt;, sometimes AmE favours the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinitive.html#Bare_infinitive" title="Infinitive">bare infinitive</a> where BrE favours the <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerund.html" title="Gerund">gerund</a>. Examples include (AmE first): <i><a href="../../../j/u/m/Jump_rope.html" title="Jump rope">jump rope</a></i> / <i>skipping&#160;rope</i>; <i>racecar</i> / <i>racing&#160;car</i>; <i>rowboat</i> / <i>rowing&#160;boat</i>; <i>sailboat</i> / <i>sailing&#160;boat</i>; <i>file cabinet</i> / <i>filing cabinet</i>; <i>dial tone</i> / <i>dialling tone</i>.</li>
<li>More generally, AmE has a tendency to drop inflectional suffixes, thus favouring clipped forms: compare <i>cookbook</i> / <i>cookery book</i>; <i>Smith, age 40</i> / <i>Smith, aged 40</i>; <i>skim milk</i> / <i>skimmed milk</i>. The first form is rarely encountered in British usage.</li>
<li>Singular attributives in one country may be plural in the other, and <i>vice versa</i>. For example, the UK has a <i>drugs problem</i> while the United States has a <i>drug problem</i> (although the singular usage is also commonly heard in the UK); Americans read the "<a href="../../../s/p/o/Sports.html" title="Sports">sports</a>" section of a newspaper, while the British are more likely to read the "sport" section. However, BrE <i>maths</i> is singular, just as AmE <i>math</i> is: both are abbreviations of <i>mathematics</i>.</li>

<p>While the use of American expressions in the UK is often noted, movement in the opposite direction is less common. But such words as <i>book</i> (meaning "to reserve") and <i>roundabout</i> (otherwise called a <i>traffic circle</i> or <i>rotary</i>) are clearly current in AmE, although often regarded as British. Some other "Briticisms", such as <i>go missing</i> (as an alternative to <i>disappear</i>), <i>bespoke</i> (for <i>custom-made</i> or <i>made-to-order</i>), or <i>run-up</i> (for "period preceding an event") are increasingly used in AmE, and a few (for instance, <i>early on</i>) are now completely standard.</p>

<p>Though the influence of cross-culture media has done much to familiarize BrE and AmE speakers with each others regional words and terms, many words are still recognized as part of a single form of English. Though the use of a British word would be acceptable in AmE (and vice versa), most listeners would recognize the word as coming from the other form of English, and treat it much the same as a word borrowed from any other language. For instance: an American using the word "chap" or "mate" to refer to a friend, would be heard in much the same way as an American using the Spanish word "amigo".</p>

</dl>
<p>When saying or writing out numbers, the British will insert an "and" before the tens and units, as in "one hundred and sixty-two" and "two thousand and three", whereas Americans will typically drop the "and" as in "two thousand three"; however, "two thousand and three" is also common. The same rule applies when saying numbers in their thousands or millions: "four hundred and thirteen thousand" would be said by a British speaker, "four hundred thirteen thousand" by an American speaker.</p>
<p>American schools teach students to pronounce decimally written fractions (".5") as though they were longhand fractions ("five tenths"), though this formality is often dropped in common speech. For example, "five hundred thirteen and seven tenths" for 513.7 — in the UK, this would be read "five hundred and thirteen point seven", although if it was written 513 <sup>7</sup><span class="Unicode">⁄</span><sub>10</sub>, it would still be pronounced "five hundred and thirteen and seven tenths").</p>
<p>Up to 1,900 it is common in both varieties of English to count in hundreds - so 1,200 may be "twelve hundred". But Americans use this pattern more consistently and for much higher numbers than is the norm in British English, referring to "twenty-four hundred" where British English would always use "two thousand four hundred"<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. Even below 2,000, Americans are more likely than the British to read numbers like 1,234 as "twelve thirty-four", instead of "one thousand, two hundred and thirty-four".</p>
<p>In the case of years, however, "twelve thirty-four" would be the norm on both sides of the Atlantic for the year 1234. The year 2000 and years beyond it are read as "two thousand", "two thousand (and) one" and the like by both British and American speakers, although the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> has recently taken the step of reading dates as "twenty-oh-six" for 2006.</p>
<p>For the house number (or bus number, etc) "272" British people would tend to say "two seven two" while Americans would tend to say "two seventy-two".</p>
<p>There was also a historical difference between <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_and_short_scales.html" title="Long and short scales">billions</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trillion.html" title="Trillion">trillions</a>, and so forth. Americans use "billion" to mean one thousand million (1,000,000,000), whereas in the UK, until the latter part of the 20th century, it was used to mean one million million (1,000,000,000,000) (although historically such numbers were not often required outside of mathematical and scientific contexts). One thousand million was sometimes described as a "<a href="../../../m/i/l/Milliard.html" title="Milliard">milliard</a>", the definition adopted by most other European languages. However, the "American" version has since been adopted for all published writing, and the word "milliard" is obsolete in English, as are <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billiard_%28number%29.html" title="Billiard (number)">billiard</a> (but not <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billiards.html" title="Billiards">billiards</a>, the game), <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trilliard.html" title="Trilliard">trilliard</a> and so on. However the term <i>yard</i>, derived from <i>milliard</i>, is still used in the financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic to mean "one thousand million". All major British publications and broadcasters, including the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>, which long used "thousand million" to avoid ambiguity, now use "billion" to mean thousand million.</p>
<p>Many people have no direct experience with manipulating numbers this large, and many non-American readers may interpret "billion" as 10<sup>12</sup> (even if they are young enough to have been taught otherwise at school); also usage of the "long" billion is standard in some non-English speaking countries. For these reasons, defining the word may be advisable when writing for the general public. See <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_and_short_scales.html" title="Long and short scales">long and short scales</a> for a more detailed discussion of the evolution of these terms in English and other languages.</p>
<p>When referring to the numeral <a href="../../../0/_/%28/0_%28number%29.html" title="0 (number)">0</a>, British people would normally use "zero", "nought", "oh", or "nil" in instances such as sports scores and voting results. Americans use the term "zero" most frequently; "oh" is also often used (though never when the quantity in question is nothing), and occasionally slang terms such as "zilch" or "zip". Phrases such as "the team won two-zip" or "the team leads the series, two-nothing" are heard when reporting sports scores. The digit 0, for example, when reading a phone or account number aloud, is nearly always pronounced "oh" in both language varieties for the sake of convenience.</p>
<p>When reading numbers in a sequence, such as a telephone or serial number, British people will usually use the terms <i>double</i> or <i>treble/triple</i>. Hence 007 is "double oh seven". Exceptions are the emergency telephone number <a href="../../../9/-/9/9-9-9.html" title="9-9-9">999</a>, which is always "nine nine nine" and the apocalyptic "<a href="../../../n/u/m/Number_of_the_Beast_0d10.html" title="Number of the Beast">Number of the Beast</a>" which is always "six six six". The <a href="../../../d/i/r/Directory_enquiries.html" title="Directory enquiries">directory enquiries</a> prefix 118 is also "one one eight" in Britain due to its extensive advertising campaign with the slogan read out as "One one eight, what's your number?"; however, in Ireland it is "eleven-eight". In the U.S., <a href="../../../9/-/1/9-1-1.html" title="9-1-1">911</a> (the U.S. emergency telephone number) is almost always read "nine-one-one", while 9/11 (in reference to the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>) is usually read "nine-eleven".</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_and_British_English_differences_6ac2.html" title="Edit section: Monetary amounts">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Monetary amounts</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Monetary amounts in the range of one to two major currency units are often spoken differently. In AmE one may say "a dollar fifty" or "a pound eighty" whereas in BrE these amounts would be expressed "one dollar fifty" and "one pound eighty". For amounts over a dollar, an American will generally either drop denominations or give both dollars and cents, as in "two-twenty" or "two dollars and twenty cents" for $2.20. An American would not say "two dollars twenty." On the other hand, in BrE, "two pounds twenty" would be the most common form. It is more common to hear a British-English speaker say "one thousand, two hundred dollars" than "a thousand, two hundred dollars" although the latter construct is common in AmE. The term "twelve hundred dollars", popular in AmE, is frequently used in BrE but only for exact multiples of 100 up to 1900. Amounts over 1900 expressed in hundreds, for example "twenty-three hundred" are very rarely heard by speakers of BrE.</li>
<li>The BrE slang term "quid" is roughly equivalent to the AmE "buck" and both are often used in the two respective dialects for round amounts, as in "fifty quid" for £50 and "twenty bucks" for $20. "A hundred and fifty grand" in either dialect could refer to £150,000 or $150,000 depending on context.</li>
<li>A user of AmE may hand-write the mixed monetary amount $3.24 as $3<sup>24</sup> or $3<sup><u>24</u></sup> (often seen for extra clarity on a check); BrE users will always write this as £3.24, £3·24 or, for extra clarity on a cheque as £3—24. In all cases there may or may not be a space after the currency symbol, or the currency symbols may be omitted depending on context.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></li>
<li>In order to make explicit the amount in words on a cheque, Americans write <i>three and <sup>24</sup><span class="Unicode">⁄</span><sub>100</sub></i> (using this <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slash_%28punctuation%29.html" title="Slash (punctuation)">solidus</a> construction or with a horizontal division line): they do not need to write the word "dollars" as it is usually printed on the cheque. Britons write <i>three pounds and 24 pence</i>, <i>three pounds <span class="Unicode">‒</span> 24</i> or <i>three pounds <span class="Unicode">‒</span> 24p</i>, since the currency unit is not preprinted. To make unauthorized amendment difficult, it is useful to have an expression terminator even when a whole number of dollars/pounds is in use: thus Americans would write <i>three and <sup>00</sup><span class="Unicode">⁄</span><sub>100</sub></i> or <i>three and <sup>no</sup><span class="Unicode">⁄</span><sub>100</sub></i> on a three-dollar cheque (so that it cannot easily be changed to, for example, <i>three million</i>) and Britons would write <i>three pounds only</i>, or <i>three pounds exactly</i>.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></li>
<li>The term '<a href="../../../p/o/u/Pound_sign.html" title="Pound sign">pound sign</a>' in BrE always refers to the currency symbol "£", whereas in AmE 'pound sign' means the <a href="../../../n/u/m/Number_sign.html" title="Number sign">number sign</a>, which the British call the 'hash' symbol, "#".</li>
<li>In BrE, the plural of the word pound is often considered to be "pound" as opposed to "pounds." For example, a Briton would say "three pound forty," to mean three pounds and forty pence. He would not apply this practice to all currencies however, and would most likely say "two dollars eighty" if stating an amount in dollars.</li>

In informal British speech the preposition is sometimes omitted, so that 5:30 may be referred to as <i>half five</i> (by contrast, the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> <i>halb fünf</i> is half-an-hour <i>before</i> five, i.e. 4:30). <i>Half after</i> is sometimes heard in both countries, and used to be predominant in the U.S. The AmE formations <i>top of the hour</i> and <i>bottom of the hour</i> are not commonly used in BrE. Forms like <i>eleven forty</i> are common in both dialects. See <a href="#Times" title="">below</a> for variation in written forms.</p>

<p>There are also variations in <a href="../../../f/l/o/Floor_numbering.html" title="Floor numbering">floor numbering</a> between the U.S. and UK. In most countries, including the UK, the "first floor" is one above the entrance level while the entrance level is the "ground floor"; whereas normal American usage labels the entrance level as the "first floor" and does not use "ground floor." Some American buildings have a "ground floor" or another name for the entrance level, usually as part of a plan to cater to <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmopolitan.html" title="Cosmopolitan">cosmopolitan</a> persons. (This may also be the case in buildings built on hillsides or uneven ground, where the basement on one side of the structure may be at street level on the other.) Nonetheless, the rest of the floors are numbered in the usual American manner.</p>

<p>Both BrE and AmE use the expression "I couldn't care less" to mean the speaker does not care at all. In AmE, the phrase "I could care less" (without the "n't") is synonymous with this in casual usage. <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intonation.html" title="Intonation">Intonation</a> no longer reflects the originally <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarcasm.html" title="Sarcasm">sarcastic</a> nature of this variant, which is not <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idiom.html" title="Idiom">idiomatic</a> in BrE and might be interpreted as anything from nonsense (or sloppiness) to an indication that the speaker <i>does</i> care.</p>
<p>In both areas, saying "I don't mind" often means "I'm not annoyed" (for example, by someone's smoking), while "I don't care" often means "the matter is trivial or boring". However, in answering a question like "Tea or coffee?", if either alternative is equally acceptable, an American may answer "I don't care", while a British person may answer "I don't mind". Either sounds odd to the other.</p>
<p>In BrE, the phrase "I can't be arsed [to do something]" is a vulgar equivalent to the British or American "I can't be bothered [to do something]". This can be extremely confusing to Americans, as the Southern British pronunciation of the former sounds the same as "I can't be asked...", which sounds either defiantly rude or nonsensical.</p>
<p>In Appalachia, some speakers use "I don't care to" (as in "I don't care to talk to him") as the equivalent of "I don't mind (talking to him)." This usage is confusing (and sometimes offputting) to both non-Appalachian users of AmE and users of BrE.</p>
<p>Older BrE often uses the exclamation "No fear!" where current AmE has "No way!" An example from <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorothy_L._Sayers_bb9e.html" title="Dorothy L. Sayers">Dorothy L. Sayers</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Q.: Wilt thou be baptised in this faith?<br />
A.: No fear!</dd>
<dd>— from <i>A Catechism for Pre- and Post-Christian Anglicans</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This usage may confuse users of AmE, who are likely to interpret and even use "No fear!" as enthusiastic willingness to move forward.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_and_British_English_differences_6ac2.html" title="Edit section: Education">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h4>
<p>In the UK, a student is said to <i>study</i> a subject (or, at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oxford_2ca4.html" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a> or <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cambridge_5f20.html" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, to <i>read</i> a subject), while in the U.S., a student either <i>studies</i> the subject or <i>majors</i> in it (except at a few <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a> schools, such as <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton_University_960f.html" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown_University_180e.html" title="Brown University">Brown University</a>, and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a>, where one "concentrates" in it). Unlike most of the world where university students pursue a single field of study, United States universities often require a variety of courses. <i>To major</i> refers only to the student's principal course of study, while <i>to study</i> may refer to any class being taken.</p>
<p>At the tertiary level in BrE, a <i>module</i> is taught by a <i>lecturer</i>, while in AmE, a <i>class</i> is generally taught by a <i>professor</i> (at some institutions, "professor" is reserved for tenure-track faculty with other members of the faculty referred to as "lecturers" or "instructors"). At the primary and secondary levels the term "teacher" is used instead in both BrE and AmE. The term "lecturer," in an educational context, would be perceived in AmE as denoting anyone, professor or special guest, giving an actual lecture before a class.</p>
<p>BrE:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"She studied history at Bristol."</dd>
<dd>"She read history at Oxford."</dd>
</dl>
<p>AmE:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"She majored in history at Yale."</dd>
<dd>"He majored in Elementary Education at the University of Minnesota."</dd>
</dl>
<p>The word <i>course</i> is ambiguous in American usage. It may refer to a student's major (as in the phrase "course of study") but more commonly it refers to the study of a restricted topic (for example, "a course in Early Medieval England", "a course in Integral Calculus") and is equivalent to a <i>module</i> at a British University.</p>
<p>In the UK, a student is said to <i>sit</i> or <i>take</i> an exam, while in the U.S., a student <i>takes</i> an exam. The expression <i>he sits for</i> an exam also arises in BrE, but only rarely in AmE; American lawyers-to-be <i>sit for</i> their bar exams, and American master's and doctoral students may <i>sit for</i> their comprehensive exams, but in nearly all other instances, Americans <i>take</i> their exams. When preparing for an exam, students <i>revise</i> (BrE)/<i>review</i> (AmE) what they have studied; the BrE idiom <i>to revise for</i> an exam has no direct AmE equivalent.</p>
<p>Examinations are supervised by <i>invigilators</i> in the UK and <i>proctors</i> (or <i>(exam) supervisors</i>) in the U.S. In the UK, a teacher <i>sets</i> an exam, while in the U.S., a teacher <i>writes</i> or <i>gives</i> an exam.</p>
<p>BrE:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I sat my Spanish exam yesterday."</dd>
<dd>"I plan to set a difficult exam for my students, but I haven't got it ready yet."</dd>
</dl>
<p>AmE:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I took my exams at Yale."</dd>
<dd>"I spent the entire day yesterday writing the exam. I'm almost ready to give it to my students."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Another source of confusion is the different usage of the word <i>college</i>. (See a full international discussion of the various meanings at <a href="../../../c/o/l/College.html" title="College">college</a>.) In the U.S., this refers to a post-high school institution that grants bachelor's degrees, while in the UK it refers primarily to a tertiary institution between secondary school and university (normally referred to as a <i>Sixth Form College</i> after the old name in secondary education for Years 12 and 13, the <i>6th form</i>) where intermediary courses such as <a href="../../../a/_/l/A_Level_54e6.html" title="A Level">A Levels</a> or <a href="../../../n/v/q/NVQ_a695.html" title="NVQ">NVQs</a> can be taken and <a href="../../../g/c/s/GCSE_097d.html" title="GCSE">GCSE</a> courses can be retaken, with the interchangeability of college with secondary school being rare but not unknown. It should be noted, however, that in the case of <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oxford_2ca4.html" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Cambridge_5f20.html" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_London_fd08.html" title="University of London">London</a> and <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durham_University_84ef.html" title="Durham University">Durham</a> universities, all members are also members of a college, for example, one is a member of <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Peter%27s_College%2C_Oxford_49cf.html" title="St. Peter's College, Oxford">St. Peter's College, Oxford</a> and hence the University.</p>
<p>In both the U.S. and UK, <i>college</i> can refer to some division within a university such as the "college of business and economics". Institutions in the U.S. that offer two to four years of post-high school education often have the word <i>college</i> as part of their name, while those offering more advanced degrees are called a <i>university</i>. (There are exceptions, of course: <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_ba3b.html" title="Boston College">Boston College</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_College_efeb.html" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a> and The <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_of_William_and_Mary_3d3c.html" title="College of William and Mary">College of William and Mary</a> are examples of colleges that offer advanced degrees.) (An obvious sign that an educational institution aspires to a better station in life may be seen when it drops "college" from its name and substitutes "university.") American students who pursue a <i>bachelor's degree</i> (four years of higher education) or an <i>associate degree</i> (two years of higher education) are <i>college students</i> regardless of whether they attend a college or a university and refer to their educational institutions informally as <i>colleges.</i> A student who pursues a master's degree or a doctorate degree in the arts and sciences is in AmE a <i>graduate student</i>; in BrE a <i>post-graduate student</i> although <i>graduate student</i> also sometimes used. Students of advanced professional programmes are known by their field (<i>business student</i>, <i>law student</i>, <i>medical student</i>, the last of which is frequently shortened to <i>med student</i>). Some universities also have a <a href="../../../r/e/s/Residential_college.html" title="Residential college">residential college</a> system, the details of which may vary from school to school but generally involve common living and dining spaces as well as college-organized activities.</p>
<p>"Professor" has different meanings in BrE and AmE. In BrE it is the highest <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academic_rank.html" title="Academic rank">academic rank</a>, followed by Reader, Senior Lecturer and Lecturer. In AmE "Professor" refers to academic staff of all ranks, with (Full) Professor (largely equivalent to the UK meaning) followed by Associate Professor and Assistant Professor.</p>
<p>There is additionally a difference between American and British usage in the word <i>school</i>. In British usage "school" by itself refers only to primary (elementary) and secondary (high) schools, and to <i>sixth forms</i> attached to secondary schools — if one "goes to school", this type of institution is implied. By contrast, an American student at a university may talk of "going to school" or "being in school". U.S. law students and med students almost universally speak in terms of going to "law school" and "med school," respectively. However, the word is used in BrE in the context of higher education; to describe a division grouping together several related subjects in a university, for example a "School of European Languages" containing <i>departments</i> for each language, and also in the term "art school".</p>
<p>Among high school and college students in the United States, the words <i>freshman</i> (or the gender-neutral term <i>frosh</i> or <i>first year</i>), <i>sophomore</i>, <i>junior</i> and <i>senior</i> refer to the first, second, third, and fourth years, respectively. It is important that the context of either high school or college first be established, or else it must be stated directly (that is, "She is a high school freshman." "He is a college junior."). Many institutions in both countries also use the term <i>first-year</i> as a gender-neutral replacement for <i>freshman</i>, although in the U.S. this is recent usage, formerly referring only to those in the first year as a graduate student. One exception is the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Virginia_2eaf.html" title="University of Virginia">University of Virginia</a>; since its founding in 1819, the terms "first-year", "second-year", "third-year", and "fourth-year" have been used to describe undergraduate university students. At the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_military_academies_55d9.html" title="United States military academies">United States military academies</a>, at least those operated directly by the federal government, a different terminology is used, namely "fourth class", "third class", "second class", and "first class" (note that the order of numbering is the reverse of the number of years in attendance). In the UK, first year university students are often called <i>freshers</i>, especially early in the academic year; however, there are no specific names for those in other years, nor for school pupils. Graduate and professional students in the United States are known by their year of study (a "second-year medical student" or a "fifth-year doctoral candidate"; law students are generally not referred to as "nth-year law students", but rather "1L", "2L", or "3L").</p>
<p>While anyone in the U.S. who finishes studying at any educational institution by passing relevant examinations is said to <i>graduate</i> and to be a <i>graduate</i>, in the UK only degree and above level students can <i>graduate</i>. <i>Student</i> itself has a wider meaning in AmE, meaning any person of any age studying at any educational institution, whereas in BrE it tends to be used for people studying at a post-secondary educational institution.</p>
<p>In the UK, the U.S. equivalent of a <i>high school</i> is often referred to as a <i>secondary school</i> regardless of whether it is state funded or private. Secondary education in the United States also includes <i>middle school</i> or <i>junior high school</i>, a two or three year transitional school between elementary school and high school.</p>
<p>A <i>public school</i> has opposite meanings in the two countries. In the U.S. this is a government-owned institution supported by taxpayers. In <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>, the term strictly refers to a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headmasters%27_and_Headmistresses%27_Conference_8c04.html" title="Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference">select group</a> of prestigious <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_school_%28United_Kingdom%29_011a.html" title="Independent school (United Kingdom)">private independent schools</a> funded by students' fees, although it is often more loosely used to refer to any independent school. Independent schools are also known as <i>private schools</i>, and the latter is the correct term in <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> for all such fee-funded schools. Strictly, the term <i>public school</i> is not used in Scotland and Northern Ireland in the same sense as in England, but nevertheless, <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordonstoun.html" title="Gordonstoun">Gordonstoun</a>, the Scottish private school which <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales_f847.html" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">Charles, Prince of Wales</a> attended, is sometimes confusingly referred to as a <i>public school</i>. Government-funded schools in Scotland and Northern Ireland are properly referred to as <i>state schools</i> — but are sometimes confusingly referred to as <i>public schools</i> (with the same meaning as in the U.S.); whereas in the U.S., where most public schools are administered by local governments, a <i>state school</i> is typically a college or university run by one of the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._state_5a68.html" title="U.S. state">states</a>.</p>
<p>Speakers in both the United States and the United Kingdom use several additional terms for specific types of secondary schools. A <i>prep school</i> or <i><a href="../../../p/r/e/Preparatory_school.html" title="Preparatory school">preparatory school</a></i> is an independent school funded by tuition fees; the same term is used in the UK for a private school for pupils under thirteen, designed to prepare them for fee-paying public schools. An American <i><a href="../../../p/a/r/Parochial_school.html" title="Parochial school">parochial school</a></i> covers costs through tuition and has affiliation with a religious institution. In the UK, the state-funded <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education_in_the_United_Kingdom_7510.html" title="Education in the United Kingdom">education system</a> grew from parish schools organised by the local <a href="../../../e/s/t/Established_church.html" title="Established church">established church</a>, the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> (C.of E., or C.E.), and many schools, especially <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_education.html" title="Primary education">primary schools</a> (up to age 11) retain a church connection and are known as <i><a href="../../../p/a/r/Parochial_school.html#United_Kingdom" title="Parochial school">church schools</a></i>, <i>C.E. Schools</i> or <i>C.E. (Aided) Schools</i>. There are also <i>faith schools</i> associated with the Roman Catholic church and other major faiths, with a mixture of funding arrangements.</p>
<p>In the U.S., a <i><a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnet_school.html" title="Magnet school">magnet school</a></i> receives government funding and has special admission requirements: students gain admission through superior performance on admission tests. The UK has <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_%28England%29_d7ae.html" title="Academy (England)">city academies</a>, which are independent privately sponsored schools run with public funding, and which can select up to 10% of pupils by <a href="../../../a/p/t/Aptitude.html" title="Aptitude">aptitude</a>.</p>

<p>Americans refer to <i>transportation,</i> while British people refer to <i>transport.</i> As <i>transportation</i> in Britain was a penalty for a crime, that is, <i>deportation</i>, the British use the word <i>communication</i> to include goods and persons, whereas in America the word primarily refers to messages sent by post or electronics. The British devised the term <i>telecoms</i> for this last use; it is not quite standard in America.</p>
<p>Differences in terminology are especially obvious in the context of <a href="../../../r/o/a/Road.html" title="Road">roads</a>. The British term <i>dual carriageway</i>, in American parlance, would be a <i>divided highway</i>. <i>Central reservation</i> on a <i>motorway</i> in the UK would be a <i>median</i> on a <i>freeway</i>, <i>expressway</i>, <i>highway</i>, or <i>parkway</i> in the U.S. The one-way lanes that make it possible to enter and leave such roads at an intermediate point without disrupting the flow of traffic are generally known as <i>slip roads</i> in the UK, but U.S. civil engineers call them <i>ramps,</i> and further distinguish between <i>on-ramps</i> (for entering) or <i>off-ramps</i> (for leaving). When American engineers speak of <i>slip roads,</i> or <i>slip ramps,</i> they are referring to on-ramps and off-ramps that have been rearranged (through use of a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grade_separation.html" title="Grade separation">grade separation</a>) to minimize weaving on a freeway segment between two interchanges that are too close together. These last two terms are almost never used by the general public in the U.S.</p>
<p>In the UK, the term <i>outside lane</i> refers to the higher-speed <i>overtaking lane</i> (<i>passing lane</i> in the U.S.) closest to the center of the road, while <i>inside lane</i> refers to the lane closer to the edge of the road. These terms have the opposite meanings in AmE, with the <i>outside lane</i> being the one near the edge and the <i>inside lane</i> being the one closer to the median. In much of the U.S., <i>outside lane</i> is only used in the context of a turn, in which case it depends on which direction the road is turning (i.e. if the road bends right the left lane is the <i>outside lane</i>, but if the road bends left the right lane is the <i>outside lane</i>). Both also refer to <i>slow</i> and <i>fast</i> lanes (even though all actual traffic speeds may be at or even above the legal speed limit). UK traffic officials, firefighters, and police officers refer to Lanes 1, 2 and 3, referring to the 'slow', 'middle' and 'fast' lanes respectively. In the U.S. the meanings are exactly reversed with Lane 1 referring to the fast lane and so on.</p>
<p>In the UK, <i>drink driving</i> is against the law, while in the U.S. the term is <i>drunk driving</i>. The legal term in the U.S. is "driving while intoxicated" (D.W.I.) or "driving under the influence" of alcohol (D.U.I.). The equivalent legal phrase in the UK is to be found "drunk in charge" of a motor vehicle (DIC).</p>

<li><b>Full stops/Periods in abbreviations</b>: Americans tend to write "Mr.", "Mrs.", "St.", "Dr." etc., while British will usually, but not always, write "Mr", "Mrs", "St", "Dr", etc., following the rule that a full stop is used only when the last letter of the abbreviation is not the last letter of the complete word. However, many British writers would tend to write other abbreviations without a full stop, such as "Prof", "etc", "eg", and so on (so recommended by some Oxford dictionaries). The rationale behind this usage is that it is typographically more elegant, and that the omitted full stops/periods are essentially superfluous, as the reader recognizes the abbreviation without them. It also removes ambiguity by reserving the period for ending sentences. However, the "American" usage of periods after most abbreviations is also widely used in the UK. Note that in either case it is incorrect to put a period after units such as kg for kilogram or Hz for hertz, as these are considered unit symbols, not abbreviations; however, in non-scientific contexts, the unit for "inch" is often written "in.", as it would be ambiguous without the period.</li>

<li><b><a href="../../../q/u/o/Quotation_mark.html" title="Quotation mark">Quoting</a></b>: Americans start with double quotation marks (") and use single quotation marks (') for quotations within quotations. In general this is also true of BrE, but can be the opposite when used in book publishing, for example. In journals and newspapers, quotation mark double/single use depends on the individual publication's <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_style.html" title="House style">house style</a>.</li>
<li><b>Contents of quotations</b>: Americans are taught to put commas and periods inside quotation marks, whereas British people will put the punctuation inside if it belongs to the quote and outside otherwise. This means that direct speech retains punctuation inside the quotation marks in BrE also, with a full stop changing into a comma if followed by explanatory text.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The American style was established for typographical reasons, an historical holdover from the days of the handset printing press. It also eliminates the need to decide whether a period or comma belongs to the quotation. However, many people find the usage counterintuitive. <i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Hart%27s_Rules_8aa4.html" title="Hart's Rules">Hart's Rules</a></i> and the <i>Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors</i> call the British style "new" or "logical" quoting; it is similar to the use of quotation marks in many other languages (including Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian, Catalan, Dutch, and German). For this reason, the more "logical" British style is increasingly used in America, although <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formal_written_English_-_regional_differences_b626.html" title="Formal written English - regional differences">formal writing</a> still generally calls for the "American" style. In fact, the British style is often the <i>de facto</i> standard among Americans for whom formal or professional writing is not a part of their daily life; many are in fact unaware that the normative American usage is to place commas and periods within the quotation marks. (This rule of placing all punctuation inside quotation if and only if it belongs to the quotation is expressly prescribed by some American professional organisations such as the American Chemical Society; see <i>ACS Style Guide</i>.) According to the <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jargon_File_ced0.html" title="Jargon File">Jargon File</a>, American <a href="../../../h/a/c/Hacker.html" title="Hacker">hackers</a> have switched to using "logical" British quotation system, because including extraneous punctuation in a quotation can sometimes change the fundamental meaning of the quotation. More generally, it is difficult for computer manuals, online instructions, and other textual media to accurately quote exactly what a computer user should see or type on their computer if they follow American punctuation conventions.</dd>
<dd>In both countries, the "British" style is used for quotation around parentheses, so in both nations one would write:</dd>
</dl>
<p>"I am going to the store. (I hope it is still open.)"</p>
<dl>
<dd>But:</dd>
</dl>
<p>"I am going to the store (if it is still open)."</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Letter-writing</b>: American students in some areas have been taught to write a colon after the greeting in business letters ("Dear Sir:") while British people usually write a comma ("Dear Sir,") or make use of the so-called <i>open punctuation</i> ("Dear Sir"). However, this practice is not consistent throughout the United States<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, and it would be regarded as a highly formal usage by most Americans.</li>

<p>Use of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalisation.html" title="Capitalisation">capitalisation</a> varies.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the words in titles of publications, newspaper headlines, as well as chapter and section headings are capitalised in the same manner as in normal sentences (<a href="../../../s/e/n/Sentence_case.html" title="Sentence case">sentence case</a>). That is, only the first letter of the first word is capitalised, along with <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proper_noun.html" title="Proper noun">proper nouns</a>, etc.</p>
<p>However, publishers sometimes require additional words in titles and headlines to have the initial capital, for added <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emphasis_%28typography%29.html" title="Emphasis (typography)">emphasis</a>, as it is often perceived as appearing more professional. In AmE, this is common in titles, but less so in newspaper headlines. The exact rules differ between publishers and are often ambiguous; a typical approach is to capitalise all words other than short <a href="../../../a/r/t/Article_%28grammar%29.html" title="Article (grammar)">articles</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preposition.html" title="Preposition">prepositions</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conjunction.html" title="Conjunction">conjunctions</a>. This should probably be regarded as a common stylistic difference, rather than a linguistic difference, as neither form would be considered incorrect or unusual in either the UK or the U.S. Many British <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabloid_newspapers.html" title="Tabloid newspapers">tabloid newspapers</a> (such as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sun_%28newspaper%29_f6cd.html" title="The Sun (newspaper)">The Sun</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Sport_afc6.html" title="The Daily Sport">The Daily Sport</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/News_of_the_World_22c3.html" title="News of the World">News of the World</a></i>) use fully capitalised headlines for impact, as opposed to readability (for example, BERLIN WALL FALLS or BIRD FLU PANIC). On the other hand, the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadsheet.html" title="Broadsheet">broadsheets</a> (such as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_47ca.html" title="The Times">The Times</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></i>) usually follow the sentence style of having only the first letter of the first word capitalised.</p>

<p>Date formats are usually written differently in the short (numerical) form. Christmas Day 2000, for example, is 25/12/00 or 25.12.00 (dashes are occasionally used) in the UK and 12/25/00 in the U.S., although the formats 25/12/2000, 25.12.2000, and 12/25/2000 now have more currency than they had prior to the <a href="../../../y/e/a/Year_2000_problem.html" title="Year 2000 problem">Year 2000 problem</a>. Occasionally other formats are encountered, such as the <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_8601_65ca.html" title="ISO 8601">ISO 8601</a> 2000-12-25, popular among programmers, scientists, and others seeking to avoid ambiguity. The difference in short-form date order can lead to misunderstanding. For example, 06/04/05 could mean either 4 June 2005 (if read as U.S. format), 6 April 2005 (if seen as in UK format), or even 5 April 2006 if taken to be an older ISO 8601-style format where 2-digit years were allowed.</p>
<p>A consequence of the different short-form of dates is that in the UK many people would be reluctant to refer to "<a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_4153.html" title="9/11">9/11</a>", although its meaning would be instantly understood. On the BBC, "September the 11th" is generally used in preference to 9/11, although 9/11 is commonplace in the British press. 11/9 is occasionally used deliberately to emphasise the distinction.</p>
<p>When writing long-form dates, the format "December 25, 2000" is widely encountered in primarily the U.S. and sometimes the UK, and it is the form generally used in the U.S. In the UK and elsewhere, it is more common to use the format "25 December 2000" or "25 December 2000", more so than Americans. It is, however, acceptable in the U.S., and the American grammarians <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strunk_and_White_b552.html" title="Strunk and White">Strunk and White</a>, among others, recommend it. Similarly, in American speech, "December twenty-fifth" is the most likely form, though "the twenty-fifth of December" is also not uncommon. For example, many Americans refer to Independence Day as the "fourth of July". In the UK the latter is more likely, and even when the month is presented first the definite article is usually inserted in speech, thus "December <i>the</i> twenty-fifth". American military usage follows the British model: "25 December 2000" and "25/12/00".</p>
<p>The use of the word "week" is different in British and U.S. English. Phrases such as "a week today", "a week tomorrow", "a week on Tuesday", and "Thursday week" in Britain and Ireland are unknown in the U.S., where "a week from today" or "a week from tomorrow" is the standard construction. "Friday week" in Britain and Ireland is rare in many areas but similarly rendered as "a week from Friday" in the U.S. "Friday week" being the Friday after "Friday next" (or next Friday), which may be itself distinct from "this Friday" (the closest one). Those british speakers who habitually use "Friday week" and "Friday next" will also use "Friday last" interchangably with "last Friday", and occasionally "Friday week last", meaning the friday before "last friday". Finally, "Friday fortnight" (2 weeks after "next friday") is occasionally heard, usually only if the speaker is counting weeks or dates in their head in a conversation.</p>

<p>Americans always write digital times with a colon, thus <i>6:00</i>, whereas Britons often use a full stop, <i>6.00</i>, although it is becoming increasingly popular<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> to use a colon. Also, the <a href="../../../2/4/-/24-hour_clock.html" title="24-hour clock">24-hour clock</a> (<i>18:00</i> or <i>1800</i>), which in the UK would be considered normal in many applications (for example, air/rail/bus timetables) is largely unused in the U.S. outside of military or medical applications. Often in the UK 18:00 will be written as 1800h or 09:00 as 0900h - representing the military speak "oh-nine-hundred-hours", even if people would almost always read it aloud as "nine o'clock". This has become popular in text messaging since it is easier to type a "h" than a colon.</p>
