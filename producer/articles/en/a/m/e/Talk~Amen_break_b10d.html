<p>Yeah I think so. Dates on stuff like this would be nice though, as referring to the "rhythmic manipulation of wav files" sounds like it was a fairly fresh concept at the time&#160;:) <a href="http://www.bootleg-jim.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bootleg-jim.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>Not necessary. It was included in many programs as grooves, rhytms, samples and a lot of other stuff, doesn't need to be mentioned I think. Reezpekt.</p>

<p>The founder of The Winstons added the following text to the article:</p>
<p><b>It is known that the drummer, G.C. Coleman,nor the copyright owner Richard L. Spencer,the grammy award winning composer and performer of the hit "Color Him Father," has never received any royalties for the sampling.It is once again the old habit of euro-centricity of copying and then claimimg the ideas of Black people.From the whites on the plantations in the south who chalked their faces with black soot and created Amos and Andy, as well as Al Jolson, to Benny Goodman hiring Black arrangers to write the music scores that made him "the king of swing,"to the shameful theft of R&amp;B music from the Blacks like Chuck Berry, Little Richard,and others, by white music pimps who "created' someting called Rock and Roll, and installed Elvis,Jerry Lee Lewis,The Beatles, and other marginally talented souls, who of course , made billions while we die in poverty.So what else is new? Brittany Spears and M&amp;M?</b></p>
<p>The text was posted form a computer in US (Charlotte) so I assume it was the real Richard Spencer. Mr Spencer, if it was really you please tell us how we can get in touch with you. I think something should be done regarding the royalties, it's not fair. Greetings.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>- LOL. let's track all songs using the sample, the authors (thieves) ans get da money! i would be glad to hear a break of my music used in so many tracks! whether i'm greedy or not is another question... sampling is just part of modern music, it would endanger art to sue people sampling records or ask them money, as long as something different was made from the original record. let's not be people from the past... besides, even if legally spencer is the copyright owner, he would no less be a thief for collecting money when he was not the drummer.</p>
<p>- how many computers does charlotte count btw? don't get why he's assumed to be the author.</p>
<p>- the break was used in hip-hop (black music) before it was used in "white" music. because people liked it doesn't mean they wanted to steal the blacks again. what happened with blues &amp; jazz (sad story that is part of the history of slavery) does not aply here imo. it's just a 5 seconds break for ****'s sake, not a musical genre.</p>

<p>This guy needs to keep in mind that perhaps one of the most famous usages of the Amen break is NWA - Straight Outta Compton. 68.221.205.180 20:57, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>removed the image and its caption("the most influential 5.[xx] seconds in electronic music history"). It adds nothing. -<a href="../../../-/m/u/User%7E-mushroom.html" title="User:-mushroom">mushroom</a></p>
<p><br />
Stupid image? Got a better idea to visualise a sample loop? STOP REMOVING STUFF OR YOU GONNA GET BANNED! I know it's not your first time...</p>
<p><br />
Why visualize it in the first place? It's a 5 second audio loop. Not to mention the caption is incredibly non-NPOV, along with much of the rest of the article (but I don't feel like cleaning that up right now). I think the image is pointless, but I won't delete it completely. The caption has to change, however. -<a href="../../../-/m/u/User%7E-mushroom.html" title="User:-mushroom">mushroom</a></p>
<p>Amen is the only loop which created a new style of music. If you can prove it wrong please do.</p>
<p>But why is it the most influential? You can't verify a statement like that with facts. -<a href="../../../-/m/u/User%7E-mushroom.html" title="User:-mushroom">mushroom</a></p>
<p>It was the most influential loop in history of electronic music because it was the only time when a simple 5sec sample break created a new subculture and new style of music. It is was used in thousands of tracks and it is the most often sampled break in history. Those are the facts.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that it's nearly impossibile to verify the statement "most often sampled break in history," I won't dispute it, simply because it is quite possibly true. However, the phrase "the most influential 5.20 seconds in the history of electronic music" is a very opinionated phrase, and it needs to be removed, along with many other things in the article. I mean, seriously, "The amen break is still to be found in many d'n'b tracks today and every dj knows that nothing is as sure to send the crowd wild as the amen break"? come on. that kind of wording doesn't belong in an encyclopedia. -<a href="../../../-/m/u/User%7E-mushroom.html" title="User:-mushroom">mushroom</a></p>
<p>I think the image does add a small something to the article. I edited the caption to be neutral. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamyshade_d84e.html" title="User:Dreamyshade">Dreamyshade</a> 05:40, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

The image is useless indeed, as it is a graphical repesentation of a sound that does not tell how the sound sounds. Well the pages *looks* better but beyond that it's useless, really, it has no point. if someone can tell what it adds apart from that, i'd be happy to know. Yawn g 05:27, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Amen is the only loop which created a new style of music. If you can prove it wrong please do." If you can prove it right please do... def a strange way of approaching knowledge: if something can't be proven wrong then it's right.Yawn g 05:27, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i><b>"Amen is the only loop which created a new style of music. If you can prove it wrong please do."</b></i> Really? I'm not so sure, in fact, this statement is blatantly inaccurate and fails to understand how Jungle (I'm presuming this is the genre you refer to) actually evolved, and what the components of the style are. The Amen break (or any specific break for that matter) did not in itself create a style or give rise to a subculture, it was only one element of a form that combined three existing genres in one: 1. Dub Reggae (the bass line, generally composed using low frequency sine tones and commonly refered to as sub-bass) 2. Soul (the vocal snippets, sometimes pitch shifted) 3. Funk (the breaks). Of course this template was subject to variation in terms of where the underlying components were sourced; but I would argue that this is a good starting point. You must also appreciate that what initially distinguished this genre of dance music from others was the dual time feel. The bass line was in cut time, while the full tempo break rolled over the top; with the vocal elements often serving to moderate between the two extremes. The three main components had all made appearances in a multitude of music’s prior to the emergence of Jungle/DnB but it was the unique Afro-Caribbean culture in London (arguably) that gave rise to this sound. I really think there is far too much significance being attributed to the influence of the Amen break and I'm sure if you could draw producers - from back in the day - into this debate, they would agree. We could sit here and name check dozens of influences on what would eventually become Jungle/DnB the Amen break is ultimately a tiny part of the equation.</p>

<p>There used to be this program back in 1995-1999 which was called 'Amen!'. It could be downloaded, though I can't find it on the net anymore. Anyone finding it please contact me ( <a href="mailto:creativecontest@hotmail.com" class="external free" title="mailto:creativecontest@hotmail.com" rel="nofollow">mailto:creativecontest@hotmail.com</a> ). It used to have the original loop, and could break it up into as many pieces you'd like. playing those back in whatever order you would want. Maybe I'm getting it wrong, but I thought this program used to be freeware.</p>

<p>No? If so, how do you explain that website The Breaks lists only 32 sampling songs for it <a href="http://the-breaks.com/search.php?term=winstons&amp;type=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://the-breaks.com/search.php?term=winstons&amp;type=0" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> as it lists 182 sampling songs, almost 6 times more, for the Funky Drummer? <a href="http://the-breaks.com/search.php?term=funky+drummer&amp;type=4" class="external autonumber" title="http://the-breaks.com/search.php?term=funky+drummer&amp;type=4" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>I get the feeling that it's all because that YouTube video claims that it's the most sampled break ever that it made it to this article. I mean, what backs that claim besides that video? Apparently nothing, therefore I'm editing that line, and please don't bring it back unless you can prove that it's been more frequently sampled than the Funky Drummer. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by [[User:{{{1}}}|{{{1}}}]] ([[User talk:{{{1}}}|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/{{{1}}}|contribs]]).</small></p>
