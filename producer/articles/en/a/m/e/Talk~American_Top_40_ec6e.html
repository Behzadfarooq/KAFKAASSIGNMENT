<p>XM Radio has been teasing that AT40 will be aired on the decades channels (70's and 80's) and it is starting this weekend (8/4-6) with a marathon. I cannot find an XM press release nor a news story on it, though, so I haven't included it in the article, even though I've heard the commercials. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 00:53, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Im not sure where you are getting your facts from but there is no LEGAL radio station in the United Kingdom which brodcasts the AT40 program. Perhaps online anywhere in the world but not on the airwaves here in the UK, and I should know. Regards, C.G</p>

<p>AT40 is owned by Clear Channel and syndicated by their subsidary, Premier Radio Networks. Shouldn't this be mentioned. And in regards to above, I agree, AT40 has not been legally broadcast in the UK since the early 90's.</p>

<p>I noticed on their <a href="http://www.kool108.com/main.html" class="external text" title="http://www.kool108.com/main.html" rel="nofollow">website</a> and read on some message boards that KOOL 108 will start airing some of the classic AT40 shows from the 70s. No word on whether other stations will begin airing them, but KQQL is owned by Clear Channel, which in turn owns Premiere.

<p>And until about two years ago, I was mentioned on American Top 40 the same number of times that the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Eagles_04d3.html" title="Philadelphia Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> played in the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_21ed.html" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowl</a>, a fact I remember because it was the same weekend, January 24-25, 1981, that the Eagles played the <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland_Raiders_c8ad.html" title="Oakland Raiders">Oakland Raiders</a>.</p>
<p>What happened was that in a December 1980 broadcast, <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casey_Kasem_b443.html" title="Casey Kasem">Casey Kasem</a> mentioned that there were two acts who had had a Top 40 entry every year in the 1970s, <a href="../../../e/l/t/Elton_John_16de.html" title="Elton John">Elton John</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_c886.html" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>. I know way too much about <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Diamond_99db.html" title="Neil Diamond">Neil Diamond</a>, and I was pretty sure that he had a Top 40 entry each year in that decade, too. I sat down and listed every year and found I had a Neil Diamond song to go in each one. In 1977, the only song of his that made the Top 40, "Desiree", didn't do so until December 24, during a time period in which Casey pre-empted the regular weekly Top 40 to do an annual recap of the annual Top 100. So, I figured that was why he may have overlooked "Desiree" and, as a result, Neil's annual 1970s accomplishment.</p>
<p>I lived in the <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> area at the time, so I called the local station that carried American Top 40, <a href="../../../w/p/g/WPGC_6ef4.html" title="WPGC">WPGC</a>, to see if they had an address for the show. They did, and I typed up the letter to Casey and sent it off to an address in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Hollywood%2C_California_8e58.html" title="North Hollywood, California">North Hollywood, California</a>.</p>
<p>I promptly forgot about the letter, and I didn't always catch the whole broadcast every week. But on the weekend of January 24, I wanted to especially hear the show because that's Neil's birthday. He was turning the Big 4-0, and his hit song "Love On The Rocks" was climbing the charts and almost certain to be in the Top 10 that week. I was hoping that Casey would say something about it being a big birthday for Neil.</p>
<p>Instead, he introduced "Love On The Rocks", which was #2 that week ("<a href="../../../%28/j/u/%28Just_Like%29_Starting_Over_b4fb.html" title="(Just Like) Starting Over">(Just Like) Starting Over</a>" by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lennon_7583.html" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a> was #1, and "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tide_Is_High_04ef.html" title="The Tide Is High">The Tide Is High</a>" by <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blondie_%28band%29.html" title="Blondie (band)">Blondie</a> was #3), by mentioning my name and my letter! This was certainly a great thrill for me. At least one cousin in a distant state heard it, too.</p>
<p>I'd love to get my hands on a broadcast of that show, or at least get to hear it again some time. Oh, as far as the Super Bowl went, "Indian Reservation (The Lament Of The Cherokee Reservation Indian)" beat "<a href="../../../w/i/t/Witchy_Woman_0608.html" title="Witchy Woman">Witchy Woman</a>". <a href="../../../r/s/l/User%7ERSLitman_c5fa.html" title="User:RSLitman">RSLitman</a> 03:00, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
