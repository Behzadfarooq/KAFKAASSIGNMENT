</div>
<p>The formation of the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_Telephone_Company_e4ba.html" title="Bell Telephone Company">Bell Telephone Company</a> superseded an agreement between <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Graham_Bell_395d.html" title="Alexander Graham Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a> and his financiers, principal among them <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gardiner_Greene_Hubbard_59bf.html" title="Gardiner Greene Hubbard">Gardiner Greene Hubbard</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Sanders_252d.html" title="Thomas Sanders">Thomas Sanders</a>. Renamed the National Bell Telephone Company in March 1877, it became the American Bell Telephone Company in March 1880. By 1881, it had bought a controlling interest in the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Electric_c798.html" title="Western Electric">Western Electric</a> Company from <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Union_7e9b.html" title="Western Union">Western Union</a>. Only three years earlier, Western Union had turned down Gardiner Hubbard's offer to sell it all rights to the telephone for $100,000.</p>
<p>In 1880, the management of American Bell created what would become AT&amp;T Long Lines. The project was the first of its kind to create a nationwide long-distance network with a commercially viable cost-structure. This project was formally incorporated into a separate company christened American Telephone and Telegraph Company on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_3.html" title="March 3">March 3</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1885.html" title="1885">1885</a>.

<p>Bell's <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent.html" title="Patent">patent</a> on the telephone expired in 1894, but the company's much larger customer base made its service much more valuable than alternatives and substantial growth continued.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_30.html" title="December 30">December 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/9/1899.html" title="1899">1899</a>, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company bought the assets of American Bell; this was because Massachusetts corporate laws were very restrictive, and limited capitalization to ten million dollars, forestalling the growth of American Bell itself.</p>

</div>
<p>As a result of a combination of regulatory actions by government and actions by AT&amp;T, the firm eventually gained what most regard as <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly.html" title="Monopoly">monopoly</a> status. In 1907, AT&amp;T president <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_Vail_a53d.html" title="Theodore Vail">Theodore Vail</a> made it known that he was pursuing a goal of "One Policy, One System, Universal Service." AT&amp;T began purchasing competitors, which attracted the attention of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antitrust.html" title="Antitrust">antitrust</a> regulators. To avoid antitrust action, in a deal with the government, Vail agreed to the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingsbury_Commitment_8702.html" title="Kingsbury Commitment">Kingsbury Commitment</a> of 1913. The terms of the agreement allowed AT&amp;T to purchase independent phone companies as long as it sold just as many. G.W. Brock says in <i>Telephone:The First Hundred Years</i>, "This provision allowed Bell and the independents to exchange telephones in order to give each other geographical monopolies. So long as only one company served a given geographical area there was little reason to expect price competition to take place." AT&amp;T focused on purchasing companies within specific geographic areas that increased its effective control of the telephone system market, while selling its less-desirable and previously acquired companies to independent buyers. Also included in the Kingsbury Commitment was the requirement that AT&amp;T allow competitors to connect through its phone lines. Economists point out that this reduced the incentive of these companies to build competing long-distance lines.</p>
<p>Around 1917, the idea that everyone in the country should have phone service and that the government should promote that began being discussed in government. AT&amp;T agreed, saying in a 1917 annual report: "A combination of like activities under proper control and regulation, the service to the public would be better, more progressive, efficient, and economical than competitive systems." In 1918 the federal government nationalized the entire telecommunications industry, with national security as the stated intent. Rates were regulated so that customers in large cities would pay higher rates to subsidize those in more remote areas. Vail was appointed to manage the telephone system with AT&amp;T being paid a percentage of the telephone revenues. AT&amp;T profited well from the nationalization arrangement which ended a year later. States then began regulating rates so that those in rural areas would not have to pay high prices, and competition was highly regulated or prohibited in local markets. Also, potential competitors were forbidden from installing new lines to compete, with state governments wishing to avoid "duplication." The claim was that telephoning was a "<a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_monopoly.html" title="Natural monopoly">natural monopoly</a>," meaning that one firm can better serve the public than two or more. Eventually, AT&amp;T's market share amounted to what most would regard as a monopolistic share.</p>
<p>In 1913, after vacuum-tube inventor <a href="../../../l/e/e/Lee_De_Forest_5d04.html" title="Lee De Forest">Lee De Forest</a> began to suffer financial difficulties, AT&amp;T bought De Forest's vacuum-tube patents for the bargain price of $50,000. In particular, AT&amp;T acquired ownership of the 'Audion', the first triode (three-element) <a href="../../../v/a/c/Vacuum_tube.html" title="Vacuum tube">vacuum tube</a>, which greatly amplified telephone signals. The patent increased AT&amp;T's control over the manufacture and distribution of long-distance telephone services, and allowed the Bell System to build the United States's first coast-to coast telephone line. Thanks to the pressures of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, AT&amp;T and <a href="../../../r/c/a/RCA_9f83.html" title="RCA">RCA</a> owned all useful patents on vacuum tubes. RCA staked a position in wireless communication; AT&amp;T pursued the use of tubes in telephone amplifiers. Some <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent.html" title="Patent">patent</a> allies and partners in RCA were angered when the two companies' research on tubes began to overlap, and there were many patent disputes.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T, RCA, and their patent allies and partners finally settled their disputes in 1926 by compromise. AT&amp;T decided to focus on the telephone business as a communications common carrier, and sold its broadcasting subsidiary <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcasting_Corporation_of_America_88ea.html" title="Broadcasting Corporation of America">Broadcasting Corporation of America</a> to RCA. The assets included station <a href="../../../w/e/a/WEAF_91d7.html" title="WEAF">WEAF</a>, which for some time had broadcast from AT&amp;T headquarters in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. In return, RCA signed a service agreement with AT&amp;T, ensuring any radio network RCA started would have transmission connections provided by AT&amp;T. Both companies agreed to cross-license patents, ending that aspect of the dispute. RCA, <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Electric_4bb6.html" title="General Electric">GE</a>, and <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westinghouse_Electric_Corporation_fdf7.html" title="Westinghouse Electric Corporation">Westinghouse</a> were now free to combine their assets to form the <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_89b7.html" title="NBC">National Broadcasting Company</a>, or NBC network.</p>
<p>In 1925, AT&amp;T created a new unit called Bell Telephone Laboratories, commonly known as <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_Labs_88bf.html" title="Bell Labs">Bell Labs</a>. This <a href="../../../r/e/s/Research_and_development.html" title="Research and development">research and development</a> unit proved highly successful, pioneering, among other things, <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_astronomy.html" title="Radio astronomy">radio astronomy</a>, the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transistor.html" title="Transistor">transistor</a>, the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photovoltaic_cell.html" title="Photovoltaic cell">photovoltaic cell</a>, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unix.html" title="Unix">Unix</a> <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operating_system.html" title="Operating system">operating system</a>, and the <a href="../../../c/_/p/C_programming_language.html" title="C programming language">C programming language</a>. However, its parent company did not always capitalize on these achievements. In 1949 the Justice Department filed an antitrust suit aimed at forcing the divestiture of Western Electric, which was settled seven years later by AT&amp;T's agreement to confine its products and services to common carrier telecommunications and license its patents to "all interested parties". A key effect of this was to ban AT&amp;T from selling computers despite its key role in electronics research and development.</p>

<p><a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_utility.html" title="Public utility">Public utility</a> commissions in all state and local <a href="../../../j/u/r/Jurisdiction.html" title="Jurisdiction">jurisdictions</a> regulated the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_System_70d8.html" title="Bell System">Bell System</a> and all the other telephone companies. The <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Communications_Commission_26fd.html" title="Federal Communications Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) regulated all service across state lines. These commissions controlled the rates that companies could charge, and the specific services and equipment they could offer. Nonetheless, technological innovation continued. For example, AT&amp;T commissioned the first experimental communications <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satellite.html" title="Satellite">satellite</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telstar.html" title="Telstar">Telstar</a> I in 1962.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T increased its control of the telephone system through its leasing arrangements for telephones and telephone equipment made by its subsidiary, <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Electric_c798.html" title="Western Electric">Western Electric</a>. Like most telephones of the time in the United States, Western Electric-made phones were owned not by individual customers, but by local Bell System telephone companies - all of which were in turn owned by AT&amp;T, which also owned Western Electric itself. Instead, each phone was leased from AT&amp;T on a monthly basis by customers, who generally paid for their phone and its connection many times over in cumulative lease fees. This monopoly made millions of extra dollars for AT&amp;T, which had the secondary effect of greatly limiting phone choices and styles. AT&amp;T strictly enforced policies against buying and using phones by other manufacturers that had not first been transferred to and re-rented from the local Bell monopoly. Many phones made by Western Electric thus carried the following disclaimer permanently molded into their housings: "BELL SYSTEM PROPERTY — NOT FOR SALE." Telephones also labeled with a sticker marking the Bell Operating Company that owned the telephone. In the 1980s, after some consumers began buying phones from other manufacturers anyway, AT&amp;T changed its policy by selling customers the phone's housing, retaining ownership of the mechanical components - which still required paying AT&amp;T a monthly leasing fee.</p>
<p>For most of the 20th century, AT&amp;T subsidiary AT&amp;T Long Lines thus enjoyed a near-total monopoly on <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_distance.html" title="Long distance">long distance</a> telephone service in the United States. AT&amp;T also controlled 22 <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_Operating_Companies_432e.html" title="Bell Operating Companies">Bell Operating Companies</a> which provided <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_telephone_service.html" title="Local telephone service">local telephone service</a> to most of the United States. While there were many "independent telephone companies", <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Telephone_and_Electronics_e377.html" title="General Telephone and Electronics">General Telephone</a> being the most significant, the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_System_70d8.html" title="Bell System">Bell System</a> was far larger than all the others, and widely considered a monopoly itself.</p>

<p>For many years, AT&amp;T had been permitted to retain its monopoly status under the assumption that it was a <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_monopoly.html" title="Natural monopoly">natural monopoly</a>. The first erosion to this monopoly occurred in 1956 where the <a href="../../../h/u/s/Hush-a-Phone_v._FCC_d092.html" title="Hush-a-Phone v. FCC">Hush-a-Phone v. FCC</a> ruling allowed a third-party device to be attached to rented telephones owned by AT&amp;T. This was followed by the 1968 <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carterphone_decision.html" title="Carterphone decision">Carterphone decision</a> that allowed third-party equipment to be connected the AT&amp;T telephone network. The rise of cheap microwave communications equipment in the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970s.html" title="1970s">1970s</a> opened a window of opportunity for competitors — no longer was the acquisition of expensive rights-of-way necessary for the construction of a long-distance telephone network. In light of this, the FCC permitted <a href="../../../m/c/i/MCI_Communications_1af6.html" title="MCI Communications">MCI</a> (Microwave Communications, Inc) to sell communication services to large businesses. This technical-economic argument against the necessity of AT&amp;T's monopoly position would hold for a mere fifteen years until the beginning of the fiber-optics revolution sounded the end of microwave-based long distance.</p>

<p>The rest of the telephone monopoly lasted until final settlement of a 1974 <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Justice_619c.html" title="United States Department of Justice">United States Department of Justice</a> <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antitrust.html" title="Antitrust">antitrust</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_break_up_of_AT%26T_a2b8.html" title="The break up of AT&amp;T">suit against AT&amp;T</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_8.html" title="January 8">January 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982.html" title="1982">1982</a>, under which AT&amp;T ("Ma Bell") agreed to divest its local exchange service operating companies, in return for a chance to go into the computer business (see <a href="../../../a/t/%26/AT%26T_Computer_Systems_7e0c.html" title="AT&amp;T Computer Systems">AT&amp;T Computer Systems</a>). AT&amp;T's local operations were split into seven independent <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regional_Bell_operating_company_281d.html" title="Regional Bell operating company">Regional Bell Operating Companies</a> known as "Baby Bells".</p>
<p>With the American consumer's new ability to purchase phones outright, AT&amp;T and the Bell System lost the considerable revenues earned from phone leasing by local Bell companies. Forced to compete with other manufacturers for new phone sales, the aging Western Electric phone designs still marketed through AT&amp;T failed to sell, and Western Electric eventually closed all of its U.S. phone manufacturing plants. AT&amp;T, reduced in value by about 70%, continued to run all its long distance services through <a href="../../../a/t/%26/AT%26T_Communications_c4fa.html" title="AT&amp;T Communications">AT&amp;T Communications</a> (the new name of AT&amp;T Long Lines), although it lost some market share in the ensuing years to competitors <a href="../../../m/c/i/MCI_f046.html" title="MCI">MCI</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/r/Sprint_Corporation_a752.html" title="Sprint Corporation">Sprint Corporation</a>.</p>
<p>A sign that hung in many Bell facilities in 1983 read: <i>"There are two giant entities at work in our country, and they both have an amazing influence on our daily lives. . . one has given us radar, sonar, stereo, teletype, the transistor, hearing aids, artificial larynxes, talking movies, and the telephone. The other has given us the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, the First World War, the Second World War, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, double-digit inflation, double-digit unemployment, the Great Depression, the gasoline crisis, and the Watergate fiasco. Guess which one is now trying to tell the other one how to run its business?"<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></i></p>
<p><a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Electric_c798.html" title="Western Electric">Western Electric</a> was fully absorbed into AT&amp;T as <a href="../../../a/t/%26/AT%26T_Technologies_23d1.html" title="AT&amp;T Technologies">AT&amp;T Technologies</a>, and was divided into several units focused on specific customer groups, such as <a href="../../../a/t/%26/AT%26T_Network_Systems_469f.html" title="AT&amp;T Network Systems">AT&amp;T Network Systems</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/%26/AT%26T_Consumer_Products_6066.html" title="AT&amp;T Consumer Products">AT&amp;T Consumer Products</a>.</p>
<p>After its own attempt to penetrate the computer marketplace failed, in 1991, AT&amp;T absorbed <a href="../../../n/c/r/NCR_Corporation_f69a.html" title="NCR Corporation">NCR Corporation</a> (National Cash Register), hoping to capitalize on the burgeoning <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_computer.html" title="Personal computer">personal computer</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unix.html" title="Unix">UNIX</a> networked server markets, but was unable to extract lasting financial or technological gains from the <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merger.html" title="Merger">merger</a>. After <a href="../../../d/e/r/Deregulation.html" title="Deregulation">deregulation</a> of the U.S. telecom industry via the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telecommunications_Act_of_1996_bdd2.html" title="Telecommunications Act of 1996">Telecommunications Act of 1996</a>, NCR was divested again. At the same time, the majority of AT&amp;T Technologies and the renowned <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bell_Labs_88bf.html" title="Bell Labs">Bell Laboratories</a> was spun off as <a href="../../../l/u/c/Lucent_Technologies_34b5.html" title="Lucent Technologies">Lucent Technologies</a>. The industry as a whole had many other reorganizations since the 1990s, both due to <a href="../../../d/e/r/Deregulation.html" title="Deregulation">deregulation</a> and because of technological advances reducing demand and pricing power in telecommunications.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, AT&amp;T purchased the largest cellular carrier, <a href="../../../m/c/c/McCaw_Cellular_8a8b.html" title="McCaw Cellular">McCaw Communications</a>, for $11.5 billion and kick-started its cellular division with 2 million subscribers.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, AT&amp;T purchased long-distance provider <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska_Communications_System_a599.html" title="Alaska Communications System">Alaska Communications System</a> (Alascom). FCC approval required the company be run as an AT&amp;T subsidiary rather than a more likely absorption into <a href="../../../a/t/%26/AT%26T_Communications_c4fa.html" title="AT&amp;T Communications">AT&amp;T Communications</a>, giving the company the <a href="../../../a/t/%26/AT%26T_Alascom_2fe1.html" title="AT&amp;T Alascom">AT&amp;T Alascom</a> name. The buyout marked the first time that any company with Bell roots would hold operations in the non-contiguous United States.</p>
<p>In 1997, AT&amp;T hired former <a href="../../../i/b/m/IBM_cbf4.html" title="IBM">IBM</a> executive <a href="../../../c/_/m/C_Michael_Armstrong_9775.html" title="C Michael Armstrong">C Michael Armstrong</a> as its <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_executive_officer.html" title="Chief executive officer">chief executive officer</a>. Armstrong's vision was to change AT&amp;T from a long-distance carrier into a global "telecommunications <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermarket.html" title="Supermarket">supermarket</a>", eyeing Internet services for the booming <a href="../../../d/o/t/Dot-com.html" title="Dot-com">dot-com</a> industry.</p>
<p>Armstrong's most prominent strategy was buying significant <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cable_television.html" title="Cable television">cable television</a> assets. After acquiring John Malone's <a href="../../../t/e/l/Tele-Communications_Inc._aba5.html" title="Tele-Communications Inc.">TCI</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/d/Media_One_b752.html" title="Media One">Media One</a> (gaining through the latter a 25% share of <a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Warner_Cable_8c38.html" title="Time Warner Cable">Time Warner Cable</a>), AT&amp;T was the largest provider of <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cable_television.html" title="Cable television">cable television</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. It intended to use these assets to bridge the so-called "<a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_mile.html" title="Last mile">last mile</a>" and break the Regional Bell Companies' access-monopoly of the consumer household for data and telephony services, but the wager was costly, substantially increasing the company's debt. AT&amp;T acquired TCI in a $48 billion all-stock transaction including the assumption of $16 billion of debt. AT&amp;T <a href="http://news.com.com/AT&amp;T+wins+the+bidding+war+for+MediaOne/2100-1033_3-225427.html" class="external text" title="http://news.com.com/AT&amp;T+wins+the+bidding+war+for+MediaOne/2100-1033_3-225427.html" rel="nofollow">acquired</a> MediaOne for $54 billion in cash and stock, after a bidding war with Comcast</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>, AT&amp;T announced a US$1 billion alliance with <a href="../../../b/t/_/BT_Group_plc_cf4c.html" title="BT Group plc">BT</a> to offer global <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voice_over_IP_284b.html" title="Voice over IP">voice over IP</a> (VoIP) services, called <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concert_Communications_Services_28b4.html" title="Concert Communications Services">Concert</a>, sparking rumors of a potential merger.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> But the parties fought for control of the project and could not even agree on the alliance's name. By mid-2001, customers were being directed to sign contracts with the parent companies, and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concert_Communications_Services_28b4.html" title="Concert Communications Services">Concert Communications Services</a>, as the venture was eventually known, was scrapped in October that year.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> AT&amp;T acquired the <a href="../../../o/l/i/Olivetti_Research_Laboratory_a16d.html" title="Olivetti Research Laboratory">Olivetti &amp; Oracle Research Lab</a>, from <a href="../../../o/l/i/Olivetti.html" title="Olivetti">Olivetti</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oracle_Corporation_7180.html" title="Oracle Corporation">Oracle Corporation</a>. In 2002, it closed down the research part of the lab.</p>
<p>Also in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, AT&amp;T paid US$5 billion to purchase IBM's Global Network business, which became AT&amp;T Global Network Services, LLC. As part of the purchase agreement, IBM granted AT&amp;T a five-year, US$5-billion contract to handle much of IBM's networking needs, and AT&amp;T outsourced some of its applications processing and data management work to IBM. IBM also committed to billing and installation for AT&amp;T's long-distance customers in a 10-year deal valued at US$4 billion; and assumed management of AT&amp;T's data processing centers.</p>
<p>With long-distance rates falling and the market for telecommunications services overall weakening, AT&amp;T could not sustain the debt it had incurred in these ventures. Moreover, the cost of upgrading TCI's equipment to handle two-way communications proved far higher than pre-merger estimates. AT&amp;T undertook a major reorganization in October 2000, moving its mobile phone and broadband units into separate companies, to allow each unit to raise capital independently.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_9.html" title="July 9">July 9</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> it spun off <a href="../../../a/t/%26/AT%26T_Wireless_c92f.html" title="AT&amp;T Wireless">AT&amp;T Wireless Corp.</a> in what was then the world's largest <a href="../../../i/n/i/Initial_public_offering.html" title="Initial public offering">initial public offering</a> (IPO). Later that year it spun off <a href="../../../a/t/%26/AT%26T_Broadband_5ada.html" title="AT&amp;T Broadband">AT&amp;T Broadband</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberty_Media_e127.html" title="Liberty Media">Liberty Media</a>, which comprised its <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cable_television.html" title="Cable television">cable TV</a> assets. AT&amp;T Broadband was subsequently acquired by <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comcast.html" title="Comcast">Comcast</a> in 2002, and AT&amp;T Wireless merged with <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cingular_Wireless_52d6.html" title="Cingular Wireless">Cingular Wireless</a> LLC in 2004.</p>
<p>In 2004, the U.S. government eliminated equal access regulations that allowed long-distance phone companies to access the networks owned by the regional Bell carriers at fixed rates. This ultimately caused AT&amp;T to move away from the residential telephone business — declaring in the process that it would no longer market residential telephone service. Instead, its residential focus shifted to offering a voice service over a broadband Internet connection called <a href="../../../a/t/%26/AT%26T_CallVantage_24b1.html" title="AT&amp;T CallVantage">AT&amp;T CallVantage</a>.</p>

<p>From 1885 to 1910, AT&amp;T was headquartered at 125 Milk St in Boston. With its expansion it moved to New York City, to a headquarters on 195 Broadway (close now to the World Trade Center site). The property originally belonged to <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Union_7e9b.html" title="Western Union">Western Union</a>, of which AT&amp;T held a controlling interest until <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a> when AT&amp;T divested its interest as part of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingsbury_Commitment_8702.html" title="Kingsbury Commitment">Kingsbury Commitment</a>.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Construction of the current building began in 1912.

Instead of a large double-high space, similar to the nearby Woolworth Building, Bosworth designed what is called a "hypostyle hall," with full-bodied Doric columns modeled on the Parthenon, marking out a grid. Bosworth was seeking to coordinate the classical tradition with the requirements of a modern building. Columns were not merely the decorative elements they had become in the hands of other architects but created all the illusion of being real supports. Bosworth also designed the campus of <a href="../../../m/i/t/MIT_7abc.html" title="MIT">MIT</a> as well as <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodore_N._Vail_bf37.html" title="Theodore N. Vail">Theodore N.
