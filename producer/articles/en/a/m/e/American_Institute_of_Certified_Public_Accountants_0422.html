	    <p>With over 330,525 CPA members (in August 2006), the <b>American Institute of Certified Public Accountants</b> (<b>AICPA</b>) is the largest professional organization of <a href="../../../c/e/r/Certified_Public_Accountant_0a08.html" title="Certified Public Accountant">Certified Public Accountants</a> (CPAs) in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States of America</a>. Approximately 40% of its members are engaged in the practice of public accounting, in areas such as auditing, accounting, taxation, general business consulting, business valuation, personal financial planning and business technology. The majority (60%) of its members are CPAs who work in industry, government and education. However, because of the Institute's major role in self-regulation of most practicing CPAs, a large part of the Institute's resources are devoted to this function and to related programs to help CPAs maintain professional competence. The two most visible CPA practice functions are tax practice and the independent audits and similar services related to financial statements of all types of entities. Only CPAs and a now dwindling number of "grandfathered-in" non-CPA accountants are permitted to perform this audit function.</p>
<p>The Institute's overriding role is to promote and enhance the profession of <a href="../../../a/c/c/Accounting.html" title="Accounting">accounting</a>. To accomplish this, it has a variety of functions, which include: providing group member benefits; preparing the Uniform CPA Examination; developing CPA professional standards; providing technical support to CPA members in many areas of practice; operating the profession's public relations programs; providing support to the academic community and representing the profession before Congress and federal agencies.</p>

<p>Like any large membership organization, the AICPA provides a number of group insurance, buying programs and similar benefits. Its life insurance trust would be one of the nation's largest life insurance companies if it was a single company rather than a membership program.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Institute_of_Certified_Public_Accountants_0422.html" title="Edit section: CPA Examination">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">CPA Examination</span></h2>
<p>The AICPA develops the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Uniform_Certified_Public_Accountant_Examination_c4bf.html" title="Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination">Uniform CPA Exam</a>, one of the most respected entry-level professional licensing exams in the U.S. The test has recently been changed from an annual two-day examination to a test that can be taken on a computer in a testing center. While each state has variations in the educational, experience and other requirements necessary to earn a CPA license, all states use the AICPA's exam to meet the entry-level testing requirement.</p>
<p>The AICPA also develops the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Qualification_Examination_f1a5.html" title="International Qualification Examination">International Qualification Examination</a> (IQEX)</p>
<p><a name="Professional_Standards_Setting" id="Professional_Standards_Setting"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Institute_of_Certified_Public_Accountants_0422.html" title="Edit section: Professional Standards Setting">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Professional Standards Setting</span></h2>
<p>The AICPA sets <i>generally accepted</i> professional and technical standards for CPAs in many areas. Until the 1970s, the AICPA held a virtually monopoly in this field. In the 1970s, however, it transferred its responsibility for setting generally accepted accounting principles <i>(GAAP)</i> to the newly formed <a href="../../../f/i/n/Financial_Accounting_Standards_Board_d9b4.html" title="Financial Accounting Standards Board">Financial Accounting Standards Board</a> <i>(FASB.)</i> Following this, it retained its standards setting function in areas such as financial statement auditing, professional ethics, attest services, CPA firm quality control, CPA tax practice and financial planning practice. Before passage of the <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarbanes-Oxley_59ff.html" title="Sarbanes-Oxley">Sarbanes-Oxley</a> law, AICPA standards in these areas were considered "generally accepted" for all CPA practitioners.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, federal public policy makers concluded that where independent financial statement audits of public companies regulated by the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission_95a6.html" title="U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</a> are concerned, that the AICPA's standards setting and related enforcement roles should be transferred to a government empowered body with more enforcement authority than a non-governmental professional association, such as the AICPA could provide. As a result, the Sarbanes-Oxley law created the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Company_Accounting_Oversight_Board_d421.html" title="Public Company Accounting Oversight Board">Public Company Accounting Oversight Board</a> (PCAOB) which has jurisdiction over virtually every area of CPA practice in relation to public companies. However, the AICPA retains its considerable standards setting, ethics enforcement and firm practice quality monitoring roles for the majority of practicing CPAs, who serve privately held business and individuals.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Institute_of_Certified_Public_Accountants_0422.html" title="Edit section: Providing Technical Support to Members">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Providing Technical Support to Members</span></h2>
<p>The Institute has many technical and professional committess and task forces that deal with numerous issues facing CPAs, their clients and the public. The AICPA also provides a wide array of telephone technical support, educational material, conferences and technical publications for its members. In addition, it offers specialization credentials in several areas, such as the Personal Financial Specialist designation for CPAs in personal financial planning. Other specializations are offered in the ares of business technology and business valuation. The AICPA's national technical conferences are well known for their excellence. The Institute also publishes the <i>Journal of Accountancy,</i> the nation's oldest technical accounting journal and has an extensive Website, www.aicpa.org, supporting all of these activities.</p>
<p>The Institute provides substantial support to the accounting programs of colleges and universities involved with educating future CPAs.</p>
<p><a name="Public_Relations_Program" id="Public_Relations_Program"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Institute_of_Certified_Public_Accountants_0422.html" title="Edit section: Public Relations Program">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Public Relations Program</span></h2>
<p>The Institute runs a number of public relations activities that include: having members available to the media to provide technical support in the areas of CPA practice expertise; operating an extensive high school and college student recruitment program to encourage students to consider a CPA career; and getting the word out about the vital role that CPAs play in the U.S. economy in support of financial markets, small business and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>The AICPA also runs extensive public interest programs. One of the most important is an award winning program called <i>360 Degrees of Financial Literacy.</i> The program is a multi-faceted effort, spearheaded by the AICPA, with the support of state CPA societies. It encourages CPAs to take a broad leadership role in volunteering to educate the American public, from school children to retirees, on financial topics that apply to their particular stage of life. This program has an extensive Website with a variety of financial literacy resources, which can be found at <a href="http://www.360financialliteracy.org" class="external free" title="http://www.360financialliteracy.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.360financialliteracy.org</a></p>
<p>During the fall of 2006, the AICPA and the AD Council launched a national campaign to encourage Americans aged 25-34 to "feed the pig" as a key step toward building a solid financial future for themselves and their families. Feed the Pig™ is a national multi-media campaign, featuring Benjamin Bankes, a smartly dressed, adult-sized pig who evokes memories of the piggy bank. The campaign delivers a strong message about the importance and benefits of saving. A dedicated website, www.feedthepig.org provides free financial information and tools to help young "career builders" take control of their finances and build long-term financial security.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Institute_of_Certified_Public_Accountants_0422.html" title="Edit section: Government Relations Program">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Government Relations Program</span></h2>
<p>The AICPA has a Washington office and a political action committee. Many of its Washington activities have a public interest aspect. The Institute and its members make recommendations to Congress and a number of federal agencies to help them better serve the public, in areas of CPA technical expertise, such as taxation and accounting. In these areas, the Institute tries to solely be a technical resource rather than recommending policy positions. For example, in the social security debate, the Institute develops white papers that lay out all of the options and the pros and cons of each option to assist policy makers. A careful process is used to weed out any policy bias in such analyses. The Washington office also represents the profession in matters of specific interest to members.</p>
<p>The AICPA's Political Action Committee is a contributor to U.S. Congressional representatives and Senators from both parties who sit on various legislative committees of relevance to CPAs.</p>

<p>Certified Public Accountants are licensed by individual states, so they must follow the laws and regulations of the state they are licensed in. Once achieving state CPA licensure, by federal regulation, CPAs are automatically licensed to practice before the Internal Revenue Service, with essentially the same rights and duties as attorneys. For audits involving federal monies, the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_Accountability_Office_4f61.html" title="Government Accountability Office">Government Accountability Office</a> has issued additional standards commonly referred to as the Yellow Book.</p>
<p>In addition, the AICPA was a primary source for defining Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for State and Local Governments through the issuance of an <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timeline_of_Governmental_Accounting_Standards_-_US_7665.html#American_Institute_of_Certified_Public_Accountants" title="Timeline of Governmental Accounting Standards - US"><i>Industry Audit Guide</i> and <i>Statements of Position</i></a></p>
<p>The AICPA is a leading member of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Federation_of_Accountants_c24b.html" title="International Federation of Accountants">International Federation of Accountants</a>.</p>
