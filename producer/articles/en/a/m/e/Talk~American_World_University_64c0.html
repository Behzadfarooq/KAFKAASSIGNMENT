<dd>You did remove them when you changed them into an image. Your new change, utilizing tinyurl, is less harmful, but I still think it's POV to intentionally boost links to one site at the expense of another. Furthermore, I don't think your change will work the way you intend it to. Tinyurl returns a 302, and google will follow the 302 and boost the pagerank of the linked-to page, not tinyurl. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> 警告 20:02, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The issue of promotional links is similar to the issue of deleting copyright violations, which we delete even if they are factual and encyclopedic. We customarily remove link spam from unrelated articles. However, it does seem as if an article that is about AWU should have an easily followed reference to AWU's website.</p>
<p>The original reason for deleting this article was that it was advertising, which is considered a valid reason for deletion. Many of us believe that the purpose of the article's creation was to promote AWU.</p>
<p>The issue is not with relevant external links placed by editors of pages in general. The issue relates to a specific technical issue. A factor in the Google weighting of sites, originally one of the most important factors, was links from other sites, which were in effect assumed to be independent endorsements of the value of the site. The existence of open Wikis allows the system to be gamed, by allowing people to directly place links to their own sites on Wikis. Because Wikipedia is relatively important, such links have relatively great weight.</p>
<p>This is a growing issue and the systematic exploitation of Wikis in this way is already occurring: see <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2004/06/04/wikis_the_next_frontier_for_spammers.html" class="external text" title="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2004/06/04/wikis_the_next_frontier_for_spammers.html" rel="nofollow">Wikis the next frontier for spammers</a> and <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2004_06_01_index.html#108608909046269742" class="external text" title="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2004_06_01_index.html#108608909046269742" rel="nofollow">Nigritude Ultramarine and the Wiki Sandbox Effect</a>.</p>
<p>I feel very strongly that we need to find ways to make it unattractive to use Wikipedia in this way. I really don't see how there can be any serious objection to the use of a tinyurl link, since it does not change the appearance or the functionality of the page. The page is exactly as useful to our readers as it was before. I personally have no objection to the substitution of tinyurl links anywhere, in the George W. Bush article or the John F. Kerry article or anywhere. To show the sincerity of this remark, I've replaced the direct link to my personal web page at <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">User:Dpbsmith</a> with a tinyurl substitute.</p>
<p>Refining this, yes, the page text should contain HTML comments that are a) not quite valid URLs but b) allow the original URL to be recovered in the event of a tinyurl failure, although my guess is that the longevity of tinyurl is likely to be quite comparable to the longevity of any particular link. I would suggest considering tinyurl as a stopgap and seeing whether the developers would consider engineering a similar feature as part of MediaWiki, running on our WikiMedia servers under WikiMedia control.</p>
<p>I ask that <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a>, <a href="../../../l/3/3/User%7EL33tminion_371f.html" title="User:L33tminion">User:L33tminion</a>, and <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> as a personal courtesy to me, let me have my way with this particular edit on this particular page. Building on <a href="../../../l/3/3/User%7EL33tminion_371f.html" title="User:L33tminion">User:L33tminion</a>'s constructive start, I made significant improvements that resulted in the page being kept, which I believe was one of your goals. I have no intention of using tinyurl links on a large scale, only in rare cases comparable to this one.</p>
<p>(Does anyone have any better ideas on how we can serve our readership without promoting AWU's self-serving goals?)</p>
<p>There are no rules about such things, but this would be a act of kindness which I would appreciate.

But doing it only in rare cases is precisely the problem. Wikipedia must remain neutral in situations like this. Taking a stance against AWU is no more appropriate than taking a stance against <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan_University_934b.html" title="Wesleyan University">Wesleyan University</a> (except that Wesleyan rips people off by a lot more money). If you wish to resolve this issue, then it needs to be done in an NPOV way. This is nothing like the removal of copyright violations.

I believe Anthony's post of 20:10 14 Nov is exactly correct. I sympathise with Dpbsmith's concern, but it's not for Wikipedia to judge. This is a problem of google's making. Perhaps Dpbsmith could write to them and ask that they fix this institution's page rank. There are other pages google does not list, are there not? He could ask google to censor AWU. I'm not sure we should. If we do not allow a link to AWU, then there should be no links to personal or promotional pages of any subject of this encyclopaedia, because the likelihood is each will be offensive to <i>someone</i>.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 23:01, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>What we need is a way to allow links to be still live, but marked as NOINDEX. The questions here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>can we do this, technically?</li>
<li>what syntax should we use to denote this?</li>
<li>is there enough of a desire to do this amongst the community to justify a developer's time or interest?</li>

<p>Supposing people are constantly walking through my house to drink from my kitchen tap. I don't care about the water they use up, but I do care about the mud they bring in on their shoes. I don't want to lock my front door. So I turn off the tap, so that people no longer have that reason to walk through the house.</p>
<p>The point is not to improve Google. The point is to protect Wikipedia. We would not hide links from Google in order to improve Google's accuracy, because that's not our problem. But even if we don't care about Google's rankings, others do, and they will use Wikipedia as a tool to do that. This will have a bad effect not just on Google (which we don't care about) but on Wikipedia (which we do) because external links will become less informative as advertisers try to cram them into articles everywhere. So the proposal is to hide some links from Google so as to remove this motivation from advertisers.</p>
<p>However, doing it by hand via services like tinyurl seems like clearly the wrong thing - and it's not clear to me that it will work, either. The only proper fix to this is to hide all external links. This requires a change to Wikipedia's codebase; each link should redirect to a page within Wikipedia, which is marked NOINDEX, which redirects on to the desired page. <a href="../../../c/i/p/User%7ECiphergoth2_2d5c.html" title="User:Ciphergoth2">ciphergoth</a> 12:41, 2004 Nov 23 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This would only work if you force the forks to link through Wikipedia as well, which seems like something Google wouldn't appreciate. In any case, I think it's better than selectively removing some links and not others based on whether or not we approve morally of those links. On the other hand, I think the best solution is to just remove links which serve no purpose other than advertising. In the case of AWU, we're increasing the liklihood of someone finding the home page for American World University by searching for "American World University". So what? <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> 警告 16:32, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If the link is valid I think it has more value than harm. If it improves ranking and the link is valid the improvement in ranking is justified. If the link was not valid or appropriate then the improvement is not, so we should remove the invalid inappropraite ones and leave the valid ones. Dagimar</p>

<dd>You did remove them when you changed them into an image. Your new change, utilizing tinyurl, is less harmful, but I still think it's POV to intentionally boost links to one site at the expense of another. Furthermore, I don't think your change will work the way you intend it to. Tinyurl returns a 302, and google will follow the 302 and boost the pagerank of the linked-to page, not tinyurl. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> 警告 20:02, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The issue of promotional links is similar to the issue of deleting copyright violations, which we delete even if they are factual and encyclopedic. We customarily remove link spam from unrelated articles. However, it does seem as if an article that is about AWU should have an easily followed reference to AWU's website.</p>
<p>The original reason for deleting this article was that it was advertising, which is considered a valid reason for deletion. Many of us believe that the purpose of the article's creation was to promote AWU.</p>
<p>The issue is not with relevant external links placed by editors of pages in general. The issue relates to a specific technical issue. A factor in the Google weighting of sites, originally one of the most important factors, was links from other sites, which were in effect assumed to be independent endorsements of the value of the site. The existence of open Wikis allows the system to be gamed, by allowing people to directly place links to their own sites on Wikis. Because Wikipedia is relatively important, such links have relatively great weight.</p>
<p>This is a growing issue and the systematic exploitation of Wikis in this way is already occurring: see <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2004/06/04/wikis_the_next_frontier_for_spammers.html" class="external text" title="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2004/06/04/wikis_the_next_frontier_for_spammers.html" rel="nofollow">Wikis the next frontier for spammers</a> and <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2004_06_01_index.html#108608909046269742" class="external text" title="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2004_06_01_index.html#108608909046269742" rel="nofollow">Nigritude Ultramarine and the Wiki Sandbox Effect</a>.</p>
<p>I feel very strongly that we need to find ways to make it unattractive to use Wikipedia in this way. I really don't see how there can be any serious objection to the use of a tinyurl link, since it does not change the appearance or the functionality of the page. The page is exactly as useful to our readers as it was before. I personally have no objection to the substitution of tinyurl links anywhere, in the George W. Bush article or the John F. Kerry article or anywhere. To show the sincerity of this remark, I've replaced the direct link to my personal web page at <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">User:Dpbsmith</a> with a tinyurl substitute.</p>
<p>Refining this, yes, the page text should contain HTML comments that are a) not quite valid URLs but b) allow the original URL to be recovered in the event of a tinyurl failure, although my guess is that the longevity of tinyurl is likely to be quite comparable to the longevity of any particular link. I would suggest considering tinyurl as a stopgap and seeing whether the developers would consider engineering a similar feature as part of MediaWiki, running on our WikiMedia servers under WikiMedia control.</p>
<p>I ask that <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a>, <a href="../../../l/3/3/User%7EL33tminion_371f.html" title="User:L33tminion">User:L33tminion</a>, and <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> as a personal courtesy to me, let me have my way with this particular edit on this particular page.

I have no intention of using tinyurl links on a large scale, only in rare cases comparable to this one.</p>
<p>(Does anyone have any better ideas on how we can serve our readership without promoting AWU's self-serving goals?)</p>
<p>There are no rules about such things, but this would be a act of kindness which I would appreciate.

<p>Some of them allow you to select the substitute link.</p>
<p><i>The existence of open Wikis allows the system to be gamed, by allowing people to directly place links to their own sites on Wikis.</i> This is google's problem, not ours. <i>Because Wikipedia is relatively important, such links have relatively great weight.</i> And I suspect they've already resolved it, by treating google as a link farm. <i>I have no intention of using tinyurl links on a large scale, only in rare cases comparable to this one.</i> If we used tinyurl for every single link, this would be acceptable. But doing it only in rare cases is precisely the problem. Wikipedia must remain neutral in situations like this. Taking a stance against AWU is no more appropriate than taking a stance against <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wesleyan_University_934b.html" title="Wesleyan University">Wesleyan University</a> (except that Wesleyan rips people off by a lot more money). If you wish to resolve this issue, then it needs to be done in an NPOV way. This is nothing like the removal of copyright violations. There is no law against "diploma mills", let alone a law against linking to them. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> 警告 20:10, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and please don't tout your improvements to this article and ask for special consideration after you voted against this article being undeleted and voted to have it deleted again.

I believe Anthony's post of 20:10 14 Nov is exactly correct. I sympathise with Dpbsmith's concern, but it's not for Wikipedia to judge. This is a problem of google's making. Perhaps Dpbsmith could write to them and ask that they fix this institution's page rank. There are other pages google does not list, are there not? He could ask google to censor AWU. I'm not sure we should. If we do not allow a link to AWU, then there should be no links to personal or promotional pages of any subject of this encyclopaedia, because the likelihood is each will be offensive to <i>someone</i>.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 23:01, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>What we need is a way to allow links to be still live, but marked as NOINDEX. The questions here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>can we do this, technically?</li>
<li>what syntax should we use to denote this?</li>
<li>is there enough of a desire to do this amongst the community to justify a developer's time or interest?</li>

<p>Supposing people are constantly walking through my house to drink from my kitchen tap. I don't care about the water they use up, but I do care about the mud they bring in on their shoes. I don't want to lock my front door. So I turn off the tap, so that people no longer have that reason to walk through the house.</p>
<p>The point is not to improve Google. The point is to protect Wikipedia. We would not hide links from Google in order to improve Google's accuracy, because that's not our problem. But even if we don't care about Google's rankings, others do, and they will use Wikipedia as a tool to do that. This will have a bad effect not just on Google (which we don't care about) but on Wikipedia (which we do) because external links will become less informative as advertisers try to cram them into articles everywhere. So the proposal is to hide some links from Google so as to remove this motivation from advertisers.</p>
<p>However, doing it by hand via services like tinyurl seems like clearly the wrong thing - and it's not clear to me that it will work, either. The only proper fix to this is to hide all external links. This requires a change to Wikipedia's codebase; each link should redirect to a page within Wikipedia, which is marked NOINDEX, which redirects on to the desired page. <a href="../../../c/i/p/User%7ECiphergoth2_2d5c.html" title="User:Ciphergoth2">ciphergoth</a> 12:41, 2004 Nov 23 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This would only work if you force the forks to link through Wikipedia as well, which seems like something Google wouldn't appreciate. In any case, I think it's better than selectively removing some links and not others based on whether or not we approve morally of those links. On the other hand, I think the best solution is to just remove links which serve no purpose other than advertising. In the case of AWU, we're increasing the liklihood of someone finding the home page for American World University by searching for "American World University". So what? <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_DiPierro_ebfd.html" title="User:Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> 警告 16:32, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If the link is valid I think it has more value than harm. If it improves ranking and the link is valid the improvement in ranking is justified. If the link was not valid or appropriate then the improvement is not, so we should remove the invalid inappropraite ones and leave the valid ones. Dagimar</p>

<dd>I agree with anthony. If we're going to have an article on this, we should link to it.
