<p>Many "citation needed" notes were added where citations already existed in the article. I prefer to place citations at the end of sentences, not in the middle of sentences unless necessary. For instance, the fact that <i>Classmates</i> was the first feature released by Biograph, and that it was released in February 1914, can be found in <i>The American Film Institute Catalog of Motion Pictures</i>, volume F1, which is already cited at the end of the sentence. — <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalloon_5060.html" title="User:Walloon">Walloon</a> 00:19, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>With your citations and general cleanup, the article now looks to be in much better shape. I've removed the cleanup tag. --<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGraemeL_c5a8.html" title="User:GraemeL">GraemeL</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGraemeL_c70d.html" title="User talk:GraemeL"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 16:50, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know the article is not under "Cleanup" now, but I found a couple of minor misquotes and inaccuracies.</p>
<p>1. On ref#3, I inserted the exact quote from the webpage that it quotes from.</p>
<p>2. Where it talks about Selig Polyscope, I came across the book</p>
<p>Biograph Bulletins, 1895-1908 pp 262 Published by film historian Kemp Niver 1971, Locare Research Group</p>
<p>I couldn't add the link to the "References" section, maybe one of you can.</p>
<p>Thanks DanP</p>

<dd>The new company is not a revival of the old company, despite what the new company would like to claim. It has the same name, but no transfer of title, trademarks, stock, physical assets, real estate, or intellectual property was involved. The new company took a trademark (the "AB" in a circle) that had fallen into the public domain from disuse, and registered it as their own. The old Biograph was made a division of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Consolidated_Film_Industries_d580.html" title="Consolidated Film Industries">Consolidated Film Industries</a> in 1928, and CFI is still in business. As for Selig Polyscope, it's not clear what you are disputing. Are you saying that Selig did not make movies in the Los Angeles area in 1908-1909, or that they did not open a studio in Los Angeles in 1909? — <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalloon_5060.html" title="User:Walloon">Walloon</a> 21:00, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On the first line, where in a reference does it state the new company was formed in 1987? Just confused here, because the website doesn't state that.</dd>

<dd>In the second, I'm not disputing anything about Selig making films on those dates. I found reference that said Biograph had been in Los angeles in 1906 prior to any known motion picture company, and this appeared in the Biograph Bulletins book, published in 1971.</dd>

<dd>I have a question on adding information on the old company. I supplied a reference stated above about the company being in LA in 1906 with verified reference and it has still not been posted. I confirmed this again in the book mentioned. I am really getting a spooky feeling about this. When I have time I am going to re-edit and include the verified information. I am currently investigating other film related articles as well, but this is getting weird. Any wiki-editors please let me know which way to go here. I was under the impression anyone can add verifiable information.</dd>

<p>All printed evidence (and I've supplied it) says that CFI acquired the Biograph Company itself, not just its labs and studio (which were owned by Empire Trust Company). You still haven't provided evidence of your claim that CFI acquired only the Biograph studio and labs. As it is now, the article has footnotes with sources that contradict statements made in the body of the article. Unless you provide the evidence to back up your claim, the article will be reverted to state that CFI acquired the entire Biograph Company. — <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalloon_5060.html" title="User:Walloon">Walloon</a> 23:32, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Walloon; I don't want to waste anyones time, nor stay on a subject that is nothing more than merely a paragraph in history. However, we do need to make sure things are correct. In response to your statement(s) the evidence of CFI acquiring only the Biograph studio and labs is in all the references. All information supplied shows the studio/laboratory facilites were acquired by CFI after the acquisition from Empire Trust cCmpany (Except for the footnote in Tuska's book)and no mention of transference of intellectual/real properties from the actual company, only the studio/laboratory facilities itself that were purchased. I supplied the information and utilized your references as well, including the New York Times and Jon Tuska's book.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I will insert all the items of reference again:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(a) The last trade of Biograph stock was reported by The New York Times on December 27, 1928, p. 39. (No transference of Biograph Company properties, intellectual or otherwise, or any mention of intellectual or real property transference to CFI.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(b) "Screen News Here and in Hollywood", The New York Times, September 27, 1939, p. 29. Empire Trust Company, one of Biograph's creditors, had acquired the <i>Bronx Studio</i>, but retained Biograph to manage it. (Again, in italics, mentions "<i>Bronx Studio</i>" nothing of any acquisition or transference of properties from company).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(c)Jon Tuska's book; The Vanishing Legion: A History of Mascot Pictures, 1927-1935, 42, Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland &amp; Company. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0786407492</a>. (This mention of "Biograph" in the book was explained to me by the Author).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again, no records indicating any kind of transference of intellectual and or real properties. The only items mentioned were the actual studio and laboratory facilities. On the clariification of Tuska's book, would I need to call him again and get a letter from him stating what he told me. Also, on your end, a verification of transfer of ownership or merging of intellectual properties , real properties etc. from the old company itself to CFI is needed (This is of course excluding the actual studio/laboratories which were purchased by CFI).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If we can find that the actual company was transferred, or transference of intellectual/real properties to CFI, then there is no problem (And, I have no problem) in changing it back to your original version. On another note, unfortunately, I do not have alot of time, the lecture circuit has been busy, so I cannot give full attention to Wikipedia on a daily basis. But, I will be checking in as frequently as possible, so we can take time on this small subject. Again, I am interested more in old studio facilities than this article.</dd>

<dd>I just wanted to make small mention of an edit I did to this article, as well as editing other film companies articles. Not just their history, I am now interested in content as well. I was informed by editor <b>Dpbsmith</b> of certain Wikipedia policies that I was actually unaware of. He stated "According to longstanding policy, Wikipedia is not a crystal ball and is not for promoting forthcoming media releases. The material should not be reinserted until sources meeting <b>WP:RS</b> can be cited that show that the product a) exists, b) has received enough mainstream press coverage to establish notability, and c) can be clearly connected to the 'Subject' itself". On a side note, strangely, I found this "Promotion" all over Wikipedia, unchallenged (Which I will be working on). Continuing, this is why the editor <b>Dpbsmith</b> removed the reference to <b>Wireless Mutoscopes</b> since the editor claimed it was a "Future" reference, and only one press release for reference. Because of this, I researched the Biograph article to see anything else, and found an inclusion on "Biograph on the Moon", which 1) No link to the "Biograph Moon" inclusion, 2)It was used as a "Crystal Ball" to portray and promote something forthcoming, and 3) has received not enough mainstream press coverage to establish notability. Therefore I deleted it. However, the inclusion was republished with an archived link. I just need assistance, because this confuses me, is contradicting to what <b>Dpbsmith</b> stated, and the longhstanding <b>WP:RS</b> Wikipedia policies. I will investigate and contact Wikipedia, but any other help by any of the editors is greatly appreciated.

<dd>The sentence "In 2003, Biograph announced that it had acquired title to 1,777 acres on the Moon for use as a filming location, and Thomas R. Bond II stated that he planned to start filming there by 2008" probably can be deleted. Assuming you take it at face value, the acquisition of lunar real estate took place in 2003 and is thus not "crystal ball" territory. <i>Strictly</i> speaking the plans to start production there in 2008 are a <i>statement</i> made by Bond in 2003. But the point is that none of these plans are important enough to have been described in 2003 in any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. The source given is just Biograph's own press release, which doesn't meet the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> guidelines.</dd>

<p>Actually, it is very clear. Not only was there not a "complete sale" of "all the assets", there was <i>no</i> sale of assets — because there were no assets to transfer, as the article says. All of Biograph's film copyrights expired by the 1940s, were not renewed, and entered the public domain (yes, I have researched this, check the footnotes to the article).

<dd>Roger, Walloon has not done anything unusual that I notice. He removed something with citations that back up his statements. If you think it is unclear that there was a complete sale of assets of the company, you should find a citation that backs up that statement. You should be talking with Walloon on this page to sort this out. It is not the role of administrators to be the arbiters of truth. I have no knowledge about this subject. My view is that I see editors working in good faith to improve this article. What I don't see is your effort to discuss this with Walloon. It is very normal for things to be removed from articles because they are uncited and contradict other information. When this happens, and you think the removal is in error, consider it a challenge to find a source that corroborates the information that was removed. If you find the source return the material with a citation. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 01:24, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Samuel, thank you for your time and input. I am concentrating on another article at the moment, but I will do just that. I also will put the article up for peer review. By this, others as well can join in with thier input, which will free me to do other things. Also, what citations and references will be valid, and acceptable to Wikipedia policies? If I find a legitimate, verifiable citation and that is removed as well, let me know the next step is on what to do. I understand you must be neutral, and I appreciate the guidance you have given me.</dd>

<dd>Nowehere in the current article does it say that the Biograph Company went out of business in 1928. If you'll look back on the history of the article and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Biograph_Studios" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Biograph_Studios" rel="nofollow">discussion page</a> for the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biograph_Studios_57da.html" title="Biograph Studios">Biograph Studios</a> article, you'll see that I am the person who kept insisting that the Biography Company did NOT go out of business in 1928, and you, Roger the Red, were the one who kept insisting that it DID go out of business in 1928. I quoted a <i>New York Times</i> article (September 27, 1939, p. 29) that said,
<dl>
<dd>The Biograph Studio in the Bronx will suspend operations on Saturday, it was learned yesterday. . . . The studio, which is owned by the Empire Trust Company, has been operated for seven years by Biograph, a subsidiary of Consolidated Film Industries, Inc.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>You objected to that. I quoted from the book <i>The Vanishing Legion: A History of Mascot Pictures, 1927-1935</i> (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0786407492&amp;id=IVtAfjvRl74C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=biograph+yates&amp;sig=4t8yECJwjs0qDkM6G1UHyQR1Dpc" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0786407492&amp;id=IVtAfjvRl74C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=biograph+yates&amp;sig=4t8yECJwjs0qDkM6G1UHyQR1Dpc" rel="nofollow">p. 42</a>) that Herbert Yates' Consolidated Film Industries gained a majority interest in the Biograph Company in 1928, and you objected to that too. The Wikipedia article as it is currently worded reflects your changes,
<dl>
<dd>When the Biograph Company fell on financial hard times, the studio facilites were acquired by one of Biograph Company's creditors, the Empire Trust Company, although Biograph Company continued to manage the studio Herbert Yates acquired the Biograph Company Studios and Film laboratory facilities in 1928. Biograph Studios in the Bronx was made a subsidiary of his Consolidated Film Industries in 1928.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The films remained at Biograph Studio in the Bronx from 1913 to 1939. When the Bronx studio was closed in 1939, the films were donated to the MOMA. The article and its footnotes DO explain what became of the company's principal assets: (1) films, (2) copyrights, (3) Bronx studio (4) film lab. I admit that the article does not currently explain what became of the company's registered trademarks (as state above, expired in the '40s) or the Los Angeles studio (as stated above, sold circa 1917). I can easily add that additional info to the article. — <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalloon_5060.html" title="User:Walloon">Walloon</a> 06:17, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am thinking that the material about the release of new and historical mutoscope films for viewing on cell phones ought to be deleted on the principle that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>.

<p>Admittedly the next sentence seems to contradict this by saying "you <i>now</i> can download short films called "Mutoscopes" from your local wireless carrier," but unless someone cares to give a verifiable source citation for the cell carriers offering them and a list of the titles offered, I am skeptical.</p>
<p>I think this is another effort at promotion (much like the claim that Biograph has leased land on the Moon and will be producing a film there in 2007).</p>

From my research, four have been produced and viewed, so there is actual verification that it is actually a done deal, unlike speculation on the "Moon" lot, which is definately presumption. On this note, any editors with any questions can leave messages. If this is the case, then it needs to be included on this page as well as the "Mutoscope" article.</dd>

<dd>This is a very low budget play which hoped to leverage a very old name into some mega funding. There is zero relationship between the original Biograph and this business. Although the website claims to have "licensed" the old Biograph library to the Library of Congress for "non-profit" use, it all fell into the public domain decades ago. The bit about a motion picture lot on the moon is transparent, meaningless hype: International law doesn't support the private control of property on the moon. Moreover, the dates the company claimed for putting a camera on the moon have come and gone (no surprise). <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwen_Gale_1eec.html" title="User:Gwen Gale">Gwen Gale</a> 09:47, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, I have been busy on othe projects but did happen to peruse this information, but happen to come across this again, and could not help but input. Although all valid contributions are welcome, the above statement is mainly an opinion rather than a verifiable fact. This is fine for the discussion page, but not for inclusion in the actual article. I am refering to the statement <i>"This is a very low budget play which hoped to leverage a very old name into some mega funding."</i> and...<i>"The bit about a motion picture lot on the moon is transparent, meaningless hype"</i> Again, an opinion, no matter if the claim is valid or invaild. I strive to keep neutrality as much as possible. As far as the "Old Downtowner" news article, it was changed and paraphrased in which I reverted it back to what the article actually said. If a quote is made, it has to be acurate and word for word. Also, this was posted in the "Wirelss Entertainment" discussion, rather then the GENERAL article discussion. On a funny note, yes the moon item is "Out there" but what is humorous as well is the artcile states that a camera will be on the moon in 2008, which your response was <i>"the dates the company claimed for putting a camera on the moon have come and gone (no surprise)."</i>. I didn't know it was 2009 yet?

<dd>I am now editing myself for repetition. So I will not be repetative, I have changed in "New Company" section "a new corporation" to "started the California corporation[19]" so it is not repetative with the inclusion at the top of the article which states "A new company with the same name started in 1991". Another "Oops!" I forgot to log in at the library when minor change was made. Hopefully now, there may be a glimmer of hope for this already moshed article.</dd>

<p>On the "Biograph" article, which I am thouroghly sick of, there has to be a deletion of repetative material. This article is up for peer review as well as with Wiki-Film. It is acceptable to be clear but have everything in this article stated ONCE, not two, or three times. This is idiotic and makes the article look like a 3rd grade essay. Notice the "B" grading. There are also more references and citations in this one article than any other film article on Wikipedia. This is why I have a morbid curiosity on this. I have little time and on here very little, but when I am, I will make contributions. --Roger the red 20:41, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am not only briefly working on amiguous inclusions, but "Double Entires". First on the "Biograph article which states at top of article "&gt;i&gt;...A new company with the same name was incorporated in California in 1991.[3]". It also states in the "New Company" section "<i>...started a new California corporation</i>[19]" Both these go to the same reference point and are in all ways identical. In my next edit, I will be including only ONE entry, "'...started a new California corporation in 1991'" as all references should be. The "new" is included in the inclusion, as well as a correct reference to the corporation reference listing. --<a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERoger_the_red_3e12.html" title="User:Roger the red">Roger the red</a> 00:06, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It is necessary to have some mention of the new company in the intro, whose purpose is to give an overview of the article.

<dd>Then if it is to be there, it needs to refer to it as a corporation, since the reference link goes to the California corporations website. Also, at least it looks better in the article. I will go ahead and make this change and see if that is acceptable.</dd>

<p>There is no requirement under Wikipedia policy for removal of tags if one editor demands removal. Each tag as you should know is individual unto itself and removing all tags is not acceptable and removal of all tags would result in a report to Wikipedia administration. The article is conflicting, confusing and at best hard to read and understand. These are the first tags on this article that will remain on this article. The "Dispute" tag is for conflicting sources, and as Wikipedia administration puts it "Hogging" the article. The disputes are on "Factual accuracies" and conflicting sources on many accounts. The verifiability of this article is dubious at best. The "Naeutrality is in question which is obvious on the "Archived" talk pages of this article. Also, please take note that this article has not been changed at all. The tags are there for other editors besides yourself to edit and contribute. These will be revealed and to the general editors community when I have time to assimilate the vast amount of information. Until then, I invite other editors to edit and contribute. I would hate to take this to arbitration but I will if need be. Also, I have edited Gaumont, Pathe and other articles. I also have tags on these with no responses as of yet, just this one which seems to stir an unusual amount of attention. To fully answer your question, I suggest you visit the talk page and my talk page, contact our AMA <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>Tutmosis</small></a>, and when I am back from my tour (In a week or so) there will be plenty to discuss.<br />

<dd>It isn't enough to say that there are conflicting sources you need to say what the conflicts are. You put those tags up last month and haven't engaged in any discussion of them.

<dd>Roger the red seems to have plenty of time to post complaints. If he's too busy to edit here then the POV dispute tags aren't relevant. If you'd like to figure out what his complaint it we can address it. Everytime I ask him he just says it's already been described. Just posting a POV tag and refusing to say why is called "hit and run tagging". As I said above, I'm certainly willing to wait another week. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 03:52, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
