<p>Daviodd, your most recent change puts these creatures in a different family than in the taxobox. Did you mean "family" informally? Or are there various classifications or what? Either way the article is now ambiguous. <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">Pete/Pcb21</a> <a href="../../../p/c/b/User_talk%7EPcb21_f99a.html" title="User talk:Pcb21">(talk)</a> 14:35, 6 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>A previous edition had begun to lump "diet" and "dangerousness of alligators" into "Anatomy", a practice that allows the great vice of rambling within one section. I chose to separate those aspects of alligators into sections.</p>
<p>The same edition overstated the danger that the American alligator poses to humans. A fatal allogator attack upon humans seems to happen about once every five years in Florida, which is surely far less than fatal dog attacks and especially snakebites. To be sure, dogs are far more common than are alligators even in Florida, but still, people wouldn't be moving into Florida if alligators posed the extreme danger that the saltwater and Nile crocodiles that certifiably hunt Man as prey. An alligator attack is to be avoided due to the severity of injuries, but so is a dog attack or especially a bite from a venomous snake. One fatal attack was to a girl who chose to protect her pet dog, the likely first object of the alligator's intention.</p>
<p>The rarity of fatal attacks by alligators in Florida indicates that alligators aren't hunting people as food. One case involved a girl protectinmngh Large alligators could hunt Man as prey; so could dogs, which also attack and kill animals larger than humans and are almost as unfussy eaters as alligators. "Extremely dangerous"? Not quite, unless one already has a stronger superlative for such creatures as bears, big cats, giant constrictor snakes, venomous creatures, and some sharks.</p>
<p>Alligator attacks have a statistically slight chance of happening to persons in Florida, the state with the highest concentration of alligators. Snakebites and even lightning strikes, let alone crime and motor vehicle accidents, are more likely killers than are alligators, which generally know well enough to leave humans alone. --66.231.38.97 19:06, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Would it be appropriate to start a new page for the albino alligator? Although its still an American Alligator, I think it is different enough to warrent a seperate page? Thoughts?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I dont think that a seperate page is needed but I have added a picture and some information here, although it could do with being expanded. --<a href="../../../d/s/w/User%7EDSWebb_7ab5.html" title="User:DSWebb">DSWebb</a> 18:01, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The American alligator has been a confirmed permanant resident of the Memphis, Tennessee area; therby, extending the previously recognized distribution range by a considerable amount. Would be interested in seeing an updated range map.</p>
<p>Also, an albino alligator page would be cool. I remember seeing an albino alligator at the Cincinnati Zoo; is it still there?</p>
<p>And one last thing that I think might be interesting, some discussion or information regarding alligators that exist far from their normal range; for instance, I know that there have been several alligators captured in the Cincinnati area; rumor has it that they migrated up the Ohio River and found warm micro-climates in the Ohio River distributaries, such as the Miami River, that have significant protection due to the large north to south oriented river hills in the region which act as baffles to cold winter winds. Apparently, these creatures have the ability to adapt and possibly make small reproducing pockets well outside of their normal range. I don't know if they would live in sewers though as the Ney York tales tell, probably too dirty and with the lack of sunlight the gators would surely suffer from a considerable vitamin D dificiency.</p>

<p><b>Size</b> An article about the heaviest (1,043 lb/473 kg, length 13 ft 10½ in/4.23 m) Floridan specimen caught in the wild can be found <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEEDC1F39F932A25756C0A96F948260" class="external text" title="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEEDC1F39F932A25756C0A96F948260" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You can find a mention <a href="http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/natsci/HERPETOLOGY/NEWSLETTER/news163c.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/natsci/HERPETOLOGY/NEWSLETTER/news163c.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> (end of page) of the longest measured specimen in Florida (14 ft 5/8 in or 428.3 cm). I don't know if this figures have been exceeded outside Florida, but I'd assume these specimen are a good representation of the true maximum size. The late great <a href="http://www.news-press.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060623/NEWS0105/606240303/1075" class="external text" title="http://www.news-press.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060623/NEWS0105/606240303/1075" rel="nofollow">Superman</a>, a captive specimen, was reportedly much heavier at 1,500 lb (680 kg, length 14 ft/4.3 m), but I'd like to see more accurate figures for this one – the weight seems too much like a rough estimate. At least I know it was once measured 13 ft 7½ in (4.15 m) long, while still alive.</p>
<p>I doubt that the claimed 19 ft 2 in (5.84 m) Louisianan individual (some details can be found <a href="http://www.gatorbeach.com/gatorfacts.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.gatorbeach.com/gatorfacts.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>) is taken seriously among modern scientific community. Based on a few weighed and measured large specimen, I got a (rather variable) length/weight ratio of 3.4–6.2 kg/m<sup>3</sup> (8.7 for "Superman"), which would suggest a weight within 1,500–2,700 lb (680–1,200 kg) range for this particular individual. This would be spectacularly large even for a <a href="../../../s/a/l/Saltwater_Crocodile_3bff.html" title="Saltwater Crocodile">Saltwater Crocodile</a>, a significantly larger species on average.</p>
<p><b>Longevity</b> The suggested lifespan of 30 years is rather coservative, as alligators have lived more than twice as long in captivity. <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=51022" class="external text" title="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=51022" rel="nofollow">Guinness World Records</a> recognizes a 66 year-old female that died on September 26, 1978 in <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adelaide_Zoo_f539.html" title="Adelaide Zoo">Adelaide Zoo</a>, Australia.

<dd><i>"The temperature at which alligator eggs develop determines their sex. Those eggs which are hatched in temperatures ranging from 90–93 °Fahrenheit (32.2–33.8 °C) turn out to be male, while those in temperatures from 82–86 °Fahrenheit (27.7–30 °C) end up being female.

<p>This wording is ambiguous. Does this mean</p>

<li>a male egg will only hatch at 90-93F, even though its gender was fixed at the time of fertilization; or</li>
<li>you can influence the gender of a fertilized egg by forcing it to hatch at a given temperature?</li>

<p>Interpretation (2) seems hard to believe. However, if (1) is true, the first sentence should read</p>
