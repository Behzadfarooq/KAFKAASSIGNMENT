<p><i>The herds formed the basis of the economies of local plains tribes who would attack the trains for plunder or during native vs. settler warfare.</i></p>
<p>I changed the above sentence, because I thougth it presented the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_02d7.html" title="Native Americans">Native Americans</a> in <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racist</a> fashion, making them look like a natural hazard, like the bison herds, instead of active participants of a political dispute over the land they inhabited. I also put it first in the list because I think that destroying the Native economy was the primary reason for the extermination of the bison herds. The political context of white <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonialism.html" title="Colonialism">colonialism</a> should not be left out, though it probably would need an article of its own.</p>
<p>--Timo Honkasalo</p>
<p>I disagree there are few records to suggest the bison hunt was subsidised. I think the extermination of the bison was influenced greatly by the aboriginal and MÃ©tis hunters as well as American hunters and traders responding to a market demanding industrial leather for the making of belts, smith aprons, gloves, gaskets and similar industrial products. I would like to know what effect the over hunting of the bison had on places like Indonesia, Singapore and the Congo Free State, where rubber plantations were built in the 1870's, around the same time bison leather supplies were becoming unreliable. I think this transition from bison leather to vulcanized rubber had a greater effect on the world then is considered.</p>

<p>Ok fair enough however my point is; bison hides were of great value durring the industiral revolution, and although some products could be make from cattle hide the toughest applications requiered a new material such as vulcanized rubber.</p>

<p>It is perfectly proper to refer to the American bison as buffalo. Check any dictionary. These animals were called buffalo long before the taxonomists gave them the name <i>bison</i> (which incidentally is not an English word but the Latin spelling for the Germantic word <i><a href="../../../w/i/s/Wisent.html" title="Wisent">wisent</a></i>).</p>

<dd>"Bison" is more precise; it refers only to the North American animal.</dd>
<dd>the <i>Bison bison</i>, and to the European bison, <i>Bison bonasus</i>.</dd>

<p>Bisons are not true buffalos, which exist in Africa and Asia. That's just the name people always call it.</p>

<dd>Take a look at their respective articles.

<p>The article implies that Yellowstone's herd was formed from transplated animals from the Bronx Zoo. That is only partially accurate. The animal never became extinct in the park; there was a small herd living there in 1890, but as its numbers were threatened, it was decided to stock the park with some zoo transplants as well. (I made a small edit to reflect this.)</p>
<p>Actually, it is entirely untrue that bison were brought in from the Bronx zoo. The bison that were brought in in 1902 were from the Goodnight herd in Texas and the Pablo/Allard herd in Montana, where the National Bison Range is now. reference:History of the Bison in Yelowstone National Park (1951) Skinner et. al.

<p>In a narrative about the American Bison, I think it is wrong to state that Bison can be homosexuals. Many male mammals will mount males as well as females but is this homosexuality? The term homosexual should relate to human behavior only. Humans can understand and choose this sexual preference if they desire. Animals do not have the cognizance for this any more than they have for hate, greed or any other human trait. Many young people use these pages for reference and should not be confused by verbage such as this. All statements relating to Homosexuality in any animal should be stricken from Wikipedia. (edit by anon user 66.157.90.190 2005-07-08 15:07)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry but I disagree with this 100%. Your assertion that homosexulality is a purely human trait seems to be based on the assumption that homosexuality is a choice. Homosexuality is a natural state in humans and there is increasing evidence it is natural in other mammals as well. Homosexuality is sexual relations with same gender. Nothing in there about humanity â the prefix "homo-" deriving from the greek for same "homos" (as in homogenous), not the latin for man (as in Homo Sapiens). The implications of saying that other mammals "lack cognizance" or are too stupid to tell the difference between males and females is just ludicrous. Please dont push political agendas by requesting that things that disagree with your own personal philosophy be removed from wikipedia, we have a policy of maintaing a <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Neutral Point of View</a>. <a href="../../../m/r/w/User%7EMrWeeble_4f64.html" title="User:MrWeeble">User:MrWeeble</a> <small>(who in the interests of full disclosure <i>is</i> homosexual and <i>didn't</i> "choose" to be so)</small> 23:46, 23 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the bigger question is whether we're talking about male bison who mount <i>exclusively</i> (or nearly exclusively) other males, or whether we're simply talking about overexcited animals that will mount anything vaguely resembling another bison. The first case would represent a homosexual bison. I would argue that the second case wouldn't. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGary_D_Robson_e7c8.html" title="User:Gary D Robson">Gary D Robson</a> 17:11, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The question can be addressed by discussing homosexual behaviour among bison, which is pretty clear: some male bisons mount other male bisons, so the have sex with members of the same sex as themselves. Unless there is evidence of bison who engage exclusively in homosexual behaviour, talking about homosexual bison would be incorrect. Deleting references to homosexual behaviour among bison would also be incorrect: young people do not learn if we hide facts from them. There is no Wikipedia policy that says that articles should be bowlderized. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 21:20, 6 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Has anyone more familiar with the species considered adding more information about typical reproductive habits? As it is, the discussion of homosexual behavior and "inter-sex" individuals rather overwhelms the rest of the information--information that probably has a broader appeal. Moreover, the comparison between the inter-sex bison and transsexuals seems a little out of place. I imagine there is a substantial difference between the biological condition and the psychological condition. --MLS</p>

It is thought by atleast some anthropologists that the Plains Culture, which did not exist prior to European-American contact, specifically Spanish-American contact, and the acquisition of horses by Native Americans, that the decimation of the buffalo began with the large scale hunting by Native Americans that hunting on horseback made possible. Most tribes that were not able to make a sure living on the plains prior to horseback hunting, migrated to the plains, causing a population explosion, and subsequent over-hunting of the bufffalo. This lasted about 200 years, all the while the buffalo population dwindling--coinciding with the rise and fall of the Plains Culture--until the near-extinction of the buffalo (which European encroachment probably only gave a coup de gras to). From my understanding, which I can cite sources for if I rewrite some of this article, guns and direct hunting by Europeans did not play a significant role because the guns available at the time were not as efficient as arrows from horesback. Natives Americans on horseback were far more efficient at killing the buffalo than Europeans in other words. --<a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrentt_2b51.html" title="User:Brentt">Brentt</a> 03:11, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There has been quite a lot of work done on the role of native people in the extinction of most of the large mammals in North America, with a very recent study associating such extinctions on one of the Carribean islands (Puerto Rico?) with its colonization six or seven thousand years ago, long after the mainland extinctions, so this could be put in that context also.

<dd>I have a ethonography that goes into quite a bit of detail of plains culture hunting techniques. Most of the hunting took place during a seasonal large scale hunt, in which a herd was circled by men on horses then they would br picked off with arrows(they didn't use guns because muzzle loaders, which although available, we're much less efficient, and more expensive than arrows, and they we're basically shooting a captive target since they we're surrounded and the buffalo tended to stay together in the circle). Because of this technique of killing off a whole herd in one seasonal hunt, the buffalo population was actually already dwindling significantly by the time Europeans started directly participating in hunts (Europeans we're trading plains peoples for buffalo products before Europeans we're actually participating in hunts, which I think was part of the impetus for such large scale hunts to take place--the statement in the article about native americans not "participating in commercial hunts" seems to be innacurate, as atleast some of the spoils of the hunt we're eventuall traded with Europeans--trade is commerce isn't it?).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also of interest is the fact that no tribes hunted buffalo as a primary means to make a living, and nobody lived in the interior of the plains, before the acquisition of horses from Europeans in the 1700s--as it wasn't a feasible way to make a living without horses. The plains culture was a result of the newly exploitable resource that horses made possible to benefit from. Thats why the plains culture was such a mish-mash of different cultures with only a basic common language used for trade which had no native speakers (the sign-langauge).</dd>

<p>Does bison have any natural enemies, one that takes on both adults as well as calves? I think it is an interesting point to be mentioned.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have seen videos of a wolf pack taking down a straggling cow in winter when the bison do not have the energy to fight back effectively as a herd. Therefore, I think the statement "Grizzly bears and packs of wolves may attempt to attack a young calf or subadult, but it's impossible for them to challenge a healthy adult." is bogus. If no one protests, I will edit out the last part of this sentance. Eco jake 17:09, 22 July 2006 (UTC)Eco Jake</dd>

First off, it doesn't seem (to me, anyway) particularly relevant what the many tribes who interacted with or depended on the bison called them. Secondly, there's only three names there, and none of them are sourced. It's been 7 months since this comment, and only two more words have been added, and I can't immediately find any real justification for leaving the section in, so I'm going to be bold and remove it for now. --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMiskwito_68c1.html" title="User:Miskwito">Miskwito</a> 00:25, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"The numbers are uncertain because the tests so far used mitochondrial DNA analysis, and thus would miss cattle genes inherited in the male line; most of the hybrids look exactly like purebred bison."</p>
<p>My understanding is that in bison/cattle interbreading a successful birth to a cattle cow is exceedingly rare if not impossible because of the large size of the calf. If this is true all are nearly all interspecies offspring would have a female bison and male cattle parent and thus inherit no cattle M-DNA. Either my understanding, which I believe is fairly common, is incorrect and may be worth addressing, or the validity of the M-DNA analysis sited is questionable.</p>

<dd>It appears to be true that crossing a male bison with a female cow isn't particularly successful <a href="../../../b/e/e/Beefalo.html" title="Beefalo">Beefalo</a> (which isn't particularly unusual when there is a significant size difference). On the other hand, bear in mind we're necessarily thinking of great success and it doesn't have to happen that often. Once you have a beefalo of whatever you want to call it with with cow m-dna this will spread through it's female offspring. In any case, since the results show a very high level of cow m-dna amongst bison and a low level of purebred bison, if anything the number of purebred is even smaller then we think <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 11:29, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does anyone have any information on any clashes between Grizzly bears and buffalo?--<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Gardner_6a49.html" title="User:Ryan Gardner">Ryan Gardner</a> 18:53, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just this:There are some photos circulating of a bison chasing off a potential grizzly attack. The photographer was Mike Tercek. <a href="http://www.miketercek.com" class="external free" title="http://www.miketercek.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.miketercek.com</a> -Kalanu</p>
<p>How can there be a clash, if at all, between a bison and a grizzly? The bison outclasses the bear in every way, strength and size. Trust me on this, there has never been a case of grizzly bringing down bison, those are the cases in which grizzly feeds on the carcasses of dead bisons, the observers just try to boast the strength of grizzly by this kind of exaggeration. If not convinced, you can spend your whole life with the bear and will not witness this, I assure. I really doubt if the bear has enough courage to take on a bison just to steal calf. Let alone bison, an adult moose is already too much for grizzly/Kodiak, all kinds of brown bear.</p>

<p>I suspect that the bison weight is only equal that of cape buffalo. Bison is taller at the shoulder, but c.buffalo has a stockire body. In fact, I got some pic of killed bison and cape buffalo, and my feeling is the cape is even larger than bison. Anyone agrees?</p>
