<p>My brother, Erik Schuessler, was a participant in another <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fremantle_Media_2e6f.html" title="Fremantle Media">Fremantle Media</a> production, The Complex. His Wikipedia entry was slated for deletion on the basis that it was insufficiently famous. The Complex was not even vaugely as popular as American Idol but was still a FOX production and aired on American prime time television. To me it raises the (biased in my case) question of whether my brother is or is not encyclopedically (is that a word?) famous. If not, where is the cutoff? At this point I've taken an acedemic interest in the matter beyond my own obvious nepotism. <a href="../../../e/a/n/User%7EEanschuessler_66fa.html" title="User:Eanschuessler">Ean</a> 23:24, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Great template for American Idol page.</p>
<p>However, not really necessary to add to each contestant's bio page especially if <i>American Idol</i> is linked on their page. The template is more about the show's history than the individual's. Otherwise, templates for <i>any</i> show (or whatever item mentioned in a bio) would be added to an individual bio page... cluttering the page.</p>

That's funny that it is as I came here more to ask the relevance of TV related junk in Wiki and Indymedia sites. I mean sheesh are we trying to create an alternative to the mainstream media or are we going to go along hum drum with all the junk they feed us? I say this article should be a canidate for deletion! American Idol has no bearing on my life and almost nothing to do with any others save some pop culture victims in North America.</p>
<p>On the other hand I can also see why it should remain as such shows represent the antithesis of the spirit of Wikipedia. Programming a very narrow and mainstream view of music/culture when they tell you it will be on the old television. Any thoughts?</p>

So, they will soon need to be included on the list of album sales. --<a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Grand_Roi_des_Citrouilles_0219.html" title="User:Le Grand Roi des Citrouilles">Le Grand Roi des Citrouilles</a> 02:12, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplate_namespace_8f91.html" title="Wikipedia:Template namespace">Templates</a> were used to show the elimination histories of contestants.

These templates are intended for these articles only. (A template should be designed for several articles.) This is not a good idea because whenever one of these articles is loaded, the server must load two files (the article and the template, not including other templates in the article).

<p>In the Controversy section the last sentence currently says that some in the media have speculated that Vegas Odds Makers have exerted influence to keep the prediction sites going, but in reality it has never been legal to bet on Americon Idol or anything of the sort in Las Vegas, so this statement seems foolish.

<p>There are significant portions of this article that do not meet the tone of an encyclopedia and use <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel</a> words to establish claims that are not referenced by any sourcing. I added a template to the most offensive section (Season 5) where the text includes phrasing like: <i>some</i> think this...and that is <i>widely regarded</i>. If those statements are true then sources need to be provided and the weasel words need to be replaced with something more accurate.</p>
<p>Secondly, I noticed a few claims about contestants and their histories within the text that are unsourced. Someone's brother was arrested? Another person was removed from the competition for XYZ? That's fine since it's all most likely true, but it needs to be sourced or it runs afoul of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> and should be removed.

<p>The article says it's broadcast on ITV2, but it's also on ITV1 because that's the channel I watch it on (I don't have ITV2)! I'm not sure if I should edit it to say it's broadcast on ITV1 <i>and</i> 2 because I don't know if the ITV1 and 2 broadcasts are the same.</p>
<p>The article also says; 'When the live shows begin next week, the version presented by Cat Deeley is expected to resemble American Idol Extra.' Well, the live shows have begun now - do the UK shows resemble American Idol Extra (I don't know what that is!) as expected?</p>

<p>The synopsis for each season are too obscenely long. Thats what the individual season articles are for. While we are at it, why do these synopsis follow the career of the winners post AI? The notable contestants already have their own articles - most especially the winners and runner-ups. Why is the "Controversies" section so large when AI controversies already have it's own page? This article also completely misses covering the history and development of the show which is pretty fascinating in itself.

<p>I am now having qualms about List of American Idol contestants, which I proposed to be deleted at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_American_Idol_contestants_f3dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of American Idol contestants">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of American Idol contestants</a>. Shortly after that article was deleted, a section in <a href="../../../a/m/e/Template%7EAmerican_Idol_eee2.html" title="Template:American Idol">Template:American Idol</a>, called "other notable alumni", popped up. I don't know if the two events are related, but I feel they are. The problem with the section in the template is we are proposing arbitrary criteria for a successful contestant. I could argue anybody who sells records or who has a significant fan base is notable. Here we are imposing our own criteria for notability as opposed to <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Wikipedia's guideline for notability</a>. A navigational template should have a sense of stability, and the constant addition and deletion of notable contestants gives a headache for those who maintain the template.</p>
<p>I would like to restore List of American Idol contestants, but only after a discussion here. Arguably, anybody who is selected to be shown on TV is notable. The producers like and choose to show a contestant based on how great or how poorly he or she performs. Since the show is popular and is discussed widely, the notoriety gained from even a 3-minute appearance (with name shown) is notable. There is a finite number of contestants who are shown on TV, so maintenance is not a problem. Additional notes on the contestamts (placement, record sales, notoriety, etc.) may also be added with the list, so that it is not a directory. (My own experiences with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Crew_of_Sesame_Street_f2e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Crew of Sesame Street">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Crew of Sesame Street</a> is also an influence in my decision.) A category doesn't always replace a list. Restoration of the article is <i>not</i> a replacement for the template section, but if the list is available, personal judgments on who is notable can be directed there. So I think if List of American Idol contestants is restored, the other notable alumni section will be unnecessary and not as controversial. <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 02:27, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agreed with the restoration, and full lists of anyone who showed up should be included, however, they should be linked to other media sites to prove their mention.
