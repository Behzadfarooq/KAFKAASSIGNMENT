<p>Paragraph should be deleted or rewritten entirely. While AAA could certainly warrant criticism, it needs to be factual and NPOV.</p>
<p>"AAA still lobbies the American federal government and state governments for increased spending on roads and automobile safety, and against gas taxes and emissions regulations." Sweeping generalization &amp; unsourced.</p>
<p>"For example, AAA lobbied against the 1990 Clean Air Act and various California emissions laws" Statement is not correct (AAA did and does support the Clean Air Act but not all facets of the proposed legislation), and citation does not contain verifiable source. Various emissions laws? Which ones?</p>
<p>"Their opponents argue that the AAA does not tell prospective members that it is a lobby group, and that the members join in order to have emergency towing privileges, not because they agree with the political positions of the organization, and that the AAA exploits their members' ignorance." Unsourced, inaccurate &amp; inflammatory rhetoric</p>
<p>The pargraph is basically an unsourced soapbox rant with an advert to an alternate auto club.24.27.202.53 20:57, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Amen. There are no sources whatsoever, and it's an ad for this "Better World" organization.Meersman 06:21, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are sources now. I added a 4th source in the place where a "citation needed" tag was placed and removed the "sources needed" tag. There are now more sources in that section than in the whole rest of the article. It's possible the article as a whole needs a "sources needed" tag but it seemes inappropriate to me to leave the sources needed tag on the one section with the MOST sources in the article. <a href="../../../p/l/y/User%7EPlymouths_dcb2.html" title="User:Plymouths">Plymouths</a> 21:03, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Also I'm totally confused at your criticism - I checked the history and as of Dec 19th (the day before your comment is dated) there were already THREE references in the criticism section. That's a far cry from "no sources whatsoever". If you're going to criticise the article could you maybe actually READ it before criticising? <a href="../../../p/l/y/User%7EPlymouths_dcb2.html" title="User:Plymouths">Plymouths</a> 21:09, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is this quote actually accureate? "Mississippi -- AAA Missouri, St. Louis, MO has jurisdiction over the state of Mississippi" Mississippi and Missouri don't even share a border, so I doubt very much that this is true. --<a href="../../../s/r/w/User%7ESrwm4_9488.html" title="User:Srwm4">Srwm4</a> 14:11, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, it is correct, according to their website. Several AAA clubs are connected even though they do not share borders -- like AAA Southern California and AAA Texas.â€” WordsmithCommunications 13:58, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Do we really need this giant list? It's confusing, isn't useful or encyclopedic content and would have to updated often as clubs merger. It doesn't matter if you are a AAA member and travel to Maine or Florida or Utah you can get the same AAA services across the country. So why would it matter to the general public which clubs control which areas? I sure whoever put that exhaustive list together is AAA employee.</p>

I am, personally, not exactly pleased with this agency. As a matter of fact, when I had been a member, I found their service to be less than advertized. However, Mr. Williams has presented a large amount of fascinating info., in a variety of interviews.</p>

<p>The Better World Club (yes, a competitor) notes in a recent newsletter that AAA has had a PR firm doing a lot of edits and adding material to this article. While the material is apparently factual, it still sounds like a great big AAA advertisement to me, what with listing all the offices and all the member services, etc. And it's getting pretty long, too. Anyone else get this impression? <a href="../../../z/_/w/User%7EZ_Wylld_4dbc.html" title="User:Z Wylld">Z Wylld</a> 14:40, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did a major re-word on the member benefits section to try to make it less advertising-speak. It could probably still use a little work. <a href="../../../p/l/y/User%7EPlymouths_dcb2.html" title="User:Plymouths">Plymouths</a> 21:08, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'd delete the list of benefits for 3 reasons:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>1. It is basically an ad. 2. The "benefits" listed are more of a benefit to AAA than the member. Take the example of "info on auto loans" cited, or the AAA credit card programs. AAA refers members to a bank for these services and receives a kickback when their members borrow or use the credit card. Gullible members believe that these offers are somehow unique or better for members; in fact, they are chosen solely on the size of the kickback going to AAA, both at the national and club level. 3. These "benefits" vary from club to club. Some clubs have programs unique to them, while other clubs reject programs offered by national to cut deals locally.</p>
<p>AAA is basically a direct marketing organization that works for the enrichment of its national management and the old-white-man boards of the constituent clubs. The roadside assistance is the carrot that gets the rubes in to be sold credit cards, overpriced car warranties, and batteries they probably don't need whenever they receive a jump.</p>
<p>I will try to edit this in the future, but will need to find 3rd party reliable sources to cite while describing the structure I've seen first-hand.Meersman 06:37, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think there does need to be a benefits section to give a general overview but I agree that some of the listings can be removed. People should be able to go to the article and learn "oh, ok, they'll tow my car or do my travel arrangements" but they don't need a lot of detail beyond that. <a href="../../../p/l/y/User%7EPlymouths_dcb2.html" title="User:Plymouths">Plymouths</a> 17:38, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've done a bunch of editing to the benefits section, including taking out a LOT of the listed benefits (leaving what I think are the basics), turning it into sentence form, and taking out all of the hyperbole. Do people think it is now sufficiently neutral to remove the "sounds like an ad" tag? <a href="../../../p/l/y/User%7EPlymouths_dcb2.html" title="User:Plymouths">Plymouths</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Well if I don't get a response in a few days I'm going to go ahead and remove it. If someone disagrees they can put the tag back. <a href="../../../p/l/y/User%7EPlymouths_dcb2.html" title="User:Plymouths">Plymouths</a> 22:37, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
