<p>We should certainly develop this into a more advanced entry. Sections should include an overview, history, organization of the school, campus, students and faculty, sports/clubs, traditions, noted alumni and noted faculty. Shall we divide and conquer?</p>
<p>For History The <a href="http://www.american.edu/about/history.html" class="external text" title="http://www.american.edu/about/history.html" rel="nofollow">AU website</a> offers a fairly good history, but it could certainly be rewritten. As well as a <a href="http://www.american.edu/tour/timeline.html" class="external text" title="http://www.american.edu/tour/timeline.html" rel="nofollow">timeline</a>. There is also some good information on the WWI and WWII era <a href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:RYJMfck7_2cJ:www.american.edu/arubin/wwii/AmericanHistory.htm+arubin+wwI+au&amp;hl=en" class="external text" title="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:RYJMfck7_2cJ:www.american.edu/arubin/wwii/AmericanHistory.htm+arubin+wwI+au&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The original website is gone, but the Google cache has it.</p>
<p>Any takers on working on this with me?</p>

<dd>Habemuswikkum, I reverted to the previous version before your changes. Be sure that when you include content, it follows the style and content guidelines set forth for Wikipedia.

<p>That technology section sounds a bit too much like it came from admissions.

<p>University Library. The library holdings include more than 780,000 volumes; 1 million microforms; 3,300 journals; 250 electronic resources; and 8,700 films, videos, and multimedia. The library provides individual carrels and group rooms for study. In addition to 35 ALADIN workstations and six CD-ROM workstations, a separate computer library and electronic classroom with 12 workstations is located on the lower level. In addition, the Music Library, housed in Kreeger Music Building, offers 35,000 recordings and more than 12,500 musical scores.</p>
<p>Law Library. The law library holds more than 500,000 volumes and 6,646 serial subscriptions.

<p>Given that the Business and Law section now contain many unrecognizable names, or businesspersons at companies that are not particularly well known, I think that the time has come to migrate the alumni to their own article.

<p>While I agree that saying AU is at the top of Embassy Row is a long-standing exaggeration, it does help provide some context as to the location of the campus to someone unfamiliar with Washington, DC streets.

<p>I think it would help. I know that when I first was thinking about attending AU, the location in DC was an issue- especially for my parents. I think that it reassures the applicant of the safety of the school if we include larger landmarks that are closer to AU. Plus, I think it is a really cool fact about AU. --<a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESenordesupremo_e562.html" title="User:Senordesupremo">Senordesupremo</a> 03:36, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Reassuring applicants" should not be a consideration for editing an encyclopedia article. Mentioning AU's location in DC near prominent national landmarks may be more noteable, particularly if such landmarks are particularly close to the campus or otherwise linked to the campus or its traditions or culture. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 03:42, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Point taken. I need to get into the 'encyclopedia' mindset. In terms of the landmarks being prevalent in AU's culture, I would say it is. I know many people from campus that intern in embassys, and the embassys themselves are active on the campus. I think that it is important to note the location of the campus, instead of the vague "located at Ward Circle" and "straddling these two neighborhoods of NW DC." Just my thought. --<a href="../../../s/e/n/User%7ESenordesupremo_e562.html" title="User:Senordesupremo">Senordesupremo</a> 03:49, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The undergraduate body at AU is made up of 62% females and only 38% males. The dating scene on campus is dismal for straight females. Head to the city for a dazzling difference. A student there explains...</p>
<p>“Oh, dear, didn’t anyone tell you? AU is overwhelmingly female, and the difference gets better or worse depending on the school you’re in. Of the small male population, a near majority are gay. However, don’t be too discouraged. They’re all nice, and the town is crawling with undergrads, Congressional staffers, interns, and law students. There is no shortage of eligible men, and they are indeed hot … East Coast style though. Be forewarned.”</p>
<p>from the <b>College Prowler</b> guidebook, <i>American University - Off the Record</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Great to know that <i>College Prowler</i> is publishing inaccurate statements. A near majority of the male population is <i>not</i> gay. There are no figures on that information. While the campus is more open to questions of gender identity and the university actively supports the community with the GLBT Resource Center, it is wholly inaccurate to frame the campus in that way. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparqMan_a449.html" title="User:SparqMan">SparqMan</a> 18:33, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just about all of the images on this page are going to be deleted soon. The article will then be in serious need of some pictures.

<p>It is understandable that AU <a href="../../../a/l/u/Alumnus.html" title="Alumnus">alumni</a> attempt to bulk up the article of their <a href="../../../a/l/m/Alma_mater.html" title="Alma mater">alma mater</a>, but this article needs to become more informative and feel less like a marketing piece. For example, being cited as a high tech campus in 1997 is not exactly a reason to explain why wireless devices can be used inside the library. Anyhow, pardon the dust as I attempt to apply NPOV. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparqMan_a449.html" title="User:SparqMan">SparqMan</a> 20:00, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Here is some information regarding Tenley Campus. The information was provided by Meghan Oakley, Assistant Director for Admissions of the Washington Semester program.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"American University purchased the Tenley Campus from Immaculata College, a Catholic girls' school, in 1987 <b>specifically for the Washington Semester Program</b>" (emphasis supplied).</i></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"Immaculata College was a Catholic girl's school with students from first grade through college. Until 1987, Capital Hall was the school's main building, then called Immaculata Hall, with the nuns living on the 4th floor and dorm rooms, classrooms, administrative offices, and a ballroom throughout the rest of the building. Federal Hall was called Loretta Hall and housed their library, science, math and other academic departments as well as the dining hall. Constitution was their gymnasium. Congressional was Marian Hall for the college students. Dunblane was the elementary school with classrooms and administrative offices."</i></p>

<p>In 2006, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Advocate_6682.html" title="The Advocate">The Advocate</a> ranked American University among the nation's top 20 schools for <a href="../../../l/g/b/LGBT_44e7.html" title="LGBT">LGBT</a> students <a href="http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbianactivism/a/TopColleges.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://lesbianlife.about.com/od/lesbianactivism/a/TopColleges.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, a fact that the university is proud of (see president's press release, cited under "faculty, student and staff developments" <a href="http://www.american.edu/president/statements/083006.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.american.edu/president/statements/083006.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>), and a fact which can help many LGBT students find a safe environment in which to study. Despite this, User:Danny <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Danny" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Danny" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> insists on deleting it from the "Other facts" section, as have other users in the past. This is vital information for some students, and it's something to be proud of. It's a great accomplishment. What's the big deal?</p>

<dd>I poked around on their website and it definitely did not appear to be common to use the article "The" as part of the institution's name. Maybe I didn't look hard enough or looked in the wrong places. If it *is* part of the institution's name then it definitely needs to be bolded in the lead and the article moved to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_American_University_531c.html" title="The American University">The American University</a> (with a redirect from this article, of course). --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 20:16, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The official, chartered name of the school is "The American University" (as it appears on the seal), while it is called "American University" for marketing purposes. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparqMan_a449.html" title="User:SparqMan">SparqMan</a> 20:18, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you can supply evidence supporting your assertion, then it seems to me that we should at a bare minimum (a) note the official name of the institution in the article and (b) move the article or at least create an appropriate redirection.</dd>
<dd>I also note that the institution is identified as "American University" in <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cool/SearchResults.aspx" class="external text" title="http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cool/SearchResults.aspx" rel="nofollow">IPEDS</a>. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 20:27, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And on that link you cited, it clearly states "The name of the university no longer includes the word <i>the</i>. It will be referred to in all university presentations and publications as <i>American University</i>." I've made a note of the former name in the first line of the article, and will correct all incorrect uses of the name. --<a href="../../../y/b/b/User%7EYbbor_df13.html" title="User:Ybbor">Ybbor</a><sup><a href="../../../y/b/b/User_talk%7EYbbor_dde6.html" title="User talk:Ybbor"><font color="green">T</font></a></sup> 21:25, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't believe the use of the article is a "former" name. Because the school was chartered with it in the name, it cannot officially change its name, while marketing materials (university presentations and publications) can use it without the article. Am I right? --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparqMan_a449.html" title="User:SparqMan">SparqMan</a> 21:42, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know the legalities involved, particularly of this case as the institution was chartered by congress which I suspect may complicate the issue. In any case, an official document from the institution clearly states that the name has been changed and that is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">good enough for me</a>. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 21:51, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think it's a question of their status as an institution but the legalities of changing the name of a corporation. I am under the impression that for a corporation, name is strongly tied to its legal identity. My area of expertise and education is higher education, though, not corporate law so I could be (and likely am) completely wrong. In any case, I think we're doing the right thing with this article by using the reference cited above. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 22:38, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
