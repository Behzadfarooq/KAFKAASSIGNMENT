<li>Delete. Advertising. Much better than as originally submitted, but I believe that the intent of the original submission was promotional and that the new article still is. "There is no such thing as bad publicity."

<li>What is POV is deleting an article because it is about something which Wikipedians aren't supportive of. Notoriety should be just as important as fame (and neither should be important at all, in my opinion).

<li>Keep: I actually think it's fairly NPOV. It presents the other side of the argument, points out that at least one state has sued it for fraudulently claiming to be a university.

<li>Again, I repeat, "there is no such thing as bad publicity."

<li>As it stands, there are plenty of diploma mills in this country; some of them have caused more of a ruckus than others; i.e. some of these mills have been in the newsmedia before for giving someone important a degree they didn't deserve (I seem to recall <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Swan_%28television_program%29_2513.html" title="The Swan (television program)">The Swan</a>'s "therapist" being berated for getting a diploma from a diploma mill. My point is, if a high profile case against this university can be brought to life, I'd vote keep. As it stands, the only example sounds like some random shmuck who got duped.

If we supply no link to its homepage we don't help its google rank, but can still supply information on this institution, and maybe prevent people from being duped by it. Most people who "enroll" in these "universities" know exactly what they're doing, but some naive souls actually think these are real online colleges, and their degrees will have merit. Those who want to buy a diploma will do so from this place or another, regardless of our article.
