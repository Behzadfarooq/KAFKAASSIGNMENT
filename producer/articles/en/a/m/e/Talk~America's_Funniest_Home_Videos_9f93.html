<p>I liked the article up until I got to that part. It's clearly opinionated and don't seem relevent to being in a encyclopedia. I don't like Bob Sagat either but alot of those comments should go elsewhere, probably in a imdb messageboard or review.--<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamstillhiro1112_6759.html" title="User:Iamstillhiro1112">User:Iamstillhiro1112</a> 05:26, 14 September 2006 (CST)</p>

<dd>Some of it may be opinon, but this is wikipedia, and the good thing about wikipedia is that it has information other encyclopedias wouldn't contain. I don't think pure conjecture should be on this page, but these are valid critcisms of an admittedly stupid little show.</dd>

<ul>
<li>The Bob Saget Episodes PWNED!!! Though they are good criticisms, whoever wrote that forgot that nowadays, they CONSTANTLY show stupid segments of, like, 20 videos of men somehow injuring their groin. Tom Bergeron and Disney came and messed this show up good (well, maybe more Disney than Tom, but Disney and ABC shouldn't be connected in the first place). To the guy above, SIGN YOUR COMMENTS! I learned that the hard way when I was <a href="../../../i/p/_/IP_address_6ed9.html" title="IP address">a minority</a>! <a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardDuck_bc24.html" title="User:WizardDuck">WizardDuck</a> 17:30, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm glad to see that section was removed. I think calling the winning videos fakes is a largely POV. It didn't fit the encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIamstillhiro1112_6759.html" title="User:Iamstillhiro1112">Iamstillhiro1112</a> 01:02, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I actually beg to differ about the removal of the "controversy" section to this article. The fact that unfunny, often "cute" videos regularly beat out other videos that were submitted, that are clearly very funny, is necessary for full article completeness IMO, especially if you do frame it within the context that it only really got started in the Tom Bergeron era, which coincides with Disney's buyout of ABC from Capital Cities. There have also been elements of the show that have either been unnecessary or wasteful of airtime that have been aired purely for corporate synergy, e.g. the time that an annoying little kid shouted the "It's A Small World" song (a terribly unfunny, charm-free thing that got aired anyway), and when the animated <i>Chicken Little</i> movie (a Disney thing) got on-air plugs via a cringeworthy "interview" Bergeron did with the flick's "star". Things never got this bad when John Fugelsang and Daisy Fuentes were hosting (when ABC was still a Capital Cities net), and while Bob Saget vexed slightly with his irksome "funny voices" and general yuk-yuk nature, at least hindsight has shown us how these actions could have been those of a man who was tremendously constricted, particularly when one thinks of Saget's humor background (i.e. very off-color stuff that shocked even Sam Kinison). In fact, count me as (not the only) one of the viewers of AFV who don't stick around to hear what the "three finalists" are because it's a case of "what's the use?". This needs to be at the very least touched on in the article. (<a href="../../../k/r/u/User%7EKrushsister_b507.html" title="User:Krushsister">Krushsister</a> 07:13, 21 February 2007 (UTC))</p>
<ul>
<li>Whoa, whoa, REWIND. Disney bought Capital Cities in 1996, and Disney didn't do this corporate crap until the 2000s. This is one of the reasons I hate Disney nowadays (another is the fact that Jetix is slowly enveloping Toon Disney in a dark cloud of bad TV, excluding The Tick). First of all, isn't this dumb promotional crap what the vignettes on Disney Channel are for? I HATE YOU DISNEY!! <a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardDuck_bc24.html" title="User:WizardDuck">WizardDuck</a> 04:41, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oops, my bad, <a href="../../../w/i/z/User%7EWizardDuck_bc24.html" title="User:WizardDuck">WizardDuck</a>. Thanks for educating me on exactly when the Capital Cities buyout happened. Also thanks for basically substantiating what it is I was trying to state in my original post, i.e. the stupid crap started happening in the Tom Bergeron era. Which is sad because now that WGN is rerunning the Fugelsang/Fuentes era and I'm seeing how much I'm actually laughing as compared to the newer eps, it kinda makes me sad. BTW, as a matter of full disclosure I've never been partial to Disney.

<p>have you noticed that when they get down to the 3 finalists, the cutest video wins and not the funniest one? i think the votes are rigged.--<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonrev_3cd5.html" title="User:Jonrev">Jon Revelle</a> 08:04, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If the top three videos contain one video with a baby or toddler in it, it is almost guaranteed the first prize. Although some videos happen to be cute AND funny (the "play golf like your daddy" video is a good example), very often it seems that more deserving videos are shot down in lieu of the baby ones. <a href="../../../s/y/c/User%7ESyckls_fbec.html" title="User:Syckls">Syckls</a></p>

yes, i have noticed that, and its really annoying. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESupmyman7_fb8d.html" title="User:Supmyman7">Supmyman7</a> 17:44, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I really want to know who picks the finalists beacause they're never any good. A 100,000$ winner was a guy dancing outside his front door. WTH? What are they smoking? 24.76.92.224</p>
<p>Just recently, a lady and her five infant children won because of giggling and other prompts. WTH?! That's not funny. That particular show had quite a few deserving videos, but small babies being prompted to laugh simultaneously is not funny for most of the show's viewers, it's rather irritating to watch. <a href="../../../j/e/d/User%7EJedo1507r_3620.html" title="User:Jedo1507r">Jedo1507r</a> 21:43, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

That ought to be mentioned if anyone knows exactly when he was on the show. Also, does anyone know the name of the woman that sang the theme song? And lastly, around 2000, when Fuentes and Fugelsang left and before Bergeron came in, there were a handful of AFV special, some of which were hosted by D. L. Hugely. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremyMcCracken_edb9.html" title="User:JeremyMcCracken">JeremyMcCracken</a> 16:08, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Is it just me or does the audience seem like they were paid to be there. After any clip, funny or not, everyone (especially the ones on camera) they have HUGE smiles on and are laughing as hard as they can. 24.76.92.224 00:06, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is the case on most television shows, as the staff encourages the audience to look like they are having a good time; it would look bad to the home viewers if no one looked like they enjoyed being there. Usually the audience is not paid, but simply allowed in for free. Look at shows like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Price_is_Right_eae9.html" title="The Price is Right">The Price is Right</a> or <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Request_Live_8c4d.html" title="Total Request Live">Total Request Live</a>, for example.

<p>One problem with the show was lack of "funny" home videos and forced humor, not just by staging but by awful and horrid voice overs. Quite often a good video was ruined by the voice over. Or the very fact that it was placed along side 30 other short videos that were almost the exact same thing. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinglink_3676.html" title="User:Kinglink">Kinglink</a> 09:25, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>All right let's break this down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuentes/Fugelsang and Bergeron versions are only reruning on WGN Superstation.</li>
<li>ABC Family only airs the Bob Saget episodes from 1994-97. Rumors say that the network may air the 1989-93 episodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people think that Comedy Central is going to air AFHV episodes. But the chances of seing AFHV on Comedy Central are 0.</p>
