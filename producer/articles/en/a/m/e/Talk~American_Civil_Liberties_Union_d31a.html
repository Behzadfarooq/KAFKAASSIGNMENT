<p>I modified the section on the NSA cases. The way it was previously written was confusing -- ACLU v. NSA is only one case (the Michigan case which was decided on 8/17), while there are several other, separate cases against the telecommunications companies.

<p>Removed the following: "On the other hand, a number of conservative figures, included Republican Governor <a href="../../../j/e/b/Jeb_Bush_d0e2.html" title="Jeb Bush">Jeb Bush</a> in 2005, have praised CAIR's work for "protection of civil rights and freedom of religion" <a href="http://www.americansagainsthate.org/OrlandoLettersCAIR.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.americansagainsthate.org/OrlandoLettersCAIR.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>."</p>
<p>The quote is a general defense of CAIR. It isn't a claim that the ACLU was right to hire someone from CAIR, and as such, is not really a response to the criticism of the ACLU. Putting the quote in is like saying "The ACLU has been criticized by conservatives for favoring the Soviet Union. However, some conservatives have praised the Soviet Union for..."</p>
<p>Even if this gets replaced by a quote that defends the ACLU specifically, just about every criticism will be disputed by one or two people on the same side. So the fact that one conservative disagrees is uninteresting unless it's used as an example of disagreement shared by a significant number of them. Is there some reason to believe that the disagreement is shared by a significant number of conservatives? <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 00:13, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I felt that the Jeb Bush remark was important because it showed that important conservatives do not consider association with CAIR to be a bad thing.
<dl>
<dd>It shows that *an* important conservative doesn't consider association with CAIR to be a bad thing.

<dd>Further, there's a POV issue -- in this brief paragraph we only discuss how evil CAIR is -- and I felt that adding that single sentence showed that the issue was more complex than believed.

<dl>
<dd>The same could be said about criticism of the ACLU's support of evolution. Do we need to include quotes by some prominent conservatives who favor evolution? (but don't even mention the ACLU in the quote)</dd>
<dd>"The ACLU has been criticized for X" is not a POV issue, even if we fail to accompany it by opposing viewpoints stating that X is not worthy of criticism. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 15:37, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The basic story of CAIR is that it is a mainstream organization that most national politicans treat with respect, but that a few conservatives, mostly associated with <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Pipes_f5d3.html" title="Daniel Pipes">Daniel Pipes</a>, have a longstanding feud with. I think putting a single sentence in to address that (e.g., to show that claims of ACLU hanging out with people who have "terrorist ties" should be taken with a large grain of salt) is important. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 17:30, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Critics of the ACLU section</b></p>
<p>This whole section needs attention. The article is on the ACLU, not every half baked and farfetched objection to the ACLU. These can be condensed into summaries, and some will need to be deleted.</p>
<p>Stoptheaclu.org contains:</p>
<p><i>"Here is how you can pray for the Stop the ACLU Coalition. Consider praying for 15 minutes a day to pray for any or all of the following requests. The battle begins and ends with prayer."</i></p>
<p><i>"Pray for confusion and division in the ranks of the ACLU. Pray that they will be unable to make reasoned cases in their litigation and that their legal arguments will fall flat in court".</i></p>
<p>This is not a site that confirms to WP to use as a valid source for any scholarly criticism. It's coming out, except as an external link.</p>
<p>The whole gun rights section needs to be pared down to a couple sentences. The ACLU believes that the <i>"Second Amendment applies to the preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated militia, and that "except for lawful police and military purposes, the possession of weapons by individuals is not constitutionally protected."</i> That's what they believe - so it's specious to argue that they are inconsistent in their defense of civil rights - they don't BELIEVE unlimited personal ownership of guns is a civil right.</p>

<dd>The article does not say 9.5 Million - that's OR. Plus, it's factually incorrect. No documentation to support this claim of $6 Million - and we have no idea if the ACLU received 1% of this 'alleged' 6 Million Dollars, or 99%. This info does not belong in the article.</dd>

<p>Yeah, you and Sribner's edit war caught my eye. I am going to work through the article from bottom to top and pull out unsourced or irrelevant material. I will check on what you posted. I did, you are absolutely correct. This wont be going back in the article unless it is sourced. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasper23_de2f.html" title="User:Jasper23">Jasper23</a> 20:32, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, you have properly submitted the request but I wish you would have made the request in a less combatitive manner. I understand that edit wars can be frustrating but from now on lets try to not let things get us angry. It makes it alot easier to change an article for the better when everyone is calm.

<p>Hi all -- I'm leaving wikipedia; since I've been involved with editing and expanding the ACLU article for more than a year, I wanted to wish everyone luck. Sorry to see that this section:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The ACLU receives funding from a large number of sources. The distribution and amount of funding for each chapter varies from state to state. To take one particular example, the ACLU of New Jersey reported $1.2 million in income to both the ACLU-NJ and its affiliated tax-exempt foundation in the 2005 fiscal year. Of that income, 46% came from contributions, 19% came from membership dues, 18% came from court awarded attorney fees, 12% came from grants, 4% came from investment income and the remainder from other sources. Its expenses in the same period were $800,000, of which 12% went to administration and management. Smaller chapters with fewer resources, such as that in Nebraska, receive subsidies from the national ACLU [27].</dd>
</dl>
<p>has been deleted. It's taken from the annual reports that every ACLU member gets mailed (I was in NJ at the time, so that's the report I got) and that are available in public libraries. This kind of behavior -- the arrogant and casual disregard for other editors' work, and the refusal to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, as well as <a href="../../../f/u/t/FUTON_bias_4061.html" title="FUTON bias">FUTON bias</a>, are some of the reasons I decided to leave the project. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 21:11, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is a national organization and the cited materials are from New Jersey and Nebraska. Your first reponse to my deletion of the material is that you are leaving wikipedia? If you are leaving over that....you need to grow some thicker skin. But I do wish you the best of luck in whatever you decide to do. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasper23_de2f.html" title="User:Jasper23">Jasper23</a> 21:17, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I must correct Jasper's misunderstanding here: the ACLU has a national organization, but the majority of the work is carried out by independent chapters, who each make their own financial report. The fashion in which someone with only the vaguest understanding of how the ACLU functions feels happy making massive edits to a technical subsection is an example of wikipedia's main weakness. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 23:29, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would guess that he is not leaving in response to your specific edit, but by repeated edits by the Anti ACLU zealots pushing their POV on this article. It had become a repository for every anti ACLU claim and screed, no matter how ridiculous. To include the results of an anti ACLU acronym naming contest on an obscure ACLU-hate site is just one example of edits that were beyond the pale. Imagine if somone opposed to President Bush tried to include all the derogatory nicknames he's called! In the 2 or 3 days I've been active here, I had my well sourced and documented "religious liberties" contribution deleted, using different fallacious arguments, numerous times. This prompted my less than amicable reaction, and I expect similar actions lead to Sdedeo's decision to leave as well. After we come up with a good article, with thoughtful, well documented contributions from both those who oppose and support the ACLU, I will seek to have the article protected - to prevent the sort of bad faith editing - which constitutes nothing more than vandalism - I've witnessed here in the last days<a href="../../../n/b/g/User%7ENBGPWS_4469.html" title="User:NBGPWS">NBGPWS</a> 22:43, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Again, good luck. "Protecting" the article in the fashion you suggest will not be approved, as it's against the "wikiphilosophy" -- articles are only protected in response to a particular edit war. I have been watching this page for over a year; on average, the page is hit perhaps three times a week with edits by people whose understanding of the organization, to put it mildly, is tenuous at best. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 23:29, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please stop insulting me. I would have replied to you earlier but you erased your own comments saying that you didnt want to get pulled back in. The finance section needs a proper rightup, not examples. You could have put those back in and I dont think anyone would have stopped you. I know I wouldnt have. I didnt know that new jersey aclu financial statements were such a sensitive issue for you. If I had known I wouldnt have touched them. But please stop with the insults. I have not treated you in such a manner. Thanks. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasper23_de2f.html" title="User:Jasper23">Jasper23</a> 01:47, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sometimes an article is so unsourced, pov and full of original research it needs to be drastically changed. That is what I have started to do with this article.

<p>Uncooperative and accusatory? What a strange thing to say. What do you want me to reference on the talk page? The unsourced and uncited material in the article? The large amounts of original research? The heavy pov from both sides that permeate this article? I am nowhere near vandalism. I cant believe that you can just sit there and let this article languish in its horrible current form. Why havent others been removing the unsourced and pov material. I think some people have been trying to stop them. Let me remind you that you also don't <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> this article.

<dd>You may wish to step back, I don't. The only one I can see not acting honestly or in good faith is Scribner. He says to refer to archives of the talk pages, where there is NOTHING there to bolster his arguments. Polovchak v Meese was not decided there. It is urban legend. To argue that the ACLU fought to return a child to the USSR is as specious as arguing that the ACLU fought for the right of men to have sex with boys in the NAMBLA case. Their involvement was over due process and the mechanics of the case, not the eventual outcome. <a href="../../../n/b/g/User%7ENBGPWS_4469.html" title="User:NBGPWS">NBGPWS</a> 03:33, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>Scribner asks that we refer to the archives of the talk pages for guidance. I will present some of the conclusions from the archives here.</p>
<ul>
<li>1) <i>"I removed the paragraph about Bill O'Reilly as it provides no concrete information whatsoever and is borderline irrelevent in that he is a just a present-day TV/talk show host."</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2) <i>"I'm concerned that an article that is supposed to be about the aclu it is more or less dominated by what its criticis think. this in itself does not seem fair to me. I want there to be a solid criticism section, but i don't understand why over half of the article is about things people how disagree with the aclu say."</i></li>

<p>Prosfilaes last revert is another attempt by POV pushers to undue the careful NPOV editing and documented research by Jasper and others. For Prosfilaes to add back in bogus material like the disproved 9.5 Million dollar claim is absolutely unacceptable. <a href="../../../n/b/g/User%7ENBGPWS_4469.html" title="User:NBGPWS">NBGPWS</a> 09:00, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Calling me a POV pusher is a personal attack, NBGPWS. "AGF and don't be so accusatory or you will have trouble" is about as hypocritical and hostile a statement I can imagine. I didn't add in any claims; I reverted to an older version of the page that didn't have a vast field of deletions. It's very hard to judge a set of changes this large at once, which is why the {{fact}} template is used on uncited items, so people can cite them or disagree with the need for citation there, and why POV issues are discussed on the webpage. Glancing at the differences, I see many changes that I would dispute one at a time. For example, the ACLU is not a libertarian organization...--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 09:39, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not in the same sense that the members of the Libertarian party is. Using libertarian in the sense of "lovers of liberty" is perhaps legit, it's an unusual usage, and using it without defining it is confusing. Using it in the form of "While the ACLU is a libertarian organization and has defended the US Libertarian Party in some past cases", at first glance, makes me feel like the author is being deliberately disingenuous; it's a lot like saying "while the Republican Party claims to support democracy, it opposes the Democratic Party."--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 15:46, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I actually do feel more or less the same way you do about that sentence. I wonder what the authors original intent was. Anyway, I dont think your analogy quite holds up because libertarianism is the philosophy before it is the party, if you get my drift. The libertarian party of the united states is not the standard bearer of libertarian though throughout the world. So, lets leave the sentence, as is, for now and eventually work out a compromise. I want the weasel words removed, but I think you are right that we shouldnt classify the aclu as a libertarian organization.

<p>Okay, read this paragraph and realize it is a harsh criticism aligning the KKK and American Nazi Party with the ACLU. Okay, true or not? I dont know? Look at the cite. What the hell is that cite?

<p>This was in the religous critics section of the article. This is well sourced and well written. It definetly involves religion and the ACLU. However, where is the critic part of this.

<p><i>Some critics argue that this position is inconsistent with their stated philosophy, and have suggested that the ACLU may only adopt this stance to appease liberal-leaning supporters of the group who also support gun control.</i> Okay, this first part is unsourced original research commentary on the ACLU. Which critics? Who has suggested? Pure speculation. This should be sourced before going back in to the article.</p>
<p><i>Critics also point out that the ACLU does not take up cases that involve possible abuses by the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Bureau_of_Alcohol%2C_Tobacco%2C_Firearms_and_Explosives_e46a.html" title="Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives">ATF</a> that go beyond the debate over the private ownership of firearms. <a href="http://www.civilrightsunion.org/acluwatch/socalledgun.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.civilrightsunion.org/acluwatch/socalledgun.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></i> This link is dead. Once again, which critics?</p>
<p>The ACLU has been involved in a few gun rights cases; most recently the ACLU of Texas joined with the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Rifle_Association_d13c.html" title="National Rifle Association">NRA</a> in favor of a proposed Texas law, HB 823, in 2006, and claiming that current legislation allowed for the harassment of gun owners<a href="http://gritsforbreakfast.blogspot.com/2005/03/pack-your-pistola-and-hit-road.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://gritsforbreakfast.blogspot.com/2005/03/pack-your-pistola-and-hit-road.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>.

<dd>Regarding the ATF/ACLU, while I found some comments during a Google search, I couldn't find anything that I would consider proof. It appears the ACLU is against gun ownership, but it also appears they won't take individual cases on the matter. I say until proof is found, it needs to be removed.</dd>

<dd>The issue of the ACLU being involved in a few gun rights cases can be found at several places while doing a google search for ACLU ATF, in fact letters to President Clinton from the mid-1990's are out there, but once again, I'm not sure this is proof.

<p>On January 10, 1994, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the NRA and other organizations appealed to President Clinton for the appointment of a national commission to "... investigate serious allegations of abuse by federal law enforcement agencies and to recommend steps that must be taken to reduce constitutional and human rights violations by federal law enforcement personnel." Citing "... serious allegations of abuse, including the improper use of deadly force...", our letter offered specific examples of black suited, masked, massively armed mobs of screaming, swearing agents invading the homes of innocents: It goes on to list names of specific people and specific incidences.</p>

<p>So what do you guys think? I found this critic in the libertarian section but in the source and on his wiki page he is listed as a civil libertarian. I just want to know if we are in agreement that a civil libertarian is a libertarian. There seems to be alot of doubt. What does everyone think? Please examine the following section. Thanks.</p>

<dd>Meaning that while many or some Democrats believe themselves to be civil libertarians, issues such as AA is one form of proof that they are not. Libertarians are against AA because Libertarians are against discrimination in all its forms.

<p>In 2004, for example, the ACLU of Southern California (ACLU/SC) threatened to sue the city of <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redlands%2C_California_83c9.html" title="Redlands, California">Redlands, California</a> if it did not remove a picture of a cross from the city's seal. The ACLU/SC argued that having a cross on the seal amounted to a government-sponsored endorsement of Christianity and violated separation of church and state. The city complied with the ACLU/SC and removed the cross from all city vehicles, business cards, and police badges. However, the issue was put on the November 2005 ballot <a href="http://www.redlandsseal.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.redlandsseal.org" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>.

<p>Here is another example of unsourced criticism in the article. I believe that this could be a very valid controversial case but it is completely unsourced. The one link in the body of the article would be insufficient (if it worked, which it does not). The bolded section is sourced but makes no sense on its own so I pulled that out to. This needs to be sourced before going back in and I think this might be better placed in the cases section. Do people agree? Disagree? Thanks.</p>

<p>This has not been removed from the article. This is from the beginning of the general criticism section. Does anyone feel this is necessary? Here is the text.</p>
<p>The ACLU's involvement in hundreds of legal cases over the years has led to a great deal of criticism from numerous points of view. In many situations, the criticism may be focused on the ACLU's stance in a particular case or group of cases; in others, the criticism focuses on the general principles that guide the ACLU's choices of what cases to take a position on.</p>
<p>A wide variety of groups oppose some or all of the ACLU's positions listed above; several general themes of criticism are discussed here.</p>
<p>If nobody comments or suggests changes then I will soon pull it off the page. Thanks. Let me know what you think. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasper23_de2f.html" title="User:Jasper23">Jasper23</a> 09:24, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree, since it may be that a wide variety of groups support some or all of the ACLU's positions.... If it read that a wide variety of groups opposed...and then listed at least a few groups that oppose some or all of the ACLU's positions, it would be better. But then to balance it out, we'd have to list the wide variety of groups that support the same positions. In other words, take it out. --Lorraine LeBeau 19:29, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is the newest section. Non-notable groups (who are these people)-pov writeup and poor writeup in general -poor sourcing (these arent news agencies but extremist newsletters)..take a look:</p>
<p>In October 1999 the Spartacist League organized a demonstration against a KKK rally in New York and listed amongst the obstacles placed in their way "the American Civil Liberties Union, which continued its revolting decades-long defense of 'constitutional rights' for the fascist terrorists." This was in reference to the lawyer for the KKK, Norman Siegel of the New York ACLU, that brokered a deal allowing the KKK to march with police protection and a sound permit, but denied even a sound permit for the labor/black mobilization against the Klan.<a href="http://www.icl-fi.org/english/wv/archives/oldsite/1999/STOPKKK.HTM" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.icl-fi.org/english/wv/archives/oldsite/1999/STOPKKK.HTM" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> Under political pressure that deal was later struck down and the sound permit was allowed.<a href="http://www.lrp-cofi.org/PR/KlanPR60.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lrp-cofi.org/PR/KlanPR60.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a></p>

<p>After creating new gun section I removed unsourced criticism, pov writing and weasel words. Here it is.</p>
<p>Critics also argue that the ACLU has not been consistent in defending all civil liberties, pointing out that it is not active in protecting <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gun_politics_in_the_US_e932.html" title="Gun politics in the US">gun rights</a>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Critics claim gun rights enjoy similar constitutional protection to other civil rights and should be treated equally by the ACLU if it is not motivated by a partisan agenda. Some contend that, unlike the First Amendment, the Second Amendment does not provide individual rights. The courts have made conflicting rulings on the topic. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasper23_de2f.html" title="User:Jasper23">Jasper23</a> 04:43, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is the introduction to the criticism section. This is an original research section and while not pov it is an original reasearch narrative and unencyclopedic. What do people think? Weasel word city.</p>

<p>As another editor on an archived talk page concluded:</p>
<p><i>"I'm concerned that an article that is supposed to be about the aclu it is more or less dominated by what its criticis think. this in itself does not seem fair to me. I want there to be a solid criticism section, but i don't understand why over half of the article is about things people how disagree with the aclu say."</i></p>
<p>The NRA and ACLU are both polarizing NGO's with almost the exact same approval / disapproval ratings:</p>
<p><i>"The main findings of (this) survey include:</i></p>
<p><i>The National Rifle Association (NRA) - 48% trust the NRA while 52 percent do not trust them.</i></p>
<p><i>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) - 49 percent trust the ACLU compared to 51 percent who do not trust them.</i></p>
<p><i>The Harris Poll #91, December 16, 2005'"'</i></p>
<p>The following is the extent of criticism from 'the Left' in the Wiki NRA article:</p>
<p><i>-Criticism-</i></p>
<p><i>From the Gun-prohibition Camp.</i></p>
<p><i>The NRA is criticized by gun control groups such as the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, Brady Campaign, Million Mom March, and Americans for Gun Safety. A variety of newspaper editorial boards, including the New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, and USA Today, frequently disagree with the NRA's policies, such as in September of 2004, when they called for the extension of the assault weapons ban; in general, criticism of the NRA is higher in urban areas than rural areas. These groups tend to point to instances of gun violence, claiming that they could have been prevented through legislation.</i></p>
<p>One could find dozens of anti-NRA quotes and claims from prominent Liberals, politicians, and groups opposed to the NRA. Michael Moore's quotes, claims and opinions could form an entire section of several paragraphs - but the article is about the NRA, not those opposed to the NRA. (The next section on criticism from the Right should be pared down too)</p>
<p>The section of criticism of the NRA from the 'Gun Prohibition camp' (a VERY inaccurate POV term as many are for sensible regulation and registration, not prohibition-now changed) should be the model for the ACLU article. What Michael Medved, Bill O'Reilly or any other windbag thinks about the NRA is not germaine to the article. What Samuel Alito thinks <i>might</i> be. <a href="../../../n/b/g/User%7ENBGPWS_4469.html" title="User:NBGPWS">NBGPWS</a> 22:04, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Would someone please try to boil it down? One helpful method is if the editors working on the article can formulate two or more ways of wording a given passage, each of which has some support, then present all these alternatives, with brief commentary on the pros and cons.

<dd>There are numerous points of contention. Many are discussed on this talk page, and there's not much to 'boil down'. Here's a new example of what I consider POV in this article.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The article states:</p>
<p><b>Religious critics</b></p>
<p><i>"The ACLU also has religious critics. At the grassroots level, the ACLU often involves itself in cases involving the separation of church and state. Some Christians, including many who may be considered conservative Christian, take issue with its positions. Many in this community contend that the ACLU is part of an effort to remove all references to religion from American government."</i></p>
<p><i>"In 2004, for example, the ACLU of Southern California (ACLU/SC) threatened to sue the city of Redlands, California if it did not remove a picture of a cross from the city's seal. The ACLU/SC argued that having a cross on the seal amounted to a government-sponsored endorsement of Christianity and violated separation of church and state. The city complied with the ACLU/SC and removed the cross from all city vehicles, business cards, and police badges. However, the issue was put on the November 2005 ballot."</i></p>
<p>Critical facts omitted that proves POV:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) Two residents of the City of Redlands were the original complainants - who, as far back as 1986, objected to the cross on their city's logo. They sought out the ACLU.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>2) Religious /conservative groups supported removing the cross.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>According to the minutes of a City Council meeting for 2005-MAY-04:"...the Alliance Defense Fund, a conservative Christian organization that finances litigation to defend issues of 'religious liberty rights' and the protection of family values, did its own legal research and decided the City does not have a defensible case with the regard to the City logo with the cross."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>At the 2005-JUN-01, City Council meeting, Reverend John Walsh, represented the People for Inclusivity, spoke. The group opposes a Christian symbol on the logo. He also presented a supporting letter with 65 signatures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>3) In Nov 2005, the residents of Redlands voted 60% to 40% not to reinstate the cross on their city logo.</li>
</ul>

<dd>This is one of the reasons why I don't like dealing with you. POV to the max is either hyperbole or a completely skewed perspective. This article, like many others could be improved, but doesn't look anything like the seriously one-sided viewpoints of a POV to the max article.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, there's usually at least one or two people in every community to disagree with a religious display, and under the law, the ACLU needs people actually affected by the display to push a complaint, that is, those people. "Religious /conservative groups" is a lumping together of disparite things. According to your own quote, the Alliance Defense Fund didn't say they supported the removal of the cross, but merely that "the City does not have a defensible case". I would bet that the "People for Inclusivity", while a religious group, would generally be considered a liberal group, and 65 signatures represents a tenth of a percent of Redlands' population. Then, when offered the option to spend millions of tax dollars fighting a pointless court battle, the people of Redlands wisely declined. I don't know how many of those 60% really agreed with the removal of the cross, and how many just didn't want to fight a losing battle, but I'd say there's enough of the latter to worry about using that statistic carelessly.</dd>

<dd>One of the reasons I find it challenging to deal with you <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a>, is that you evidently have no grasp of what constitutes <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. Only an editor without an understanding of OR would argue <i>"I don't know how many of those 60% really agreed with the removal of the cross, and how many just didn't want to fight a losing battle, but I'd say there's enough of the latter to worry about using that statistic carelessly."</i> or would repeatedly add in the claim that CRAC estimated the awards to be in 'the millions', when POV editors are adding individual claims toether to arrive at that OR conjecture.

<p>The article as a whole has a rather anti-ACLU tone: extensive space devoted to critics and controversial positions, yet little to the organization's supporters and to bread-and-butter rights protection. <b><a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova"><font color="blue">Durova</font></a></b> 04:37, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Durova. This doesn't fix the problem, but I suggest the phrase "<i>A wide variety of groups oppose some or all of the ACLU's positions listed above; several general themes of criticism are discussed here.</i>" be removed. I think it is almost a weasel word, but the main reason is it has no use. If it must be included, I'd rather it state "Several cases are discussed here" at the end of the paragraph above it.

<dd>I thought I'd chime in to express that my general impression of the page is that it is a little too focused on the controversial aspects and the criticism of the ACLU. I realize that the ACLU is probably one of the most controversial American organizations, so certainly, a large amount of this is appropriate. But I think there should be an effort to keep the focus on the ACLU and the direct criticism of the ACLU itself-- rather than expanding the focus to include a number of the wider issues that the ACLU is involved in.</dd>
<dd>So, perfect example: we have a whole section on the controversy about the ACLU being awarded attorneys fees. This really isn't an ACLU issue. This is true of any non-profit, and true of the court system in general. If you lose a case, in some instances you have to pay the other side's attorneys fees. Because the ACLU is one such non-profit, we've having a whold debate about this issue on the ACLU page, but we really shouldn't, because it's really not an ACLU-criticism per se, even if the critics of the ACLU are also criticizing the practice.</dd>
<dd>Simlarly, the critics section seems to be more focused on the CRITICS than on the ACLU. Obviously, we do need a lot of criticism, but it seems like there would be a better way to organize it. For example, maybe integrating the "Positions", "Notable Cases" section and the "Criticism" section in such a way that you show their position on an issue, the notable cases on that issue, and then talk about the criticism of the ACLU's stance on that issue. So, the Seperation of Church and State would fit into that mold very easily. I don't know for a fact that way would be better, but it's something to consider.</dd>
<dd>In general though, I'd say that there needs to be a better focus on the the ACLU itself, rather than as a large discussion of some of the major political issues the ACLU is embedded in. The current page also sort of lacks an overaching cohesive organization-- it seems more like an assortment of specific facts, commentary, and criticisms, rather than a high-level overview.</dd>
<dd>If people specify some of the specific issues under dispute, I'll comment on them.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>"Alecmconroy. I'm not an ACLU scholar, but I think you are mistaken on the ACLU/other non-profits legal fees distinction. I think a special law was passed that said if a case is about the Establishment Clause, the ACLU gets legal fees that would otherwise not be awarded. The ACLU then uses this to go after municipality after municipality on Establishment Clause issues for the very purpose of raking in the public's money by abusing that law. Again, I'm not an ACLU expert, neither do I know what I said is exactly the issue, but your saying it's just plain old attorney fees is mistaken. Indeed a law is being sought to stop the extra legal fees in Establshment Clause cases precisely to stop the ACLU from siphoning large amounts of money from the public in abuse of the original law. And this is why, I'm assuming, people feel this is such a big controversy, such a big issue -- the ACLU will lose a lot of the public's money if this passes and will not be able to sue on a pretext just to be able to extract more of the public's money. In other words, the ACLU will be greatly discouraged from being suit after suit against little towns for displaying Christmas scenes on public property or crosses and the like. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESafeLibraries.org_8d6f.html" title="User:SafeLibraries.org">SafeLibraries.org</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/f/User_talk%7ESafeLibraries.org_5149.html" title="User talk:SafeLibraries.org">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SafeLibraries.org_fbcd.html" title="Special:Contributions/SafeLibraries.org">contribs</a>).</small>
<dl>
<dd>There are a large number of circumstances where a successful party in civil litigation can be awarded attorney's fees. (<a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney%27s_fee.html" title="Attorney's fee">Attorney's fee</a> discusses some of them). The debate about whether those laws are appropriate is really a whole separate issue from the ACLU itself. This is the case for any party in any lawsuit that is covered under those laws. What those laws should be is a different legal debate-- a debate that isn't really about the ACLU itself.</dd>
<dd>So, you see what I mean when I talk about distinguishing between the ACLU itself and the larger issues the ACLU is embedded in. Should the government pay attorneys fees for some parties who had to sue to stop violations of their civil rights? I don't know-- but it's a larger debate that isn't about the ACLU-- we're just discussing it on the ACLU page because they're the most famous civil rights group-- but the same debate would apply to any other lawyers involved in the same sort of civil rights cases.</dd>
<dd>I think it's fine to mention that the ACLU recoups some of their costs when they win cases, but currently, this article covers the whole debate about attorney fees in the middle of an article on the ACLU. That's a fine debate to have-- but there's no reason to have it in the middle of the ACLU article.</dd>

<dd>Yeah, you're right. But if in the future this attorneys fees matter does indeed turn out to significantly inhibit the ACLU's glee in suing, perhaps then it could be mentioned as the reason for the slowing of ACLU law suits.

<dd>I think that the ACLU is just one of many examples which demonstrate the inadequacy of current usages in the US of the "left/right" continuum. There are a couple of points which do indicate that it is "hard to classify":
<ul>
<li>For instance, the ACLU was a pioneer of First Amendment advocacy, which has been since adopted by groups with a wide variety of ideological perspectives, ranging from "conservative"' to "libertarian" to "liberal" to "radical". The ACLU today continues its 1A work, which indeed is therefore hard to classify.</li>
<li>Moreover, the ACLU takes clients and positions on clients from a wide variety of ideological perspectives--from the KKK, to Rush Limbaugh, to Nike, to Karen Finley, to the American Library Assocation. This also would render it "hard to classify".</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, the ACLU does work on behalf of other issues, such as anti-discrimination work, which in the US today is frequently described by self-identified conservatives as "liberal" or "left". This mix of left and non-left missions could itself make it difficult to classify, but it's not crazy for conservatives to look at the ACLU and say "left" or "liberal" or whatever. What <i>is</i> crazy is to use these very POV terms ("left" and "right") in an article. It would be far better to state something like I did above, that the ACLU takes clients from a range of ideological perspectives; works on issues that range from adopted across a range of ideological perspectives (like First Amendment) to issues adopted by the contemporary US left (anti-discrimination, GLBT rights); but within any such issue may take positions that would not be easily categorized as "left" or "right" (such as the ACLU's position on commercial speech as in the Nike case). It would <i>also</i> be helpful to note that the ACLU is comprised of a national board and multiple state and regional chapters which, on occasion, go their own way on issues. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">LQ</a> 20:29, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think, probably, a mix of libertarian &amp; liberal ... but agree that the spectrum is inadequate, albeit widely-used; and it carries its own POV (which excludes a wide range of political thought). My main problem is that the sentence is a mealy-mouthed way to make that point about the ACLU, but it's almost content-less: "it's hard to classify the ACLU on an inadequate scale that is mostly driven by rhetorical &amp; POV uses" -- well, obviously! it's hard to classify anyone on that scale, pretty much. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">LQ</a> 17:07, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Based on the list of stances ACLU takes on given issues (as listed in the wikipedia entry), it seems silly to try to purport that that the ACLU is "hard to classify" on the conservative/liberal spectrum.

<dd>All this confusion has to do with the way we misuse left or right today. Left Right regards the economic policies of liberals or conservatives. The ACLU does not take stances on the Minimum Wage. They take stances on the other axis, the libertarian authoritarian axis, which includes issues like gay marriage, abortion, freedom of speech, et cetera. So they do no fall on the left right continuum.</dd>

<p>I think it's still quite relevant. I've worked for the ACLU for two straight summers (I'm a law student), and I can tell you that the incident is viewed with an amused sense of pride. It's still a major slogan for the ACLU, on mugs, shirts, etc. The fact that the two candidates used the ACLU to represent themselves to the public speaks volumes about the importance of the ACLU to the political debate and I think that's certainly relevant to the article. bbilford 03:14, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oppose trivia section, but don't oppose the quote. Instead, I wonder if it could be contextualized with another sentence that better explains the way the ACLU has been perceived by the Christian right in the US in the last 35 years, help resolve some of the POV/vandalism edits attacking the ACLU, and fill in the organizational history gap between 1940 and 1988/2001. Bush's statement was very much an attempt to tap into the rightwing political attacks on the ACLU, and we currently only address the anti-ACLU attacks by saying "Its views are often controversial and criticized by both parties." This isn't inaccurate, but it doesn't do justice to the way that the ACLU has been used by conservative US politicians as a symbol of liberalism and/or anti-religious bias. So I suggest trying to highlight this amusing anecdote in a way that properly contextualizes it as part of this political targeting of the ACLU. Something like, <i>"With the rise of the US Christian right in the 1970s, the ACLU became a particular target for criticism by conservative politicians, who have often accused the organization of being un-patriotic or anti-religious. ACLU supporters, while not agreeing with those criticisms, have taken a certain amused pride in the attacks. The ACLU has tapped into this sentiment by adopting the slogan "Become a card-carrying member of the ACLU," a phrase memorably used by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H.W._Bush_6cdf.html" title="George H.W. Bush">George H.W. Bush</a> in an election debate attack on <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Dukakis_8fbd.html" title="Michael Dukakis">Michael Dukakis</a>.'</i>" The proposed language could use a lot of wordsmithing, but, ideally it would address the political attacks on the ACLU without the POV-magnet problems caused by a "Criticisms" section. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">LQ</a> 14:59, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You've introduced another POV problem. Your perception that the "Christian right" rose in the 1970s. In fact, what you call the "Christian right" has always been a primary component of the American political community. What you saw in the 1970s was a schism taking place in that community, in which differences between components became more pronounced. If you don't believe that what you call the "Christian right" was a major power, consider the number of non-Protestant US presidents over history. The phrase "Bible Belt" goes back to Lincoln. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECritic-at-Arms_0494.html" title="User:Critic-at-Arms">Critic-at-Arms</a> 3 January 2007</dd>

<p>Jasper, you seem to have a POV problem. You removed the entire reference to ACLU support of the internment of Japanese Americans in WWII, as being "unsourced". Since one of the co-founders of ACLU took loud exception to this support, and it's referenced repeatedly in ACLU records, newspaper and magazine accounts of the time, it's hardly "unsourced," and in fact is common knowledge. If you like, I will "source" a couple of thousand words on the issue, directly from ACLU talking papers and the cold letters sent back to Nikkei who asked for help and to the one attorney who did take up the cause.</p>
<p>Also, you selectively removed words which clarified ACLU positions in relation to Supreme Court decisions, and leave a false impression regarding the gun control issue.

<dd>Notable? sure. Related to the article, questionable. The relationship between the removed statement is not at all aparent. They say nothing about the ACLU, only something about it's members. It'd be great if some secondary source <b>related</b> these quotes to criticism of the ACLU, but on their own they're tangential nonsense and original research(with respect to this article). <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 04:38, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Only on Wikipedia do self-evident statements require additional "context." We've got the founders of the ACLU making comments that reveal socialist leanings and intentions, and we've got a current ACLU which is accused of such, yet no one here has managed to connect the dots. --<a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaizum_0a13.html" title="User:Haizum"><b>Haizum</b></a> <b>μολὼν λαβέ</b> 00:21, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have reviewed the article and am placing it on a one week hold pending fixes to the following problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>The article is very well written and well referenced, but the references themselves need a bit of a clean-up.
<ul>
<li>First of all, the Controversial Stances section contains some references that are simply external links and not encased in ref tags. This needs fixing for uniformity</li>
<li>Secondly, while the number of references is certainly impressive and wonderful, the references should contain some minimum bibliographic information (that is, more than simply a link to a website). At minimum, this information should be:
<ul>
<li>the author of the reference (if availible)</li>
<li>the title of the reference</li>
<li>the name of the larger work the reference is a part of (if so)</li>
<li>the publication date of the reference</li>
<li>the date of access of the reference when it contained the information being referenced (if availible online).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can either enter the information above by hand for each reference, or if you prefer, use a citation template found at <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITET_7f44.html" title="WP:CITET">WP:CITET</a> which can help organize the information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One additional statement looks like it needs a reference, but is not referenced, the current membership quote of 500,000 members is not referenced anywhere. This should be a simple fix.</li>
<li>As a flow issue, the "positions" section and the "controversial stances" section could either be merged or simply brought next to each other. These two closely related sections should not be separated as they are.</li>
<li>Likewise, the "Organization History" and "Notable Historical Cases" should be near each other, since they essentially deal with the similar topics.</li>
</ul>
<p>If these problems are not fixed in a week, the article will unfortunately fail GA for now. That does not prevent you from performing the fixes and renominating it. Please let me know at my talk page when these fixes are made (see my sig). --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>|<a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayron32_19db.html" title="User talk:Jayron32"><small>talk</small></a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jayron32_7743.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32"><small>contribs</small></a> 02:51, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Since the hold has been on for more than 1 week, I am failing the article. The article does seem to be improving, and I recommend that once all of the above fixes have been made, the article can be renominated for GA.

<p>This was mentioned earlier. Some conservatives say the ACLU is more interested in a liberal agenda then protecting the Bill of Rights. I know this is extremely POV, but most liberals, such as myself, consider ourselves working in the inteerest of the constitution and the Bill of Rights. Also, the ACLU is not leftist, although you could make a case for liberal. They dont get involved on the left right economic axis of politics, but on the libertarian authoritarian axis. As such, the ACLU can be considered both liberal or libertarian. The best word is Civil Libertarian. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Wikifan999 (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikifan999_63a2.html" title="User talk:Wikifan999">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wikifan999_5a2b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wikifan999">contribs</a>) 20:20, 28 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Sorry, I didn't see this before. Civil libertarians are not always what we refer to as libertarians. Most people consider libertarians those who agree with liberals on issues of personal freedom but with conservatives on issues of economic freedom. Liberals believe in personal freedom but government control when it comes to economic matters. It has to do with the 2 axis. Both liberals and libertarians are civil libertarians, because civil libertarians are those who believe in civil liberties. There is no implication about economic freedom in the word civil libertarian. So the ACLU is neither liberal nor libertarian, but is what the two agree on. They are civil libertarians, some of them have leftist beliefs, other members consider themselves libertarians. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Wikifan999 (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikifan999_63a2.html" title="User talk:Wikifan999">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wikifan999_5a2b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wikifan999">contribs</a>) 20:25, 28 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
