<p>I just went through the article <b>again</b> changing all the uses of "words as words" to <i>italics</i> and removing "quotes". This is done for clarity and readability, as per the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia: Manual of Style</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Words as words</b></dd>

<dd>Italicize words when they are being written about, rather than being used to write about what they refer to. Similarly for letters.

<dd>I don't understand your logic. Above, when should we use the <i>panning</i> version and when should we use the "panning" version? In the English language, <i>italics</i> are used to denote names of works, whereas quotes are used to denote pieces within works. The number of times I have had to correct articles because they were written by people who do not understand this concept is astounding. <i>panorama</i> would denote a music album, a book, a movie, a play, a novel, or another such title of a work; whereas the quotes would refer to a part of the work (e.g. a song title on an album, a chapter in a book, the name of an act in a play, or a part played by an actor in a movie). So, please, clarify why Wikipedia often seems to employ its own standards--or are several contributors merely ignorant of the proper punctuation?<a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.147.111.208.html" title="User:172.147.111.208">172.147.111.208</a> 17:57, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yaddar 19:53, 28 March 2006 (UTC) The fact of Europe and Asia sharing a condition of 2 separate continents is a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grandfather_clause.html" title="Grandfather clause">grandfathered</a> term since Ancient Europeans didn't knew most of Asia actually existed... (see history of <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurasia.html" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> here in wikipedia). In the case of the American Continent, it was recognized as a whole NEW LANDMASS for the Spanish, Portuguesse and Italian Sailors, thus people of the time named WHOLE NEW CONTINENT "America" (and then, the origin of the word would be that of an Italian Sailor)</p>
<p>And besides the US schools, in the vast rest of the world out there America is seen as a one Continent, with two subcontinents((North America and South America); or 4 Geographical Regions (North America, Central America, South America and the Caribbean) or 2 Cultural Regions (Latin America and Anglo-saxon America, -Instead of "North America and Latin America" since we are talking about the LINGUISTIC origins of their population-)</p>
<p>So, the United States are the ONLY ONES who teach America the continent as plural and its in order to know if they are talking about the continent or their country... NOT because there are acctually TWO AMERICAS... "Americas" then would be a Regional terminology ruled by USAGE IN THE US and not for any Geographical nor Historical condition. (not the same as Europe and Asia, whose terminology comes across a Granfathered Historical condition).</p>
<p>Sice then we don't Speak of "Two Asias"... we don not say we have the Far East continent and the Middle East continent... we DO call them 'Geographical Regions'... North Amercia and South America aren't Continents, they are Subcontinents.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
The following was previously by itself toward the top of the talk page without a heading. I've moved it here. For what it's worth, Central America is not a continent, and National Geographic does not recognize it as one. I believe it is more of a cultural division. Additionally, please sign comments in the future. If nothing else, it makes the flow of conversation much clearer. -- <a href="../../../d/p/a/User%7EDpark_3481.html" title="User:Dpark">Dpark</a> 00:31, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
It is true that, as the article states, most references in English describe North America and South America as two continents. This article is a reference in English; why doesn't it do the same? It is confusing for the article to begin "The Americas is an alternative name in the English language for the continent of America," when for the typical reader the Americas are two continents. <a href="../../../a/j/d/User%7EAjd_013d.html" title="User:Ajd">AJD</a> 20:33, 28 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I went through and cleaned that up a bit. I removed the mention that English texts "assume" The Americas are two continents. This is basic geography. (See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a>). As far as I can tell, this "The Americas are one continent" thing is a view held primarily by Spanish-speaking people. I don't pretend to understand the view, or where it comes from, but there are definitely two continents. At least, that's the accepted view in English-speaking areas. If there's some debate about the number of continents, let it be hashed out on the continent talk page. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Americas_eb6d.html" title="The Americas">The Americas</a> should present accepted information. In English, it's accepted that there are two continents. -- <a href="../../../d/p/a/User%7EDpark_3481.html" title="User:Dpark">Dpark</a> 06:13, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continent</a>, where it says that a continent is "a large contiguous landmass". But then it goes on to ignore its own definition, and then re-uses it as if it is a deviation (a landbridge) in stead of the definition itself that makes the whole of America one continent. Confusing. There's a tension between logic and custom here. Well, in English, anyway. Not in Dutch, for example. I'm Dutch and In my entire life I've only once come across the plural form (Amerikas), which I pointed out to someone and we had a bit of a laugh at such stupidity.</dd>
<dd>Google 'de Amerikas' for dutch sites (.nl) and you'll get just one hit! Do the same for 'les Ameriques' for french sites (.fr) and you'll get 7000 hits versus 224.000 for 'l'Amerique'. In German it's 2640 versus 1.440.000. Of course, the use of Amerique/Amerika for the USA has to be substracted from these figures, and that requires quite some more research.</dd>
<dd>Or try Wikipedia. The German Wikipedia doesn't know about 'Amerikas' and has a disambiguation page for 'Amerika' that says it's either the continent (yes, <i>one</i> continent) or, colloquially, the USA. The French Wikipedia says 'Amerique' is one of the five continents (no mention of the plural). The Spanish Wikipedia says America is one continent with two subcontinents. And my other languages are a bit rusty&#160;:), but it seems that the Indonesian, Danish, Esperanto, Latin and Portuguese Wikipedias call America one continent. The Swedish Wikipedia seems to call it a double-continent and only the Italian, Romanian and Polish Wikipedias seem to say that there are two continents (North and South), although even these seem to suggest an ambiguity.</dd>
<dd>So it's not the Spanish who deviate, it's more like the English language is the odd one out (avoiding ambiguity with the colloquial naming of the USA), with some other languages following suit rather half-heartedly. Of course, this is the Enlish Wikipedia, so usage in the English language is the criterium, but don't pretend it's a Spanish oddity to call America one continent. That's even scientifically the most correct naming.</dd>

<dd>Then again, shouldn't an encyclopedia be language-independent? Or rather, shouldn't there be a version of Wikipedia for the people of the world (and thus language-independent), and, if so, in what language should that then be? English seems the most logical choice (Esperanto isn't big enough). And having two English versions (actually three, if you count the 'simple English' version) seems too much. So this version should reflect the average view in the world and not just the English speaking part of it. Right? I'm sure this has already been discussed somewhere, but where?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>A language independent encyclopedia has no meaning. Any useful information presented in any language is necessarily biased toward the way of thinking of those who use that language.</dd>
<dd>And I don't think it's appropriate to refer to other languages in an attempt to define the "proper" meaning of English words. Maybe in other languages, "America" refers to the Americas, and maybe in other languages, it's taught that the Americas is only one continent. I really don't know. I know that in English, we have an accepted meaning to the terms, and if they don't match other languages, maybe we should leave it that way. Native speakers of other languages would be (and often are) terribly offended if it were implied that they must change their use of a word because it doesn't match that of English speakers. I see no reason we shouldn't feel the same. It's not reasonable to warp our language to meet someone else's definitions.</dd>
<dd>For example, German has no distinction between "many" and "much", but there's a clear distinction in English. You could argue that the English way is "wrong", because most languages (I believe) don't have the distinction, but people would call you silly (at best). German has only "viele", but English has "much" <i>and</i> "many". German (perhaps) has only "Amerika". English has "America" <i>and</i> "the Americas". It makes no more sense to adopt the German use of "America" than it does to adopt the German's consolidated "much/many". You cannot avoid bias. It's better for the German speakers to have their encyclopedia and the English speakers to have theirs. Trying to suit everyone results in a product which suits no one. -- <a href="../../../d/p/a/User%7EDpark_3481.html" title="User:Dpark">Dpark</a> 04:59, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The difference between 'many' and 'much' is something purely linguistic (which, by the way also exists in German; 'viele' and 'viel'). Like the differences between American and English English. But the difference between 'America' and 'Americas' can be seen as a statement about a fact outside language; whether it's one or two continents. Anyway, can there really not be a language-independent encyclopedia? By this I mean one that isn't biased by linguistic oddities, in which language follows fact in stead of the other way around. Putting it that way, I now think Esperanto (or another 'synthetic' language) would probably be the best choice for that. But that leaves the problem that hardly anyone speaks it (me included). <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 09:36, 2005 Jun 8 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe my German is rustier than I thought. I remember trying to explainthe difference between "much" and "many" to some Germans, though. Maybe I just lacked an understanding of the equivalent structure in German. Anyway, I have no doubt that there are other similar situations. They are eluding me right now, though.</dd>
<dd>The problem with saying that whether America is one or two continents is that there is no concensus. Look at the continent page. Look at the German continent page. The French one. None of them give a hard number of continents. For whatever reason, geographers cannot seem to decide what constitutes a continent any more. I remember learning the 7, and later learning about "Eurasia" being a single continent. I'm pretty sure everyone I know was taught the same thing, but I can't guarantee it. But if we can't even agree on how many continents there are, how are we to assert that it's "wrong" to refer to North and South America as two separate continents? I don't think we can make calls like that. Again, that kind of thing is best left to the continent talk page. Until that debate is decided, I feel it's better to give the accepted opinion in English-speaking countries.</dd>
<dd>And yes, I firmly believe that there's no such thing as a language-independent encyclopedia (or anything else in written form). Debates like this show us why it doesn't really work. Esperanto isn't especially neutral, either. It's more than just a little Euro-centric. -- <a href="../../../d/p/a/User%7EDpark_3481.html" title="User:Dpark">Dpark</a> 14:32, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>British and Irish usage would generally be to see them as distinct continents. No-one much uses the "large contiguous landmass" defn, otherwise not only are Europe and Asia the same continent, so's Africa (though there's a nano-article here for that too, admittedly. "Scientifically", one might argue that continental plates are more significant.

<dd>The standard in America, and I believe other English-speaking countries as well, is to teach that there are 7 continents: Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, North America, South America, and Antarctica. More recently, it's been common to teach that Europe and Asia can potentially be regarded as a single continent (Eurasia), but still teaching the 7 continents first. Webster's still says there's 7 continents. -- <a href="../../../d/p/a/User%7EDpark_3481.html" title="User:Dpark">Dpark</a> 04:59, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dpark just reverted almost all of my changes (with no comment here), saying they're confusing. But my purpose was in part to make the text clearer, incorporating the ideas in this discussion. I won't be so childish to revert it again straight away, so could others maybe comment on it? For one, I think my version of the beginning, about the differences between languages, is easier to read. Then there's the rings of the <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_flag.html" title="Olympic flag">Olympic flag</a>. That they "represent the five parts of the world which embrace healthy competition" is indeed taken form that article, but it sounds downright silly to me. I read elsewhere in Wikipedia that they represent the five inhabited continents, and that sounds a lot better and it is in keeping with the lists at the bottom of the <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_flag.html" title="Olympic flag">olympic flag</a> article. And why drop "as one continent"? That clarifies the point (and clarification was my main purpose). I now agree with the first two reverts in the second paragraph (although I corrected the doubling of the 'the'). But the last sentence is just wrong if you ask me. The western hemisphere is the half west of the prime meridian. So to say that (the) America(s) <i>is</i> the western hemisphere is nonsense, it just happens to be the major occupant of it. The <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_hemisphere.html" title="Western hemisphere">western hemisphere</a> article gets this wrong too (I'll start a discussion about that there too). <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 20:14, 2005 Jun 8 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I felt that this was somewhat confusing. It seems to me to be less clear than the other text in explaining the contexts in which <i>America</i> refers to the United States and when <i>America</i> refers to the Americas (the contexts being primarily English vs. non-English). Think the information is pretty much the same, but I felt it read a little less smoothly, and was a little less clear.</dd>

<dd><i>The use of the term</i> America <i>to refer to the the Americas as a whole is also found in English in reference to the pre-Columbian or early Columbian era, such as in the common phrase "<a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Columbus_1595.html" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> discovered America".</i>

<dd>I just edited your edit because the one continent view is more common in languages other than English. And it looks strange to speak of one continent and still use the plural form. I'm still in doubt about the implicit assumption at the beginning that North and South America are two continents. It is one thing to use the plural form Americas in the English language (implicating two continents) but another to implicitly state that there actually <i>are</i> two continents in the 'real world'. So I'm in favour of dropping 'the continents of'. That doesn't really change the meaning of the text and avoids the issue. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 07:13, 2005 Jun 13 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looks good now. I just shortened it here and there for legibility (hope we won't go head to head again over what constitutes clear writing). Just one thing. You say "<i>Traditionally</i> in English-speaking countries, North and South America are considered two continents." But at the beginning of the article it says that the introduction of the plural is relatively <i>recent</i>. I always thought that at first the term America was used for the continent, then the USA became so important for many cultures that it came to represent the entire continent (pars pro totem), so it got the name of the continent (totem pro pars?) (also helped by the problem of what to call the inhabitants of the country). So an ambiguity arose that was resolved by using the plural for the Continent(s). And maybe the notion of two continents was even inspired by this. And that would be very interesting. Language is supposed to represent and thus reflect the world we perceive. But in this case (if this is the case) our perception (or that of English speakers) was influenced by the development of the language. So the perception reflects the language in stead of the other way around. That would be odd. Might there be more instances of this phenomenon? (I have a feeling there are many.) Anyway, to come back to the question: how traditional is the perception of (the) America(s) as two continents? <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 10:17, 2005 Jun 14 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't fully agree with your legibility changes, but I don't disagree with any of them strongly enough to revert them. They're fine.</dd>
<dd>As for how "traditional" the two-continent view is, I guess that's debateable. I wasn't especially fond of the "recent" tag added at the beginning (especially since it replaced "less ambiguous"), but rather than revert, I simply added back the "less ambiguous" modifier. I'm fairly certain that the use of "the Americas", and the idea that the Americas are two continents has been around for quite some time. The National Geographic Society recognizes seven continents. So far as I know, this has always been its stance, since 1888 (when it was founded). I believe this reflects the American opinion since (at least) then, all the way up to now. If nothing else, I'd say that the National Geographic view has had a significant effect on all English-speaking countries, so assuming the 7-continent view goes all the way back to 1888, I'd bet it spread to the rest of the English-speaking world (any parts which didn't share the view, anyway) at least a century ago.</dd>

<dd>I'd say that 1888 is fairly recent, well at least recent enough not to constitute a tradition. If for 400 years before that the singular name (and the one continent concept) were in use, I'd say that is more like tradition.

<p>I'm not especially interested in trying to find a single theory for Wikipedia to put forward, at least not if there isn't a single widely accepted one, but the last sentence in this one strikes me as very, very odd:</p>
<p><i>Yet another theory states that Vespucci named America after Amorica, the continent of ancient Greek and Roman myth. It is assumed that the Italian Vespucci would have been familiar with Roman myth. Early explorers often believed they were rediscovering islands and continents of myth or religion, such as the idea that South America was the Garden of Eden or 'Earthly Paradise'. After Vespucci's death, people forgot where the name America came from, so they changed his name to Amerigo to explain the naming of America.</i></p>
<p>Is there any question of Vespucci's first name? If not, that last sentence is very strange, and extremely misleading. If so, then it's still very strange, and needs to be explained.

<p>I just changed Muke's edit again. I hope this doesn't turn into an edit war, but I feel confident enough to do the edit. First, the ambiguity was already stated in the same sentence and the link only pointed to a dictionary entry that also just restates what the sentence already states. I agree with changing 'politically charged' to 'politically incorrect' (though I'm not sure if the incorrectness is political - it's a geographical issue isn't it?). But I think I can safely state that calling the USA America <i>is</i> incorrect. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> July 6, 2005 07:56 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not going to revert your edit, the current phrasing appears fair. But saying it's incorrect on some absolute level is POV. As mentioned in the removed dictionary link, "America" is both the country and the continent. Indeed, in most contexts outside of things like "Columbus discovered America", the continent is referred to as <i>the Americas,</i> and <i>America</i> by itself refers exclusively to the country. (Try <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=America" class="extiw" title="google:America">Google:America</a> and see how long it takes till you come up with a result where 'America' means 'the Americas'.)</dd>
<dd>Now, it may be that some people may feel that the sense of 'America' as the continent is the only <i>proper</i> sense, but this is 1) a matter of <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prescriptivism.html" title="Prescriptivism">prescriptivism</a>, not a matter of absolute right or wrong, and 2) most likely motivated by offense taken at 'America' referring mainly to the U.S. Promoting language change on the grounds of avoiding giving offence is the most usual meaning of what is <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/politically_correct" class="extiw" title="wikt:politically_correct">politically correct</a> (which in non-technical senses often has little to do with actual politics).</dd>
<dd>At any rate, saying that the United States of America can't call themselves America, because America is originally and properly the continent, is like saying the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Mexican_States_129e.html" title="United Mexican States">United Mexican States</a> can't call themselves Mexico, because Mexico is originally and properly the <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico_City_fae1.html" title="Mexico City">city</a> (which it is).

<p>I completely disagree with this point of view, America is a continent, I am from Mexico and in schools all over the spanish and portuguese speaker nations the term America refers exclusively to the continent. If you want to insist that America is two continents and then you decide to call them North America and South America for the georgraphy then you have to include Mexico and possibly Guatemala and Belice in that called North America. The contradiction comes from the name USA that is United States of America, if you want to insist and say that America is not a continent, then USA should be modified to <a href="../../../u/s/n/USNA_e604.html" title="USNA">USNA</a>, i.e. <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_North_America_a424.html" title="United States of North America">United States of North America</a> TO BE CONSISTENT. In my opinion the problem comes as well from the fact that USA does not have a proper name for their country, USA is only describing where they are and some of their politics. But things would be different if they would not kill all native americans or if they would be a mixed race with the native americans, then they could be United States Navajoes or Apache Republic of North America. Carlos Chavez</p>
<hr />
<p>Ouch! <i>Expecting language to work like logic is fallacious</i>. I strongly resent that, but at the same time I have to admit it's true. At least for natural languages. A language is supposed to express meaning and without logic everything is meaningless. But language necessarily evolves. New findings disprove the logic of the old terminology (examples abound in science). But the old language will persist in everyday speech. However, in this case there are two 'logics' namely those of (the) America(s) being one or two continents, either of which can be said to be true. In the 'one continent' logic the name 'America' is already used for that, so logic dictates it cannot be used for something else. I suppose that using the name 'America' for the country comes from the habit of North Europeans to think about North America when they talked about America. For the Spanish however (and therefore in the Spanish language) the focus was on South America. In that language the name 'America' continued to mean the (one) continent, probably because there wasn't one single country that came to represent the Spanish colonies (although in the case of North America there's also Canada). There's just no simple answer here, so in that sense you're right. Language doesn't quite follow logic. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> July 7, 2005 07:14 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't mind that the article says that calling the U.S.A., America, is politically incorrect. However, by usage it is commonly accepted albeit a misnomer (like calling Native Americans, Indians). The usage is frowned upon but there isn't a perfect alternative.</dd>

<dd>Now this I found interesting- all the English speaker's I talk to (whether from the U.S., U.K., Ireland, etc.) all understand "America" as referring to the U.S.A. Because for sake of simplicity English speaker don't always want to say, the United States of America, each time they just refer to it as America. Most people I talk to from countries where English is not the primary language (ie. Germany, Spain, etc.) all believe that it is, in fact, a mistake to call the U.S.A., America. Many of the neighboring countries all understand that America most commonly refers to the USA whether they agree with it or not (Canadian, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, etc.) Since people rarely need to refer to the entire continents of America, they specify the country of topic- eg. "Guatemala, Honduras, Aruba, El Salvador, Brazil, Canda".</dd>

<dd>Now here's the ironic part of it all, to clarify to most foreigners that they are talking about the U.S.A. and not the other North, South, or Central American countries, they refer to it as "the US" or "The States" even though Mexico's actual name is, Estados Unidos Mexicanos, or United States of Mexican. Most people today, everywhere around the world in fact, refer to the USA as either the US or the United States. The term "(the) America" to refer to the U.S.A. typically sounds old-fashioned and commonly parodied only when referring to immigrants arriving to the country in the 19th and early 20th century. So is calling the U.S.A. the U.S. or United States much more specific? Well, to be argued- but there's not a good alternative now, and I don't think anyone soon is going to rename it something neutral like.. "WestLand" and some people will probably also have problems with that&#160;:P--Acefox 8 July 2005 15:07 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well there is a perfect alternative to '(the) America' to refer to the U.S.A. and that is, ehm ... the U.S.A. (or do I miss your point?). And if you shorten that to 'the U.S.', as many people do, it's actually shorter than '(the) America' (three syllables in stead of four). I suppose you mean the problem of what to call the inhabitants, if not '(the) American' and that <i>is</i> a problem. Some alternatives are given in <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_words_for_American_4bc3.html" title="Alternative words for American">Alternative words for American</a>, but most of these are just plain ugly. I usually use 'U.S. citizens' or '(someone) form the U.S.', but that's awkward. I suppose 'Statesider' is the best alternative; it isn't awkward to pronounce, it isn't ambiguous and most people will know what is meant by it.</dd>

<dd>The point of the 'United States of Mexico' is often used, and in various ways at that, but it's rather lame because people only learn about this through these discussions; nobody refers to Mexico by that name.

<dd>Yes, but the point is no one calls citizens of the United States, "United Statesian" or "United States of American". You can call people from Germany, Germans (even though they refer to themselves as Deutch- and the country's official name Deutchland); or people from Japan, Japanese (even though they refer to it as Nipon in English spelling). What then is wrong with referring to people from the U.S.A. as Americans? It's not 100% correct, but 9 out of 10 people will probably know exactly what you're talking about.

<p><br />
Perhaps English-speaking readers will feel a bit offended by this, but reading some of the definitions in this article and in this discussion, I feel I must point out some things.</p>
<p>First of all, as stated above, America (the continent) is not USA. Some of you might argue that they have the same name, (such as NY state, and NY city) but this is incorrect. The name of America, refering to the nation of USA began to be widely used, mainly by USA residents (which is an important topic) in the first half of the XX century, in a way to increase the reach of its nation Cultural Imperialism and supremacy over the American continent. The reasoning behind this is, "if other people think/say they also live in [America] it will be easier for them to be assimilated to our culture". Another issue raised with this is that all lands in the American continent are "America" - thus making the taking of that land more "natural", as the US have done with Puerto Rico and more blatlantly with (New) Mexico.</p>
<p>Second, the article is terribly wrong at its very first sentence; America is not divided into two parts, but three. North, Central and South America. Central America is composed by all the Caribbean Isles, and continental mass south of Mexico and North of Venezuela.</p>
<p>Third, as implied from the above paragraphs, the term "The Americas", although grammatically correct, is a geographical and political fallacy, in an imperialist attempt to subdue the third world countries to a "mother country".</p>
<p>When adressing two parts of the continent, one still uses the singular form, which serves to conclude that "America" is a term that should be used in the singular, and only to refer the continent. ("The poverty in Central and South America has ...") We have an example of the same logic in Europe: All of us are aware of the differences between Eastern European and Western European countries. Does that mean that there are two Europes? The continent is one, and thus its name should be always used in the singular. The Far East and the Middle East indicate the presence of "two Asias"? ~~LtDoc~~</p>
<p>And reffering to Muke Tever´s comment, a huge mistake has been made. He claims that "in most contexts outside of things like "Columbus discovered America", the continent is referred to as <i>the Americas,</i> and <i>America</i> by itself refers exclusively to the country." + - It shows an obvious non-neutral POV, expressing his opinion trying to make it sound like "general knowledge" something accepted worldwide, which couldnt be more untruthful. In Latin America, and in most "Latin Europe" ("non-English Europe") the term ´America´ refers to the continent as a whole, not as the nation of USA. The term ´The Americas´ is actually not used at all, since the continent is one, and whole. He tries to back this information by says that google will only point to pages where [America] means the nation and [The Americas] mean the continent. He fails to see to see that most internet pages are in the US domains, thus reflecting the same "politically incorrect" views of US residents.~~Lt Doc~~</p>

<dd>North Europeans and US citizens used America interchangibly for the US, because they thought only the US was worth calling America as a nation. For them only a country composed of light white skinned people mattered, because in the racist age in which that usage first appeared (the 19th century mostly) brown american peoples were thought unworthy of consideration as sovereign nations. Indeed many considered their independence not the coming of their political maturity but only the passage of their suzerainty from a weakened tutor (Spain) to another more capable (The UK or the USA). <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalvadorjo_220f.html" title="User:Salvadorjo">Salvadorjo</a> 04:34, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have no idea how you get <i>"How can South America not be part of America?"</i> from my edit. Your edit seems to assert that the claim that the colloquial english language usage of the term "America" to refer to the USA (without qualification) <b>IS</b> politically incorrect. First, colloquial usage is what it is regardless of whether some people consider it to be incorrect, politically or otherwise. Second, it is almost inherent in the nature of political incorrectness that not everyone agrees with the assertion of incorrectness. Hence my edit to claim that "some people consider" the usage to be politically incorrect. And I really think the wikilink should be to the entire phrase <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">politically incorrect</a>, rather than leaving incorrect unlinked. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a>≠<a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 22:42, July 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ah, so you're Bkonrad. Confusing to go by two names. Just as it's confusing for the term <i>America</i> to have two meanings. My point was, If the USA is America, then South America is apparently not part of America. And that's weird. I don't care about the 'political' bit. I claim it is linguistically incorrect. <i>America</i> first meant the entire continent (or <i>continents</i> if you will). Then, in northern Europe and GB in particular, it came to mean the part of it that was most important to people there. Normally, something like that could lead to a change in the meaning of a word, possibly causing problems if not everyone follows (which is always the case initially), but eventually the language will change and <i>America</i> could justifiably be used for the USA. However, there is a perpetual problem here, namely that the term is also used for something different and especially confusing is that the two meanings overlap (America is part of America?). This could only be changed by changing the name of the other thing, but all that's been done in that respect is that some have started calling it <i>the America's</i>, but that's still confusing (America is part of North America? How can the whole be part of a part of it?). And South America hasn't changed names, so there's still a problem. The result would be that South America is not part of America, which is logically wrong and therefore linguistically incorrect. About your last remark: there is no article on <i>incorrect</i>, but I suppose that's not what you mean. It's a result of the presentation with <i>politically</i> in brackets. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 08:14, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps it might be best to rewrite the introductory sentences altogether. They are rather long and convoluted. You seem to be questioning a fundamental slipperiness of human language. It is not logical, never was and never will be. To baldly assert that the way hundreds of millions of native english speakers use a term is simply "incorrect" seems rather audacious and contentious. However, an assertion that "some consider it to be incorrect", while perhaps a bit <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_weasel_terms_687f.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel terms">weaselly</a>, is pretty incontrovertible. I'm not sure what you're saying about there not being an article on incorrect. I'm saying that it is less deceptive to readers to leave the link as "<a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">politically incorrect</a>", rather than "<a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">politically</a> incorrect". <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a>≠<a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 02:09, July 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Indeed, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natural_language.html" title="Natural language">natural languages</a> are not logical in many senses, but that's no excuse to throw in the towel. I agree that the introductory sentence (it's actually just one sentence!) is rather contorted. The reason can be found hereabove; it's the result of long negotiations (now you know why oficial documents are often incomprehensible). Alright then, how about this;</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>The Americas</b> refers collectively to <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_America_93d9.html" title="Central America">Central</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>, as a relatively recent and less ambiguous alternative to the name <i>America</i>, which may refer to either the Americas or the USA. The former useage is now often considered archaic in <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a>, but still in use in other languages, where <i>the Americas</i> is often considered to form a single continent. The use of the term <i>America</i> for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States"><i>United States of</i> America</a> in English and colloquially in other languages is both <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_correctness.html" title="Political correctness">politically incorrect</a> (it may be seen as cultural imperialism) and <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logic.html" title="Logic">illogical</a> (eg, it would place South America outside America). But this use led to the emergence of the term <i>Americas</i> to take away the ambiguity (in English), if not the illogicality.</dd>

<p>Well, the ambiguity was the origin of the emergence of the term <i>the Americas</i> (I assume), so that needs to be mentioned and the illogical consequence that <i>South America is not in America</i> is certainly worth a mention too, I'd say. Which pretty much leads to the above. Except for the <i>politically</i> incorrect bit. Someone else put that in, so I left it in. So that might be dropped now.

<dd>But what you are doing is not <a href="../../../r/e/d/Reductio_ad_absurdum.html" title="Reductio ad absurdum">Reductio ad absurdum</a>, but rather simply shifting frames of reference. In one context, the term America refers to one thing and in another context, the term has a different meaning. Used in context, the term is not especially problematic from a logical perspective. What remains problematic is that some people seem to view using the term to refer to the U.S. as representing some sort of cultural imperialism. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a>≠<a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 16:42, July 23, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The cultural imperialism is covered by the 'politically incorrect' bit (maybe this explanation should be added to it - I have done that above). About having two meanings for 'America', I'd say it's <i>that</i> which inherently shifts the frame of reference (although this is linguistic nitpicking). It is true that most people will have no misunderstandings when using the term 'America' (although I once heard someone accidentally refer to the southern US states as 'South America'). But my point is that having two meanings for one word is wrong <i>from a Logical point of view</i>. And that is what the term 'illogical' refers to. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 09:54, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with DirkvdM, and disagree to Bkonrad that the use of the term "America" referring to the nation of the US is illogical. That is beyond dispute; just follow the thought. America (continent) is divided in three parts, Northern, Central and Southern. A part of the North American subcontinent (therefore a part of America - continent) is the nation of US. Therefore, the nation of US is part of America, the continent. Calling the US "America" is saying that America is part of America, which is illogical. And also very pollitically incorrect, yes. And also insulting to any American (one who lives in the continent of America) that is a non-US resident. What Bkonrad states afterwards, however, makes perfect sense, that the cultural imperialism of the US causes problems with the terminology. (Ive already made a few comments above this, if interested, please read).</p>
<p>As for calling the name of the nation of the U.S. "America" being incorrect, I totally agree. Even if it sounds harsh to english speakers, to non-english speakers is a blunt attempt to colonize them culturally. If you add up all the people in the world, one will come to the conclusion that most people use the term meaning the continent, not the country. Another thing that increases the "incorrectabilty" of the use is that the cultural imperialism imposed by the U.S. is such that it "forces" people to acknoldge them as "Americans" (i.e. citzens of U.S.), thus implying in its use that those who are "american" (born in the U.S.) are the owners of "America" (the continent), that all of America (continent) is the place of rule of americans (born in the U.S.).</p>

<dd>Wikipedia does not advocate for "correct" or "logical" use of the language. It reports what is. Period. If you can present a source for an opinion and attribute the opinion, that is fine, but to baldly label an extremely common usage of a term as incorrect or illogical is pushing a POV and is contrary to Wikipedia guidelines and policies. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a>≠<a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 03:52, July 30, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>True, strictly speaking, but do you truly believe everything in Wikipedia is 'totally sourced'? By that I mean that no interpretation whatsoever takes place.

<dd><i>do you truly believe everything in Wikipedia is 'totally sourced'?</i> Of course not, but it is the ideal, and in cases where things are contentious, it is even more important than for presenting less controversial facts. Your argument based on logic borders on original research. I don't dispute that some, or even many, people find the usage to be incorrect or illogical. However, it is inappropriate for Wikipedia to state without qualification that such widespread and commonly accepted usage <b>IS</b> either incorrect or illogical. The best we can do is state that the usage of the term is contentious and describe the various points of view without presenting any of them as being less correct or less logical than others. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a>≠<a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 14:21, July 30, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I refer to <i>Formal Logic</i> (maybe that should be made a bit clearer), which is just about reasoning. It doesn't care if the assumptions are correct, just if the reasoning is. The prescriptive bits here (the assumptions, called propositions in logic or axioms in Mathematics) are that America is the U.S.A., that the Americas are made up of three parts, two of which are North and South America and, lastly, that America (the USA) is located in North America. This cannot be true. It leads to a falsum. At least, if you apply the rule that South-X is part of X (a subset). Which seems obvious. So there is something wrong with the assumptions (prescriptions, propositions, axioms, whatever). They contradict themselves.</p>
<p>By the way, the double negative you mention is no problem in logic. They cancel each other out. The <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_negative.html" title="Double negative">double negative</a> article states they don't. But then it's about something different, like 'I can't get no sleep'. Logically that means 'I sleep all the time'. But the article says such things are either wrong (which is prescriptive) or acceptable in the way they're meant (which is descriptive). But that's a different matter. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 12:50, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, if that is what you mean by "formal logic", then you prove nothing with your argument except that words can sometimes have more than one meaning. Big deal. You can pick just about any word in the dictionary and make a similar argument. Beyond that, your proposition that "America is the U.S.A." is unsupportable.

<p>Huh? That U.S.A. is America (in the way you say it is sometimes used) is an assumption (the definition that leads to the coming about of the term 'the Americas').

<dd>First, applying logic to a figurative use of language seems rather futile and pointless. Second, your proposition equating USA and America is mistaken. It is not an IS relationship, but rather a figure of speech in which the larger entity stands in for a prominent portion of that entity. The U.S.A is in America (and for good or ill, is probably the most prominent aspect of America for many). Many people casually use the term to refer to the part. Applying standards of logic (whether formal, or whatever it is you think you are doing) really doesn't prove much of anything. <a href="../../../b/k/o/User%7EBkonrad_1453.html" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a>≠<a href="../../../b/k/o/User_talk%7EBkonrad_cb14.html" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 00:41, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I believe this discussion has an obvious historic explanation. After the American continent was <i>discovered</i> by Christopher Colombus, Martín Waldseemüller, a german cartographist, wrote <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmographiae_Introductio_370b.html" title="Cosmographiae Introductio">Cosmographiae Introductio</a>, a book that suggested that the new landmass was not the India, and that it was a new continent that was to be called América, after Americo Vespucci. However, the book and the term took use in most of Europe, but not in Spain or Portugal. That is the reason why, the Spaniard collonies were some of them called Indias even until their independence.</dd>
<dd>The English colonies were called <i>American Collonies</i>, and that term did not mean conflict at all, since they were clearly meant to be the British American Collones. However, when the U.S.A. got it' independence from Britain, the new country kept the term America to refer to itself. At the point of U.S.A.'s independence none of the southern spanishs collonies was independent, they also had names as New Spain, and General Captaincy of Colombia, and the idea of Ameria as a continent and of the people of the collonies as Americans, was not spread at all.</dd>
<dd>With this scenario, it seemed rather reasonable to name the new country United States of America, which describes it's political organization and situation. However this name was fit when it was created, it did not have any reference to the national self of the country, as for example Mexican United States has one.</dd>
<dd>When the Spanish and Portuguese collonies got their independence, the leaders of the rebellion reinvindicated the name of americans for themselves. This people were in touch with the ideas from the French revolution. The notion of America as a continent and not as the U.S.A was widely spread amongst the European, with the exception of Spain and Portugal and more recently of the British, who had already established tight commercial links with it's former collonies. The new countries adopted all names that made a clear reference to their national identity, yet having all being freed by similar movements, they all considered themselves american countries.</dd>
<dd>This two notions of America continued through time, but it is clear that the term America was originaly meant as a continent and not as a country. When U.S.A. got it's name the term America in it was a reference to it's geographic position as understood by the English. This clearly explains that the use of the term America to refer to the United States of America is essencialy incorrect. This does not pose that much of a problem, since it is rather easy to say <i>United States</i> or <i>U.S.</i> or <i>U.S.A.</i> if you don't want to say the rather long complete name. But when it comes to the demonym, an alternative to american must be made, and I think the most correct would be <i>unitedstatean</i>.</dd>
<dd>A more radical thing to do would be to change the country's name, the originally proposed Columbian, would be fine to me it's still present in District of Columbia. But it is hard to see this happening, yet it would solve the problem that the current name gives the country no identity at all.</dd>
<dd>The suggestion of the term Americas is wrought in this confusion is also quite wrong, it doesn't make sense to divide the continent in two. North, Central, and South Americas have always been considered subcontinents. Although North America has the word America in it's name it clearly is not an America by itself, the term clearly refers to a Northern part of the larger America. We never refer to Subsaharian Africa as part of <i>the Africas</i> for example. It would make more sense to say that the word <i>America</i> refers both to the country and to the continent, but as I have already said, that is also wrong.</dd>
<dd>Please do not think I mean that U.S.A. doesn't have a national identity, of course it has one. The only thing I have supported is that that identity is not stated in it's name, and that a demonym should somehow refer to it. The fundamental point for this article is that America is a continent and not a country, and that therefore this article should be renamed. (201.114.91.43 01:45, 30 September 2006 (UTC))</dd>

<p>I think the point is not much whether America is one continent or two. That is a geographical issue. The main point is that the whole "New World" (north and south) was given the name of America in the sixteenth century. And actually the America of those times was mainly the south part (somebody call it "the First America"). So, America is historically and properly the name for the whole landmass.~~Carlos C.~~</p>
<dl>
<dd>Exactly that is what I meant, the whole land mass has always been known as America in the outside, since that is what it was called from the begining. Pretending to divide it into The Americas, can only be understood as a way of redifining the notion of the continent into one such that the United States of America can be an America by it's self.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The whole redefinition is pointless, since as I already pointed out, the terms North America do not mean that those regions are Americas by themselves, they are only the names of the North parts of the larger America. We never refer to Sub Saharian Africa as part of <i>the Africas</i> for example.</dd>

<p>I am from Chile, South America. The first time I heard the term "American" refering to a US citizen was while I was in the USA. I was shocked. In the Castilian-American speaking countries, the term "estadounidence" is the correct way to refer to a US citizen. Also, we are taught that America is a continent (starting in Canada, and ending in Chile). America is not a country. For us, America is not divided into South or North America, however, to specify where a country is, we say "Mexico is in the northern part of America" or "Honduras is in the central part of America". If you look at the history of the US, you can see why they call themselves Americans. They were the first Democratic nation stablished in the American Continent (North and South), I think that's the reason why in english, and even BRE english there isn't a distintion. I want to make this clear, if a US citizen goes to Latin America, please, don't call yourself an American, because there, you are not. For us, "Americans" mean Native Americans, like Mayas, Azstecas, Mapuches, Incas. American has a more ancestral meaning. With this being said, I never use the word American to refer to a US citizen, not even when I speak English, becuase I find it rude.</p>

<dd>I'm here to clear something up. I keep seeing America refered to as one continent in this discussion. That is wrong. North America and South America are two SEPARATE continents (reason it is called the Americas not America). The fact they are connected does not make any difference as Europe and Asia are also connected and it's clear they are two separate continents. -DCR</dd>

<p>The article contains the following sentences that strike me as misleading: "In contrast to the rest of the continent, the majority of Canadian and United States residents are white, English-speaking, and of predominantly European ancestry. The native American Indian tribes of the region have mostly been absorbed, displaced, or wiped out and now form small minorities in these two countries." Although both sentences are true statements about Canada and the U.S., they misleadingly imply that the majority of people in the rest of the countries in America are <i>not</i> of predominantly European ancestry. My understanding is that this varies quite a bit from country to country. For example, a large majority of Mexicans claim at least some Native ancestry, but in some of the South American countries (Argentina particularly comes to mind) the population is almost exclusively of European descent. However, I don't have the information at hand to provide a more accurate statement, so I'm noting this in hopes that someone more knowledgeable will provide a correction. <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussBlau_27b9.html" title="User:RussBlau">Russ Blau</a> <a href="../../../r/u/s/User_talk%7ERussBlau_9049.html" title="User talk:RussBlau">(talk)</a> 11:47, July 12, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The issue of the previous entry was avoided by largely removing it. But now it reads <i>The majority of the American people live in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>.

Canada and the US are the only countries outside Latin America, right? So I changed that a bit, adding some of the previous version as well. How are these countries politically different from Latin American countries? I removed that. Feel free to put it back, but then explain.</p>
<p>Roy da Vinci (RAAAH!) added an interresting point about the US treating Latin America as its back yard. But this needs some more explaining. During the 19th century there was sort of an agreement (I don't know how much this was 'official') between the USA and Europe that their foreign influences should not cause any conflict; the USA would stay out of Eurasia if Europe stayed out of Latin America. WWII changed that, though. And now the USA are everywhere. And was it just 'southern Latin America' (and what is that?), not the whole of Latin America? Also, I'm not sure if this is the right article to point this out, though I can't think of a better one.</p>
<p>Roy da Vinci also alphabetised the nationalities of the colonists of European descent, but that didn't seem to make sense to me, so I reverted that, so he reverted <i>that</i>. It's a very minor thing, but that doesn't mean I'll give way&#160;:) . It seems to make more sense to me to put them in an order of importance (quantitatively speaking, that is). So I'd say Spanish, British, Irish, French, Portuguese, Italian, German and Dutch. Notice my 'modesty' in moving the Dutch way to the back of the list. But more seriously, I'm not quite sure about the order, but it would be enlightening to mention this, so not just to give the list, but also to say in what order they are.</p>
<p>I assume not all blacks are descendants from slaves. There must be more recent immigrants from Africa (such as Eddy Murphy in 'Coming to America'&#160;:) ). Or is this group too small to be worth mentioning?</p>
<p>What is 'from the Balkan' in one word? Balkanese? I circumvented the issue in my edit.</p>

<p>True, not all countries outside the US and Canada are predominantly 'latin language-speaking'. And usually I prefer to stay close to the literal meaning of a word, but here it's not just that most people understand <i>Latin America</i> to mean Central and South America. Consider this. You'd be hard put to find an English-speaking country where only English is spoken. Still, you'd call even the US an English-speaking country, right? (Well, the UK, then...) Similarly, it isn't strange to call the part of America that's predominantly Latin-speaking Latin America. Also, you wouldn't call Quebec part of Latin America.

<p>I daresay that the US English usage of <i>America</i> to refer "the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States of America</a>" is an irritant to (what US folks would call) "non-Americans".

<p>Ya'll need to realize North America and South America are two seperate continents. Are Europe, Asia, and Africa one big continent just because they're connected?

<p>Nope sorry, it is all a single continent. Even the Olympic Comitee places things as 5 continents. ElChompiras</p>
<hr />
<p>Please, Chompiras and the rest of you well-meaning but linguistically confused Latin Americans. It <i>is</i> confusing, so let's break it down by language, shall we?</p>
<p><b>In <i>Portuguese</i> and <i>Spanish</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>América</i> means (1) one continent; (2) the USA, in this order. Ambiguous? So is life, have a little <i><a href="../../../p/a/t/Patience.html" title="Patience">paciencia/paciência</a></i>.</li>
<li><tt>&lt;POV whose="my own" verified="false"&gt;</tt>Native speakers of Portuguese or Spanish dislike the term "the Americas" and consider it at best a useless neologism, at the very worst a harmful transfer of cultural baggage from English-speaking cultural context. If heard in English they flinch, but if heard in P'e or S'ish ("as Américas" or "las Americas") they would verbally challenge the speaker.<tt>&lt;/POV&gt;</tt></li>
</ul>
<p><b>In <i>English</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li><i>America</i> shall mean whatever general usage makes of it, and here the native speakers have a bigger say. One would think that since England was a latecomer into the area, the original meaning in English would have been whatever the near-sounding Portuguese or Spanish word meant. What "America" means in the 21st century, well, ask the speaker. Ambiguous? Yes, words can be ambiguous – just like language.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, languages evolve around popular uses of the terms. So what we Portuguese and Spanish native speakers need to understand is that, however dismal it may be to us, the fact is that the equivalent word in English is <i>not equivalent</i>. Think of it as you will; take comfort in the fact that the order of punctuation and quotes is not the same, either; in English the most correct form is to put the quotes after the punctuation, thus: "hello," and in Spanish or Portuguese you <i>have</i> to write "hola". Or "olá".</p>
<p>I'm not a native speaker of English, so if a native asks me what America means I'll give him the Portuguese/Spanish definitions, since these are also true in English. If she asks me how many continents there are, I'll answer "six," and wait for her "a-ha!" to add, "counting Antarctica, of course." –&#160;<a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETintazul_611a.html" title="User:Tintazul">Tintazul</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/i/n/User_talk%7ETintazul_2783.html" title="User talk:Tintazul">msg</a></sup> 17:18, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As part of the more prosperous <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_North_b779.html" title="The North">northern</a> world, the United States especially has long overshadowed and attempted to manipulate southern Latin America, most notably during the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>While this is certainly interesting, it looks more like an editor just read Chomsky's <i>Necessary Illusions</i> and wanted to make a point. I removed it mostly because it is vague: there are some clear ways that the U.S. has "overshadowed" and "attempted to manipulate," and it might be useful to detail this with more information.</p>
<p>Also, the phrase "southern Latin America" is more incorrect than vague. I have a feeling it was meant to refer to Central America.</p>
<p>I also removed it because its current wording makes it seem like a POV generalization. The North/South division of the world doesn't seem to be especially relevant without further explanation . Additionally it seems to blame the economic position of the United States (and, by association, the ENTIRE "Northern World") for its actions during the Cold War, which is altogether too simplistic. ANYTHING the U.S. did during that time period was complex, and mentioning only economic factors leaves out important political motivations. Actually, the way it's worded doesn't make a motivation clear at all, and doesn't even describe what has happened.</p>
<p>NPOV perhaps would be to explain what is known about the States' political, eco. &amp; soc. relationship with Central America during the Cold War, using its economic position when relevant.</p>

<dd>I'm unsure what the point of the above is; while it is true that interpretations vary regarding whether or not America(s) is one continent or two, with most English sources indicating the latter, it is an incomplete read of the UN scheme. The above reflects more a cultural delineation/grouping, not a geographic one <i>per se</i>. Even <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> highlights this distinction in their entry for the Americas: indicating two continents (North and South America) but also distinguishing <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> from <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-America_aae9.html" title="Anglo-America">Anglo-America</a>.

<dd>I've restored the prior edition; I'm all for clarity (which I think the prior edition was), but I do not see how that has been fulfilled through recent edits. I think the prior edition, which harks of definitions/descriptions in other compendiums (<i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, for instance) sufficiently delineates what the Americas are comprised of in relation to other geographical features. In addition, I do think that the text, in concert with the locator map and terms wikified, allow for a sufficient expatiation beyond that of a merely literal read of the text (e.g., <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antarctica.html" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>).

<dd>I think the "it" is somewhat intentional: a number of usage guides indicate varied usage regarding <i>America</i>, and "it" (which per earlier in the sentence, more properly refers to 'the collectivity') may mean "fairly common outside of [the Americas or the USA]". I thought about substituting said text with 'overseas' (i.e., outside of the Americas) or the like, but (given <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">my location</a>) of course that's not omniscient and I didn't want to get <i>too</i> specific given the variety of sources regarding usage.

<dd>How is it incorrect? I disagree: various sources indicate that America (without modifier) is (fairly) commonly used in this fashion (i.e., used to refer to the WH outside of it in, say, Europe) and again by those in the Americas outside of the USA, but it is most commonly used to refer to the USA inside of it <i>and</i> still by those outside of it ... which is elaborated in the next paragraph. It's all about nuances. I think the current ed sufficiently summarises the situation without hair-splitting ... which is better the purview (though <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">contentiously</a>, I might add) of <a href="../../../u/s/e/Use_of_the_word_American_8aee.html" title="Use of the word American">Use of the word American</a>.

<dd>I'm unsure where the difficulty in comprehension is arising from. No: it is saying that usage of America to refer to the collectivity remains <i>fairly</i> common – not <i>most</i> common – outside of it (the collectivity). The paragraph after that expands further about usage to describe the USA.

<p>That's fine. Moving on:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Whether usage of <i>America</i> or <i>the Americas</i> is preferred, many people living in the Americas refer to themselves as <i>American</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now I've heard many non-US Wikipedians say they refer to themselves as American, but I see no references in any article showing how often this usage occurs outside of this web site. My impression thus far is:</p>
<ul>
<li>that many people living in the Americas <b>want to be able</b> to refer to themselves as <i>American</i> and want to make other people <b>stop being able</b> to refer to US people or things as <i>American</i>; but,</li>
<li>that no one actually calls themselves "American" (in English) or <i>Americano</i> (in Spanish or Portuguese) other than U.S. citizens or residents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, I think we cannot afford to neglect the recent political movement for relaxing immigration laws for Latin American immigrants who want to work and/or live in the US.

<dd>I'm not sure what you mean. Americano is (possibly) fine - It's spanish. Similarly, it's appropropriate to call someone from Munich "Deutsch" but not "Dutch".

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/Talk%7EAmericas_b4de.html" title="Edit section: Proposed new intro">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Proposed new intro</span></h2>
<p>The article currently starts with (or it did when I started writing this):</p>
<dl>
<dd>The <b>Americas</b> commonly refers to the lands of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Hemisphere_4a04.html" title="Western Hemisphere">Western hemisphere</a>, consisting of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continents</a> of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a> with their associated <a href="../../../i/s/l/Island.html" title="Island">islands</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/g/Region.html" title="Region">regions</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I see two problems with that:</p>
<p>1. "the lands of the western hemisphere" would, technically*, include part of Europe, Africa, Macaronesia, etc. Maybe it would work better if the following comma was removed, since it would then unambiguously specify <i>which</i> lands of the western hemisphere are considered "America". But I think it would be better to just get rid of that altogether, due to ambiguity (and also #2 below).</p>
<p>(* note: the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_hemisphere.html" title="Western hemisphere">western hemisphere</a> page talks about a non-capitalized "western hemisphere" as the literal, geographical one, and a capitalized "Western Hemisphere" as a cultural notion referring just to the Americas (which is a distinction I personally had never heard about, but that's irrelevant); therefore, this complicates the sentence, as the expression itself can then assume two meanings, and context doesn't provide obvious clues).</p>
<p>Furthermore, since North America and South America are components of "the Americas", it is a bit of a self-referential definition.</p>
<p>2. It explicitly mentions that the Americas are composed of two continents, which, as we all know, is a contentious issue.</p>
<p>I thought of replacing it with something like this (this is just a draft):</p>
<dl>
<dd>The <b>Americas</b> commonly refers to the lands that separate the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Ocean_bdb7.html" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</a> and the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Ocean_570a.html" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> from each other. It encompasses the lands from <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenland.html" title="Greenland">Greenland</a> in the north to <a href="../../../t/i/e/Tierra_del_Fuego_e386.html" title="Tierra del Fuego">Tierra del Fuego</a> (southern <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chile.html" title="Chile">Chile</a>) in the south.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This way we avoid both using the ambiguous "western hemisphere" term, as well as the debate over whether it's one or more continents.</p>
<p>Comments, suggestions? I didn't want to "be bold" and change that right away, without input from other people. Thanks... --<a href="../../../c/o/t/User%7ECotoco_32b8.html" title="User:Cotoco">Cotoco</a> 20:17, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree with the above. The current opening paragraph is very good and not ambiguous, for three reasons. First, there is nothing wrong with describing a whole (the Americas) by listing its parts (North America, South America, etc.). Second, the definition of the Western Hemisphere as used is the most widespread usage an is not particularly prone to causing confusion. Third, just because people occasionally try to change it to a single-continent definition is no reason to give it prominence. You'll notice that they rarely, if ever, try to discuss it here.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The proposed version comes off as very weasely. My first impression, as a reader, is that the writer has described North and South America while going to great lengths to avoid mentioning them by name. That would give a very odd impression.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>P.S. What's wrong with "New World"? It certainly isn't vandalism. --<a href="../../../y/a/t/User%7EYath_6387.html" title="User:Yath">Yath</a> 20:55, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like Cotoco's version, and it can be followed with an additional sentence explaining that some people consider the Americas to be a single continent (<a href="../../../a/m/e/America_%28continent%29.html" title="America (continent)">America</a>), while others divide it into two (<a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Per Yath, the <i>status quo</i> is sufficient. Why? The current intro harks of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">definitions found</a> in various compendiums, namely the <i><a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_ecd4.html" title="Encyclopædia Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a></i>, and <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merriam_Webster_16db.html" title="Merriam Webster"><i>Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary</i> (11th ed.)</a> ... <i>all</i> of which note the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_hemisphere.html" title="Western hemisphere">Western hemisphere</a> (<i>OED</i> notes "or the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_World_a493.html" title="New World">New World</a>" too ... and accusations of that as vandalism, thus, are hyperbole) and also note the <i>two</i> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continent.html" title="Continent">continents</a>. (For added clarity, it may just be a matter of removing the initial comma from the current edition.) And while I do not disagree with contentions that America is perceived by some as being just one continent, these sources indicate otherwise and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">not <i>one</i> authoritative source has been provided</a> to substantiate this; besides, this <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">viewpoint</a> is accommodated for in the next paragraph and through references of a singular <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landmass.html" title="Landmass">landmass</a>. In addition, the proposed intro is unclear: <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurasia.html" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> also separates the <a href="../../../a/t/l/Atlantic_Ocean_570a.html" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Ocean_bdb7.html" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific Oceans</a> from one another ... just the other way around. Moreover, the proposed intro is rather limiting: the Americas entail more than just geographic entities but, e.g., cultural <a href="../../../r/e/g/Region.html" title="Region">regions</a> that are coincident like <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-America_aae9.html" title="Anglo-America">Anglo-America</a>, et al.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And seeing as how the UN macroregion of the Americas is synonymous with usual reckonings, there's little need to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">unduly emphasise</a> that definition. And please note that a dedicated article – <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas_%28terminology%29.html" title="Americas (terminology)">Americas (terminology)</a> – was crafted to specifically deal with and clarify relevant notions.

<p>Re the assertion (which I agree with): <i>A few alternative theories regarding the landmass' naming have been proposed, but none of them has achieved any widespread acceptance.</i> To me it almost leaves the impression, after the scepticism expressed about the Vespucci theory, that there is no acceptable theory. But there is, the Vespucci theory. Or at least that's the majority view.</p>
<p><b>Richard Amerike</b> theory: This seems the best choice linguistically but that's POV. Critics of this theory though point out that the name would only have described fishing grounds, not the North American landmass. I wonder if that's worth mentioning.</p>
<p><b>Amerrique</b> theory: It's not stated where the word 'Amerrique' originates and I expected to see that. I gather it's purported to be a Mayan word, although I also read: <i>An imaginative anthropologist studying the mayan culture in Yucatan, Le Plongeon had written to Marcou: "The name AMERICA or AMERRIQUE in the Maya language means, a country of perpetually strong wind, or the Land of the Wind, and sometimes the suffix '-ique' and '-ika' can mean not only wind or air but also a spirit that breathes, life itself." (Scholars today, however,recognize that America doesn't derive from the Mayan language,which was not spoken in Nicaragua, though the name almost resembles in sound the Quiche Maya iq'amaq'el meaning perpetual wind).</i> Paraphrased from <a href="http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/COHEN-01.ART" class="external text" title="http://muweb.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/art/COHEN-01.ART" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It sounds like "myth busted" (if true). Does this theory have popular belief in say Central America in the way the Vespucci theory has in the north?</p>
<p>And there is also the Scandinavian: <b>Amteric</b> theory <a href="http://galactica.informatics.sunysb.edu/surgery/america.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://galactica.informatics.sunysb.edu/surgery/america.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>&#160;:)</p>
<p>In short all these theories are territorial and/or nationalistic. I wonder if it's worth acknowledging that. The Vespucci claim for the naming of America is dominant because it's the view of the majority of people who live there. <a href="../../../h/a/k/User%7EHakluyt_bean_a25f.html" title="User:Hakluyt bean">Hakluyt bean</a> 18:19, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How prevalent or accepted are these alternate theories; are they salient and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>?

<dd>The thing with prevalence is... where are we talking about? I would say treat theories fairly; summarize evidence from proposers and detractors. Then note popularity. On verifiability the three theories already in the article are verifiable and I'm happy with them. What's missing atm is a statement that "Vespucci" is the most popular theory, and why. It seems to be just assumed. To people outside the United States on the basis of the article at present this may be puzzling.

<p>Ok, we've had a slow edit war over whether to include this term in the introduction. I've seen claims that it's biased, but no explanation yet. As far as I know, it's simply common term used to describe the Americas, especially in biology, e.g. "old world monkeys" vs. "new world monkeys" and so forth.

<p><br /></p>
<p>I think it's quite appropriate, since you'll find that reference in most of the first entries in the "Archivos de Indias" in Seville. It is a term of reference of the continent, the same way we used to say long ago "Las Américas" in plural, but nowadays it's not in fashion and we don't use it anymore in Spain. Well, I agree it should be noted that europeans called it the New World, I'm sure the aztecs and incas didn't called themselves the New World,&#160;;).</p>
<p>I was thinking ot including a little more information on the discussion on the term "America". It seems everybody forgot to mention the book "Las venas abiertas de latinoamerica" of Eduardo Galeano, a uruguayan journalist/historian ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Galeano" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Galeano" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Galeano</a> ). In this book he strongly critisices the appropriation of the term by the US, making the americans of south america "second class americans". So since this has become a moral issue, I think someone should include the other version of the story, latin america's point of view, very well described in the work of this man. I would do it myself but I'm terrible with pc's and I'd probably end up erasing the whole document!! Lol* however, i'll check in a while and if it's not included, I'll do my best. <a href="../../../n/e/m/User%7ENemi_kaunistytto_e2eb.html" title="User:Nemi kaunistytto">Nemi</a> 13:51, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Deep, give it a rest. Everyone knows Canada and the States are in the Americas. America (continent) or America (New World) would both violate Wikipedia's naming convention which requires that things be at the name they're most commonly known as in english. The Americas is not a neologism and you know that perfectly well.

<p>This is the current and only flag of the Americas that were ever produced, the problem is for non-american political reasons they are hard to find. I have some examples of the British version of the flag with the Union Jack in the corner at <a href="http://themidlands.net/victoria/index.php?title=British_America" class="external free" title="http://themidlands.net/victoria/index.php?title=British_America" rel="nofollow">http://themidlands.net/victoria/index.php?title=British_America</a> but can't find any more sources which displays the flag of the Americas.

<dl>
<dd>Fortunately, it has long since been expunged from this article, but I should point out that this flag (or at least the original version with the Union Jack, was made up by me for a goofy web comic I draw, and the wiki you cite is a wiki about the fictional setting of the comic. As dragons and elves are not features of the historical British Empire, I don't think that Victoria is a very authoritative source. By the way, Intuitionz, you seem to have uploaded an image at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Cdnamerica.GIF" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Cdnamerica.GIF" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Cdnamerica.GIF</a> saying that you, as the creator, are releasing it into the public domain.

<dd>Because they are "<i>more or less</i> discrete masses of land" (Lewis, Martin W. &amp; Kären E. Wigen.

<p>Please try to remember that even though there is a section on the term <i>American</i>, this article is about the Americas. There is no need to focus on the different names of citizens of the United States. An article already exists for that purpose (<a href="../../../u/s/e/Use_of_the_word_American_8aee.html" title="Use of the word American">Use of the word American</a>), so this article doesn't need terms like <i>gringo</i> or <i>yanqui</i> which have nothing to do with an article on the Americas. Only when conflicts exist between the expected usage of the term <i>American</i> as translated (or a variant) should it be noted (i.e. americano or americana in Spanish does not have all of the same meanings as American in English and norteamericano or norteamericana are very context sensitive).

<p>The use of the word "Nations" in this article as a heading is incorrect (see <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation.html" title="Nation">Nation</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">State</a>). It should be either States or Countries. States refers to sovreign governments, while nations refers to groups of people who have a shared identity (for example the Kurds or the Scottish). States would be the preferable word, though I think countries would be acceptable as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nations is actually fine here, but so is states, or countries <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 16:40, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I will note as someone involved in political science that "Nation" has a particular meaning in the English language that has nothing to do with countries, so is not at all acceptable as used here. The United States and Brazil, for example are not nations, but are states. --<a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBremkus_6c78.html" title="User:Bremkus">Bremkus</a> 00:44, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That simply isn't true. Brazil and America are definitely nations in English. Political scientists can no easier demand that English usage be changed so we don't say this than I as a <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physics.html" title="Physics">physicist</a> can refute that <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_Laurie_9d51.html" title="Hugh Laurie">Hugh Laurie</a> <a href="../../../w/o/r/Work_%28physics%29.html" title="Work (physics)">works</a> as an actor is incorrect because work has a specific meaning that doesn't apply to what he does. <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> is not prescriptive. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 15:15, 20 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I will note that in English the words Nation, State, and Country have a distinct meaning, even though most people in everyday language conflate their meaning. A country is a geographical entity. A State is a political entity. A Nation is a group of people that share a common identity, and it is not a political entity. It may or may not be linked to a state or country. For example, the Japanese people are a nation, and have their own state (thus being a nation-state). However, the Kurds are also a nation, and are an example of a stateless-nation. Another example would be Indian nations throughout the Americas which lack their own states. The United States is not a nation, but is a Conuntry or State. Some would argue that the American people could possible be called a nation, but because most nations share a homogeneous ethnic identity, this is a hard arument to make. As I said, see <a href="../../../s/t/a/State.html" title="State">State</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country.html" title="Country">Country</a>, and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nation.html" title="Nation">Nation</a>.--<a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBremkus_6c78.html" title="User:Bremkus">Bremkus</a> 23:15, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Okay, I'll start by admitting one of the things I really dislike about the article is that is says almost nothing about the Americas - it only says things about how the Americas are named, or referred to. The article blows, because there's not <b>History of the Americas</b>, <b>Geography of the Americas</b>, <b>Inhabitants of the Americas</b>, <b>Biology of the Americas</b>, <b>Politics of the Americas</b> and so on. The <i>Demography</i> section is the only section that actually tells me anything <i>about</i> the Americas that I could actually go out and see today. So I moved it to the top, and the trivia sections down a bit. Is there really any rational for moving the usual information to the bottom? I can sort of buy moving "Naming" to the top, as it's basically a very tiny "History" section, so <i>History</i> - <i>Demographis</i> - <i>Trivia</i> ordering can probably be easily enough justified. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 15:24, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi! Sorry about that -- it makes sense to me to structure information in this article (and other continents/groupings) similar to how it is arranged in country articles.

<dd>Perhaps this article lacks other sorts of details because they (should) really live in specific articles about other entities in the Americas: e.g., <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>; also compare with <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurasia.html" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>.

I believe there is also a country wikiproject, which outlines an overall structure for country articles but is rather mum on this naming point.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I agree that North America is a subcontinent of America, the same as Central and South America. In my opinion, the word <i>Americas</i> is kind of confusing and does not reflect what everyone knows about the existence of only five continents in the world (without considering Antartica). History facts reveal the discovery of one sole continent, America. Besides, that happened in La Espaniola, Dominican Republic. We have also been informed of a most archaic term for America; the West Indies (or <i>Indias Occidentales</i> in Spanish). This applies to everyone and most importantly, everywhere. Cultural differences, however, have contributed to the separation of the continent once known as America. For instance, when most of southern United States was under Spanish and Mexican power and control, America still remained being the common usage among the people of this present area. We also make differences between Latin and Anglo-Saxon America, but, we must keep in mind that those terms comprehend a cultural ending, not geographical. Americas, in this sense, refers only to those regions of America that are separated by different types of things, such as language, economic development, culture, traditions, races, and society. In conclusion, I agree that North America should not be mistaken for a continent, when <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discovery_of_America_5fed.html" title="Discovery of America">history</a>, and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography.html" title="Geography">geography</a> do not do so. The same happens when we separate Europe into Western and Eastern Europe, which does not mean that they ought to be considered as two separate continents, for the same reasons explained above. Nevertheless, my advice is to correct the already existent article, by putting subcontinemt instead of continent, and delete the present one or, ultimately, join both articles and make one out of them. --<a href="../../../g/u/s/User%7EGustavo86_a547.html" title="User:Gustavo86"><i>Gustave</i></a> - <a href="../../../g/u/s/User_talk%7EGustavo86_294a.html" title="User talk:Gustavo86"><i><b>May I help you?</b></i></a> 23:16, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In common English usage (at least amung the vast majority of people whose first language is English) North and South America are seperate (and they are far more seperate than Europe and Asia), and as this is an English encyclopaedia that is what should be used (with an explanation of other uses) and the current title reflects that. Another arguement is that geologically speaking, they are seperate continents. There is also the added benefit of disambiguation, as in at least the US (and, from personal experiance, contrary to the article, Canada, I can't say anything about other English speaking regions) the unqualified term America means the USA and while that is not a compelling reason in and of itself, it just contributes to the other reasons.<a href="../../../s/a/y/User%7ESay1988_c500.html" title="User:Say1988">say1988</a> 02:07, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

It's originally America.. for the hole continent.. but that doesn't matter.. right or wrong this is an english article, so put the bloody name that english speakers use. period <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by DunkelMeister (<a href="../../../d/u/n/User_talk%7EDunkelMeister_5175.html" title="User talk:DunkelMeister">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DunkelMeister_403e.html" title="Special:Contributions/DunkelMeister">contribs</a>) 09:59, 18 March 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>
