<p>Should contestants that do not have their own articles be redirected to their section on this page? It's already been done for Rhonetta Johnson (consensus: merge/redirect).

<dd>Okay, I'll change all the red links that say such - if there is still a conflict, I'll make it (American Idol singer).

<p>Given that these contestants have been with the show for some time, and many will continue to be with the show for several weeks, should not the decision to terminate their articles and stubs be given some discussion? It seems rather major to me, especially since a number of people worked on those articles and stubs, and I think the information actually had its uses. Instead of nixing it all completely, maybe a page with all the data on the semifinalists would be a better alternative, with short summaries and links for those contestants with longer pages. It just seems a bit counterinformative not to have more on the semifinalists, and now that we only have information for a select few, it doesn't feel very neutral. People will want to know about the semifinalists if they watch the show, and even if the information is very little and only enough for a stub, it's at least a start. Besides which -- when people who aren't familiar with Wikipedia click on the links for the semifinalists and are sometimes directed to more pages, sometimes to the top of the article, it's confusing. <a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperial_8a15.html" title="User:Emperial">Emperial</a> 14:03, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Furthermore, the reasons given for some article stub removals ("not worthy" and similar) seem to lack neutrality to me. There is an interest and a reason for having information on semifinalists *during the semifinals*. Wikipedia should be informative for AI viewers and voters, even if the information we have is very limited. <a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperial_8a15.html" title="User:Emperial">Emperial</a> 15:32, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It doesn't really matter to me one way or another, but performing on one of America's most watched television shows, in front of millions of people, seems pretty notable to me. If these contestants were to walk down the street, they'd be recognized by more people than, say, <a href="../../../k/a/d/KaDee_Strickland_6255.html" title="KaDee Strickland">KaDee Strickland</a> (a bit-part actor who was on the front page as a featured article back in December). One thing I am going to do is fix some of the looping links. -- <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterHand_55c4.html" title="User:MisterHand">MisterHand</a> 17:40, 25 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you; even many contestants cut in Hollywood are notable enough for an article in my view. They're presenting and performing on a stage with over 40 million people watching, and if you search around on the Internet, fan clubs and boards exist today even for some of those early eliminated contestants! <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyC83_1bc7.html" title="User:CrazyC83">CrazyC83</a> 20:43, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Relevant information about the semifinalists can and should be given on the appropriate season article page. There simply isn't any independently important information about them if being a semifinalist is all that they've accomplished. And yes, some people still remember them; I personally remember Lisa Leuschner, and was disappointed when she was cut, but compare google hits for her name<a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-08%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22lisa+leuschner%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=20&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;newwindow=1&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2006-08%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=%22lisa+leuschner%22" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> (only less than half of which are unique hits) with those for <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leah_LaBelle_ee6f.html" title="Leah LaBelle">Leah LaBelle</a>, the <i>first</i> of the 12 finalists to be voted off that same season.<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2006-08,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22leah+labelle%22+%22american+idol%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2006-08,GGLG:en&amp;q=%22leah+labelle%22+%22american+idol%22" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> The divide in coverage is staggering. I'm very confident that anyone who achieves no fame outside of being a semifinalist (let alone a semisemifinalist) would be deleted or redirected if put to a vote on AFD today.

<dd>I think because people seem to be willing to waste the time to have the articles for the time being and expand them with each new episode, and it doesn't hurt Wikipedia to have the articles while individuals are interested in updating and maintaining them. On the flip side, there's the question of why waste time redirecting the pages when people just keep adding them? Why not wait to make them redirects after the semifinals end and everyone stops caring? In the meantime I think we have a duty to let people know about the semifinalists as much as possible since they're current, and this is a current event article. The 2006 Olympics pages have numerous stubs and empty links for various international athletes who haven't even won any medals, just because they were at the Olympics. Given viewer coverage of AI versus individual Olympic events, it seems to make sense that AI semifinalists deserve stubs for the time being, too. --<a href="../../../e/m/p/User%7EEmperial_8a15.html" title="User:Emperial">Emperial</a> 00:41, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree with the idea that semifinalists should have some other notable thing to their name besides being a semifinalist to get an article. Not all semifinalists should get articles, but I think that those finalists who make it to the final round should all get articles. --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_5794.html" title="User:Revolución">Revolución</a> <small><font color="green"><u><b><a href="../../../r/e/v/User_talk%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_6ee1.html" title="User talk:Revolución">hablar</a></b></u></font></small> <small><font color="green"><b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Revoluci%C3%B3n_ac29.html" title="Special:Contributions/Revolución">ver</a></b></font></small> 00:53, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I finally tracked down some previous deletion discussions on <i>Idol</i> contestants—they are notably unfavorable to <i>finalists</i>, let alone those who didn't even make it that far. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_A.J._Gil_84de.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/A.J. Gil">A.J. Gil</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_EJay_Day_24aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/EJay Day">EJay Day</a> had no consensus, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mario_Vasquez_6c21.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mario Vasquez">Mario Vasquez</a> was redirected (though later unredirected), <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Consantine_Maroulis_fb7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Consantine Maroulis">Constantine</a> (under a misspelling) was deleted (though later recreated), and even <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Carrie_Underwood_8df6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Carrie Underwood">Carrie Underwood</a> was merged and redirected when she was also just a wee finalist. These were all less than a year ago, and are hardly a sign that Wikipedians in general consider <i>Idol</i> to automatically bestow notability on all those whom are touched by it. The deletion discussion for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Kimberly_Caldwell_73ce.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kimberly Caldwell">Kimberly Caldwell</a> was more favorable, but mainly based on the fact that she's had a post-<i>Idol</i> career.</dd>
<dd>Also, regarding those who were "notably" bad, or otherwise cut prior to even the semifinals, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rhonetta_Johnson_a743.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rhonetta Johnson">Rhonetta Johnson</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_David_Hoover_e5b4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/David Hoover">David Hoover</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Leroy_Wells_1b8d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Leroy Wells">Leroy Wells</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mary_Roach_83b5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mary Roach">Mary Roach</a> were all deleted or redirected.</dd>
<dd>I think even now if one of the less popular finalists were to be listed on AFD, the vote would be close; a semifinalist would be killed. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 02:10, 26 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I still think that <i>while the semifinals are running</i> we should endeavor to provide as much information on the semifinalists as is useful. After the semifinals, who cares? They disappear into nothingness.

<p>I was under the impression that the producers were making no distinction between the Bottom 3 and the Bottom 2 in these early stages of the finals. In other words, they did not make it aware in Week 1 whether Ace Young or Lisa Tucker actually got the 11th-most votes. All the audience was told is that Ace was safe first, then Lisa, but that was not necessarily the actual order of finish. Therefore, in the elimination chart, no distinction should be made, except that both Ace and Lisa were in the Bottom 3.

<p>I think bottom two should be taken out, and we need to look no farther than the results show from 4/19 for a reason why. Paris was told that she could have a seat, but it was not specified whether she had the third lowest votes or not. Same with Chris, the only thing clear is the lowest vote total unless announced by Ryan Seacrest. I guess we should probably change the wording of the table, even if the bottom two is implied.

<dd>I was about to bring up this issue. I think we should make the distinction between "bottom 3" and "bottom 2" (or perhaps word it some other way). The information on who was "saved" first should be kept, but a note at the bottom could clarify that it is not always known whether the last saved member of the bottom 3 necessarily received the second-lowest number of votes. Also, consistency is important here, as right now there is one case (last week's) where both bottom 3 and bottom 2 are listed as bottom 3, and I saw at least one instance in which the notes on the individual contestant bios did not match the chart. -<a href="../../../d/i/v/User%7EDividedByNegativeZero_aca4.html" title="User:DividedByNegativeZero">VJ</a> 04:42, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is there any reference for the statement that Taylor Hicks received the highest percentage of votes in the May 16 vote (33.68%)? (Comments and calculations in the Trivia section.) Only Elliott Yamin's name was associated with one of the percentages on the results show. If there's no confirmation that Taylor Hicks was the top vote-getter, the entire subsection should be eliminated. 208.20.220.72 21:19, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No source cited. Looks like original research, speculation, or wishful thinking. Struck references based on the speculation. -- 71.255.35.247 02:37, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"During the East Coast transmission of the May 2 show, Paris Bennett was bleeped while singing Mary J. Blige's "Be Without You" at the exact point where the word 'shit' appears in the lyrics. However, Fox confirmed that the song was not bleeped when it was broadcast on the West Coast. Forum posters on the West Coast said Bennett sang the radio edit of the song which excludes the word 'shit', leaving viewers nationwide wondering why Bennett was precensored during the earlier live transmission."</p>
<p>Paris Bennett did not announce that she was singing the radio edit of Mary J. Blige's song "Be Without You". With the show running live on the East coast, the producers expected the word "<a href="../../../s/h/i/Shit.html" title="Shit">shit</a>" to appear in the performance. Because this was not pre-recorded, there was no way to foresee what was to come. Obviously, the crew reacted and prepared to censor that moment, in case she had done so. No profanity was heard during the performance, and so the producers left the censorship out of the West Coast show, three hours later.</p>
