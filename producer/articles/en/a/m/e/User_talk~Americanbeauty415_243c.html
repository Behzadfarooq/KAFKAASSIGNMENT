<p>It seems like you're having issues getting to the pdf from the census bureau. I suspect this is a problem with your computer's configuration, or the network connection you are hooked up to. Could you describe your problem in more detail, and perhaps I can help you troubleshoot? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJereKrischel_dc08.html" title="User:JereKrischel">JereKrischel</a> 18:32, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It sounds like perhaps we can find more accurate wording then - your issue is not that ths source is broken, but that the commentary regarding the source is not completely accurate. Let's add in your thoughts, and try to keep the source, and the indication that in 1990, eurasian families represented the greatest proportion, even though this might not be true for the population at large (which may have grown up and no longer be in families)...would that work? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJereKrischel_dc08.html" title="User:JereKrischel">JereKrischel</a> 18:43, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Please, let's work on characterizing the census quote properly, and add any counter references you have. Just deleting the reference is not really appropriate. Hopefully you've seen the "note" I added to the citation, indicating it represents "families" not total multiracial population. Let's expand on that until you approve, okay? --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJereKrischel_dc08.html" title="User:JereKrischel">JereKrischel</a> 18:50, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the "thesis":</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here's the quote:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>Census data indicate that the number of children in interracial families grew from less than one half million in 1970 to about two million in 1990. In 1990, for interracial families with one White partner, the other parent was Black for about 20 percent of all children, the other parent was Asian for 45 percent, and the other parent was American Indian and Alaska Native for about 34 percent.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>This means that in 1990, out of a total of 100%, 45 percent of these families were white/asian, 34% were white/native, and 20% were white black. The statement, "white and Asian mixes made up the largest proportion" is true. If the statement was "white and Asian mixes made up the majority", that would be false.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Hopefully this clarifies things - the statement being made is regarding proportion, not absolute majority. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJereKrischel_dc08.html" title="User:JereKrischel">JereKrischel</a> 18:54, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Can you add the CSU census quotes, rather than changing the literal, word for word quote from the census source cited? We can't just attribute words (even if more accurate) to people that didn't explicitly say them. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJereKrischel_dc08.html" title="User:JereKrischel">JereKrischel</a> 19:00, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please CITE the document you mentioned on my talk, and add something to the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, even excluding pacific islanders (approx. 5% of the Asian/Pacific Islander pop in 1990) <a href="http://www.census.gov/apsd/wepeople/we-4.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.census.gov/apsd/wepeople/we-4.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.census.gov/apsd/wepeople/we-4.pdf</a>, the proportion of white/asian mix would only drop 2.5%, still being the largest proportion. --<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJereKrischel_dc08.html" title="User:JereKrischel">JereKrischel</a> 19:05, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you very much for your edits to Blasian. Quite a few folk have been putting completely unsubstatiated racial stereotypes (re: asian men/black women, genetic "averaging", etc) in these mixed-race articles, and your vigilance is appreciated.

<p>Although admittedly the line "people with mixed Asian and European origins have become synonymous with exotic glamour in some cultures." is probably not needed in the article dealing with <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurasian_%28mixed_ancestry%29.html" title="Eurasian (mixed ancestry)">Eurasians</a>, I find it odd that you did not remove the statement "Regardless, both are two beautiful cultures, when blended create a being of exquisite and exotic beauty." in the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blasian.html" title="Blasian">Blasian</a> article.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Denacali.jpg</b>. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the media meets the criteria at <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>, use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>.

<p>If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too.

Note that any unsourced and untagged images will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_speedy_deletion_81ee.html#Images.2FMedia" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion">criteria for speedy deletion</a>.

<p>Hi. In response to your message left on my talk board:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a 'move' function that allows page moves without the need to create an entirely new article. Please use this function in future - duplicate articles only confuse people!</li>
<li>You are a puppetmaster - I'm willing to say that much. You are using more than one Wikipedia account to edit with, and I will bet my entire edit history on it.</li>
<li><i>Judging from your fictional assumptions</i>- My assumptions are not fictional, I'm afraid - and they're not just mine, either. <i>and ability to overlook "inappropriate" articles that existed long before I touched them,</i> - I'm afraid that the articles only recently came to my attention, If you'll look at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HawkerTyphoon_9691.html" title="Special:Contributions/HawkerTyphoon">my contributions</a> you'll see that I routinely target hundreds of artciles a day for vandalism.<i>it's obvious you are not a detective. You're an editor, so I'm going to kindly tell you and the rest of your gorginotts to stay off my ass and do what your job requires you to do. CORRECTLY MONITOR THE BOARDS.</i> Please see WP:Personal Attacks. I've got the same job as you - to make sure that Wikipedia is used sensibly and with thought towards others. You've removed warnings from your talk page, removed speedy deletion templates, and resorted to personal attacks and sockpuppets to get your point across. However legitimate your edits may now be, your behaviour in 'enforcing' them is in violation of Wikipedia policy, and that's why I'm targetting you specifically. <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawkerTyphoon_6353.html" title="User:HawkerTyphoon">HawkerTyphoon</a> 13:47, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello Americanbeauty. Recently I've been noticing a number of edits from you where you assert that <a href="../../../m/e/d/User%7EMedia_anthro_2d1c.html" title="User:Media anthro">User:Media anthro</a> is posing as an editor. I feel that you are in rather significant confusion about our terminology. <i>Everybody</i> who edits Wikipedia, including you and Media anthro, are known as <i>editors</i>. Administrators (also called sysops) are a distinct group of editors who the Wikipedia community have assessed and approved to have access to extra tools such as block/unblock, delete/undelete and protect/unprotect. I feel that you may be confusing <i>editors</i> with <i>administrators</i>. Media Anthro never posed as an administrator; he is, in fact, an editor. When you have a question such as this, you don't need to ask it in multiple places. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yanksox&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94234671" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Yanksox&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94234671" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_investigation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94225176" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_investigation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94225176" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Suspected_sock_puppets&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94224296" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Suspected_sock_puppets&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94224296" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94226652" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94226652" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Asking it in one of those places would have been sufficient.</p>
<p>Additionally, I noticed <a href="../../../m/e/d/User_talk%7EMedia_anthro_011e.html#Mulatto" title="User talk:Media anthro">here</a> you accused <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">User:SqueakBox</a> of being Media athro's sockpuppet. This is a serious allegation and a violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">no personal attacks</a> if you do not have substantial evidence to back it up. SqueakBox is a long-term editor with over 20,000 edits and it is inappropriate to make such allegations in such a casual manner without citing evidence. Please don't do that again.</p>
<p>In future, if you wish to know if an editor is an administrator, you may view the <a href="../../../l/a/_/WP%7ELA_1d59.html" title="WP:LA">list of administrators</a> or you may search the admin group on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Special%7EListusers_21e7.html" title="Special:Listusers">user log</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, you chastised Media Anthro for replying to your message on his talk page rather than on yours. It is, in fact, completely acceptable for an editor to reply to messages in either location. Many editors, including many administrators, will reply to messages left on their talk page in the same place because they prefer to keep conversations in tact. For the same reason it was acceptable for Squeakbox to also comment on Media anthro's talk page. There is no hard rule for where to reply to messages. If you leave someone a message, it is best to watchlist their talk page for a little while so you can see if they reply there.</p>
<p>I hope this information may help to straighten out some of your confusion. If not, please feel free to let me know and I will try to help. <b>Sarah Ewart</b> 10:09, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
