<dd>Well, I tried give a neutral description of what he does: "He has written extensively about the role of faith in government." I don't think that sentence gives an endorsement or criticism to his position; it just says he has written a lot about faith in government. The previous description seemed more critical of his ideas.

<p>CNN has recently given free reign to David Frum and Frederick Kagan to speak about Iraq Policy on behave of the 'American Enterprise Institute' without having guests with alternate views to their statements of fact.</p>
<p>I think this is about the word "institutional." This means that when Fred Kagan basically wrote the (retardly) so-called "Surge" strategy, he could advocate personal policy positions independent from the AEI as a group.</p>

<p>Joshua Muravchik (a resident scholar of AEI) was National Chairman of the Young Peoples Socialist League 1968-1973.</p>
<p>Type in "Young Peoples Socialist League, Vietnam war" in google, and see with your own eyes, in your own head what Neo-Cons like Muravchik were espousing during the Vietnam conflict. Below is an excerpt from their website.</p>
<p>"Throwing itself into the growing movement against the unjust war in Vietnam, the YSA quickly grew to become one of the largest and most effective radical youth groups in America. Despite competition from various ultra-left, Maoist and Stalinist groups, the Young Socialist Alliance, through coalitions such as the Student Mobilization, was able to build a mass youth movement against the war in Vietnam around the slogan of “Bring the Troops Home Now!” This was in contrast to the slogans of “Drive the G.I.s Into the Sea” and “Tune In, Tune Out” of its less serious competitors."</p>
<p>Agree or Disagree with Vietnam or the Iraq Wars. You have to hand it to the Neo-Cons for their absolute gut-wrenching Chickenhawkism. More Brass than a marching band.</p>
<p>And the Irving Kristol Award should merit a mention on the article for AEI.</p>

<p>Muravchik and several other prominent neo-cons such as Irving Kristol famously turned their back on far-left liberalism before becoming conservatives. Muravchik's activities as part of a Socialist movement during the Vietnam War are therefore hardly relevant to judging the ideological bent of the American Enterprise Institute today. It is easy to see that many of the Institute's scholars and supporters possess a largely conservative social and economic outlook, however, it is worth noting that several prominent scholars such as Norm Ornstein and Ben Wattenburg are registered Democrats and often lean far to the left on certain issues, making the partisan affiliation of the Institute a bit harder to define.</p>
<p>What happened to their website? Seems like a few right wing websites are disappearing (also coalition for diplomacy in iran)</p>

<p>This category lists notable groups and persons who are skeptical about the scientific consensus on global warming as described in the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a> article. The AEI deny that they are "global warming skeptics", but they define "skeptic" in a very narrow way.

<dd>Why is this definition narrow? The AEI authors say they don't dispute the science, merely the policy recommendations proposed to deal with the problem. Could you please supply a citation that shows AEI disputes the science of global warming? You may be correct in saying that AEI should be called global warming skeptics, but when the organization specifically denies the charge you need to cite your sources. --<a href="../../../d/_/m/User%7ED_Monack_6280.html" title="User:D Monack">dm</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/_/m/User_talk%7ED_Monack_f4c7.html" title="User talk:D Monack">(<i>talk</i>)</a></sup> 06:27, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was the person who posted the link to the BBC documentary regarding the uncontroverted Zionist agenda of the AEI. For some time now, I have fought tooth-and-nail with Wikipedia editors who, on one hand, have no qualms with citing as authority publications that are candidly Zionist, yet on the other hand, refuse to accept any critique of Zionist publications, entities, etc., even when they come from sources as credible as the BBC.</p>
<p>With all due respect, I hope that you people are actually advocating for Zionism because if you are simply that uninformed, then you really have no business editing a resource as widely used as Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_38.118.3.41_3e87.html" title="Special:Contributions/38.118.3.41">38.118.3.41</a> (talk) 20:10, 1 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>I may have missed it, but the BBC documentary seems to be criticizing the AEI for being neo-con hawks, not for being Zionists. Can you give us a quote where they make the criticisms you mention? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 20:31, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I cut it because there was no allegation of criticism in the paragraph. The video may criticize AEI for being a zionist organization (though Will Beback suggests otherwise), but the paragraph did not make such a statement. If there is a reasonable criticism of AEI for being zionist, fine. That is not what was written. <a href="../../../r/k/e/User%7ERkevins_a5af.html" title="User:Rkevins">Rkevins</a> 02:59, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Rkevins, you are gravely incorrect. My post, verbatim, was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The American Enterprise Institute <i>has been <b>criticized</b></i> for its pro-Zionist policy agenda. In a May 18, 2003, BBC broadcast entitled, The War Party, Meyrav Wurmser, wife of AEI member David Wurmser and member of The Hudson Institute, candidly admitted that “many of us are Jewish” and that “all of us, in fact, are pro-Israel, some of us more fiercely so that others.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If that is the only reason why the post was removed, how could you have missed this?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The BBC merely noted that AEI advocates Zionism. It wasn't a criticism. Every think tank takes positions on controversial subjects. In the United States, being pro-Israel is well within the normal political discourse. A majority of Congress could be accurately called "Zionist". Calling it a criticism is taking sides on the issue which violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wp%7Enpov.html" title="Wp:npov">NPOV</a>. The section should be removed. --<a href="../../../d/_/m/User%7ED_Monack_6280.html" title="User:D Monack">dm</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/_/m/User_talk%7ED_Monack_f4c7.html" title="User talk:D Monack">(<i>talk</i>)</a></sup> 15:20, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It was a statement from a WSJ editorial about your employer. Editorials are (of course) opinion pieces, and should be considered separately from factual content. It would be entirely appropriate to put the WSJ editorial into a separate "commentary" section if you wish. If I may say, your characterization of an opinion piece from a highly partisan source as "fact" suggests that your personal <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> in this matter is clouding your judgment. <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERaymond_arritt_89f0.html" title="User:Raymond arritt">Raymond Arritt</a> 01:44, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The fact in question meets the standards of <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>. Omitting it falsely implies that Exxon funded global warming research by AEI. As it is, the Wikipedia article one-sidedly describes the Guardian article in specific terms while only describing the rebuttal in generalized terms, a plain violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. The rebuttal should be explored fully: the Wikipedia article omits that AEI solicited work from IPPC supporters, that AEI has published work on climate change contrary to Exxon's position, and that a $10,000 honoraria is modest for the amount of work being solicited.<a href="http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.25586,filter.all/pub_detail.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.25586,filter.all/pub_detail.asp" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> -- <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedFrank_f8cb.html" title="User:TedFrank">TedFrank</a> 01:58, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Are you saying that opinion pieces from partisan sources are to be accepted as factual information? Not that I have anything against the WSJ, being a subscriber until recently.

<dd>The Guardian uses such non-vitriolic terms as “intellectual Cosa Nostra”, and has been proven to have gotten basic facts wrong and misrepresent other facts, and you view it as perfectly neutral. Whatever. I recognize that NPOV requires Wikipedia to acknowledge fringe conspiracy theories like that of the Guardian, but that doesn't excuse omitting the truth when it's verifiable. I note that the article still omits relevant facts about the controversy. -- <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedFrank_f8cb.html" title="User:TedFrank">TedFrank</a> 02:57, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
