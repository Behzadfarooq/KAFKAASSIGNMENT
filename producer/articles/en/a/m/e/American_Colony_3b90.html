<p>Moved by a series of tragic losses, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> natives Anna and <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horatio_Spafford_6892.html" title="Horatio Spafford">Horatio Spafford</a> led a small <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> contingent in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1881.html" title="1881">1881</a> to <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> to form a Christian utopian society known as the "American Colony." Colony members, later joined by <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Swedish</a> Christians, engaged in philanthropic work amongst the people of Jerusalem regardless of their religious affiliation and without <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proselytize.html" title="Proselytize">proselytizing</a> motives--thereby gaining the trust of the local <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a>, and Christian communities. During and immediately after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the American Colony played a critical role in supporting these communities through the great suffering and deprivations of the eastern front by running <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soup_kitchen.html" title="Soup kitchen">soup kitchens</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospitals</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/p/Orphanage.html" title="Orphanage">orphanages</a> and other charitable ventures. In addition, members of the Colony were permitted to photograph behind <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkish</a> lines to create a truly unique record of life under the constraints of <a href="../../../w/a/r/War.html" title="War">war</a>.</p>
<p>Although the American Colony ceased to exist as a religious community in the late <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a>, individual members continued to be active in the daily life of Jerusalem. Towards the end of the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, Colony quarters opened to the public as the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Colony_Hotel_0d9b.html" title="American Colony Hotel">American Colony Hotel</a>. The hotel is an integral part of the Jerusalem landscape where members of all communities in Jerusalem still meet. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a> representatives from the Palestinian Liberation Organization and Israel met in the hotel where they began talks that led to the historic <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a> Oslo Peace Accord.</p>

<p>In 1871, Horatio Spafford, a prosperous <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawyer.html" title="Lawyer">lawyer</a> and devout <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presbyterian.html" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> church elder and his wife, Anna, were living comfortably with their four young daughters in Chicago. In that year the great fire broke out and devastated the entire city. Two years later the family decided to vacation with friends in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. At the last moment Horatio was detained by business, and Anna and the girls went on ahead, sailing on the ocean liner S.S. Ville de Havre. On <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_21.html" title="November 21">November 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1873.html" title="1873">1873</a>, the liner was rammed amid ship by a British vessel and sank within minutes. Anna was picked up unconscious on a floating spar, but the four children had drowned. Horatio received the tragic news in a short telegram from Anna, which read "Saved alone. What shall I do?". After receiving Anna's <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telegram.html" title="Telegram">telegram</a>, Horatio immediately left Chicago to bring his wife home.</p>
<p>The Spaffords did their best to put together their shattered lives back in Chicago. In <a href="../../../1/8/7/1878.html" title="1878">1878</a>, a daughter, Bertha, was born and, two years later, a son Horatio. After an <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epidemic.html" title="Epidemic">epidemic</a> of <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scarlet_fever.html" title="Scarlet fever">scarlet fever</a> broke out and their baby son died, it seemed that the Spaffords were doomed to unhappiness. Rumors ran rampant through their church. Horatio left the <a href="../../../f/u/l/Fullerton_Presbyterian_Church_dd8c.html" title="Fullerton Presbyterian Church">Fullerton Presbyterian Church</a>, which he had helped to build. In solidarity a group of Spafford's friends also abandoned the Chicago church and together decided to seek solace and <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a>'s guidance in the holy city of Jerusalem. Delaying only until the birth of their daughter, Grace, in August <a href="../../../1/8/8/1881.html" title="1881">1881</a>, the Spaffords set out for Jerusalem with a band of thirteen adults and three children.</p>
<p><a name="In_Jerusalem" id="In_Jerusalem"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Colony_3b90.html" title="Edit section: In Jerusalem">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">In Jerusalem</span></h2>
<p>In a <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renting.html" title="Renting">rented</a> <a href="../../../h/o/u/House.html" title="House">house</a> in the Old City, the group quickly adapted to their new surroundings. Because they had no interest in proselytizing, they were warmly received by the local community, among whom they soon began <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philanthropy.html" title="Philanthropy">philanthropic</a> work. Called the "American Colony" by their neighbors, they sought to live a communal life on the model of the early Christian church. Horatio continued to search the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> for guidance and for signs of the end of time when <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> would reappear in Jerusalem. Although the Colony was criticized and harassed by several of the American consuls in Jerusalem for their seemingly unorthodox religious life, the Colony survived and thrived as a religious community.</p>
<p>Although Horatio Spafford died of <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malaria.html" title="Malaria">malaria</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1888.html" title="1888">1888</a>, the community grew over the years. Visiting Chicago in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1894.html" title="1894">1894</a>, Anna Spafford made contact with Olaf Henrik Larsson, the leader of the Swedish Evangelical Church. Inspired by Anna's words and full of messianic fervor, the Swedes from Chicago decided to join Anna on her trip back to Jerusalem. Larsson also exhorted his relations and friends in Nas, Sweden, to go immediately to Jerusalem. As a result, 38 adults and seventeen children sold all their possessions and set off for the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Land_6f3c.html" title="Holy Land">Holy Land</a> to join the Colony, arriving there in July <a href="../../../1/8/9/1896.html" title="1896">1896</a>.</p>
<p>The Colony, now numbering 150, moved to the large house of a wealthy <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> landowner outside the city walls. The extensive land attached to the house was quickly put to use for the Colony's support. Part of the building was used as a hostel for their frequent visitors from Europe and America. A small farm developed with <a href="../../../c/o/w/Cow.html" title="Cow">cows</a> and <a href="../../../p/i/g/Pig.html" title="Pig">pigs</a>, a <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butcher.html" title="Butcher">butchery</a>, a <a href="../../../d/a/i/Dairy.html" title="Dairy">dairy</a>, a <a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakery.html" title="Bakery">bakery</a>, a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carpenter.html" title="Carpenter">carpenter</a>'s shop, and a <a href="../../../s/m/i/Smithy.html" title="Smithy">smithy</a>. The American Colony Store provided additional support through the sale of images, <a href="../../../s/o/u/Souvenir.html" title="Souvenir">souvenirs</a>, artifacts and archaeological objects worldwide.</p>

<p>From March to October <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a>, a plague of <a href="../../../l/o/c/Locust.html" title="Locust">locusts</a> stripped areas in and around <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine_%28region%29.html" title="Palestine (region)">Palestine</a> of almost all <a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegetation.html" title="Vegetation">vegetation</a>. This invasion of biblical proportions seriously compromised the already depleted food supply of the region and sharpened the misery of all Jerusalemites. Djemal Pasha, Supreme Commander of <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabia.html" title="Arabia">Arabia</a>, who mounted a campaign to limit the devastation, asked the American Colony photographers to document the progress of the locust hordes.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Colony_3b90.html" title="Edit section: World War I">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">World War I</span></h2>
<p>When the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Empire_4168.html" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> entered <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> as an <a href="../../../a/l/l/Ally.html" title="Ally">ally</a> of <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a> in November <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>, Jerusalem and Palestine became a battleground between the Allied and the Central powers. The Allied forces from <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>, under the leadership of the British, engaged the German, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrian</a> and Turkish forces in fierce battles for control of Palestine. During this time the American Colony assumed a more crucial role in supporting the local populace through the deprivations and hardships of the war. Because the Turkish military commanders governing Jerusalem trusted the Colony, they asked its photographers to record the course of the war in Palestine.</p>
<p>The Colony was permitted to continue its relief efforts even after the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> entered the war on the side of the Allies in the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>. As the German and Turkish armies retreated before the advancing Allied forces, the American Colony took charge of the overcrowded Turkish <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_hospital.html" title="Military hospital">military hospitals</a>, which were inundated by the wounded.</p>
<p>The outbreak of World War I in 1914 brought great suffering to the country. All young men were <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conscript.html" title="Conscript">conscripted</a> into the army, while the older men were drafted into work <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigade.html" title="Brigade">brigades</a>. Food supplies dwindled as the Allies sustained a blockade of the Palestinian <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coast.html" title="Coast">coast</a>, and the Turkish army confiscated provisions. Weakened by <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malnutrition.html" title="Malnutrition">malnutrition</a>, people died of <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typhus.html" title="Typhus">typhus</a> and other epidemics. As <a href="../../../f/a/m/Famine.html" title="Famine">famine</a>, disease, and death ravaged the people of Jerusalem, the Colony, struggling for their own survival, engaged in relief work. With money from friends in the United States, the American Colony ran a soup kitchen that fed thousands during these desperate times. When the British Allied commander, General Allenby, entered Jerusalem on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_11.html" title="December 11">December 11</a>, 1917, the Colony offered their philanthropic services to the new rulers of Palestine and continued to serve their fellow Jerusalemites.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Colony_3b90.html" title="Edit section: After the war">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">After the war</span></h2>
<p>The Colony also administered an <a href="../../../o/r/p/Orphanage.html" title="Orphanage">orphanage</a> to provide refuge for the many children torn from their parents during World War I. The charitable work begun by the Spaffords continues today in the original Colony house abutting the walls of the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_City_of_Jerusalem_985f.html" title="Old City of Jerusalem">Old City of Jerusalem</a>. The Spafford Children's Center provides medical treatment and outreach programs for Arab children and their families in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Inner tensions within the American Colony led to the final demise of this utopian Christian community in the <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>. Since then the second home of the American Colony, outside the city's walls, has functioned as a hotel.</p>
