<p>Season descriptions should probably have spoiler warnings before any important information like the final contestants, who won, what the winner did later, etc. Season descriptions could be split in two, with non-spoiler info. (who the contestants are, air dates, etc.) in the first half. - <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew238_be83.html" title="User:Matthew238">Matthew238</a> 07:41, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Do we know why the seasons are referred to as "cycles?" This differentiates the series from other American shows, so I think it's important to cover. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> (<big><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisGriswold_df5d.html" title="User talk:ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:red">☎</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ChrisGriswold_d1f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:black">☓</span></a></big>) 20:12, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I suspect that is simply because the show at 13 or so episodes, is shorter than serials of say 22 or so episodes. Furthermore, the cycles occur more frequently than once a year. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 04:36, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Maybe something to do with modeling? Most reality shows are on more than once a year, and don't run more than 13-14 episodes, unless they're live (<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_f5f8.html" title="Big Brother">Big Brother</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Idol_ef58.html" title="American Idol">American Idol</a>, etc.).

<p>Last Friday, I posted that some writers on <i>ANTM</i> had disrupted work for an hour and had threatened to go on strike over a dispute on union membership. The strike began the next day and was still ongoing as of Tuesday. However, I came back to the <i>ANTM</i> page and saw it removed. I think LilFlip 246 did it, but why? The notation said "source," but I cited the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> business section. This is an important development, as it threatens the show schedule for the next cycle.--<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesmond_Hobson_ab29.html" title="User:Desmond Hobson">Desmond Hobson</a> 15:44, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article said the dispute was resolved then cited an article from early July, which clearly did not state the dispute had been disolved. In fact, the strike continues whih is a serious problem for the production of the show. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESyndicalista_3db2.html" title="User:Syndicalista">Syndicalista</a> 01:22, 17 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that we should check and see which names are actually doing work and who can be discussed in a context besides the show. Elyse, maybe Amanda, Tocarra, Ann, Naima, Eva, Adrianne, Mercedes, Shandi, Yoanna, Brittany, I can see them having their own pages. A lot of the others seem to have fallen through the cracks after their seasons ended. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesB3_3655.html" title="User:JamesB3">JamesB3</a> 22:46, 13 October 2005 (UTC)

<p><b>Nicole Linkletter</b>&#160;: Tyra Banks announced during the finale party that Linkletter has been chosen by photographer Gilles Bensimon to be shot in Paris for an entire year to do the couture collection photo shoots. Said Tyra, "People don't understand what that is, but in the fashion world, to shoot couture for Elle magazine, with Gilles Bensimon, is huge!". This accomplishment undoubtedly makes Linkletter the most successful woman to emerge from "America's Next Top Model".</p>
<p>While that's a great opportunity for Nicole, I think making the claim that she's the most successful model to emerge from ANTM is a bit premature as she has yet to prove herself. For now we should just wait and see, and perhaps if this prediction comes true, then we can edit the page to say so. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabricationary_b588.html" title="User:Fabricationary">Fabricationary</a> 01:10, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it is reasonable for the winners, runners-up, and especially notable contestants from each season of Top Model to have their own Wikipedia pages, as these contestants usually have some sort of modeling career following the show. However, I don't think it is especially relevant for other contestants - especially those that have no other claim to fame - to have their own page. Is anyone with me? The specific contestants I am talking about are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nicole Panattoni (the last I heard of her, she was modeling for adult Halloween costumes...)</li>
<li>Giselle Samson (is not modeling anymore)</li>
<li>Tiffany Richardson (is not modeling anymore)</li>
<li>Rebecca Epley (models, but is not notable)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I don't think it's reasonable for any contestants from Cycle 5 to get their own pages except for Nik (the runner-up) and Nicole (the winner), unless they do something very notable. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabricationary_b588.html" title="User:Fabricationary">Fabricationary</a> 02:42, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think that the models all should have a page because they are all contributors. Giselle was an amazing model in my view and her photos are flawless. Tiffany Richardson and Giselle are both still modeling. Changster785 7:17, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, I see your point, but if anyone is planning to create more pages for contestants, I hope you have more information to contribute than just "____ was on cycle _ of <i>America's Next Top Model</i>. She was eliminated ___th." (Similarly, it would be pointless to only outline what that contestant did on the show since it's probably already on the <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/America%27s_Next_Top_Model_9535.html" title="America's Next Top Model">America's Next Top Model</a></i> page under that cycle). If that model/contestant has done notable things (in modeling, acting, or otherwise) since the show and apart from the show, I could see how a page might be useful. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabricationary_b588.html" title="User:Fabricationary">Fabricationary</a> 18:51, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'd say if you can leave the comment you just made, you know enough to make a page. But it might be a good idea, given the reservations expressed by others above, to start writing the article you have in mind on your user page (follow the red link on your user name) and see if it will be considered "encyclopedic" enough to not get immediately nominated for deletion. &lt;g&gt; Remember that putting double-brackets around something [[creates a link to]] another Wikipedia article (if it exists).

<p>It has become standard that the winner and runner up receive articles, so why doesn't Melrose Bickerstaff have one? The argument was that her season recently ended, and she didn't have time to prove her signifigance. She has now walked in two shows for New York fashion week, appeared in a catalog, and is designing for Ishkada clothing.

<p>When I started to do a minor edit on this article, a note popped up about its length possibly being larger than preferable. It does take a while to load, in retrospect, and other long-running series covered on Wikipedia (<i><a href="../../../a/l/i/Alias_%28TV_series%29_465c.html" title="Alias (TV series)">Alias</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/u/r/Survivor.html" title="Survivor">Survivor</a></i>, etc.) have successfully been organized into main articles and separate articles for each season. It might make for easier navigation of this information to apply the same organization to <i>America's Next Top Model</i>.

<dd>I agree with you. I have all the episodes available, so I would be happy to help with summaries.

<dd>I think it sounds like a good idea; we're starting to summarize every episode and elimination here, and that's not good. With each season separated, we could discuss characters and eliminations better on their own article. <a href="../../../e/l/c/User%7EElcda0_03b8.html" title="User:Elcda0">Elcda0</a> 23:48, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I can see this working out well, and I like the look of the sample pages already created. I've written much of the current summaries, so if time needs to be saved, they can be split up among individual episodes as most of them are sequential. This would also be a good time to create an "America's Next Top Model" category, comprised of pages for each cycle and pages of former ANTM contestants. However, a down side to this idea is inviting the expansion of material that may or may not deserve a place on Wikipedia, such as pages on non-notable ANTM contestants that only consist of "___ was on cycle 5 of ANTM and finished 6th" or a re-hash of their UPN biography. Also, what would happen to the trivia section? I myself have never been a fan of it (due to its often-subjective nature), but creating separate pages for the articles might invite someone to create a separate page for trivia, which would be pure clutter, in my opinion. Perhaps if this splitting plan is implemented, the current "America's Next Top Model" page could be reserved for explaining the show's format/judges and delving a bit into trivia, though not too much. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabricationary_b588.html" title="User:Fabricationary">Fabricationary</a> 05:50, 13 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The main ANTM page that Fabricationary just described is exactly what I had in mind — general information, including a trivia overview that compares/contrasts all seasons in one source. A separate trivia page isn't really necessary, because the general information itself (minus the season-specific content) is ample but not so much that it couldn't still share space with trivia.</dd>
<dd>As for the creation of unnecessary contestant articles, some would argue that a few such articles have already been created. Certain past contestants who failed to make the finals, like <a href="../../../t/o/c/Toccara_Jones_239f.html" title="Toccara Jones">Toccara Jones</a> (regardless of the current state of her article), may still merit articles, but it's often because of an impression created that extends far beyond participation in the competition. And if it's nothing more than a rehash of the UPN website writeup, it sounds like a candidate for speedy deletion or copyright violation.</dd>
<dd>It seems to me that among the American competitive reality series covered here at Wikipedia, ANTM is the one that is currently most unwieldy for the amount of its content. Compare with <i><a href="../../../s/u/r/Survivor.html" title="Survivor">Survivor</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Apprentice_e490.html" title="The Apprentice">The Apprentice</a></i>. — <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkansasTraveler_85b6.html" title="User:ArkansasTraveler">ArkansasTraveler</a> 13:20, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Countless anonymous users have kept editing the page and listing the two eliminated contestants on top under the heading "Contestants in order of elimination" while leaving the vast majority of contestants (who have not been eliminated) on the same list as if they have also been eliminated in that specific order. It is misleading and invites vandals/speculators to change the order of the existing girls to make their own assumptions as to who will be eliminated next/who will win. (Case in point: countless changes to the list shifting the names of Jayla, Nicole, Nik, and Bre last season leading up to the finale)</p>
<p>Therefore, for now, it is logical to list contestants by first name alphabetical order with a note by the names of the already-eliminated girls. Until about half of the girls have been eliminated, this is the most concise and clear way of noting this; after that, two separate lists can be made - "Contestants in order of elimination" and "Contestants still in the running to be America's Next Top Model" or some variation of those two.</p>
<p>I'll keep reverting the page back to this version until enough contestants have been cut to merit a separate list of eliminated contestants.</p>

<p>I created a cycle summary which replaced listed info, and transferred info specific to each season to its dedicated page.</p>
<p>The column of "Other contestants (in order of elimination)" in the summary has been left deliberately without links. In order to avoid accidental recreation of deleted candidates, and to ensure that there are no double-redirects, it is suggested that these names are not made into namespaces <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 03:37, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone changed the ANTM crossovers, and they put wrong information. This person said that Eva won the acting challenge and got the opportunity to be on Kevin Hill. Yaya won the acting challenge in Cycle 3, and all she won was to be in first class while they flew a plane to Tokyo. Eva got to be on Kevin Hill because she won Cycle 3.

<p>It's tedious to read, the formatting is terrible and the language is questionable. I would contribute, but I know very little about ANTM. May I make some suggestions? The season subheadings should be organized so that the contestant winner is clearly displayed, the date of original airing and the channel the season was syndicated on. There are too many lists at the bottom of the article, and perhaps should be combined in the season subheadings. In the end, this article should only have 5 subsections: Season 1, season 2, season 3, season 4 and season 5, with all the other information divided into their proper sections. Perhaps at the bottom, some trivia can be added? Or in a seperate article.

<p>I've noticed this too, and I've tried to make some changes to this article lately. I overhauled the recaps for Cycles 1, 4, and 5 and hopefully improved them sufficiently. I would do Cycles 2 and 3 as well, though I'm not familiar with those as I am with the others.</p>
<p>Perhaps the names of the contestants from each cycle could be moved underneath the synopsis for each cycle? Does anyone fancy this idea?</p>
<p>As far as the trivia, I think it's gotten a bit out-of-hand. <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabricationary_b588.html" title="User:Fabricationary">Fabricationary</a> 00:53, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It still needs some serious cleaning up. There is far too much opinion and the facts presented seem random - anecdotes about the odd contestant here and there. For example, Tyra shouting at Tiffany - Tyra gave as her reason the fact that she knew of Tiffany's obstacles and was angry at her wasting the opportunity. Yet on a recent body language programme, it was suggested Tyra's anger, and in particular the way she dealt with it, reflected more the fact that Tiffany by laughing was detracting from Tyra's show and not showing the deference that Tyra always insists upon. THe increasing amount of time we see Tyra chatting with the other girls over each series reflects this: it is Tyra's show, it's all about her and she will have nothing detract from that. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.144.132.66.html" title="User:195.144.132.66">195.144.132.66</a> (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_195.144.132.66_4027.html" title="Special:Contributions/195.144.132.66">contribs</a>) .</small>

<p>I have to question "records" such as "Amanda (Cycle 3 - Partially/Night Blind)" and "Most "First Called Out For Safety"" and "First Contestant To Contract Disease During The Show" and "First Contestant Who Tyra Banks Shouted At" and "First Contestant Whose Close Relations Died While Filming" ... and what's up with "Unique Parentage"?</p>

<p>The race stuff is problematic because I don't think most contestants actually "self-identified" their race during the show. If anything, we might just mention a few of the most relevant "racial" facts (the "white-white pair" entry is going way too far) in a paragraph of the main article. Much of the other stuff might be better listed in a "trivia" section, if at all. I also removed the winners and runners-up because you can glean that information from the contestant list in each cycle. - <a href="../../../d/c/l/User%7EDcljr_a662.html" title="User:Dcljr">dcljr</a> <small>(<a href="../../../d/c/l/User_talk%7EDcljr_034e.html" title="User talk:Dcljr">talk</a>)</small> 12:57, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>oh er hello everyone. I suppose maybe you've read the "records" section already and from the talk that have sufficed from this, I see that my action of possible ignorance lumping alot of "facts" together could've been seen quite negatively.</p>
<p>For my ignorance I apologise sincerely, and I have to say that after some rectification it does look alot neater and readable.</p>

<li>Recently some anonymous and new registered users have been adding points to the trivia section that have compromised its value. Things like "First photoshoot to feature animals" is just silly (and can be found by looking at the individual cycle pages' synopses), and stuff like "Worst photo in the history of ANTM" is subjective, as not everyone will agree wholeheartedly, for example, that Lluvy's fish picture is worse than every other picture in the history of ANTM. (I personally think the worst is Brittany's "porn star" dogwalking one.)

<dd>I agree - I think much of the article is trivia/fluff. The judge's names can be stated in a paragraph - tables are not needed for each season. Contestants' makeovers, while of interest to some, are not the sole focus of the show and generally don't impact where a contestant will end up placing. The photoshoot information is covered in each season's article. The "Success after the show" section, in my opinion, doesn't belong here but rather on each "successful" contestant's page. Here it is too subjective with no criteria given as to what constitutes "sucessful" (i.e. lots of former contestants are signed, but not with notable agencies). I would like to cut the article down significantly, but I'd like to discuss these changes first. Are you with me, Dcljr? <a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabricationary_b588.html" title="User:Fabricationary">Fabricationary</a> 17:27, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The statistics section overflows unnecessarily because age statistics are based on years only. I have determined the age of the oldest and youngest winner. However, there is no outright winner for the oldest and youngest contestant, but this is probably due to the lack of dob available on contestants. 18 is a very common age group for participants, so this long list for youngest contestants is pretty meaningless unless we can determine exact age, measured at the start of the relevant series. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 07:50, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>At the "Statistics" part I was surprised to see this sentence: Most ugly and fake contestant in the history of America's Next Top Model: Melrose Bickerstaff (Cycle 7) And throughout the whole article I couldn't find a single fact supporting that.--24.80.232.128 11:08, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello, juz thought of contributing these 4 lines in - I have been faithfully watching the series all the way from Cycle 1 to currently Cycle 7, my statements which i have added to the show stats regarding about best/worst photo and best/worst TV commercial in ANTM history, is indeed proven true... Recaps episodes can be verified at www.youtube.com.</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Photo, by judges' opinions in Top Model history: Sara Albert (Cycle 6), for 'Swarovski Crystals - Bald Look' Photoshoot Week 1.</li>
<li>Worst Photo, by judges' opinions in Top Model history: Lluvy Gomez (Cycle 6), for 'Zodiac Signs Calendar' Photoshoot Week 3.</li>
<li>Best TV Commericial, by judges' opinions in Top Model history: Melrose Bickerstaff (Cycle 7), for 'Secret Deodorant' Shoot Week 9.</li>
<li>Worst TV Commercial, by judges' opinions in Top Model history: CariDee English (Cycle 7), for 'Secret Deodorant' Shoot Week 9.</li>
</ul>
<p>My Backings/References for adding these:</p>
<p>Best photo: Sara Albert (Cycle 6) was confirmed by Tyra herself claiming it is the best photo she has seen so far in history of Top Model.</p>
<p>Worst Photo: Lluvy Gomez (Cycle 4) was confirmed by the judges, Nigel and Nole, of being the worst photo in ANTM history.</p>
<p>Best TV Commercial: Melrose Bickerstaff (Cycle 7) was confirmed unanimous by the 4 judges. They felt that Melrose has delivered the best TV commercial, even though it was a foreign language, cos they felt Melrose is a natural and can deliver her lines smoothly.</p>
<p>Worst TV Commercial: CariDee English (Cycle 7) was confirmed unanimous by Tyra, Nigel &amp; Twiggy. Though she is billed as the judges' favorites - they felt her win in the acting challenge has caused her to compromise her standards in delivering the commercial, which she often flubs her lines and as claimed by Nigel, acted like a drunkard and over the top kissing... the judges felt it is the worst TV commercial in ANTM history and felt it was time to give CariDee a wakeup call by placing her in bottom two.</p>
<p>I really hope these statements will verify my stand, and i hope there shouldnt be any eradication of the stats, thank you.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not that these aren't verifiable. it's just that, in my opinion, many of these stats are getting too trivial. It may be nice for a fansite, but for an encyclopedia entry.... By the way, I'm not necessarily commenting on your stat additions. I"m just commenting on the whole list in general. <a href="../../../s/k/s/User%7ESKS2K6_b393.html" title="User:SKS2K6">SKS2K6</a> 22:05, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Erhem, if u think these stats are too trivial, perhaps i think stats like the most common names like Nicole(s) and Sara(s) are unnecessary, The Cover Girl win is absolutely unecessary cos no one actually knows abt who and who win what... cos not everybody goes online... they watch TV generally... they are too trivial, which the focus shd be on the challenge wins, who cares who wins Cover Girl of the week, it does not affect their outcome of their judging! Think abt it before u make statements like 'too much trivia' it is very insulting to those ppl who are more ANTM knowledgeable than you!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I beg to differ - i think it is absolutely necessary to include these stats, cos it is alway critical to stay on the competition, based on how well or badly done = a TV commercial or photoshoot for that matter, should the girls need to stay in the competition. It is essential that this knowledge be made known that the judges know their best &amp; worst photo, and also best &amp; worst TV commercial in history of ANTM...</li>
</ul>
<p>The statements have been made fair and in no bious towards any of teh girls mentioned above, cos after all, the judges' opinions DO matter!!</p>
<p>I would delete these "statistics" since these statistics, especially the Secret commercial statistics (from Cycle 7), are opinionated. In addition, the so-called "best" and "worst" commercial for the whole series cannot be determined by one Cycle 7 episode. The CoverGirl of the Week, however, can be validated through the commercials inserted into every ANTM episode.</p>
<p>And FYI, mysterious editor, Lluvy was in Cycle 4, not Cycle 6. (This was corrected before I finished posting my comment to the site.) It would also help if you spelled out your words in the article itself as well as the discussion.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETHE_evil_fluffyface_e043.html" title="User:THE evil fluffyface">THE evil fluffyface</a> 16:50, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How is adding a tag insulting? I find it hilarious that you go and insult me for stating an opinion, but whatever. And I've been a loyal fan of the show, watching since Cycle 4. I just find it trivial. This is not a fan page; it is an encyclopedia. As such, there is no need for all these trivial facts that don't matter to people who are not fans. Please see <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIVIA_c4e2.html" title="WP:TRIVIA">WP:TRIVIA</a> for the reasons I'm saying this. I would honestly be fine if the whole section were deleted because it does not matter to the page as a whole. <a href="../../../s/k/s/User%7ESKS2K6_b393.html" title="User:SKS2K6">SKS2K6</a> 18:25, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>There was a Dr. Yvonne in Cycle 6, she was one of the semi-finalists, but didn't make it to the Top 13, cos the panel felt her look is too average, and though she can walk well, her face doesnt translate modelesque... sad but true. But whatever hey, she is a doctor and she can always go back to practice medicine, she still will be successful! =D</li>

<p>I have to agree with the above segment, i have to rectify or revert back to previous data. I don't understand why is it that Elyse and Shandi are lightest contestants whereas it should be Melrose instead... whoever put Elyse and Shandi, please stop it. And regarding about the youngest contestant's age, stop putting Nicole's age in terms of months, she is already 19 years old at that time. She is definiety not the same age as Eva Pigford who was 20 at that time she won Cycle 3, Nicole's &amp; Eva's birthdates are 2 years apart, not the same age. Please get facts right before making silly changes. Thank you. Apollolancer 13:51, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know who put Shandi in, but Elyse is also measured at 114 in cycle one. And I'd like to see a source that says Melrose is that light. There is no way in hell she's 104 lbs. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EFordmadoxfraud_5d6c.html" title="User:Fordmadoxfraud">Ford MF</a> 18:44, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>the problem is that <i><b>there are no sources for any of these numbers</b></i>. All of this is trivial and probably under personal research. That's why I'm advocating the removal of most of these facts except for the clearly verifiable ones. There are news articles that say Nicole was the youngest winner. There are none that say so-and-so was the lightest contestant. <a href="../../../s/k/s/User%7ESKS2K6_b393.html" title="User:SKS2K6">SKS2K6</a> 19:38, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know where the 104 lbs. comes from, but a (now-defunct) website article on Melrose listed her as 5'8" and 107 pounds; one website has listed this stat (<a href="http://www.insidebayarea.com/tv/ci_4781017" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.insidebayarea.com/tv/ci_4781017" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). I'm with <a href="../../../s/k/s/User%7ESKS2K6_b393.html" title="User:SKS2K6">SKS2KS</a>. The trivia section needs to be cleaned up BIG TIME or removed completely---It's unencyclopedic and there's a lot of speculation/OR going on. This is an encyclopedia, not an ANTM fansite. Lastly, the heights can't be confirmed for Cycle 7 since it wasn't listed on the CW website. We're going on speculation from ANTM forums and fan websites. <a href="../../../e/l/c/User%7EElcda0_03b8.html" title="User:Elcda0">Elcda0</a> 09:52, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, I've got a question: Sanne Nijhof from the Dutch version of ANTM entered the Ford Models contest, and on 17 January 2007, she won the Ford Models Supermodel of the World competition, winning a US$ 250,000 contract with the world renowned agency. Why isn't that in the story about the Dutch version of ANTM? And as far as anyone knows, no other girl from whatever version of ... Next Top Model has ever achieved that, placing Sanne in the Top of all the contesters, of every version of ... Next Top Model. I think it would be worth mentioning.

<p>It seems that everytime I frequent the site the last names of many Cycle 8 contestants keep changing. I thought that Sarah &amp; Cassandra's surnames were "confirmed" since a long time ago but apparently not because they just got changed AGAIN. Among others, Diana, Brittany, Renee, Samantha, Kathleen, Natasha and Jael have all had at least 2 last names credited to each of them over a period of 2 weeks. The only "consistent" ones have been Whitney, Dionne and Jaslene (and Felicia, who has not had her last name assigned to her, yet). Can anyone verify the actual last names of all the contestants? I think it'll stop the maddening changes. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../z/e/p/User%7EZephyrWind_8f04.html" title="User:ZephyrWind">ZephyrWind</a> (<a href="../../../z/e/p/User_talk%7EZephyrWind_7662.html" title="User talk:ZephyrWind">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ZephyrWind_8542.html" title="Special:Contributions/ZephyrWind">contribs</a>) 11:27, 3 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>Those are the only confirmed last names.</p>
<p>If there aren't any confirmed last names of all the contestants for CYCLE 8, might as well temporarily remove all the last names of their CYCLE... It's unorderly... If the last names are already confirmed, the 13 of them, then it is time to place them... 68.193.255.234 21:56, 16 March 2007 (UTC) I can vouch that Diana's last name is not O'Connell. Whether the network's PR people want her last name to be given or not, as someone who grew up with her, I can say she is of 100% Polish descent and grew up in GArfield, NJ (Polish caital of NJ). Her last name is Polish. Trust me.68.193.255.234 21:56, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>None of the above appear to be reliable confirmations.

<li>I'm pretty fed up with the whole thing - edit wars over something as fundamental as the contestants's surnames appear ridiculous beyond imagination. Will editors not leave the darned information out if it's not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliably sourced</a>? An insistent editor bangs on that Brittany's surname is not carriger, <i>etc</i> and says that "a yearbook which is doing the rounds" says it's something else. I don't quite see how a "yearbook" could qualify as "reliable". <a href="http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/felicia-campbell-fourth-girl-sent-home-from-top-model-8-4892.php" class="external text" title="http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/felicia-campbell-fourth-girl-sent-home-from-top-model-8-4892.php" rel="nofollow">Realitytvworld.com</a> cites the following as the correct names (Dionne Alexander, Brittany Carrigher, Whitney Cunningham, Renee DeWitt, Natasha Galkina, Jaslene Gonzalez, Diana O'Connell, Jael Strauss, Sarah Vanderhaar) contrary to previous assertions. I'm starting to think we're being manipulated by the show's producers, that each and every tiddly bit is marketing for the show? If there really are no reliable sources, we might as well delete the whole <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expletive.html" title="Expletive">@^%&amp;*</a> lot ..... as <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">spam</a>. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 09:14, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Realitytvworld as well as other websites get their surname information from here. Notice how they did not have one for Felicia until one popped up here. Several people ON Wikipedia itself have admitted to making up some of these names. Go to the fansofrealitytv Top Model forum and check Brittany's thread for somebody who went to high school with her who posted a yearbook photo with her last name listed as Hatch. Renee used to be a Barbizon model. Google Renee Alway + Barbizon. Some people have seen a resemblance to Jay Alexander so as a joke they listed Dionne's as Alexander. Several people both on and off Wikipedia have said to know Diana personally and have stated that her last name is Zalewski and she is of full Polish heritage. As well as markings on this site itself that have claimed they made up the previously listed surnames. Even though mine are correct we may as well just delete the surnames of the remaining girls since there seems to be no peace on the matter. 4.241.33.251</li>
