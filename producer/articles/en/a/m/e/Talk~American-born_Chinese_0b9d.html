<p>An American-born Chinese or ABC is a person born in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> of Chinese ethnic descent. A Chinese American is an American who is of ethnic <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">Chinese</a> descent. I'm a little confused; is there a distinction? The Chinese American article discusses the post-1965 immigration boom like this article as well as politics and immigration history. Should this article be merged with <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_American_7e72.html" title="Chinese American">Chinese American</a>? --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue387_7c2a.html" title="User:Blue387">Blue387</a> 05:14, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think someone who created this wanted to use the "ABC" as an acronym for American Born Chinese. In any case, the distinction may be primarily that Americans always affix -American to every ethnicity to state that a person is born in America, i.e. "African American," "Italian American," "Chinese American," etc.</p>
<p>There's an ambiguity in doing that, though. You're not sure whether you're born here, naturalized here, or you're half-American and half-Chinese.</p>
<p>I would vote for keeping this article as a "slang" or colloquial term because I don't think American-born Chinese is intended to cover the history of being Chinese American. We need to debate this more.--<a href="../../../l/u/x/User%7ELuxdormiens_f304.html" title="User:Luxdormiens">lux</a> 06:44, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This article discusses the children of first-generation Chinese American immigrants, while the latter discusses the immigrants more. ABCs are very different from their immigrant parents, with their culture and language totally like "Americans". This article needs to stress more that ABCs are losing their culture and language at a surprisingly rapid pace. Young ABCs today rarely speak any Mandarin. Usually only the immigrant children speak Mandarin daily. — <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevey7788_7be5.html" title="User:Stevey7788">Stevey7788</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevey7788_4943.html" title="User talk:Stevey7788">talk</a>) 22:08, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>NPOV note: "To remedy this problem" sounds a bit like taking a side on the whole immigrants and assimilation issue. (the other side would say: no problem at all, america is all about assimilation) Isnt there a more neutral way to couch it, like "to remedy this situation" or "to assist the efforts of the parents in maintaining ties with chinese culture"?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Is that better? I wrote it as "Some parents have taken step to remedy this problem" --<a href="../../../l/u/x/User%7ELuxdormiens_f304.html" title="User:Luxdormiens">lux</a> 23:22, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hands, I rewrote it as "taken steps to ensure their children retain ties to their heritage", after thinking about what you said. It's more the parents' efforts that allow Chinese schools to exist, compared to Hispanics or other immigrants.</dd>

<p>I look through the history and see that nicksinif, a well-meaning member of Wikipedia, has repeatedly added to the list of stereotypes that Chinese men have small penises. Must we talk about small penis? I'm not sure how appropriate that is to an encyclopaedium that all manners of people might be reading, from the elderlies to the kidlings.</p>
<p>None of all the stereotypes listed are positive or negative. The stereotype of Asian-Americans being overly smart, for example, often leads to stigmatization against the Asian-Americans that might choose to become a car mechanics or janitors over that of doctors and lawyers.</p>
<p>Another thing: I might agree with leaving the stereotype of Chinese people owning restaurants because that's a visible and widely discussed aspect in media and Chinatown. I would want to expand it with an explanation of how that's not true. However, penises cannot be seen, judged, or compared. --<a href="../../../l/u/x/User%7ELuxdormiens_f304.html" title="User:Luxdormiens">Lux</a> 23:00, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't think that this article should not be used to dispell generalizations as that seems more opinion oriented and wikipedia articles should inform and not persuade. I think the stereotypes should just be listed and not argued with "Myth" and "Fact". As of right now I don't think this article follows NPOV.</p>
<p>Some of the arguments are flawed as well, for example "Myth: The Chinese Americans are skilled at classical instruments — typically the piano or the violin, instruments of professional and high prestige. Fact: This is found prominently only in the sons and daughters of the immigrants; the immigrants themselves may also know how to play the instruments as symbols of the high-class living that they hoped to achieve for themselves or their children. It does not necessarily apply to ABCs." I can't tell if this is supporting or against the generalization. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsteron_98ef.html" title="User:Asteron">Asteron</a> 19:12, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I was the one who added the Myth and Fact because people were just adding more and more sentences, making the stereotypes a mixture of what is stereotypical and what is not. It's probably better to just list the stereotypes, rather than writing explanations of how the stereotypes are wrong (we can just use links or off-line citations that can point out the origin of the stereotypes). If you want to delete all the "facts", leaving just the stereotypes, I'll support that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know who implied that "This is found prominently only in the sons and daughters of the immigrants", because I agree that it seems to support, rather than counter the stereotype. I just mindlessly cleaned up the article without checking whether the sentence makes sense. --<a href="../../../l/u/x/User%7ELuxdormiens_f304.html" title="User:Luxdormiens">Lux</a> 06:05, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To clear the myth or stereotype, the reason specific group of Asians are better at mathematics or performance arts are due to education or family influence. Immigrant children who came older are better at arts and sciences because of their personal or education experiences. It is in no ways "genetically superior" but "merely statistics" when comparing with other American ways-of-life. Family backgrounds also influenced such. CalvinWg</p>

<p>In Cantonese, ABC's are called Jok Sing's. Is there any formal translation of this in written chinese, Mandarin, or english? 128.6.175.59 20:50, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think "Jok Sing" comes from Cantonese, and I don't know if it is actually from Taisanese(or Toisanese) because the dialect sounds similar. I would say it is a euphenmism of "ABC" meaning "the center of a bamboo" CalvinWg</dd>

<p>I find this info. astonishing and hard to believe. It definitely needs to be backed up, specifically the part about Love boat. I dont' see why the chinese people (PRC in this case), would be interested in learning chinese culture from the ROC gov. (Taiwan)?? Plus, why would the Taiwanese gov. promote "relationships" between Taiwanese and Chinese overseas when PRC is their biggest political/military rival?? The whole thing just doesn't seem to make sense.

<dd>Traditionally, the KMT has maintained better relations with the Chinese diaspora than the CPC. This had to do with issues of ideology, trust, and mutual interest. If you go to San Francisco Chinatown, you will still see flags of the Republic of China flying in slightly greater quanities than flags of the People's Republic of China. Almost every one of those "gates" to the established Chinatowns was donated by the ROC government, with a Blue Sky White Sun Symbol and Sun Yat-sen's "Tian Xia Wei Gong" calligraphy etched in.</dd>
<dd>These "overseas Chinese" attending Love Boat are those who have family ties with Taiwan.--<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 02:11, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Then it should be specified. Plus since these people are Taiwanese-Americans who are attending, it shouldn't be under this article. (a violation of NPOV since whether Taiwanese are Chinese is controversial)--<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonafide.hustla_8457.html" title="User:Bonafide.hustla">Bonafide.hustla</a> 08:29, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's not controversial, at least not in this context. Please cite your sources. There exists a "Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission", not a "Overseas Taiwanese Affairs Commission", but the use of "Chinese" in this context is completely lost to you. Even the most independence supporters in Taiwan have used the term "ABC" and have not substituted "ABT".--<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 17:18, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well yeah, as long as the word Taiwan doesn't appear in this article. By the way, can u plesae cite your source about the "love boat"? Does it still exist?--<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonafide.hustla_8457.html" title="User:Bonafide.hustla">Bonafide.hustla</a> 05:40, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, it exists. You're asking a stupid question, like whether the Boy Scouts still exists and are asking me to "prove" it. I can show you the website, but you wouldn't be able to read it.</dd>
<dd>"Although the majority attenders are Taiwanese American partially due to the hostility between Taiwan and mainland China. " This is not verifiable. The hostility has nothing to do with this. It has to do with differences in background and origin. Mainlanders don't send their children on this program for reasons beyond "hostility": they have no connections to Taiwan, etc. --<a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a> 17:49, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The stereotypes below have at various times been applied to the American-born Chinese population:</p>
<ul>
<li>That Chinese Americans are the "Model Minority," in that Chinese Americans are the smart, hard-working students that excel in prestigious subjects, gurus of math and science by virtue of being born Chinese. While many sons and daughters of Chinese immigrants tend to excel in school, subsequent generations have borne <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americanized.html" title="Americanized">americanized</a> groups with similar attributes and skills little different from the typical American.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That Chinese Americans are skilled at classical instruments — typically the <a href="../../../p/i/a/Piano.html" title="Piano">piano</a> or the <a href="../../../v/i/o/Violin.html" title="Violin">violin</a>, instruments of professional and high prestige. The sons and daughters of the <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immigrant.html" title="Immigrant">immigrants</a> are often persuaded to play the instruments as symbols of the high-class living. This does not necessarily apply to ABCs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That children attend only Chinese private <a href="../../../s/c/h/School.html" title="School">schools</a> as an alternative to <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_education.html" title="Public education">public school</a> — or they may attend Chinese school on <a href="../../../w/e/e/Weekend.html" title="Weekend">weekends</a> (in local <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church.html" title="Church">church</a>, for example) while going to public school on <a href="../../../w/e/e/Weekday.html" title="Weekday">weekdays</a>. While these schools and churches do exist with a purpose to teach children Chinese culture and language, only a minority attend these functions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That all American-born Chinese can speak <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_language.html" title="Chinese language">Chinese</a>, as well as <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_language.html" title="Greek language">Greek</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a>, and <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French</a>. There is a dual (and contradictory) perspective. First, some may view Chinese Americans as slow and incapable of speaking English, so they may talk slowly to them in a condescending manner; otherwise, they may see Chinese Americans as an over-achieving group of individuals who know a variety of languages, math, and science, but are alien to mainstream American culture; however, these stereotypes are true of few American-born Chinese. A majority can speak English well but usually do not know Chinese or other languages, similar to a typical American.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That all Chinese Americans are either <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> church-goers or devout <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhists</a>. While Buddhism may be more widespread, it is increasingly common for ABCs to convert to Christianity; however, some are secular.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>That all Chinese Americans are associated with the restaurant business. This stereotype is similar to that of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">Hindu</a> people managing hotels and gas stations. While Chinese restaurants are prominent in and outside of Chinatown, a majority of ABCs are not associated with dining services.</li>
</ul>
