	    <p><b>American Anthropological Association (AAA)</b> was founded in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1902.html" title="1902">1902</a> and claims to be "the world's largest professional organization of individuals interested in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropology.html" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>".</p>
<p>Although there were several other American anthropological societies in existence at the turn of the 20th century, this new, national organization was formed "to promote the science of anthropology, to stimulate and coordinate the efforts of American anthropologists, to foster local and other societies devoted to anthropology, to serve as a bond among American anthropologists and anthropologic[al] organizations present and prospective, and to publish and encourage the publication of matter pertaining to anthropology" (AAA Articles of Incorporation).</p>
<p>At its incorporation, the Association also assumed responsibility for the <i>American Anthropologist</i>, which was originally begun in 1888 by the Anthropological Society of Washington (ASW). By 1905, the journal also served the American Ethnological Society, in addition to the AAA and ASW.</p>
<p>From an initial membership of 175, the AAA grew slowly during the first half of the 20th century. Annual meetings were held primarily in the Northeast and accommodated all attendees in a single room, the day-long affair concluding with a black tie dinner gala. Since 1950, its membership has increased dramatically, now averaging in excess of 11,500. Annual meetings draw more than 6,000 individuals, who attend over 600 sessions organized into a 5-day program.</p>
<p>The AAA has been a democratic organization since its beginning. Although <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franz_Boas_aa34.html" title="Franz Boas">Franz Boas</a> had initially fought to restrict membership to an exclusive group of 40 "professional anthropologists," the AAA's first president, W. J. McGee, argued for a more inclusive membership embracing all those who expressed an interest in the discipline. McGee's vision still guides the Association today. Business affairs, likewise comprehensive with 24 Councillors selected from the membership, and Executive Committee of 9 in 1902, are now conducted by a 36-member Section Assembly representing each of the Association's constituent Sections, and a 15-member Executive Board. This increase in representation reflects the growing diversity of the discipline, which is viewed by many as a source of strength for the Association and for American anthropology as a whole. In Richard B. Woodbury's words, ". . .the AAA has remained the central society for the discipline, addressing with considerable success its increasingly varied interests and speaking for anthropology to other fields, the federal and state governments, and the public" (Encyclopedia of Cultural Anthropology, 1994).</p>

<p>Section 1. The purposes of the Association shall be to advance anthropology as the science that studies humankind in all its aspects, through archeological, biological, ethnological, and linguistic research; and to further the professional interests of American anthropologists; including the dissemination of anthropological knowledge and its use to solve human problems.</p>
<p>Section 2. To advance the science of anthropology, the Association shall: Foster and support the development of special anthropological societies organized on a regional or functional basis; Publish and promote the publication of anthropological monographs and journals; Encourage anthropological research, act to coordinate activities of members of the Association with those of other organizations concerned with anthropology, and maintain effective liaison with related sciences and their organizations;</p>
<p>Section 3. To further the professional interests of anthropologists, the Association shall, in addition to those activities described under Section 2: Take action on behalf of the entire profession and integrate the professional activities of anthropologists in the special aspects of the science; and Promote the widespread recognition and constant improvement of professional standards in anthropology.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Anthropological_Association_7b31.html" title="Edit section: AAA's Goals">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">AAA's Goals</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>To further the professional interests of anthropologists</li>
<li>To disseminate anthropological knowledge and its use to address human problems</li>
<li>To promote the entire field of anthropology in all its diversity</li>
<li>To represent the discipline nationally and internationally, in the public and private sectors.</li>
<li>To bring together anthropologists from all subfields and specializations, providing networking opportunities across the broad range of the discipline.</li>
</ul>
<p>The AAA, which advances these purposes though its publications, meetings and various programs, is the only organization that represents anthropology's diversity and speaks for the entire discipline in this time of critical challenges and changes.</p>
<p>A number of ideologically polarized debates within the discipline of anthropology have prompted the AAA to conduct investigations. These include the dispute between <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derek_Freeman_a0e2.html" title="Derek Freeman">Derek Freeman</a> and (posthumous) defenders of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margaret_Mead_da68.html" title="Margaret Mead">Margaret Mead</a> and also the controversy over the book <i><a href="../../../d/a/r/Darkness_in_El_Dorado_2ed4.html" title="Darkness in El Dorado">Darkness in El Dorado</a></i>.</p>
<p>In March 1967, during the <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam_War_129f.html" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, the Council of the AAA adopted a "Statement on Problems of Anthropological Research and Ethics" that stated: "Except in the event of a declaration of war by Congress, academic institutions should not undertake activities or accept contracts in anthropology that are not related to their normal functions of teaching, research, and public service. They should not lend themselves to clandestine activities. .&#160;.&#160;. The international reputation of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropology.html" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a> has been damaged by the activities of unqualified individuals who have falsely claimed to be anthropologists, or who have pretended to be engaged in anthropological research while in fact pursuing other ends. There is also good reason to believe that some anthropologists have used their professional standing and the names of their academic institutions as cloaks for the collection of intelligence information and for intelligence operations. Academic institutions and individual members of the academic community, including students, should scrupulously avoid both involvement in clandestine intelligence activities and the use of the name of anthropology, or the title of anthropologist, as a cover for intelligence activities."</p>
<p>A statement on "Principles of Professional Responsibility" adopted by the same Council in May 1971 stated: "In relation with their own government and with host governments, research anthropologists should be honest and candid. They should demand assurance that they will not be required to compromise their professional responsibilities and ethics as a condition of their permission to pursue research. Specifically, no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given. <a href="http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/ethstmnt.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/ethstmnt.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
