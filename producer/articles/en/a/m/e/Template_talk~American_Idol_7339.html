<p>I just thought it might be a good idea to have all the articles pertaining to American Idol in one place, to keep it all organized.</p>
<p>We can also moniter all the AI articles (for vandalism, etc.) by clicking on "whatlinkshere" or "related changes".</p>

<dd>I also think that it's getting quite large, and it should be split into smaller templates. I suggest that the roster section be removed completely, and perhaps we add a prominent link to a List of American Idol finalists. Then on the individual contestant pages, we use a more compact navigation box that only includes the contestants of a particular season, like this:</dd>

<p>Do you think that runners-up are generally as notable as the winners on American Idol?? Clay Aiken I can see as being even more notable than Ruben Studdard, but the rest I think are not as notable as the winners. If there isn't a good reason for the revert, it will stay removed. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus2_3f8f.html" title="User:Marcus2">Marcus2</a> 21:33, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>After first adding Clay Aiken back (you agreed he belongs here), I decided to revert to the runners-up version. They may not be as notable (other than Aiken), but there is one important distinction: Except for Justin Guarini in Season 1, each runner-up gets a record deal along with the winner (and unlike the rest of the finalists). Besides, with adding Aiken back to the "other" section, I was torn as to whether or not <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Daughtry_4d28.html" title="Chris Daughtry">Chris Daughtry</a> (whose debut album, like Aiken's, IIRC has outsold the debut of every "Idol" winner to date) belongs here too; it's easier if we limit the "notable others" to Jennifer Hudson (likely Oscar winner) and William Hung (so infamous he became famous). --RBBrittain 03:45, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I added back the Runners-Up section. Katharine's album is selling well, Bo's did, Diana's on Broadway, the only one not really notable is Justin, but he was still the first ever runner-up so I think it should stay. And I neednot mention why Clay should be there. If the winners are there, so should the runners-up so I think we should leave it up. <a href="../../../z/a/q/User%7EZaque_24_2704.html" title="User:Zaque 24">Zaque 24</a> 01:08, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The "other notable alumni" section is getting out of hand, with the re-addition of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antonella_Barba_4df9.html" title="Antonella Barba">Antonella Barba</a> pushing it to a fourth line. (If Antonella belongs here, so does <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frenchie_Davis_db10.html" title="Frenchie Davis">Frenchie Davis</a>; she's been removed before, and I don't think either of them belong on their notoriety alone.) After reviewing the sales list in the main <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Idol_ef58.html" title="American Idol">American Idol</a></i> article, I propose the following standard for including <i>Idol</i> participants not in other categories (judges, winners, runners-up, etc.) in this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. album sales of at least 100,000 units (per the main article); or</li>
<li>Winning an <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_136f.html" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a>, primetime <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmy_Award_4d8c.html" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Award</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Award_0dda.html" title="Grammy Award">Grammy Award</a>, or <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Award_ddaa.html" title="Tony Award">Tony Award</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose the 100,000 level based on the sales of the least-selling runner-up, <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Guarini_0561.html" title="Justin Guarini">Justin Guarini</a> (150,000); I then lowered it to 100,000 as a round number, and because that only adds <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamyra_Gray_5f11.html" title="Tamyra Gray">Tamyra Gray</a> (122,000) who belongs because she was the first and also has TV-series credentials (<i><a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Public_c7a0.html" title="Boston Public">Boston Public</a></i>). The following qualify under this particular criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Daughtry_4d28.html" title="Chris Daughtry">Chris Daughtry</a></b> (4th place, season 5; 1,880,000 as <a href="../../../d/a/u/Daughtry.html" title="Daughtry">Daughtry</a>)</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Gracin_19bc.html" title="Josh Gracin">Josh Gracin</a></b> (4th place, season 2; 647,000)</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../k/e/l/Kellie_Pickler_4572.html" title="Kellie Pickler">Kellie Pickler</a></b> (6th place, season 5; 463,000)</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hung_60a2.html" title="William Hung">William Hung</a></b> (auditioner, season 3; 295,000)</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimberley_Locke_2056.html" title="Kimberley Locke">Kimberley Locke</a></b> (3rd place, season 2; 211,000)</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamyra_Gray_5f11.html" title="Tamyra Gray">Tamyra Gray</a></b> (4th place, season 1; 122,000)</li>
</ul>
<p>If <i><a href="../../../m/u/s/Dreamgirls%7E_Music_from_the_Motion_Picture_06b0.html" title="Dreamgirls: Music from the Motion Picture">Dreamgirls: Music from the Motion Picture</a></i> (single-disc, 633,000; double-disc, 142,000) is attributed to <b><a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Hudson_36da.html" title="Jennifer Hudson">Jennifer Hudson</a></b> (7th place, season 3), she would also qualify; however, the second criteria is specifically aimed at her for winning the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress_76b1.html" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress</a> for <i><a href="../../../d/r/e/Dreamgirls_%28film%29.html" title="Dreamgirls (film)">Dreamgirls</a></i>.

<p>I am amending the template to italicize those that do not qualify under this proposed standard, and to warn that they will be deleted on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_25.html" title="March 25">March 25</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> (in eight days).

<p>I really don't like this critera. But I have a knew idea. Why don't we just have people vote for which contestants should stay, and then have a certain amount of votes to have. For instance, if the maxiumum is 5 votes, and Frenchie Davis only has 3, and Lisa Tucker has 15. Lisa would stay but Frenchie wouldn't. Anyone else think so? 216.54.173.236 00:45, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The cut-off of 100,000 based on Justin Guarini seems to be arbitrary and doesn't address people who are noted on AI but not for album sales. I also don't like voting for who stays and who goes. That would be an even poorer indicator of notability and may encourage <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppetry</a>. (notability based on Wikipedians' opinions?)

<dd>This also doesn't take into account those notable outside American Idol for things unrelated to music etc. For example <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Wilson_645a.html" title="Lisa Wilson">Lisa Wilson</a>, who I added a while back but someone seems to have removed, was second runner-up at <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_USA_f31f.html" title="Miss USA">Miss USA</a> and thus is clearly notable enough to be included. -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> â€¢ <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PageantUpdater_2fc0.html" title="Special:Contributions/PageantUpdater"><font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font></a> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 04:22, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If she had actually won Miss USA, I might agree; but she didn't, so I don't think she belongs here--though I didn't remove her. (Likewise for <a href="../../../a/y/l/Ayla_Brown_433a.html" title="Ayla Brown">Ayla Brown</a>, who is here and proposed for deletion, and her NCAA basketball career.)</dd>
<dd>As far as the criteria's relationship to music, remember that (as <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Cowell_2a72.html" title="Simon Cowell">Simon Cowell</a> loves to say) <i>Idol</i> is a singing competition, so music should be the primary focus. (And I didn't pick the 100,000 number entirely because of Justin; it also keeps William Hung &amp; Tamyra Gray in while culling most of the deadweight.) I have considered possibly adding a criteria based on appearances in Broadway or national touring musicals (which as a minimum would save <a href="../../../l/a/t/LaToya_London_ac57.html" title="LaToya London">LaToya London</a> and bring in <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frenchie_Davis_db10.html" title="Frenchie Davis">Frenchie Davis</a>), since that has some relationship to music; but I'm not fully sold on that.</dd>
<dd>IMHO, the proper weighting for success in other media should be the "big four" award criteria I established mainly for Jennifer Hudson &amp; equivalent achievements. --RBBrittain 21:27, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the section should be eliminated as well, and I somewhat agree with restoring the complete list of contestants, however, additional research needs to be done on that. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyC83_1bc7.html" title="User:CrazyC83">CrazyC83</a> 04:31, 18 March 2007 (UTC) I think just leave all the names up there. All of them that are on the template have done something considerable. 216.54.173.188 18:33, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>However, we cannot just pick and choose whom to include. That violated <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_7_0c48.html" title="User:Mike 7">Michael</a> 21:23, 18 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This goes back to the argument about runners-up; but if you eliminate runners-up, all you really do is drag <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay_Aiken_b79b.html" title="Clay Aiken">Clay Aiken</a> fans back into the argument over this section. I'd only support that idea if we concurrently raise the album-sales criteria to RIAA gold certification (with the "big four" award criteria unchanged); that eliminates one whole category while reducing this one to Aiken, Daughtry, <a href="../../../b/o/_/Bo_Bice_869a.html" title="Bo Bice">Bo Bice</a>, Gracin, Pickler, and Hudson. (Platinum certification would be a bit too severe.)</dd>
<dd>At this point, I do NOT support restoring the list of contestants, though it might work if it were separate from this template and combined with some major pruning (i.e., delete all but the winners). The problem here is that, IMO, most of the people in this section are NOT really "notable", but are just wasting space; that's what I'm trying to fix. (One last point: Unfortunately, the Wikipedia definition of "notable" doesn't really address the issue at hand, except to suggest that the criteria be objective--which is what I'm doing.) --RBBrittain 21:27, 18 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Why can't we just leave it like it is. 216.54.173.225 01:51, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't see why contestants such as <a href="../../../l/a/t/LaToya_London_ac57.html" title="LaToya London">LaToya London</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Vazquez_3eb2.html" title="Mario Vazquez">Mario Vazquez</a> should be considered for deletion at all - the notability criteria for music on Wikipedia only requires being signed to a major label, not a minimum sales requirement, and many contestants have had songs chart on various Billboard charts without reaching that figure of sales. <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELone_twin_aed0.html" title="User:Lone twin">User:Lone twin</a> 17:2, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with the inclusion/exclusion criteria above. While the fans of the various alumni left out would disagree, including every AI contestant who meets the minimum standards of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> would make the template unweildy long. Also having an excessively long alumni list would make the template unbalanced, giving too much weight to relatively minor players in the competition.--<a href="../../../e/q/d/User%7EEqdoktor_83a7.html" title="User:Eqdoktor">Eqdoktor</a> 09:20, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with RBBrittain's criteria in the fullest. None of the italicized contestants deserve to really be there, and it's a nice list of criteria to help take them off. --Smoke Rulz 12:04, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>A couple of people cited Wikipedia standards for "notability", but no one directly linked to <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a>. Based on the comments and the Wikipedia notability standards, I have implemented the criteria with two modifications:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../j/a/s/Jasmine_Trias_f261.html" title="Jasmine Trias">Jasmine Trias</a></b> is retained because one of the specific criteria is having a record certified gold or higher in any country; she has two such albums in the Philippines (one platinum, one gold).</li>
<li><b><a href="../../../e/l/l/Elliott_Yamin_3b74.html" title="Elliott Yamin">Elliott Yamin</a></b> is retained because Hits Daily Double predicts his album will debut with up to 90,000 copies sold <a href="http://www.hitsdailydouble.com/news/newsPage.cgi?news06578m02" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hitsdailydouble.com/news/newsPage.cgi?news06578m02" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which suggests he will reach my 100,000 criteria shortly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that though the specifics of the Wikipedia music criteria vary from my own, the results appear to be very similar for the most part; for example, though <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Hung_60a2.html" title="William Hung">William Hung</a> hasn't reached gold certification, he has released three albums on the <a href="../../../k/o/c/Koch_Entertainment_3c9d.html" title="Koch Entertainment">Koch Entertainment</a> label, which appears to meet the criteria of having released two albums on a major label or important indie label.</p>
<p>As a final note, the eighth Wikipedia criteria ("(h)as won or placed in a major music competition") largely puts to rest the whole argument about the "runners-up" category of this template. <i>American Idol</i> certainly qualifies as a "major music competition", so all <i>Idol</i> winners AND runners-up are automatically "notable". --RBBrittain 03:14, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
