<p>I do not think we should merge the articles since this events occuring on this flight are more far-reaching than the man shot. It deals with issues about transportation safety, U.S. Air Marshalls, etc., and therefore they should remain separate. <small>—The preceding comment is by 140.247.158.122 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_140.247.158.122_941c.html" title="Special:Contributions/140.247.158.122">contribs</a>) 13:53, 18 December 2005: <i><a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">Please sign your posts!</a></i></small></p>
<p>Granted, there are going to be differing reports from differing news agencies, but what is written in here is significantly different from what I am hearing at this moment from CNN. I say we not get ourselves pissed off at eachother over what is "right" and what is "wrong" and just wait until tomorrow. Like I said, otherwise, people will just get angry and we'll have a big fight on our hands. <a href="../../../a/p/j/User%7EApjake_72bf.html" title="User:Apjake">Lancer Sykera</a> 21:49, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well. Putting an event that has occured and (the) person that caused the whole incident or maybe even a small involvement are totally different. The merger would be absolutly unnessesary. ---Tsugaru- 06:50, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Consolidate into the Alpizar article, the flight is really not important except in relation to him. DavidLeeWilson 19:31, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Most of the merge discussion seems to be happening in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rigoberto_Alpizar_3aff.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rigoberto Alpizar">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rigoberto Alpizar</a>, right now. --<a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFangz_eec0.html" title="User:Fangz">Fangz</a> 21:05, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>There should at least be a small page about the flight itself pointing to Alpizar, otherwise people who'd heard about the flight and not the person himself won't find any info here. What I mean is, this flight *is* special, and I mean *flight*. Sure, it is special because of Alpizar but we need to have a page about the flight, albeit not as long as it is now. Gleb_Belov</p>
<p>I say merge it as right now this is under the category "Accidents and incidents on commercial airliners in the United States". This was not an accident and techinically the incident in question took place on the jetway, not the plane itself. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayKay_d358.html" title="User:JayKay">JayKay</a> 23:49, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This was discussed at some length back in December. It seems things have settled down so it seems reasonable to try and close the debate. I suggest <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_Flight_924_e31e.html" title="American Airlines Flight 924">American Airlines Flight 924</a> is merged into <a href="../../../r/i/g/Rigoberto_Alpizar_ebc7.html" title="Rigoberto Alpizar">Rigoberto Alpizar</a>, as there is very little information here that is not on that page, and to redirect this to there. <a href="../../../k/c/o/User%7EKcordina_3fec.html" title="User:Kcordina">Kcordina</a> 11:23, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd agree with that move to Rig. Alpizar, since the entire incident centers around one person. If it's needed, the redirect can still be categorized by including the category on the same line (no hard return). -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 17:17, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed "<i>The federal air marshals handled the situation exactly the way they are trained to do.</i>" from the article.

<p>I am sympathetic to the assumption that the air marshal(s) acted appropriately in shooting an uncooperative, unstable person who had allegedly said he had a bomb (I'll suppose he referred to his backpack, as I've read in one source), as I've heard a number of administration spokespeople say, but could someone please comment on whether or not it was appropriate to blow up his suitcases as well? What I'm wondering is, if there is a possiblity of a dangerous device, who knows if it's not possibly some biologically active agent? If the packages were "sniffed" or inspected by some device, there might have been a positive result indicating, say, an explosive or biologically active agent, but a negative result doesn't mean that there's *not* something present. And if something was present but hidden from detection and released upon the explosion, it would be stupid (almost bipolar) to blow it up, at least to do so in the open air in an airport. That's just my opinion. Anyone read anything on this in an authoritative media source?</p>
<dl>
<dd>My(non-professional) opinion is that there is no advantage to putting anything biologically active on the plane. Explosives are easier to procure, there's no guarantee that whatever agent you have will even survive the explosion, and an explosion at 30,000 feet will do an awful job of spreading the bug.<a href="../../../a/t/t/User%7EAttakmint_b65b.html" title="User:Attakmint">Attakmint</a> 20:07, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>releasing a nasty virus at an international airport would spread it pretty well.</p>
<p>blowing up the suitcase is a good way to say "we really did think he had a bomb", even if they knew he should not have been shot.</p>
<dl>
<dd>What's the principle that says "never attribute to malice what can be attributed to ignorance"? Like pretty much everybody else on the planet, the Feds have policy and procedure, and part of that probably includes treating this as a bomb threat. I'm not willing to pass judgement on the shooting until the investigation is finished. Oh, and on the disposal of the bags - I know forum posts are hardly authoritative, but I've heard from a forum I frequent that the bags were opened with high pressure water, and that water was used to short out any possible electronics in bombs. So technically, the bags weren't blown up, they were blown open. It still strikes me as convoluted, unnecessary, and somewhat overdramatic to pack a biological agent in a luggage bomb though. <a href="../../../a/t/t/User%7EAttakmint_b65b.html" title="User:Attakmint">Attakmint</a> 11:12, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I changed the text that he was traveling with a woman back to that he was traveling with his wife. The woman was heard by a witness to shout "My husband, my husband!" (see the nytimes article, among others), so I think we can fairly deduce that she was his wife.

<p>Several news articles contain information that Rigoberto Alpizar claiming to have a bomb might be wrong. Although the sky marshals say it's so, witnesses claim that Alpizar didn't speak at all. All together the situation is way too confused and based on rumors more than facts. I'd consider not just typing off news reports. --Madayar 21:37, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So do I but nobody seems to be interested. (Especially considering nobody has commented in 4 months) I think the best way would be to merge it into the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Rigoberto_Alpizar_ebc7.html" title="Rigoberto Alpizar">Rigoberto Alpizar</a> article, which would remain, replacing the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_Flight_924_e31e.html" title="American Airlines Flight 924">American Airlines Flight 924</a> article. The content is about Alpizar and his death, not necessarily the flight. <a href="../../../a/u/b/User%7EAuburnPilot_7d36.html" title="User:AuburnPilot"><span class="text">​​<font face="Brush Script MT" color="#0000FF" size="4">​​AuburnPilot​​​</font>​</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../a/u/b/User_talk%7EAuburnPilot_2a5c.html" title="User talk:AuburnPilot"><font color="#0000FF">Talk</font></a>)</sup> 00:21, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, after reading the full article, it seems there is really no information in this article that isnt in the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Rigoberto_Alpizar_ebc7.html" title="Rigoberto Alpizar">Rigoberto Alpizar</a> article, with the exception of some background commentary.

<dd>Just redirect it (actually, I'll do that now); it's likely/possible that some information was transferred from here to the RI article, and deleting this article damages our compliance with <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> licensing requirements. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 18:54, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
