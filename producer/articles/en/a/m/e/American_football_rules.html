<p>Game play in <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a> consists of a series of individual plays of short duration, outside of which the ball is <i>dead</i> or not in play. These can be <b>plays from scrimmage</b>—passes, runs, punts, and field goal attempts—or <b>free kicks</b> such as kickoffs. Substitutions can be made between plays, which allows for a great deal of specialization as <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coach_%28sport%29.html" title="Coach (sport)">coaches</a> choose the players best suited for each particular situation. During a play, each team should have 11 players on the field, and each of them usually have specific tasks assigned for that specific play.</p>

<p>The object of the game is to score points by advancing the ball to the opponent's end zone for a <i>touchdown</i>, or to kick <i>field goals</i>, and to prevent the other team from doing likewise. The team with the most points when time has expired wins.</p>
<p><a name="Time_of_play" id="Time_of_play"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football_rules.html" title="Edit section: Time of play">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Time of play</span></h2>
<p>Collegiate and professional football games are 60 minutes long, divided into four quarters of 15 minutes each. In high school football, 12 minute quarters are usually played. The clock is stopped frequently, however, so that a typical professional game can exceed three hours in duration. Timing is stopped after any incomplete pass and any play that ends out of bounds (although in the NFL the clock restarts on the referee's ready-for-play signal outside the last two minutes of the first half and the last five minutes of the second half). In addition, each team is allowed 3 timeouts each half that they may use at their discretion.</p>
<p>The clock may also be stopped for an officials' time-out, after which, if the clock was running, it is restarted. For example; if there is a question as to whether or not a team has moved the ball far enough for a first down, the officials may bring the chains in to measure. While this measurement is taking place, the officials will signal for a stoppage of the clock. Once the measurement is finished and the ball is spotted, the referee will then signal for the clock to restart. Additional situations where officials make take a time-out are to administer a penalty and for an injured player to be removed from the field.</p>
<p>In addition to the game clock, a secondary <i>play clock</i> is also usually displayed. This counts down the time the offense has to start the next play before it is assessed a delay of game penalty (see below).</p>
<p>Officials call for media time-outs after a change of possession (turnover by interception, fumble or on downs), following a successful PAT (Point(s) After Touchdown) or a field goal try, or in the NFL after a kickoff when the opposing team scored, usually when there is more than 5 minutes to play in each quarter. If an instant replay challenge is called during the game, the referees also signal for a media time out. The referee signals these media time-outs by first using the time out signal, then extending both arms in a horizontal position.</p>
<p>Separating the second and third quarters is a <i>halftime</i>. Teams change ends of the field at the end of the first quarter and the end of the third quarter. In the <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" title="NFL">NFL</a>, an automatic timeout is called by the officials when there are two minutes left (or less than two minutes if the play began with over two minutes left and ended with less than two minutes left) in both the second and the fourth quarters; this is most commonly referred to as the <i>two-minute warning.</i> No such warning is normally given in amateur football, though if there is no visible stadium clock, the referee will give a two-minute warning (four minutes in high school).</p>
<p><a name="Overtime" id="Overtime"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football_rules.html" title="Edit section: Overtime">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overtime</span></h3>
<p>If a game is tied at the end of four quarters, <i><a href="../../../o/v/e/Overtime_%28sport%29.html#Football" title="Overtime (sport)">overtime</a></i> is played.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the NFL, overtime periods are 15 minutes in length and are <i><a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudden_death_%28sport%29.html" title="Sudden death (sport)">sudden death</a></i>, meaning that the team that scores first, by any means, wins, and the game automatically ends (referred to in recent years as a <i>walk-off touchdown</i>, <i>walk-off field goal</i> or in rare situations, a <i>walk-off safety</i>). A coin flip is employed to determine which team will gain possession first; the winning team has the option to either receive the kickoff or choose the side of the field they wish to defend. During the regular season in the NFL, one overtime period is played (with each team receiving two time outs), and if neither team scores during overtime, the game officially ends in a tie. In the playoffs, as many overtimes are played as are necessary to determine a winner.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The longest professional football game in history was played in 1984 between the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Express_9ab4.html" title="Los Angeles Express">Los Angeles Express</a> and the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan_Panthers_e181.html" title="Michigan Panthers">Michigan Panthers</a> of the now-defunct <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Football_League_4cc2.html" title="United States Football League">USFL</a>; with the Express winning the game 27-21 after 3:33 of the third overtime period at the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Memorial_Coliseum_f2f1.html" title="Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum">Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_Europa_95da.html" title="NFL Europa">NFL Europa</a>, a developmental league run by the NFL, uses a 10-minute overtime period, with the constraint that each team must have the opportunity of possession; once both teams have had such an opportunity, the overtime proceeds in a manner similar to the NFL's. Thus, if Team A has the first possession of overtime and scores a touchdown and converts their kick (thus being 7 points ahead of Team B), Team A would then kick off to Team B (In the NFL, the game would have ended with the touchdown, without a conversion being attempted). Team B would have to match or exceed the 7 point difference within this ensuing possession; exceeding it would end the game immediately, while matching the difference would result in a kickoff to Team A. From this point, the overtime is sudden death.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In college and high school football, an overtime procedure (the <i>Kansas plan</i>) ensures that each team has equal opportunity to score. In college, both teams are granted possession of the ball at their opponents' 25 yard-line in succession. A coin flip takes place, with the winning team having the option either 1) to declare that they will take the ball first or second, or 2) to decide on which end of the field the series will occur (both teams' series occur on the same end of the field). The losing team will have the first option in any subsequent even-numbered overtime. In the first overtime, the team with first series attempts to score either a touchdown or a field goal; their possession ends when either a touchdown or a field goal have been scored, they turn the ball over via a fumble or an interception, or they fail to gain a first down. After a touchdown, a team may attempt either an extra-point or a two-point conversion. (However, if the team on defense during the first series recovers a fumble and returns it for a touchdown, or returns an interception for a touchdown, the defensive team wins the game. This is the only way for a college overtime game to end without both teams having possession.) Regardless of the outcome of the first team's series (be it touchdown, field goal, or turnover), the other team begins their series. If the score remains tied after both teams have completed a series, a second overtime begins. If the score remains tied after two overtimes, teams scoring touchdowns are required to attempt a two-point conversion from the third overtime on. Just as in regulation, if a defensive team recovers a fumble/returns an interception to the end zone during a two-point conversion attempt, they will receive two points.</li>
<li>In high school football, in most states, each team is granted possession of the ball at the 10-yard line, meaning that a team cannot make a first down without scoring except via a defensive penalty that carries an automatic first down (such as defensive <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pass_interference.html" title="Pass interference">pass interference</a> or roughing the passer). As is the case with the college overtime rule, the team that wins the coin toss will have the choice as to whether to take the ball first or second, or decide at which end of the field the overtime will be played. The other major difference between overtime in college football and high school football is that in high school football, if the defense forces a turnover, they may not score. However, in <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>, the college overtime rule is used, as the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_Interscholastic_League_85e2.html" title="University Interscholastic League">University Interscholastic League</a>, which governs interscholastic activities for Texas public high schools, plays by NCAA football rules with a few modifications for the high school level.</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football_rules.html" title="Edit section: Coin toss">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Coin toss</span></h3>
<p>The game begins with a <i>kickoff</i>, which is one type of free kick (see below). Prior to the game, captains from each team participate in a <a href="../../../c/o/i/Coin_toss.html" title="Coin toss">coin toss</a>. The winner of the toss may make one of the following choices: to kickoff, to receive and have the other team kickoff, or to choose an end of the field to defend. The toss winner nearly always chooses to receive, because that means they get to go first on offense. The other team then may choose from the remaining options (usually which end of the field to defend). In amateur football, the winner of the toss may also defer their choice to the second half and give the other team first choice of options in the first half. This is typically done when the captain winning the toss wants to receive to start the second half.</p>
<p>A kickoff is also used to start the second half of the game. The team who did not get first choice at the coin toss now chooses; likewise, they nearly always choose to receive. Kickoffs also take place after each touchdown and field goal, with the scoring team kicking off.</p>
<p><a name="Kickoffs" id="Kickoffs"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football_rules.html" title="Edit section: Kickoffs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Kickoffs</span></h3>
<p>The ball is placed on a <a href="../../../t/e/e/Tee.html#Kicking_tee" title="Tee">tee</a> (or held) at the kicking team's 30 yard line (35 yard line in college and 40 for high school). The kicking team's players line up on the field parallel to and behind this line and may not cross it until the ball is kicked. A valid kickoff must travel at least 10 yards (though the ball is usually kicked as far as possible—40 to 70 yards), after which any player (though usually one on the receiving team) tries to catch or pick up the ball and advance it down the field before being <i>downed</i>. Occasionally, the kicking team may set up a kick with the intent to recover it; this <b>onside kick</b> is a play where the kicker tries to kick the ball just over the required 10-yard distance in a manner such that a teammate might catch it after a lucky bounce.</p>
<p><a name="Receiving_a_kickoff" id="Receiving_a_kickoff"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football_rules.html" title="Edit section: Receiving a kickoff">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Receiving a kickoff</span></h4>
<p>If a kickoff goes out of bounds before being touched by a player from the receiving team and before entering the end zone, the ball is spotted at the point where it went out of bounds, or 30 yards from the point of the kick, whichever is closer. This spot becomes the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_of_scrimmage.html" title="Line of scrimmage">line of scrimmage</a>. A kick that travels through the end zone, or is caught by the receiving team within the end zone but not advanced, is called a <a href="../../../t/o/u/Touchback.html" title="Touchback">touchback</a>. The ball is placed on the receiving team's 20 yard line, which becomes the line of scrimmage. Most commonly, however, a member of the receiving team will return the kick until he is downed. The spot of the downed ballcarrier becomes the line of scrimmage.</p>
<p><a name="Downed_player" id="Downed_player"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football_rules.html" title="Edit section: Downed player">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Downed player</span></h3>
<p>A player carrying the ball is downed when any of the following occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any part of the runner other than the hands or feet touches the ground. This may be as a result of:
<ul>
<li>Contact by an opponent, where the opponent <i>tackles</i> the runner by pushing him, grasping him and pulling him to the ground, sliding into his legs, etc. Unlike the use of the word <i>tackle</i> in other sports, if the opposing player fails to down the ballcarrier, it is called an <i>attempted tackle</i>.</li>
<li>Accidentally falling to or touching the ground. However, in professional football, the runner is not down in this situation, but may rise and continue to run—unless he is <i>down by contact</i> with an opponent, in other words he has been touched by an opponent whilst he has possession of the ball.</li>
<li>Intentionally downing the ball: intentionally kneeling, verbally declaring "I'm down" (except in college) or similar actions. For example, to protect the quarterback from violent hits by opponents attempting to tackle him, he may slide to the ground feet-first. This slide is interpreted as intentionally downing the ball, and opponents may be penalized for hitting him.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The runner goes out of bounds; that is, any part of his body touches anything (other than another player or an official) on or past a sideline or an endline. Note that the entire sideline is out of bounds.</li>
<li>The runner's <i>forward progress</i> toward the opponents' goal line is stopped from contact by the opponent with little chance to be resumed. The exact moment at which the player's forward progress stops may be unclear and is subject to the judgment of the officials. When this contact occurs on the quarterback, who is grasped and in the control of opponents in the backfield, the quarterback is often referred to as <i>in the grasp</i>.</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football_rules.html" title="Edit section: Plays from scrimmage">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Plays from scrimmage</span></h3>
<p>The majority of a football game takes place on plays that begin at the line of scrimmage. The officials <i>spot</i> the ball (place it in a designated spot on the field) on the line of scrimmage and declare it ready for play.</p>
<p><a name="Positions" id="Positions"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football_rules.html" title="Edit section: Positions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Positions</span></h4>
<p>The width of the spotted football defines the width of the <i>neutral zone</i>, an area of the field no player other than the snapper may position themselves in or above before the snap. Each team has its own line of scrimmage which is a vertical plane from sideline to sideline that passes through the point of the ball nearest its own goal line.</p>
<p>The players on offense must arrange themselves in a <i>formation</i>, all "behind" their line of scrimmage (that is, on the side of the line nearest their own end zone). At least seven players on offense must position themselves "on" (very near) the line; up to four may be farther from it. All players on offense must <i>come set</i>, or stop moving, before the snap. Once set, the offense may "shift" and come set again, as long as they do not simulate the beginning of a play. Additionally, one player at a time, called the <i>man in motion</i>, may be in motion, so long as he is not moving forward (toward the opponents' goal line) at the time of the snap.</p>
<p>The <i>offensive linemen</i> are the players who line up on the line. The <i>center</i> normally lines up directly over the ball, on each side of him is an <i>offensive guard</i>, and on both sides next to the guards are the <i>offensive tackles</i>. The rules require that 5 offensive linemen wear jerseys numbered 50–79. Usually these 5 <i>interior lineman</i> are the ones who wear those numbers. Any other linemen near the tackles are called <i>tight ends</i> and are not part of the interior line. The remaining offensive players who are called <i>backs</i> if they are postitioned in the <i>backfield</i> (the area behind the linemen), or <i>wide receivers</i> (also called <i>split ends</i>). Any wide receivers who are on the line are also linemen. The <i>quarterback</i> is in position to receive the ball from the center; <i>running backs</i> position themselves anywhere in preparation for the play; and wide receivers line up in the backfield positioned to go downfield to catch passes. Of the running backs, a <i>halfback</i> or a <i>tailback</i> will often be in position to run with the ball; a <i>fullback</i> will be in position to block or run with the ball.</p>
<p>The players on defense may arrange themselves in any manner, as long as all players are "behind the line" (that is, on the side of the line nearest their own end zone). Players who line up opposite the offensive line are called <i>defensive linemen</i>, usually with one or two <i>defensive tackles</i> in the middle (although a single defensive tackle is often called the <i>nose guard</i>) and one <i>defensive end</i> on each side. Behind and near the linemen are positioned the <i>linebackers</i>; positioned opposite the wide receivers are the <i>cornerbacks</i>. Two other defensive players, called <i>safeties</i>, position themselves somewhat freely, but usually in the middle of the field behind the linebackers. These last four players are often referred to as the <i>secondary</i>.</p>

<p>The play begins with a <i>snap</i>, where the center throws or hands the ball backward to one of the backs, usually the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quarterback.html" title="Quarterback">quarterback</a>. The play ends when the ball is dead (see below). The ball is typically next spotted where the ball last became dead; however, if it became dead outside the hash marks, it is brought in on the same yard line to the nearest hash mark. This spot becomes the line of scrimmage for the next play. In the case of an incomplete <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forward_pass.html" title="Forward pass">forward pass</a>, the ball is returned to the spot where it was snapped to begin the previous play. A fumbled ball that goes out of bounds is declared dead and possession remains with the team that most recently had control of the ball.</p>

<p>The ball becomes dead, and the play ends, when:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ballcarrier is downed, as described above;</li>
<li>a forward pass falls incomplete (it touches the ground before possession is secured by a player);</li>
<li>the ball or ballcarrier touches the sideline or endline or otherwise goes outside the field of play ("out of bounds");</li>
<li>the ballcarrier or the ball, except on a scoring field goal attempt, hits any part of the goalpost (even if it bounces back onto the field);</li>
<li>a team scores;</li>
<li>a kick receiver makes a fair catch (waving his arm above his head to signal a fair catch, where he the kicking team is not allowed to interfere with him or hit him after the catch, but in return he is not allowed to run), or a member of the receiving team gains possession after a fair catch signal was given;</li>
<li>a member of the kicking team possesses a kicked ball (e.g. "downing" a punt allowed to roll by the receiving team by holding it to stop its roll);</li>
<li>a kicked ball comes to rest;</li>
<li>a touchback occurs; or</li>
<li>under NFL or college rules, on fourth down (or, in the NFL, on any down after the two-minute warning in either half), a ball fumbled forward by the offensive team is recovered by an offensive team player other than the fumbler.</li>
</ul>
<p>The nearest official typically blows his whistle after the ball becomes dead to alert the players that the play is over. If the ball is alive and the official sounds an <i>inadvertent whistle</i>, then the ball still becomes dead, but the team in possession of the ball may elect to have the down replayed or take the spot where the ball was declared dead. If the ball was loose from a fumble, then the ball can be put into play at the spot of the fumble. If the ball was in flight from a kick or a pass, then the down is always replayed.</p>

<p>A field goal is scored when the ball is place kicked, drop kicked, or free kicked after a fair catch or awarded fair catch (High School or NFL only) between the <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goal_posts.html" title="Goal posts">goal posts</a> behind the opponent's end zone. The most common type of kick used is the place kick. For a place kick, the ball must first be snapped to a placeholder, who holds the ball upright on the ground with his fingertip so that it may be kicked. Three points are scored if the ball crosses between the two upright posts and above the crossbar and remains over. If a field goal is missed, the ball is returned to the original line of scrimmage (in the NFL, to the spot of the kick; in high school, to the 20-yard line if the ball enters the end zone, or otherwise where the ball becomes dead after the kick) or to the 20-yard line if that is further from the goal line, and possession is given to the other team. If the ball does not go out of bounds, the other team may catch the kicked ball and attempt to advance it, but this is usually not advantageous. One official is positioned under each goalpost; if either one rules the field goal no good, then the field goal is unsuccessful. A successful field goal is signaled by an official extending both arms vertically above the head. A team that successfully kicks a field goal kicks off to the opposing team on the next play.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football_rules.html" title="Edit section: Touchdown (6 points)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Touchdown (6 points)</span></h3>
<p>A touchdown is achieved when a player has legal possession of the ball and the ball crosses an imaginary vertical plane above the opposing team's goal line. After a touchdown, the scoring team is awarded a try (see below). A successful touchdown is signaled by an official extending both arms vertically above the head.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football_rules.html" title="Edit section: Try for extra point (1 or 2 points)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Try for extra point (1 or 2 points)</span></h3>
<p>A <b>try</b> is more frequently called an <b>extra-point attempt</b> or a <b>PAT</b> (abbreviation of "Point After Touchdown"). Either one or two additional points may be scored during the try. The ball is spotted at the 2 yard line (NFL) or 3 yard line (college/high school), and the team is given one play to earn points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The offensive team may attempt to kick the ball through the goalposts, in the same manner that a field goal is kicked. This option is almost always chosen, because a two point conversion attempt is much riskier. If successful the team is awarded one point, referred to as an <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extra_point.html" title="Extra point">extra point</a>. Because the extra point is almost always successful (especially in <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" title="NFL">NFL</a> play), sportscasters will refer to a team up by seven (not six) points as being "up by a touchdown".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The offensive team may attempt to advance the ball via run or pass into the end zone, much like a touchdown on the extra-point attempt, except that it receives two points. This is called a <b><a href="../../../t/w/o/Two-point_conversion.html" title="Two-point conversion">two-point conversion</a></b>. The success rate for two-point conversions is less than 40 percent in the NFL and college, making the two-point conversion attempt a risky tactic; thus it is usually attempted only when two points will help the team but one point will not. For example, suppose that it is late in the game with a score of 21-10 and the losing team scores a touchdown, making the score 21-16. The scoring team will usually attempt the two-point conversion, because if successful, a three-point deficit later could be matched with one field goal; failure to convert would result in a five-point deficit that would not be surmounted without another touchdown—a situation no worse than the four-point deficit achieved with a kicked extra point.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Under college rules, if the defensive team advances the ball the length of the field into the other end zone on the try, for example by an interception or a fumble recovery, it receives two points. This is officially recorded as a touchdown scored by the defense. The <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association_2404.html" title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</a> adopted this rule in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>. This scenario cannot occur under NFL or <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Federation_of_State_High_School_Associations_5d81.html" title="National Federation of State High School Associations">National Federation of State High School Associations</a> rules; the ball is dead and the extra-point attempt is over immediately when the defense gains possession.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the extremely rare event that the offensive team scores a <a href="#Safety_.282_points.29" title="">safety</a> on the try, it receives one point. In college football, this can occur when, for example, the defense gains control of the ball and attempts to advance it, then fumbles it out of bounds in its own end zone. In the NFL, since the try ends once the defense gains possession, a safety can only be scored if a defensive player bats a loose (fumbled) ball out of bounds in the end zone.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The officials' signal for a successful try, whether an extra point or a two point conversion, is the same as for a touchdown. After the try, the team that scored the touchdown kicks off to the opposing team.</li>

<p>The uncommon <b>safety</b> is scored if a player causes the ball to become dead in his own end zone; two points are awarded to the opposing (usually defending) team. This can happen if a player is either downed or goes out of bounds in the end zone while carrying the ball, or if he fumbles the ball, and it goes out of bounds in the end zone. A safety is also awarded to the defensive team if the offensive team commits a penalty which is enforced in its own end zone. A safety is <i>not</i> awarded if a player intercepts a pass or receives a kick in his own end zone and is downed there. This situation, in which the opponent caused the ball to enter the end zone, is called a <a href="../../../t/o/u/Touchback.html" title="Touchback">touchback</a>; no points are scored, and the team that gained possession of the ball is awarded possession at its own 20 yard line. If the interception or reception occurs outside the end zone, and the player is carried into the end zone by momentum, the ball is placed at the spot of the catch and no safety is awarded. A safety is signaled by a referee holding both palms together above the head, fingertips pointing upwards. After a safety, the team that conceded the safety kicks a free kick (a punt must be used in the NFL; a place kick or a drop kick is permissible in amateur) from its 20 yard line.</p>

<p>A free kick (see below) may be taken on the play immediately after any <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_catch.html" title="Fair catch">fair catch</a> of a punt. In the NFL, if the receiving team elects to attempt this and time expired during the punt, the half is extended with an untimed down. The ball must be held on the ground by a member of the kicking team or may be drop kicked; a tee may not be used. (High school kickers may use a tee.) This is both a field goal attempt and a free kick; if the ball is kicked between the goal posts, three points are scored for the kicking team. This is the only case where a free kick may score points. This method of scoring is extremely rare; it is only advantageous when as a team catches a very short punt with very little time left. Note that a team is unlikely to be punting with only a few seconds left in a half, and it is rarer still for punts to be caught near field goal range. The officials' signal for a successful fair catch kick is the same as for a field goal.</p>

<p>The game is officiated by a crew of three to seven officials. Every crew will consist of a <i>referee</i>, who is generally in charge of the game and watches action on the quarterback and in the offensive backfield; an <i>umpire</i>, who handles spotting the ball and watches action on the offensive line; and a <i>head linesman</i>, who supervises placement of the down box and line-to-gain chains. The crew may also consist of a <i>line judge</i>, <i>back judge</i>, <i>field judge</i> and <i>side judge</i>, in the order listed: i.e. a crew of five officials has a referee, umpire, head linesman, line judge and back judge.</p>
<p>Officials are selected by the teams in advance or appointed by the governing league. Note that unlike some other sports, no football officials—not even at the NFL level—are full-time employees of the league; they all officiate on a part-time basis.</p>
<p>During the game, the officials are assisted in the administration of the game by other persons, including: a <i>clock operator</i> to start and stop the game clock (and possibly also the play clock); a chain crew who hold the <i>down indicator</i> and the <i>line-to-gain chains</i> on the sideline; and <i>ball boys</i>, who provide footballs to officials between downs (e.g. a dry ball each down on a wet day). These individuals may be provided by the teams involved—it is not uncommon for a high school coach's son to act as ball boy for the team.</p>

<p>A <b>free kick</b> is a special play which does not occur from scrimmage. The kicking team begins behind the ball, while the receiving team must remain at least 10 yards downfield before the ball is kicked.</p>
<p>A <b>kickoff</b> is a kind of free kick used to start each half, and also used to restart the game following a field goal or touchdown. At the beginning of a half, the kicking team is determined by <a href="../../../c/o/i/Coin_toss.html" title="Coin toss">coin toss</a>. After a field goal or touchdown, the kicking team is the team which just scored. A kickoff must be either a place kick or a drop kick. A tee may be used, and the ball may be held by a member of the kicking team. The receiving team may recover and attempt to advance the ball at any time after the kick, but the kicking team may not touch the ball until it has traveled at least 10 yards or been touched by a member of the receiving team. The ball is usually kicked as deep as possible to the receiving team, in order to force the receivers to start far down the field, but sometimes a team will attempt to recover its own short kick, in a play known as an <b><a href="../../../o/n/s/Onside_kick.html" title="Onside kick">onside kick</a>.</b></p>
<p>A free kick is also used to restart the game following a safety. The team that was trapped in its own end zone, therefore conceding two points to the other team, kicks the ball from its own 20-yard line. This can be a place kick (in the NFL, a tee cannot be used), drop kick or punt.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football_rules.html" title="Edit section: Penalties">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Penalties</span></h2>
<p>Because football is a high-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Contact_sport.html" title="Contact sport">contact sport</a> requiring a balance between offense and defense, many rules exist that regulate equality, safety, contact, and actions of players on each team. It is very difficult to always avoid violating these rules without giving up too much of an advantage. Thus, an elaborate system of penalties has been developed to "<a href="../../../l/e/t/Let_the_punishment_fit_the_crime.html" title="Let the punishment fit the crime">let the punishment fit the crime</a>" and maintain a balance between following the rules and keeping a good flow of the game. Players are constantly looking for ways to find an advantage that stretches the limitations imposed by the rules. Also, the frequency and severity of penalties can make a large difference in the outcome of a game, so coaches are constantly looking for ways to minimize the number and severity of infractions committed by their players.</p>
<p>It is a common misconception that the term "penalty" is used to refer both to an infraction and the penal consequence of that infraction. A <i>foul</i> is a rule infraction for which a penalty is prescribed.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Some of the more common penalties are listed below. In most cases when a penalty occurs, the offending team will be assessed a penalty of 5, 10 or 15 yards, depending on the infraction. Also, in most cases, if the penalty is committed while the ball is in play, the down will be replayed from the new position (for example, if the offense commits a penalty on a first-down play, the next play will still be first down, but the offense may have to go 15 yards, or farther, to achieve another first down.) But if a defensive penalty results in the ball advancing beyond the offense's first-down objective, the next play will be the first down of a new series. Some penalties (typically for more serious fouls), however, require a loss of down for the offense; and some defensive penalties may result in an automatic first down regardless of the ball position. In all cases (except for ejection of a player or, in rare cases, forfeiture of the game), the non-offending team is given the option of declining the penalty and letting the result of the play stand (although the Referee may exercise this option on their behalf when it is obvious), if they believe it to be more to their advantage. For some infractions by the defense, the penalty is applied in addition to the yardage gained on the play. Most <b>personal fouls</b>, which involve danger to another player, carry 15-yard penalties; in rare cases, they result in offending players being ejected from the game. In the NFL, if a defensive penalty occurs after time has expired at the end of a half, the half will be continued for a single, untimed play from scrimmage. Under college rules, any accepted penalty when time has expired at the end of any quarter results in an extension for one untimed down.</p>
<p>In the NFL, with three exceptions, no penalty may move the ball more than half the distance toward the penalized team's goal line. These exceptions are defensive pass interference (see the discussion of that penalty for more details), intentional grounding, and offensive holding – but in this last case the exception pertains only if the infraction occurs within the offensive team's own end zone, in which case an automatic safety is assessed (intentional grounding from the end zone also carries an automatic safety). Under college rules, the same half-the-distance principle applies, but any offensive fouls involving contact in their end zone (eg. holding, illegal blocking or personal fouls) result in a safety.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Note:</i> The <b>neutral zone</b> is the space defined by lines drawn through the ends of the ball parallel to the yard lines when the ball is spotted and ready for play. No player may legally have any part of his body in the neutral zone when the ball is snapped, with the exception of the center.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Specific penalties most often fall into larger categories; the penalties here are listed as such.</p>

<p>A penalty shall be called against the team on offense, or the team with possession of the ball, when...</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Illegal procedure</b> (5 yards) - they commit any of a number of infractions in failing to adhere to the rules that govern action before the snap. Referee signal: two arms in front of chest with closed fists "rolling" around each other (same signal that basketball referees use to signal traveling). Illegal procedure includes, but is not limited to:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>False start</b> - any player moves after they have gotten in their set position before the snap in a way that simulates the start of the play.</li>
<li><b>Illegal motion</b> - a player in motion is moving forward at the time of the snap. Referee signal: One arm in front of chest, palm open and down, with the elbow out to the side, moved away from chest.</li>
<li><b>Illegal shift</b> - a player is not in motion but is not set before the snap; more than one player is in motion at the snap; or after more than one player was moving (shifting), all eleven players have not been motionless for one second. Referee signal: two arms in front of chest, palms open and down, with the elbows out to the side, moved away from chest.</li>
<li><b>Illegal formation</b> - fewer than 7 players line up on the line of scrimmage (or more than 7 in the NFL); eligible receivers fail to line up as the leftmost and rightmost players on the line in the NFL; or when five properly numbered ineligible players fail to line up on the line.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Delay of game</b> (5 yards) - they fail to snap the ball before the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Play_clock.html" title="Play clock">play clock</a> reaches zero. The 40-second play clock (25 seconds in amateur) starts running immediately when the previous play ends. If there is a timeout or other stoppage of play, a 25-second play clock starts from when the ball is spotted and declared ready for play. Referee signal: Upper arms extended out from the body, forearms bent toward the opposite arm, such that the arms lie on top of one another or that each arm touches the opposite shoulder.</li>
<li><b>Illegal touching</b> of a pass (5 yards) - a forward pass first touches an <i>ineligible receiver</i>, that is, one of the five members of the interior offensive line. If the ball touches a defender first, any player may touch it, and defenders may freely make contact with receivers. Referee signal: one hand held up to shoulder, fingertips touching the shoulder.</li>
<li><b>Ineligible receiver down field</b> (5 yards) - an ineligible receiver is past the line of scrimmage prior to a forward pass. Ineligible receivers must wait until the pass has been thrown and travels past the line of scrimmage to move past the line of scrimmage. This penalty is not imposed if the receiver is behind the line of scrimmage when he receives the pass. This exception has been added to accommodate the screen pass, where a receiver (most often a back, but sometimes a tight end or wide receiver) catches a ball behind the line of scrimmage behind a "screen" of offensive linemen. Referee signal: One palm touching the top of the head with the elbow out to the side.</li>
<li><b>Intentional grounding</b> - a forward pass is thrown intentionally away from eligible receivers so that the passer avoids being tackled for a loss (or throwing an interception)
<ul>
<li>NFL penalty: 10 yards or spot of foul, whichever is farther from the original line of scrimmage, and loss of down. If the penalty occurs with less than a minute left in the 1st or 2nd half, a 10-second penalty is also enforced. If it occurs with 10 seconds or less left, the half automatically ends. The 10-second runoff does not apply if the penalized team uses any of the allotted time-outs in lieu of the runoff. The defense is not credited for a QB sack on intentional grounding penalties.</li>
<li>College penalty: Spot of foul and loss of down; defense awarded a quarterback sack in some leagues.</li>
<li>In both NFL and college, intentional grounding from the offensive team's own end zone constitutes an automatic safety unless the defense chooses to decline the penalty, which might only ever happen if the infraction had occurred on a fourth-down play. If the quarterback has moved outside of the area between his offensive tackles (the "pocket"), there is no penalty for grounding the ball if the quarterback throws the ball past the line of scrimmage. There is also no penalty for "spiking" the ball to stop the game clock, by throwing it directly into the ground. However, such an action must be executed immediately after the snap of the ball, before the quarterback demonstrates intent to make a forward pass.</li>
<li>High school penalty: 5 yards from the spot of the foul and loss of down; defense credited with a quarterback sack.</li>
<li>Referee signal: both hands held out flat, facing each other, in front of the referee, moving down together diagonally roughly from one shoulder to the opposite hip.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the NFL, if the penalties above (with the exception of "Illegal Formation") occur with less than a minute remaining in the half and the clock running, then a ten-second penalty is also assessed. The half automatically ends if the penalty occurs with 10 seconds or less remaining to be played with the clock running. The 10-second penalty does not apply if the clock is stopped when the ball is set for play and will not start until the ball is snapped, or if a team elects to use one of their time outs in lieu of the 10-second runoff. A team wanting to run the clock out in a close game cannot intentionally false start and use the 10-second rule to their advantage, because the run-off rule only applies to a team that is either losing or tied. Since the enforcement of the 10-second runoff, only one NFL game ended automatically due to a false start with less than 10 seconds remaining (in 2005 between Arizona and St. Louis). A pre-season game in 2006 between Houston and Kansas City had the first half end automatically due to an intentional grounding penalty with less than 10 seconds left.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Offensive pass interference</b> - a player physically hinders a defender attempting to catch a pass, or pushes the defender in order to create separation to catch the pass. Referee signal: two arms in front of the body with palms out and fingers up, moved in a pushing motion out. NFL penalty: 10 yards from the previous line of scrimmage. Amateur penalty: 15 yards from the previous spot and loss of down.</li>
<li><b>Illegal forward pass</b> (5 yards and loss of down) - a forward pass is thrown from past the line of scrimmage, or when a second forward pass is thrown on the same play. Referee signal: One hand, flat, waved behind the small of the back. Defense credited with a quarterback sack in some college leagues.</li>
<li><b>Holding</b> (10 yards) - there is illegal use of the hands or arms while blocking, usually a grasp or a tackle of a defending player; an automatic safety is assessed if the spot of the infraction is within the offensive team's own end zone. Referee signal: one forearm vertically held in front of the body with a closed fist facing the referee's chest; the other hand grasping the first arm's wrist. The penalty is enforced from the previous spot, unless the infraction occurred beyond the line of scrimage or during a running play, in which the penalty is enforced from the spot of the foul. High school penalty: 10 yards from the spot of the foul.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, when a player on offense commits an illegal block, such as if...</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Illegal block in the back</b> (10 yards) - a player makes any block from behind and <i>above</i> the waist. Referee signal: one forearm vertically held in front of the body with palm facing outward; the other hand grasping the first arm's wrist.</li>
<li><b>Clipping</b> (15 yards) - an illegal block from behind and <i>below</i> the waist. Referee signal: hand striking the back of the leg.</li>
<li><b>Blocking below the waist'</b>, also called a <b>crackback block</b> (15 yards) - an illegal block, from any direction, below the waist by any offensive player not on the offensive line (e.g. wide receivers, quarterbacks and running backs), by any player after change of possession, by any player in high school with certain exceptions. Referee signal: both hands brought down, wrists turned inward, in a chopping motion across the front of the thighs.</li>
<li><b>Tripping</b> (10 yards, 15 in high school) - a player trips a defender near the ankles. Referee signal: one foot kicks the ankle of the other leg from behind.</li>

<p>A penalty shall be called against the defensive team when...</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Offsides</b> (5 yards) - any part of a player is in or past the neutral zone when the ball is snapped. Unlike offensive players, defensive players are not compelled to come to a set position before the snap, so if a defender jumps across the line but gets back to his side before the snap there is no penalty. In the case of an offsides penalty, play is not stopped, and the penalty is announced at the conclusion of the play. The offense can thus decline the penalty and take the yardage gained on the play - unlike in the case of a false start penalty against the offense, whereupon the play is immediately stopped by the officials. Referee signal: both hands placed on hips, with elbows pointing outwards.</li>
<li><b>Encroachment</b> (5 yards) - a defensive player crosses the line of scrimmage and makes contact with a player, or has an unabated path to the quarterback, before the snap. Unlike the offsides penalty, this penalty immediately halts play: the referees blow the whistle, the clock stops, and the offense does not run a play. In high school, any entry to the neutral zone by a defensive player is an encroachment penalty; the play cannot start with a player offsides. Referee signal: same as offsides.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delay of game</b> (5 yards) - a defensive player delays the game or hinders the offense in hurrying to make the next snap. This happens most often in the last two minutes of a half when the offense is trying to go down the field in a hurry. Referee signal: same as offensive delay of game.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Running into the kicker</b> (5 yards) - on a kicking play where the defense fails to touch ("block") the kicked ball, they run into the kicker/punter. If such an act occurs but is not flagrant, this penalty is assessed. If flagrant, the personal foul of roughing the kicker may be assessed instead (see below).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Defensive pass interference</b> - a defensive player physically hinders an offensive player from catching a catchable forward pass that has not been touched by any other player. Referee signal: same as offensive pass interference - two arms in front of the body with palms out and fingers up, moved in a pushing motion out.
<ul>
<li>NFL: An automatic first down and the ball is moved forward to the location of the interference — a devastating penalty if the play was a long pass. If the interference takes place in the end zone, the ball is placed on the one-yard line.</li>
<li>College: An automatic first down. Penalty is 15 yards or the spot of the foul, whichever is closer to the previous line of scrimmage. The half-the-distance rule <b>does not</b> apply, unless the previous line of scrimmage was on or inside the 2-yard line. If the ball was snapped between the defensive team's 17-yard and 2-yard lines, <b>and</b> the foul occurred inside the 2-yard line or in the end zone, the ball is placed on the 2-yard line.</li>
<li>High school: 15 yards and an automatic first down; the half-the-distance rule always applies.</li>
<li>At any level, if the receiver is interfered with behind the line of scrimmage, the defender cannot be charged with pass interference (although he may be guilty of a different penalty). This nuance in the rules almost never arises, but can conceivably occur on a screen pass. Pass interference is also rendered inapplicable if the ball was tipped by a player on either team prior to the contact being made, regardless of how slight or incidental the "tipping" was.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Illegal use of hands</b> (NFL: 5 yards and an automatic first down; college: 5 yards and an automatic first down unless the previous play was 1st and 10, making the next play 1st and 5; high school, 10 yards and the down repeated) - a player illegally uses his hands against a player on offense while attempting to ward off a block, cover a receiver, or tackle a ballcarrier. Referee signal: one forearm vertically held in front of the body with an open fist facing away from the referee's chest (closed first for a HS referee); the other hand grasping the first arm's wrist. There are several restrictions on how a defender may initiate contact, such as when...
<ul>
<li><b>Defensive holding</b> - a player grasps a player on offense while attempting to ward off a block or cover a receiver. Referee signal: one forearm vertically held in front of the body with a closed fist facing the referee's chest; the other hand grasping the first arm's wrist.</li>
<li><b>Illegal hands to the face</b> - a player pushes or hits as a player on offense in the head or helmet. Referee signal: One open fist in a pushing motion to the referee's chin.</li>
<li><b>Illegal contact</b> - a player makes significant contact with a receiver after the receiver has advanced five yards beyond the line of scrimmage, This rule was adopted in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, and its enactment is regarded as contributing to the dramatic increase in both passing yardage and scoring the NFL has witnessed since that time. Referee signal: One arm in front of the body with palm out and fingers up, moved in a pushing motion out.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Inadvertently contacting the <b>face mask</b> (5 yards, automatic first down awarded in college only) - contacting the offensive player's face mask without grasping or twisting it, or a "touch and release" of the mask. Note: it is also a foul for an offensive player to touch an opponent's face mask, including when the runner stiff-arms a defensive player. Referee signal: One hand extended in front of the face, fist closed, and pulling down (simulating the grasping of the mask).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Personal Foul</b> (15 yards and a first down, except in high school, where the down is repeated) - a player commits a conduct- or safety-related infraction. If the officials decide that the action was particularly flagrant, the player in question can be ejected from the game. Referee signal: same as offensive personal foul, <i>possibly</i> followed by the appropriate signal for one of the following penalties:
<ul>
<li><b>Roughing the Passer</b> (15 yards and an automatic first down, all levels) - a defender continues an effort to tackle or "hit" a passer after the passer has already thrown a pass. The NFL standard is that a defender is allowed to take one step after the ball is thrown; a defender is penalized if he hits the passer having taken two or more steps after the ball leaves the passer's hand. Referee signal: arm moved in a passing motion.</li>
<li><b>Roughing the Kicker</b> (15 yards and an automatic first down, all levels) - a defender, having missed an attempt to block a kick, tackles the kicker or otherwise runs into the kicker in a way that might injure the kicker or his vulnerable extended kicking leg. This protection is also extended to the holder of a place kick. Referee signal: leg moved in a kicking motion.</li>
<li><b>Roughing the Snapper</b> (15 yards and an automatic first down, all levels) - on a punt or field goal attempt, the center is allowed to regain his balance and assume a protective position before he is contacted by the defense.</li>
<li>Intentionally grasping the <b>face mask</b> - contact on an opponent's face mask which includes grasping or twisting the mask, and including using the mask to tackle an opponent.</li>
<li><b>Spearing</b> - tackling or otherwise contacting an opponent with one's helmet. (This technique is illegal because of the risk of neck injuries to the tackler.) Referee signal: arm extended, bent at the elbow, touching the side of his head with a closed fist.</li>
</ul>

<p>A penalty shall be called against the offending team when...</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Substitution infraction</b> (5 yards) - the team has twelve or more players in the huddle or formation before a play or a player is attempting to leave the field as the ball is snapped. Referee signal: arm along the side of the body with the palm of the hand touching the opposite shoulder.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Illegal participation</b> (15 yards) - twelve players participate during the play, either because twelfth player is not detected before the snap or enters during the play. Illegal participation is also called when an offensive player goes out of bounds (unless forced out by contact by the defense) and returns during the play. Referee signal: two hands, palms down, touching the top of the head, with an elbow out to each side.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Sideline infraction</b> (5 yards) - when a coach or player on the sidelines is on the edge of the field during the snap. An official will usually issue a "sideline warning" once before issuing a penalty, and subsequent penalties will be unsportsmanlike conduct.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Personal fouls</b> (15 yards, automatic first down in NFL and college if committed by the defense) - a player commits a conduct- or safety-related infraction. This includes unnecessary roughness, such as hitting a ball carrier after he is already out of bounds, "piling on" a ball carrier who is already down, or violent contact with an opponent who is away from and out of the play. If the officials decide that the action was particularly flagrant, the player in question can be ejected from the game. Referee signal: Open fists held diagonally perpendicular and above the head, with the front edge of one hand striking the rear edge of the other hand near the thumb.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Unsportsmanlike conduct</b> - any person—usually a player, but occasionally a coach, and very rarely one or more spectators—acts or speaks in a manner deemed to be especially objectionable by the game officials, or by rule. Examples include throwing punches, deliberate physical contact with officials, verbal abuse of officials, and taunting, which, since <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> in the NFL, has included any "prolonged and premeditated celebrations" by players (prior to that year these latter carried only a 5-yard penalty). Referee signal: both arms extended to the sides perpendicular to the body with open fists, palms down.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Violations of the <b>equipment</b> rules - any player in the game without necessary safety equipment (mouthpiece, pads), without chin straps properly fastened, or in violation of certain clothing rules (e.g. sock requirements in college). HS penalty: 5 yards. College penalty: timeout charged against the offending player's team.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Palpably unfair act</b> (as necessary) - Called in the case of any illegal action that the officials deem has clearly and indisputably deprived a team of a score. For example, if a player or other person not legally in the game at the start of a given play comes onto the field to tackle a player apparently en route to a touchdown, the team that would have scored is awarded the touchdown. This can also conceivably be invoked in cases where the defense commits repeated intentional infractions very close to its own goal line (the half-the-distance rule making the consequence of such infractions otherwise infinitesimal).</li>

<p>During each play, any official may signal a penalty by tossing a bright yellow colored <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag.html" title="Flag">flag</a> onto the field toward or at the spot of a foul. Multiple officials may flag the same play. If applicable, the same official can signal additional penalties on a given play by throwing a <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beanbag.html" title="Beanbag">beanbag</a> or his <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hat.html" title="Hat">hat</a>. When a flag is thrown, the referee, the official(s) who threw the flag(s) and other officials with a view of the play confer to come to a consensus on whether an infraction was actually committed, what it was, and who committed it. The final determination and assessment of the penalty is the sole responsibility of the referee.</p>

<p>The referee then makes initial visual body signals to the press box (and crowd) indicating what penalties were committed and the team that committed them, the latter shown by extending the arm toward that team's end zone. The referee then confers with the offended team's on-field captain to find out whether the offended team would rather decline the penalty and take the result of the play. However, there are certain scenarios where the referee may not have to confer with the team captain because the enforcement is entirely automatic (such as a false start penalty) or when the choice is fairly obvious (such as when the defense commits a foul during a play in which the offense scores a touchdown).</p>
<p>After any final conference, the referee then makes full visual signals describing the penalty in detail, which consists of: the penalty that was committed, the team that committed it, whether or not the opposing team chooses to decline it, and the resulting down or possession. In <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_Football_1afc.html" title="College Football">College Football</a>, the <a href="../../../n/f/l/NFL_18f8.html" title="NFL">NFL</a> and other professional leagues, and in some high school games, the referee also announces the penalties over a <a href="../../../w/i/r/Wireless_microphone.html" title="Wireless microphone">wireless microphone</a> to the crowd. In college and professional football, the referee will also give out the numbers of the players who committed the fouls.</p>
<p>Example: Suppose that, on a pass play in the NFL from the offense's 30 yard line, the <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safety_%28football_position%29.html" title="Safety (football position)">safety</a>, wearing number 26, commits defensive pass interference at the defense's 45 yard line. The official closest to the play, the side judge, throws his flag. After the pass falls incomplete and the play is whistled dead, the referee confers with the side judge and perhaps the umpire (who could also see the play and who would know whether a defensive lineman tipped the ball, which would negate the penalty), who inform the referee of what they saw. The referee will likely then choose to assess the penalty.</p>
<p>The referee stands in the middle of the field, gives the pass interference signal and points to the defense's end zone. Since the penalty is very advantageous to the offense, the referee will likely assume that the penalty is not declined. After a short pause to confirm the penalty, the referee gives the full signal, displaying the body signals as he describes them: "Pass interference, number 26, defense. The ball will be placed at the spot of the foul. Automatic first down." The ball is moved to the defense's 45 yard line, and the next play begins.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football_rules.html" title="Edit section: Instant replay">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Instant replay</span></h2>
<p>In the NFL, a number of rulings (but typically not penalties) can be reviewed by officials or challenged by coaches (see <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instant_replay.html" title="Instant replay">Instant replay</a>). If a coach wants to challenge a play, he must do so before the next play begins, and he does so by throwing a red flag similar to the officials' yellow flags. Coaches are allowed two challenges per game and may be granted a third if their first two are successful. The team loses a timeout if they lose the challenge. Plays inside the two-minute-warning cannot be challenged; any review of that play must be initiated by a replay official off-field. The referee performs the actual review via a video screen on the sideline. The referee will announce the result of <a href="../../../i/n/s/Instant_replay.html" title="Instant replay">instant replay</a> reviews over his wireless microphone.</p>
<p>In college, coaches are allowed one challenge per game by first requesting a timeout. Otherwise, a replay official in the press box observes all plays. If he deems a ruling may be in error, he notifies the officials on the field to interrupt the game before the beginning of the next play. The replay official performs the review and relays the decision to the referee, who announces the result. Not every conference employs replay, which is optional.</p>
<p>High school rules do not provide for video review of any decisions by officials during the game. Further, the use of television or video tape for coaching purposes during the game is prohibited. If a coach feels a rule has been misinterpreted, he may call timeout and request a coach-referee conference to <i>discuss</i> the ruling with the referee, but no replay equipment will be consulted during the conference.</p>
