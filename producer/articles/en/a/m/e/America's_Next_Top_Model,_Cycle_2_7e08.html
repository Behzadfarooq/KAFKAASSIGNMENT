<p>The second season of <i><b><a href="../../../a/m/e/America%27s_Next_Top_Model_9535.html" title="America's Next Top Model">America's Next Top Model</a></b></i> aka the editorial season aired in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, and featured twelve contestants instead of ten. Though the format was the same as Cycle 1, there were notable variations on how the show was presented.</p>
<p>The photo shoots in this season tended to be more sexual; the first photo shoot required contestants to pose nude in body paint, an assignment that plus-sized contestant Anna Bradfield refused. Subsequently, she was the first contestant to be eliminated.</p>
<p>Additionally, the final four contestants — Shandi Sullivan, <a href="../../../y/o/a/Yoanna_House_183a.html" title="Yoanna House">Yoanna House</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercedes_Scelba-Shorte_bb4f.html" title="Mercedes Scelba-Shorte">Mercedes Scelba-Shorte</a>, and April Wilkner — participated in an erotic photo shoot in <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan.html" title="Milan">Milan</a>, <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> in which each pair of contestants posed nude together for a perfume advertisement. However, while the official site of this program normally displays the portfolio pictures of each contestant each week, the body paint photo shoot was placed in the site gallery in an edited form and the perfume advertisement photographs were completely omitted from each contestant's portfolio.</p>

<p>In order of elimination, here's some information on the 12 contestants of Cycle 2:</p>
<p><b>Anna</b> - <i>Eliminated 1st</i> after refusing to do the first photoshoot which involved only body paint covering the contestants' bodies. Felt an obligation to be a role model to the wives and mothers of America (she was a wife and mother herself), and believed only her husband should see her naked. However she did not execute her intentions well enough at panel and the judges felt she contradicted herself. To this date, Anna is the only contestant in ANTM history to have a non-existent portfolio.</p>
<p><b>Bethany</b> - <i>Eliminated 2nd</i> after the judges felt that she was not versatile enough for the fashion industry. Controversy surrounded the size of her breasts, which were larger than the other contestants' and she did not know how to correctly pose to look more high-fashion. Along with Yoanna, she confronted Camille at the house meeting early in episode 2. Bethany was eliminated because she couldn't pose without looking pinuppish.</p>
<p><b>Heather</b> - <i>Eliminated 3rd</i> for just not showing her uniqueness, although she took a stunning photo, lingering doubt and loneliness got the best of her. She tried making friends with Yoanna and when Yoanna won the challenge for that week, Yoanna forgot Heather's name and picked April instead to share in her prize. This really flustered Heather, who just couldn't handle being forgettable. Heather was sent home because she looked too "teen".</p>
<p><b>Jenascia</b> - <i>Eliminated 4th</i> mostly for apparently not owning up to her height. Early on, Jenascia knew she had to overcompensate because she was the shortest girl there at only 5'7". Jenascia had helped April escape her own problems at the fashion show in the first episode, and when all the other girls left without her when she had overslept the first photoshoot (by over 3 hours) including April, Jenascia felt betrayed, especially by April. Judge <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigel_Barker_4cce.html" title="Nigel Barker">Nigel Barker</a>, photographer for the first photoshoot, calmed her down and eventually got her to turn out a successful photo. However, the judges soon felt she wasn't bringing anything "extra" to the table to make up for her lack of height, and she was sent home in Episode 4. After the cycle, Jenascia became pregnant with her first child, due late January.</p>
<p><b>Xiomara</b> - <i>Eliminated 5th</i> after looking like a "walrus wearing chiffon" (per Nolé Marin) in the underwater shoot. Her alternative and unique looks set her apart from most of the other contestants but worked against her as she didn't know what to do with it. After seeing Xiomara's runway walk with bugged-out eyes, <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._Alexander_5fcf.html" title="J. Alexander">J. Alexander</a> said, it looked like she was "on crack". During the "fear" photoshoot, she tried to aide Catie, and her picture ended up being the worst. The two sparred in the judging room, in front of all the judges. However, she shone in the celebrity shoot as <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grace_Jones_bfff.html" title="Grace Jones">Grace Jones</a>, although at first she was not pleased with the idea. She became good friends with Shandi and was shown to be very caring and likeable, especially with her impressions, and this was proven as she was chosen to share in the rewards won by the other girls often.</p>
<p><b>Catie</b> - <i>Eliminated 6th</i> after a combination of a weak photograph and an even weaker in-person performance. Catie had started out as an early front-runner in the first couple episodes, even winning the runway challenge in Episode 2. She was devastated and cried constantly after having had her long blonde hair cut off in the makeover in early Episode 3, and she also had a meltdown when the contestants were suspended over a deep hole for a photoshoot. She pulled off a strong enough photo to continue although her mental and emotional weaknesses worried the judges. During that shoot, Xiomara had given up her own focus to help Catie, for which Catie attacked Xiomara later. Her runway walk remained continuously strong, however the judges repeatedly told her that she looked or dressed like a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prostitute.html" title="Prostitute">prostitute</a>. Catie was eliminated after the black &amp; white photoshoot (paired up with a commercial), in which she looked like a "scared guppy" (per Eric Nicholson).</p>
<p><b>Sara</b> - <i>Eliminated 7th</i> after the judges felt she was heading down-market, and fast. Sara's portfolio was never spectacular but she was consistent and determined. She faced adversity from her own immediate family due to her Persian heritage, as her father believed that modeling was akin to prostitution. A visit from her mother in episode 5 (won by Mercedes) gave her the strength she needed. The judges also liked her "homegirl" attitude early in the season but Tyra felt she didn't know how to "turn it off" correctly. After her performance in Tyra's debut music video, the judges suddenly thought that Sara would be more marketable for beer commercials rather than high fashion, despite her natural beauty.</p>
<p><b>Camille</b> - <i>Eliminated 8th</i> after the judges felt her attitude was just not improving enough. The judges had been criticizing her attitude and arrogance throughout the entire competition. She was eliminated in Milan, during their international destination shoot after she said "This is my signature walk, and this is what's going to make me famous." She had made an early enemy out of Yoanna, ostracizing herself in the process from most girls with the exception of Catie. She was very focused on the task at hand and stated that she was not there to make friends - which showed in her dismay of Catie later using Camille's tomatoes during a reward dinner in Episode 3, and accidentally breaking Xiomara's earrings in Episode 4 during a challenge. Camille and Yoanna settled their differences in the first half of Camille's final episode, but when Camille implied to the judges that Yoanna had an eating disorder, their quick friendship ended as quickly as it had began.</p>
<p><b>April</b> - <i>Eliminated 9th</i> after the judges felt she remained too clinical and critical, almost like a robot, and that she couldn't unleash her romantic side into modeling. She had consistently good photos, but was too self-critical. During the very first runway challenge in Episode 1, she had mistakenly put on a wrong outfit and Jenascia came to her aid. Later that episode, April was the one shown as being so torn when the van drove off to the photoshoot without Jenascia. They later reconciled. Also early in the series, April struggled with presenting her Japanese heritage. She was half-Caucasian and half-Japanese and didn't know how to market herself, but after a talk with Janice Dickinson during a challenge, she realized she needed to start marketing herself as an Asian model to stand out more. Her overanalyzing everything soon cost her as it was the reason she was eliminated before the finale episode. Before the show, she was working as a business executive at a Fortune 500 company, but claimed it wasn't the lifestyle she wanted anymore and hence pursued modelling.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../s/h/a/Shandi.html" title="Shandi">Shandi</a></b> - <i>Eliminated 10th</i>. The most seemingly gawky and awkward of the Cycle 2 contestants had a hard time in the beginning, straight from stocking the shelves at a <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walgreens.html" title="Walgreens">Walgreens</a> in Kansas City. She landed with Bethany in the bottom 2 during Episode 2 after showing "the worst runway walk I've ever seen in my life" (per Tyra). She worked on it began to show the most potential as a high-fashion model, even though she had started with stringy brown hair and glasses. Shandi passed out at the Episode 3 challenge when her blood sugar dropped too low. Her troubles with her family overshadowed her good performances, and she wished she had the same support from her family as most of the other girls did. She quickly became friends with Xiomara and they remained friends. Shandi's lust got the best of her when she ended up having sex with a young Italian man shortly after arriving in Milan, Italy. It tore her apart, so she confessed her infidelity to her boyfriend at home the next day. She didn't get cut that episode either even with those personal issues burdening her. However, she was eliminated the next episode, just shy of the final 2.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercedes_Scelba-Shorte_bb4f.html" title="Mercedes Scelba-Shorte">Mercedes</a></b> - <i>Eliminated 11th</i>, the runner-up of Cycle 2. Mercedes started out as a cute, bubbly girl at the beginning of the series without much airtime or a storyline, but that changed during Episode 4 when she stated in a confessional that she had been diagnosed with <a href="../../../l/u/p/Lupus_erythematosus.html" title="Lupus erythematosus">lupus</a>, a "chronic illness that attacks the immune system". She was shown being clandestine with her medication, in attempts to avoid the other girls pitying her. In Episode 5, during their interviews with Janice Dickinson for a challenge, she won by telling Janice about her secret illness. Janice was pleasantly surprised by her attitude regarding it, and the other girls were shocked, as they had no idea. Mercedes fought her way through the competition with a good attitude and a consistent portfolio. Her vulnerability showed a few times, but then she quickly fought through it and made it all the way to the final 2 against Yoanna. Her ultimate downfall was that her look would always be "too commercial", although she ruled the final runway challenge.</p>
<p><b><a href="../../../y/o/a/Yoanna_House_183a.html" title="Yoanna House">Yoanna</a></b> - The winner of Cycle 2, after proving not just to be a classic beauty with her elegant and highly praised face, but after improving her runway walk and consistently being able to be both high-fashion and commercial. In Episode 1, Yoanna revealed to the other girls that she had been an avid fan of fashion since childhood, and had shed 50 pounds in weight in hopes of pursuing modeling. She had the most knowledge of designers and fashion, which proved to be another advantage for her. Her constant tension with Camille occasionally came close to sapping her confidence, but she kept her determination to get better, and she did. Her runway walk was shown to be less than stellar in the early stages, but she practiced and eventually the judges received it very well. Doubts about her body toning from designers and the judges deferred her confidence, especially after the go-sees in Milan where a designer had said her body wasn't fit enough for high fashion. For the final photoshoot comprised of edgy, high-fashion beauty shots, she was supposed to look directly at the camera with only a helmet on. Some of her hair was sticking out in the back, so she took the clippers and cut it off, butchering it in the process. Although it seemed frightening at first, it just reaffirmed her strong desire to win. It all paid off in the end when she emerged victorious.</p>
