<p>Oh yeah, can't believe I forgot about that one. well, four different pages with "American Idiot" as the title (<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Idiot_%28album%29_1026.html" title="American Idiot (album)">the album</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Idiot_%28song%29_dcab.html" title="American Idiot (song)">the song</a>, and the film) or part of the title (<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Idiot_EP_e80f.html" title="American Idiot EP">American Idiot EP</a>) definately makes it worthy of a disambiguation page. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeBlowfromKokomo_79c0.html" title="User:JoeBlowfromKokomo">JoeBlowfromKokomo</a> 01:14, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While I think this is defintely a late edit, I personally like the album, but I know a lot of fans felt that Green Day has a different sound on this album ('new Green Day') and if we could site it, we should put in a criticism section. <a href="../../../k/o/c/User%7EKochdude388_efc8.html" title="User:Kochdude388">Kochdude388</a> 02:00, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Booklet shouldnt be ignored when interpreting the songs. They show the lyrics as handwritten dairy entrys. Jimmy and Jesus have pretty much the same (male) handwriting, but some lines are written by a female (Whatsername). Also, most of the songs have dates next to the title (like diary entry). Some of those are far too symbolic to ignore. Here they are:</p>

<p>If you take this into account, the album might be interpreted as a much stronger political statement. Whatsername might be Liberty and the old ideals of the USA (he meets her on July 4th). Jimmy/Jesus are the american public torn between old ideals and deceptive lies. Also note the musical quotes: Part II of Jesus of Suburbia cites "Summer of 69", Part IV cites "Ring of Fire" by Johnny Cash. The beginning of "Homecoming" cites "Jack and Diane" by J.C. Mellencamp. All these songs are Americana by now and paint a rather positive and patriotic picture of "american life". -- Sweetshark 80.171.202.199 15:02, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This, and none of their other albums are really punk rock. Pop punk, maybe. But this album takes a more rocky approach, even with the political lyrics. Pop rock maybe?</p>

<p>All rock is part of pop. Some have stronger pop influences. This album has rock influences, punk influences, and pop influences. Beatles (pop rock), Who (rock), Clash (punk), and other artists all have an influence on Green Day. PM03</p>

<p>I disagree; American Idiot is NOT pop. It is punk rock. Period.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of these songs are very poppy, and it is arguable whether all the songs are punk, but some are certainly new wave. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 22:48, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Punk is something that can't be defined. Using powerchords doesn't mean that a record is punk, and vice versa, a ballad CAN be punk. Punk is about social engagement and feeling that you don't need to change for the world to like you. I believe Green Day is, and always was, making music that THEY like, I don't see Green Day putting a mainstream song on one of their albums without it having a punk message. I think that is the main reason you can consider American Idiot punk. Green Day does what they like, and their songs reflect it. That's punk.</p>
<p>How about you all go listen to some dead kennedys, minor threat, dead boys, flux of pink indians, and discharge, and then come back and talk about what REAL punk rock is. I'm sorry to be offensive, but anyone who thinkgs green day is punk has no clue as to what they're talking about. Sure, go ahead and think they're 'alternative' (they're as mainstream as it gets), I really don't care. They're not punk rock.</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree. And why is it classified as Rock\Rock opera?</li>
<li>Rock maybe... They're not Rock but somehow it looks ok</li>
<li>But Rock Opera? Where did that came from? I'm editing it to <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_punk.html" title="Pop punk">Pop punk</a>. <a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychomelodic_05d5.html" title="User:Psychomelodic">Psychomelodic</a> 20:11, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Green Day described it as a Rock Opera... opera meaning a story told through song only, no spoken dialogue. iTunes describes this album as Alternative &amp; Punk. - --220.237.60.163 06:08, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, punk can be defined! Look it up in Wiktionary. It says "a harsh rock music originating from the 1970s with angry, offensive lyrics; a reaction against progressive rock". A reaction against progressive rock? Isn't that the genre known for rock operas? Oh wait, <i>this</i> is a self declared rock opera!? Oopsie, doesn't sound too punk to me! <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGold_Stur_8892.html" title="User:Gold Stur">Gold Stur</a> 02:34, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ironically, much like the term "grunge" many years later, "punk" was a term coined by the media rather than the musicians. Vehemently arguing over a term that was shoehorned in by popular culture is amusing. The declaration that anything can or cannot be "punk" is equally amusing. Attempts at creating a limited definition of what can and cannot be punk goes against the grain of the concept itself. It's akin to ostracizing someone from the high school "punk" club because they do not wear the right brand of "punk" approved shoes. "Oopsie", doesn't sound too punk to you? Too bad. Self applied labels are intrinsically transitory, and are ultimately an exercise in futility. Watching people desperately try to define themselves and their tastes as punk is about as far from the origins of punk as one can imagine. This applies comfortably to both sides of this pedantic argument. Green Day is or is not punk? For most people this question is a debate simply based on how they identify themselves and how they feel about Green Day's music. Facts are facts however. Green Day began as a self identified "punk" band, best known for playing at a self identified "punk" club to a self identified "punk" audience at a time and region when "punk" was very far removed from the mainstream. "Punk", "Pop Punk" and "Alternative" are all applicable depending upon perspective and era. With that comfortably in mind, I will change the label back to encompass all views. Repeatedly if necessary. Enjoy.Theplanetsaturn</dd>

<p>I recall that in an interview, someone from Greenday said that Jesus and Jimmy were two different people, not one. Evidence: In Novacaine, the singer, presumably Jesus, refers to Jimmy in the 3rd person, plus, he claims that Jimmy 'says its better than air', which makes no sence if he is Jimmy.

<li>I doubt it, because 'She's a Rebel', where we meet her, is after 'Novacaine', which I gave a link to <a href="../../../n/o/v/Novocaine.html" title="Novocaine">novocaine</a> and put in a '<a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">Sic</a>' as to prevent some Speeling Nazi from fixing it.

<li>I'm not convinced. "She's a Rebel" is the first song we hear about Whatsername, but she could appear earlier. Plus, unless she's singing "Novacaine," we're left with the curious position of the female lead in the story having only one song (Letterbomb), which doesn't fit with the album-as-musical theme. <a href="../../../t/e/u/User%7ETeucer_4752.html" title="User:Teucer">teucer</a></li>

<li>Yes, quite. I think that Jesus/Jimmy has a split persona. Of course, the guy's high and insane. He's going to refer to "himself" in the third person.

<p>Considering all of the above, the line "Jimmy Died Today, he blew his brains out into the bay. In MY STATE OF MIND IT'S MY OWN PRIVATE SUICIEDE." strongly intends that they're the same person.

<li>Originally I perceived Jesus and Jimmy as separate characters, and I believe Wikipedia formerly supported that idea. However, I am now under the impression that they are split personalities. For those of you who have seen (or read) <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fight_Club_eaff.html" title="Fight Club">Fight Club</a>, I think their relationship is near-identical to that of Narrator and Tyler Durden, if that helps. Some other people have given reasons for the one-person theory, but I think the strongest bit comes in <i>Letterbomb</i>. "You're not the Jesus of Suburbia / The St. Jimmy is a figment of / Your father's rage and your mother's love" Compare this to the opening line of <i>Jesus of Suburbia</i> - "I'm the son of rage and love."This also explains the constant presence of "the" in front of either's name - it's one side and another of the same person. I think this is more or less definitive evidence, but if anyone still disagrees, I still think the two-person theory can be argued for. I do, however, consider myself very qualified, since I've been listening to this album over and over again for several weeks.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../b/d/d/User%7EBDD_7cba.html" title="User:BDD">BDD</a> 01:43, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm the biggest expert seeing as I've listend to it through every day since it came out, and have two copies of it (the normal one and the one with the book.) =D And yes, the above comment is completely correct and I support it.

<li>This is just my personal opinion, but I view St. Jimmy as a person Jesus of Suburbia created in his mind. Probably a split personality. Anyway, I believe that at first Jesus of Suburbia thought he was a real person. PM03 15:20 10 Sept. 2005</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If any of you have seen the video that premiered in the UK of "Jesus of Suburbia", it has Jesus writing a big "SAINT JIMMY" on the wall, as if he were tagging it. I would suppose that they are the same person. GUEST</li>

I think that this album have some genres of music. American Idiot and Jt. Jimmy are reaaly punk. No discuss here. Holiday? Punk Rock, maybe pop punk Bouvevard of Broken Dreams? Rock Whatername maybe is Pop Rock. This album could have more one song that we can call pop rock, have normal rock and punk rock</p>

<li>Let me start off by saying I have listned to American Idiot countless times, memorized every word, and am unhealthily obsessed with Green Day (people have told me so). Personally, I believe that JOS and Jimmy are the same person, but I'm going to support another side. JOS is schitzo. Him and Jimmy are completely different people, living within the same body, leading seperate but intertwining lives. I could type up the entire story as I see it, but I go with what the band has said (this isn't an exact quote) -- "We wrote this album with our own views on it, but we left it open, for people to decide what they want it to be about. It's definitely anti-bush, but it's also a human story." ~Green Day. Sorry if anything in that quote wasn't exactly what the band said. 172.143.124.71 22:18, 28 December 2005 (UTC) Kira</li>

<p>First off, forgive me if my format here is wrong, this is a first for me. I think the album's "opposition to Bush" is little more than hype...though the lyrics mentioned certainly are, there's no other real reference, and I'd say it's a stretch to call it a major theme in the album. I'm not much of a writer, so I'd rather somebody else deal with it, if anyone happens to agree with me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Welcome to Wiki, your formatting is fine - just sign off with four tildes.&#160;:) As for the Bush opposition, it's most clear on the track "Holiday." Aside from the lyrics, the group themselves stated it in live shows - they played the American Idiot tour's last concert in Toronto on the radio and you hear them talking about how much they hate him, so I it's safe to say the really mean it. They also mentioned their political motivation in interviews. <a href="../../../k/r/u/User%7EKrupo_42f8.html" title="User:Krupo">Krupo</a> 14:11, Oct 19, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't see the link between alot of those lines and Bush. The first 'Sieg Heil to the president gasman' is thought by many to be a racist insult to Arnold Schwarzenegger because of his austrian birth. I think any referencesa to Bush are so intentionally vague that it cannot be said to be a major theme and i agree that it was largely a marketing hype. --Neon white 21:24, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The line 'Like a child left behind' is refering to the character Jesus and not Bush. However, their opposition to Bush is very blatant. They have formally said that they don't support him and don't think that he acts in the interest of americans, and at his concert in Toronto on 2004's election night (I was there), Billy Joe went "I hate Bush. I hate him so much. I think that we're safer with Saddam. If he wins tonight, we're not going to be from California any more. We're going to be from Toronto." They've also had their picture taken with John Kerry and are on the punk compilation album "Rockin' against Bush." <a href="../../../d/_/p/User%7ED_prime_dcf8.html" title="User:D prime">D prime</a> 01:58, 18 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While "child left behind" <i>is</i> a descriptor for Jesus (or Jimmy), it seems highly unlikely that Green Day would unintentionally choose a phrase so similar to <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act_51fb.html" title="No Child Left Behind Act">Bush's education plan</a>. I would agree, however, that besides the title track and <i>Holiday</i>, there is very little anti-Bush music on this album. Don't get me wrong - I love Green Day and hate Bush - but I can recognize a marketing ploy when I see one. If we can think of a polite way of saying that in the article, I would definitely be in favor of doing so. --<a href="../../../b/d/d/User%7EBDD_7cba.html" title="User:BDD">BDD</a> 01:46, 26 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This was removed for being POV/review-style: <i>"American Idiot," the first single released from the album, is a raw and energetic call to arms of sorts.

<p>There's an import version of American Idiot that includes the song "Favorite Son." Most of the time, 'bonus tracks' on import releases are just tacked on the end, but I thought there was a chance that, since the album has a storyline, "Favorite Son" may have been put somewhere in the middle of the album instead. I've been unsuccessful at finding the import release's tracklisting, though.

Favorite Son was originally made for Rock Against Bush Vol. 2 --68.194.81.250 20:12, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, Favorite Son was written around the same time as American Idiot.</p>
<p>This is my first time on a talk page, so I'm probably not formating any of this right. But, I disagree on the full rock opera plot (keep in mind the plot was conceived as a whole with the b-sides included). I believe Favorite Son would come after Jesus of Suburbia, as for aesthetic reasons it appears the five-part songs come just after the beginning and just before the end of the album. And further more, Jesus of Surburbia is an introduction to the main character and why he is unhappy with Jingletown. The first line in Favorite Son is "He hit the ground running at the speed of light", that leads me to believe it would be about J.O.S. the character going off on his own. For one reason, in the edited-down album the plot immediately jumps from J.O.S. leaving home to already being in the middle of his new life in the city.</p>
<p>Then I think Governator might go either before or after Holiday, as it is similar in political content to Holiday. I can't quite word it right, but I think it would be part of Jesus of Suburbia's anger at the world around him and then him being happier in Holiday. If Governator comes after Holiday, it might fit in place as JOS changes his mind from being pleased in Holiday to feeling lonely in Boulevard of Broken Dreams. However, one reason Governator might come before Holiday is because that song and BoBD transition into one another, and at first Green Day wanted to releas them together as a single. But, of course, Governator was already a b-side to American Idiot by the time the album came out and plans for the second single were underway. This song is probably the trickiest to fit in somewhere.</p>
<p>Shoplifter is about JOS getting by as a rebellious, um, shoplifter, with Whatsername. I think it would fit in after She's a Rebel. If it came before She's a Rebel, it might imply that Whatsername vastly improved JOS's life. But I really think it was intended to come after She's a Rebel, as it would help out my guess on Too Much Too Soon.</p>
<p>Too Much Too Soon would probably come before Extraordinary Girl, and so after Shoplifter by my theory. Because on the album it immediately jumps from JOS being happy with Whatsername to him feeling insecure and knowing they can't stay together, then her dumping him. It would make more sense if it explained a little more about their situation (as in Shoplifter) and then about how things weren't working out. Therefore, Too Much Too Soon would give more insight as to why JOS is acting like he is in Extraordinary Girl. That's just what I think. -Kuiper</p>
<p>I've never done this before so forgive any mistakes I might make. I just wanted to add that Holiday and Boulevard of Broken Dreams are cross faded...so you can't really put a song in the middel of the two</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>I think Shoplifter should fit between St. Jimmy and Give Me Novacaine, as Jesus/St. Jimmy stealing things to get by. It seems out of Whatsername's character to do some thing like that. As such, Too Much Too Soon should be either before or after Letterbomb. I think Jesus is a more mellow guy than his (who I believe to be) alter-ego St. Jimmy, so I think TMTS is told by Jimmy as him seeing Whatsername as wanting too much and such and more of why they broke up (she packs her bags and says goodbye and bon voyage...) and Jimmy being disgusted at JoS (who is wishing he hadn't done all the stuff he's done (he's talking shit about how it's better way back when), hence that, in Homecoming, Jimmy dies (which supports the theory that JoS and St. Jimmy are the same - "in my own private suicide") and so his alter-ego is no more, and he goes back home, trying to go back to how it was. --69.151.179.134 06:51, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree, just a few minutes ago I listened to Too Much Too Soon and felt like an idiot thinking it would come before Extraordinary Girl. Letterbomb seems to portray Jesus/Jimmy's anger very well, so I think TMTS might come before it. It it still quite tricky, as Jesus/Jimmy is receiving a break-up letter from Whatsername, so she wouldn't be backing her bags and saying goodbye before the break-up letter. It is almost impossible for Green Day to have designated the b-sides and then rewrote the album tracks, so it has to fit in somewhere. One possibiliy, though it seems so unlikely, is that TMTS might have been a fight between them. I.E., their relationship is falling apart and maybe Jesus/Jimmy is expecting her to come back, but instead receives that letterbomb. Now that I think about it, that seems like an acceptable theroy. Again though, this interupts songs that fade into one another. However, of course, they are not written into each other any more than the rest of the plot. The transition merely occurs on the album, so, the b-sides could easily have been removed and then the remaining songs were merged. As for Shoplifter, now I think it might come before Are We the Waiting. In his imperfect life in The City, he steals things to get by. Then in Are We the Waiting he starts to transition into his alter-ego, and in St. Jimmy, obviously, becomes it. Right now I think the "full" tracklisting would look like this:</p>

<dd>I'll disagree - Favorite Son sounds like it takes place after JoS leaves ("He hit the ground running at the speed of light", as in, away from home), so put it after Jesus of Suburbia. I'd say to put Governator before Holiday (the events of Arnold being elected and such drive the politics in Holiday, so that fits). --69.151.177.237 05:18, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Billie Joe Armstrong once said in an interview, however: "I think a lot of people sort of stick us in a category of just being punk, and I don't think we're the most punk, and I don't even think we're a voice for punk at all. We're not waving a punk rock flag or anything like that - we represent ourselves and our own songs and our own style and our own philosophies, and if that doesn't agree with some faction of people... then f*ck 'em." People are so eager to stick bands into slots, but every band is unique and many do not fit perfectly into any single category. Green Day does not have to be "punk" or "rock" or "alternative"... they are simply "Green Day", and we should not criticize them when they step out of the box which they have been put into.</dd>

Why can other people express their views about how Green Day has gone downhill with American Idiot, and I can't defend them? And don't delete a post that you don't even understand... I'm NOT denying the fact that some of their songs are punk pop (or rock or alternative)... what I'm saying is that that doesn't mean they've gone downhill or sold out punk, because they never were punk.

<p>I modified a section in the plot a bit. Added that it might be possible that Novacaine is about Jesus/Jimmy's feelings for Whatsername.</p>
<p>It makes more sense than the drugs explanation to me. First of all, novacaine's not really a drug you get high off of. Secondly, Jesus had already been doing drugs since the beginning of the album. Also, Novacaine segues right into She's a Rebel, which hints that they might be related.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Novocaine is not a recreational drug, but it is an analgesic, structurally similar to cocaine (hence the name: new cocaine). But I think a literal novocaine=drugs reference would be too obvious. My conclusion would be that the existence of Jimmy itself is the drug, the pain relief.<a href="../../../d/j/a/User%7EDJac75_637e.html" title="User:DJac75">St. Jimmy</a> 18:38, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is the significance of the song 'Rock and Roll Girlfriend' to the story in the album? Is it supposed to be one of Jesus' daydreams?

<ul>
<li>I don't think 'Rock and Roll Girlfriend' is very significant to the storyline. You see, 'Rock and Roll Girlfriend' actually precedes the American Idiot project. The track 'Homecoming' was largely created before the band even thought about doing a rock opera, although 'Homecoming' essentially inspired Green Day to make the album. So if 'Rock and Roll Girlfriend' doesn't connect with the storyline, it's because of that. ----<a href="../../../o/r/n/User%7EOrnen_4a77.html" title="User:Ornen">Ornen</a></li>

<p>Billie Joe said on storytellers that the main character is female, yet the article jumps from "He" to "She" and "His" to "Her" all the time. Plus "Jesus" and "St. Jimmy" don't hint at a girl. What's the definite word?</p>

<p>The main character was never said to be female, you just either heard wrong or completely made that up. Jesus of Suburbia/St. Jimmy is a male while Whatsername is a female.</p>

St. Jimmy is about Jimmy Paige, and the Jesus of Suburbia is just a metaphor for all the kids growing up in todays boring <i>suburbia.</i> The only unifying theme at all is pointing out how sucky the American people as a whole are getting. I don't know if someone's managed to imagine enough meaning into it to make a movie or not, all this deeper meaning is strictly in the listener. It's a pop album, made to make money.

<p>I removed this line, "Many expected "American Idiot" to win Record of the Year, but the award was instead presented to Norah Jones' album, "Feels Like Home", even though the album came in second to American Idiot in record sales" from the second paragraph of the page for a couple reasons. First and foremost, the Record of the Year Grammy is presented to a single not an album and Ray Charles won the Album of the Year Grammy that year not Norah Jones. The single "American Idiot" did get nominated and it lost to Ray Charles &amp; Norah Jones' "Here We Go Again" so perhaps that's what the person meant. Secondly, who are these "many" who expected "American Idiot" to win? The RotY has a long history of being awarded to MOR songs (with a few exceptions like "Beat It") but I suppose it's possible "many" people did expect it to win but I'd like to see a source for that. Lastly, it's irrelevent that Feels Like Home came second to American Idiot in sales because, whether you agree or not, the Grammys publicly state that their awards are not based on sales numbers. That is all.--Lairor 17:50, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I believe American Idiot is the bset rock album of the decade so far. it is better than there most succesfful album , Dookie and it deserves to win all the awards it has, Hitesh</p>

<p>There's a paragraph at the bottom of the section "The recording" that talks about the controversy of the guitar in the track "American Idiot" being the same as in the Dillinger Four song "DoubleWhiskeyCokeNoIce", and about how Green Day "ripped off" Holiday from the Iggy Pop song "The Passenger".</p>
<p>This paragraph has several problems. First of all and most trivially, in its current form, in addition to addressing the reader in the second person and failing to link to the articles on Dillinger Four, Iggy Pop, etc., the paragraph has a comma error, and the word "Although" is misspelled. The rest of the language isn't that great either.</p>
<p>Next, the paragraph points out that the members of Dillinger Four are "often quoted to saying Green Day ripped off their song", but fails to provide any sort of source or citation for this. (Also, my own brief googling turned up no such quote, but I suppose I could have tried harder.)</p>
<p>There is also the question of the use of the term "ripped off". I listened to part of DoubleWhiskeyCokeNoIce, and it does sound very similar, but the term "ripped off" implies, in my mind, not only explicit intent, but also a sort of malice. Although it is apparently popular among true punk fans to believe that Green Day stole from Dillinger Four in the great riff crime of the century, the matter hardly seems as cut and dry as this paragraph would imply; the two bands are friendly and toured Japan together, and may have discussed song writing and structure. It's also entirely possible the riff is included as a sort of tribute, even. Please, if you know (not think, not believe, not wish) that I'm wrong, tell me.</p>
<p>I got interested in this paragraph because I noticed that part of "City of the Damned" sounds like "Summer of '69" by Bryan Adams. The article for Summer of '69 includes a note that Green Day (and also Bon Jovi) was <i>inspired</i> by this song, rather than "ripping it off". The practice of musical references, tributes, inspiration, or whatever you want to call it extends well beyond Green Day, from John Williams and Hans Zimmer referencing Holst to the Barenaked Ladies tribute to Rush in "Grade 9".</p>
<p>So for all that, I changed that paragraph. B1mck 01:15, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone apparently changed the reviews to give American Idiot the highest possible rating. Allmusic did not give the album 5 stars. Rolling Stone did not give the album 5 stars and Pitchfork Media gave it a score of 7.2, not 10. I haven't checked the other reviews but I'm guessing they were changed as well.</p>
<p>Also this album is not in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of alltime. In fact Rolling Stone's list came out before this album was released so that would have been impossible. I agree that this is a great album but its ridiculous for someone to be changing the album reviews and making up facts about the album on the wikipedia page.</p>

<p>People have criticized the album for the change in style, "sell-out", and especially changes in appearance for the band as Billy began to wear an eyelid which has been synomonous with the group of "emos". Someone needs to research this. 67.99.175.237 01:01, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's all relative. The amount of Green Day "haters" was phenomenal after the "sell out" of their Gilman roots, but it consisted of a smaller amount of the public. Is there a larger number of people who hate them now? Probably. But there is also likely a larger number of people who love them then there was back then. The "sell out" accusation has been being thrown at the band since even before Dookie was released. What it boils down to is relevancy. There is no need to specify what is a general accusation throughout the history of the band on the listing for this album alone when it already is covered quite well on the main Green Day page.Theplanetsaturn 23:43, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With all these people hating on the album and all these high-class disscussions, this may not be worth mentioning...but similar to Jinx and Haushinka on 'nimrod.', there doesn't sound like there is any break in sound between Holiday and Bulouvard of Broken Dreams. As heard by listening to the CD, the end of Holiday and beggining of Bulovard run into eachother.
