<p><i>Some of the changes in American spelling were largely phonemic, while others involved the restoration of "etymologically correct" Latin (or Greek) spellings, often to words which English had borrowed from French (or indirectly, Greek) – color, center, Gk.διαλογος → Fr. couleur, centre, dialogue → British English colour, centre, dialogue.</i> I took out the centre/center example because I think it is not an illustration of the point the author is trying to make. If I'm not totally off then the etymology is: L. <i>centrum</i> -&gt; Fr. <i>centre</i> (by degradation of final syllables) -&gt; E. <i>centre</i> (taking over the written form, pronunciation then diverges between E. &amp; Fr.) -&gt; <i>center</i> (Websterised). I can't see how <i>center</i> should be any closer to <i>centrum</i> than <i>centre</i> is. BTW I think the whole argument is spurious: it seems to me that Webster did not try to make spelling closer to Latin/Greek but rather tried to simplify it (<i>dialogue</i> became <i>dialog</i> not because of anything Greek but because the <i>-ue</i> is silent).</p>
<p>There should be a justification for the etymology claim, or it should be removed. 217.251.122.242 10:45, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>--- About the spelling differences of -ize/ise: I am a bit confused by the first sentence. Looking in other sources on the net it seems like it should say British English in the first word. But I have English as a second language why I let others make a statement. -- Adam L</p>
<hr />
<p>The suggestion is often that Webster was responsible for changing spelling, however, the evidence actually points to the contrary. If you look at many 17th &amp; 18th Century British works you will see many American spellings such as center, theater, harbor, honor and favor amongst others. The dictionaries by Blount (Glossographia 1661) and Cockeram (English dictionarie 1647) contain each of these. Also the "ize" spellings are the only ones listed which is still the case in British pocket dictionaries; "ize" is also the favoured spelling of many British book publishers such as Oxford University Press, Penguin and Pan-Macmillan to name a few. The real changes to British spelling came in the mid 18th Century with Johnson's francophillic tendencies for changing spellings to keep in fashion with the other side of the English channel. Many people also seem to forget that a number of US spellings have already been accepted in the UK; jail instead of gaol, siren instead of syren, alarm instead of alarum, cider instead of cyder, burden instead of burthen, advertise instead of advertize and baritone instead of barytone to name a few.</p>
<p>--Rick P</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm not sure what the right forum is for raising such issue, but I think that the discussion of og/ogue misses some of the nuance of how the two forms are used in American English. In my experience, educated writers of American English use the term "analogue" when writing about something that is analogous to another thing, but use the term "analog" as a converse of digital (analog watch, analog circuit). Similarly the term "dialogue" is the correct term for verbal discourse, while "dialog" is simply another term for "dialog box" (the term did originate with "dialogue" but it has been said that Apple API engineers standardized on the "og" spelling because it would be easier on programmers, with user documentation subsequently using the modified spelling).</p>
<p>Similarly, the discussion of disc/disk fails to mention the fact that while both forms are used in American English, the distinction is fairly clear. A "disc" is a circular object like a CD, frisbee or platter, while a "disk" refers to almost any kind of persistent storage for a computer.</p>
<p>I do not have the reference material or background to prove these claims, and thus have not changed the article to reflect them. This is merely based on my personal experience with technical and academic writing in the US. -- Tim Foley --24.6.194.60 08:01, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I second the above mention of disk/disc, although it is unconscious for most. most americans think of disc as discus and disk as the computer disk. -thisdude</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>I removed the miscellaneous difference:</p>
<pre>
|loth || loath || for the adjective; the verb is <i>loathe</i> in both.
</pre>
<p>The spelling <i>loath</i> was always acceptable in Britain and is now predominant. Fowler in <i>Modern English Usage</i> listed both spellings, but he advocated personally for <i>loath</i> in order to be consistent with the verb. The spelling "loth" has now lost so much ground that it wouldn't surprise me to encounter an educated Briton who had never seen it. My only direct evidence that <i>loth</i> is acceptable in America is that the OED doesn't mark it as a Briticism.</p>
<p>If someone wants to reinstate this entry notwithstanding the above, it should at least be made to show that <i>loath</i> is a valid British spelling.—<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlotwell_e987.html" title="User:Blotwell">Blotwell</a> 29 June 2005 12:44 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>"Mom(my)" is a very common spelling in the West Midlands of England - for example the Express &amp; Star newspaper (published in <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolverhampton.html" title="Wolverhampton">Wolverhampton</a>) uses it for headings in its personal column. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 23:46, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>How about past tense: -ed vs. -t (e.g. spelled vs. spelt)? Is that relevant?</p>
<p>As a Brit, I don't think it's fair to say we think American spelling is 'coarse'. Rather there is a slightly smug sense that Americans (ie. Mr Webster) have introduced the variations arbitrarily, merely to be different from UK. - Martin Turner</p>

<dd>I think it may be a touchy subject, and I'm not trying to push the American view, but I think that if at all possible, if you are questioning which to use, American spelling would be the best to use, seeing as the US is the largest entity viewing these pages. Am I the only one who thinks this way? <a href="../../../j/p/0/User%7EJP06035_fdfe.html" title="User:JP06035">Jared</a> 17:58, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think Wikipedia should use international english spelling since America is on its own in the world with way it spells certain english words. 00:04, 8 March 2006 (GMT)</p>
<p>Most of the english-speaking world is not American. -gigacannon 4/6/06 22:39 GMT</p>
<p>I'd say that the mixture of spellings etc. in Wikipedia is a good thing. It's an added educational bonus (seeing the variety, and realising that the different versions are equally "correct"), and it reflects the nature and origin of the project. No straitjacket, please - but do respect the spelling conventions of each article, and keep it in the version of English in which it started. Consistency within an article is desirable, consistency across the whole encyclopaedia is not. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 08:45, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I put up a proposal on the Wikipedia Manual of Style(spelling) talk page to have consistent spelling on all articles. But nobody seems to like it.<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECameron_Nedland_3a36.html" title="User:Cameron Nedland">Cameron Nedland</a> 21:03, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'd have to agree with Snalwibma, having a mixture of spellings increases awareness. Having the spelling standardised could be a mistake for a wiki, the last thing you want to do is phase out contributors/contributions based on spelling differences.--NeF 16:51, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/Talk%7EAmerican_and_British_English_spelling_differences_Archive_1_dbf7.html" title="Edit section: Fetus/Foetus">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fetus/Foetus</span></h2>
<p>"Fetus" is derived from the latin root "fetus", this can be verified in any dictionary, British, American or otherwise. The pseudo-greek spelling (OE) is an error introduced by some English authors in the 19th century which seems to have stuck. There is no etymological justification for it whatsoever, and it is simply incorrect usage. I'm a diehard preserver of British/American distinctions, but in this case the American usage is actually the ONLY correct one. - MMGB</p>
<p>The thing is that once a variant gets used enough, it becomes an acceptable alternate form, even if its original justification was erroneous. M-W lists foetus as a chiefly British variant, so I don't think it's fair for us to call it incorrect. And no, that doesn't mean I like it or encourage its use.</p>
<p>Yeah - it depends on "who gets to make the call". The medical community explicitly forbids the usage of "foetus" - neither the Lancet (British) or the NEJM will permit its use in an article. No medical textbook uses it either. By this standard, it can be deemed "incorrect". IF you want to use a wider standard, then you could argue that "ain't" is correct as well. It depends on where you draw the line. - MMGB</p>
<p>If the medical community (including the British English medical community) says it is incorrect, then I'd say its incorrect. I like maintaining Britishisms (at least whenever they happen to be Australianisms as well) -- but I also am a slave to the opinions of scientific experts&#160;:) -- SJK</p>
<p>Speaking as a Briton, I see no reason to continue a widespread spelling mistake just because it's a British mistake. "Fetus" is a technical term so if the British Medical Association say "foetus" is wrong then it's wrong and the correct spelling is "fetus" no matter what the rest of the population may believe. Good British dictionaries such as Chambers or the OED point out the etymological problem even though they list the incorrect spelling Likewise a British encyclopedia such as Macmillan's has an entry for "foetus", but it just says "See fetus". I suggest that we do something similar but adding the point about the bad etymology on the "foetus" page. -- [[User:Derek Ross]</p>

I am unsure about the factual accuracy of the above. I live in Australia and study Unit 2 Biology and we have only <i>ever</i> spelt foetus as <i>foetus</i>. I believe this would be the correct way as in unit 2 Biology we would not be taught anything which is scientifically/medically incorrect. Shall investigate further. --<a href="../../../r/k/e/User%7ERkeys_be3f.html" title="User:Rkeys">Rkeys</a> 09:54, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I too, am unsure about the factual accuracy regarding the spelling <i>foetus</i>. I live in Canada and majored in Biology at the University of Toronto, where the word was spelt <i>fetus</i> or <i>foetus</i> according to the publisher of the text used. The convention in Canada as late as 2003 was to spell as one chose, as people here are given to seeing both, although more often the version called American. Yet, even with a tendency toward American spelling, this is the first time in 25 years of biology that I have ever seen such a claim against <i>foetus</i>; it is often so spelt in biology and medical texts from the United Kingdom and Commonwealth.</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>I suggest that the term <i>"frenchified"</i> — used in the main article three times — be avoided all together, as it has a pejorative tone, and Wiktionary backs me up on this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Frenchify &gt; Adjective Frenchified: (vulgar, slang) to have contracted a venereal disease; to have become more like the French.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If a word is <i>actually</i> required, then <i>Gallicized</i> (or <i>Gallicised</i>, if preferred) would be better. Citing Wiktionary again:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Gallicize &gt; Adjective Gallicized: To make French as the culture, customs, pronunciation, or style; to translate into French.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The best choice may simply be to avoid any usage of either where the word <i>French</i> would do on its own.</p>
<p>I spell American, but I found the article derisive of British &amp; Commonwealth spelling and the bases on which it is derived. Moreover, the author's knowledge of spelling as it is practiced, de facto, outside the USA is somewhat of a stereotype.</p>

<p>In the case of St Pancras it may be more a case of the design of British road and rail signage - which never (?) uses punctuation ... But yes, it is also a BrEng/AmEng difference. Purists would say St (like Mr, Mrs, Dr etc) is a contraction, not an abbreviation (i.e. the final letter is present) and therefore does not take a period ("full stop" in BrEng), whereas abbreviations proper, where the final letter hass been ommited (e.g. vol., ed.) do take a period. But there is (I think) an increasing trend here (UK) to do away with all such periods in abbreviations. Whatever ... St Pancras should definitely NOT have a period after "St". <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 08:38, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Reading my (slightly dated, circa 1980) Concise Oxford Dictionary, it gives both spellings for analog/analogue, although the -gue form comes first. As I understand (although this may be wrong), it is not incorrect to use -ize spellings in Commonwealth English, nor -ise in American English, despite what people think. Is this something similar; that is, is (e.g.) analog instead of analogue still valid in Commonwealth English? <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourohfour_c17e.html" title="User:Fourohfour">Fourohfour</a> 18:22, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe y'all think that "Commonwealth English" has some shade of a shared standard? It's not where it's at. Take the word <i>colorize</i>, meaning "to add color to a black-and-white movie." The only U.S. spelling is "colorize," but in Britain you find "colourise" and "colourize"; in Canada, "colourize" and "colorize"; in Australia, mostly "col<i>ou</i>rise" and "col<i>o</i>rise," although -ize ending are also (rarely) found. So much for standardization. Ireland is not part of the Commonwealth, yet speaks Commonwealth English. (?) As I posted someplace else, the phrase "Commonwealth English," which <i>never</i> shows in authoritative publications, was coined by some fellow Wikipedian who had just fallen off of the wagon.--<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber">JackLumber</a> 22:11, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Colourise is not only the usual spelling in Australia, but it is also the correct spelling. If one was to write colorise in an Australian english examination they would be ,arked as wrong. It does not matter that some Australians are idiots and spell the American way it is still wrong. As for liquorice since my last comment regarding I have looked and seen it spelt both ways. Perhaps written more commonly as licorice. But most importantly colorise is incorrect. Futhermore how is my stance on ise vs ize preposterous? Ise must not be American enough... How may I ask does my user page paint me as being biased?

<dd>You are dreadful right, that entry cries out for a usage note. In older literature "plough" was very common; newer "plows" are usually... plows.

<p>"Plow is also used in Canada." With respect to the above, as long as I can remember, (I am forty and have lived in Canada for 37 of those.) the word plough has been utilised as the noun while plow has been used as the verb. More recently, I have seen plow also used as a noun by those thoroughly confused by the U. S. spelling. This occurrence happens more often than I would like to see, especially since the advent of the 'spellchecker' function on most software programs which defaults to U. S. spelling.

<p>I have never, ever heard the form <i>snicker</i> to mean "snigger" in the UK. Indeed, when they changed the name of Marathon chocolate bar to Snickers some years ago, to bring it into line with its American name, they played on the fact that <i>snickers</i> means nothing at all in British English, by having people confuse it with <i>sneakers</i> (which itself hardly occurs, of course).</p>

<dd>Good point. Although, Cesar is correct in such languages as Spanish. I've seen Phenix as a variant of Phoenix.

<dd>But, in fact, both words are used in the UK, and (to me at least) they have slightly different meanings: "whine" implies a tone of complaining, making a "plaintive cry"; whereas "whinge" would be repeated complaining; but the dictionary meanings do overlap. -- <a href="../../../t/d/w/User%7ETdw_dd74.html" title="User:Tdw">TrevorD</a> 22:42, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Spelling differences between American English on one side, and British and Commonwealth English on the other are generally more conspicuous than spelling differences within the Commonwealth.

<p>In American usage; both "er" and "uh" are used and both have distinct pronucations (at least in General American).

<dl>
<dd>Hi Jon, pleased to meet you. Our mileage may vary, I guess. <i>Uh</i> seems to prevail in transcription of speech (note that I myself added "the British variant is used in the U.S."); but <i>er</i> was "coined" by R-droppers (apparently, Britons; the first recorded use is in the St. James's Magazine) as a pronunciation spelling of the "schwa" or similar vowel. This vowel can be realized in various ways, but the use of the "r" or rhotacized schwa is improper IMO. The <i>er-uh</i> difference is more of a sociolinguistic thing, anyway---it could be as well deleted from this page. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber"><font face="bookman old style"><i>JackLumber</i></font></a>, 12:31, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why? Languages drift over time; it's just a fact of history. Moreover, though I'm no sutdent of linguisitics, I can tell you that the picture is a lot more complicated than "America decided to simplify" - not all US/UK differences are simplifications on the part of the US, and in a lot of cases, it's the <i>Americans</i> who have retained an older usage abandoned by the <i>British</i>, not the other way 'round.

<p>Then why not just write that the Canadian Oxford prioritizes the <i>yogourt</i> spelling, while the other two prefer <i>yogurt?</i> The way it's written it doesn't convey this information at all.

<dd>Indeed. The problem is, the Canadian Oxford dictionary foregrounds the "French" <i>yogourt</i>---and I don't know why, since "Canadian English Usage" and "The Cambridge Guide to English Usage" point out (_based on corpus data_) that <i>yogurt</i> prevails (that is, they don't merely "prefer" <i>yogurt</i>). Interestingly, the original (British) Oxford dictionary had <i>yogurt</i> as the main spelling, but it was most likely a typo (<i>yogurt</i> never shows in the quotations!); however, the 2nd edition of the OED still prioritizes <i>yogurt</i> over <i>yoghurt</i>, but in fact <i>yoghurt</i> prevails (and has always prevailed) in Britain.

<dd>According to the <i><a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_ecd4.html" title="Encyclopædia Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a></i>, the term 'Britain' is short for 'Great Britain' the largest island of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_ba5a.html" title="British Isles">British Isles</a>, and excludes most of the other islands — not part of the constitute countries of England, Scotland and Wales — surrounding it such as <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Isle_of_Man_10ef.html" title="Isle of Man">Isle of Man</a>. However, it also says that administratively <b>both</b> the terms 'Britain' and 'Great Britain' are synonymous with 'UK' which includes <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> and all the other smaller islands surrounding it, except the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_Islands_7556.html" title="Channel Islands">Channel Islands</a> and the Isle of Man. I tend to agree with what Britannica says about this, so therefore 'Britain', 'Great Britain' and 'UK' can be used interchangeably. Is it really a big deal if a user changes Britain to UK or Vice-versa? I highly doubt it. If we want this encyclopaedia to be respected, perhaps we should use what is used in offical documents, etc. But anyway, all the best. Cheers. -- 203.164.189.167 08:20, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If that's what the Encyclopædia Britannica says, then it is wrong. "Britain" is synonymous with "UK", but "Great Britain" refers to the island. This is how the terms are used in contemporary Britain. But you are right to say that Britain and the UK are interchangeable - which one prefers must depend on stylistic considerations. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 09:11, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>One of the issues here is the linguistic (not political!) status of Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland (justly or not) <i>is</i> part of the UK, but it's not part of the easternmost island of the British Isles (whatever we call that island...). Using the term "the UK" lumps Northern Ireland together with said island. In some context that would be okay, but in many, it would not be okay. --<a href="../../../c/u/l/User%7ECultural_Freedom_ebef.html" title="User:Cultural Freedom"><font face="bookman old style"><i><font color="#FF0000">Cul</font><font color="#FF3333">tu</font><font color="#FF5555">r</font><font color="#FF7777">al</font> <font color="#9999FF">F</font><font color="#7777FF">r</font><font color="#5555FF">ee</font><font color="#3333FF">d</font><font color="#0000FF">om</font></i></font></a> 2006-07-16 09:18 (UTC)</p>
<p>The problem is that the stylistic level of <i>Britain</i> "UK" and <i>America</i> "US" is *not* the same---the latter can only be informal, the former is used also in formal writing, and has been used also to refer to the British Empire and the Commonwealth of Nations. <i>America</i> "United States" is similar to _<i>England</i>_ "Great Britain/United Kingdom"---this last (incorrect) usage is found not only among Americans. A contentious issue you pointed out, 203, is that of <i>fetus</i> vs. <i>foetus</i>.

<dd>There is certainly only one Ireland, but a large chunk of it is part of the UK because that's how the majority of its population want it at the moment. I'm not saying that Britain doesn't mean the island also known as Great Britain, because it does. But in informal usage, "Britain" is also used as a synonym for the UK. Illogical yes, but language is not a mathematical formula. And on the subject of illogicalities, at the Olympic games the UK team goes under the name "GBR", and its international driving licence plate code is "GB".

<p>Why just not use 'British Isles' and end all this thread up? It's the precise term, and it's also not so long.</p>
<p>Because 'British Isles' includes the whole of Ireland; those of us of a pedantic bent quite like these fine distinctions - I groan at seeing <i>English National Opera</i> as England isn't a Nation - you can't get an <i>English</i> passport - only a UK one. I would argue that although Britain is widely used as meaning the same as United Kingdom this is wrong, just as using England as meaning Britain is wrong. <a href="../../../a/p/e/User%7EApepper_679f.html" title="User:Apepper">Apepper</a> 16:28, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The definition of the word 'nation' is probably a bit more complex than you presume. Without having checked this very thorougly, and quite ready to withdraw it later, I would probably argue that England may be considered a nation, though it is certainly not a national state. This distinction is often confused. A 'nation' is 'an imagined community' and the term could be applied with some justification to England, which has several of the defining features of a nation, such as a flag, a football team and so on. A state, on the other hand, or a national state, is an administrative unit that excerts sovereign power over a territory. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, United Nations really isn't an organization of nations, but of national states. <a href="../../../e/m/i/User%7EEmil_Perder_992f.html" title="User:Emil Perder">Emil</a> 14:40, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oxford English Dictionary (1989): "The earlier and better [sic] spelling is <i>disk</i>, but <i>disc</i> is now the more usual form in British English, except in sense 2g, where disk is commoner as a result of US influence." (Sense 2g is the computing sense.) Things of changed, though. The <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/68/3/1903.html" class="external text" title="http://www.bartleby.com/68/3/1903.html" rel="nofollow">Columbia Guide to AmE</a> (1993) is outdated in this respect. Look it up in any modern style guide, you'll read a one-page paragraph and then you'll probably say, "huh?" According to Merriam-Webster, <i>disk</i> and <i>disc</i> are equally acceptable, <i>disk</i> being commoner, but <i>disc</i> _usually_ used for "a phonographical record," the farm implement, and an "optical disK" (yes, it reads <i>usually disc</i>: OPTICAL DIS<b>K</b>---go figure!) Yet according to present-day British dictionaries <i>disk</i> is _the_ spelling in computing and a U.S. variant (Oxford, "<i>disc</i>, U.S. also <i>disk</i>"; Chambers, "<i>disc</i>, especially U.S. <i>disk</i>") in all other senses. And what about the distinction between a <i>compact disc</i> and a <i>compact disk</i>? Oh, and <i><a href="../../../d/i/s/Disc_brake.html" title="Disc brake">disc brake</a></i> is more frequent than <i>disk brake</i> in both British and American English.

<p>Long ago in the late '80s when I was working on a computer magazine here in the UK, my editor and I pondered which form to adopt, as our various contributors would seem to pick either, willy-nilly. I had the idea that a 'disc' is what we should use to describe an object that is, in fact, circular in form, such as a Compact Disc. The word 'disk' therefore would be allowed to describe something that clearly is no longer disc-shaped, such as a floppy disk (by then, the small square plastic things you shove into an Atari ST) and later, a hard disk. We were happy enough with that distinction.<a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Tindale_986f.html" title="User:Ian Tindale">Ian Tindale</a> 11:53, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article mentions that some Commonwealth spellings ("Centre", "Theatre", etc.) are increasingly used in the U.S. It should be pointed out that, for the most part, these spellings are actually used to look more "foreign," not because Americans are increasingly seeing these spellings as "American." For example, the use of "Centre" in the naming of a building or other place, this is normally intended to imply "European sophistication." This is similar to cases where America might be spelled Amerika to refer to German or Russian influences in the U.S (e.g. the miniseries from years ago about Russia conquering the U.S.). This spelling would really be a euphimism but would not be considered proper spelling. In the same way the use of British spellings in the U.S. is generally more euphimistic than anything else. Although it can be argued that the more these "euphimisms" are used the more they will start to be considered "proper," today these spellings are still almost universally considered incorrect in the U.S. even when they are used. <font face="bookman old style"><i>MCorazao.</i></font>, 26 July 2006</p>

<p>I don't really understand this part. It says <i>"(Thus American spelling treats -l the same as other final consonants, whereas Commonwealth spelling treats it irregularly.)</i> This is incorrect. The word is "swimming" in both dialects, not "swiming", so AmE doesn't treat -l the same as final consonants. The doubled letter is to differentiate between words with the "magic e" and words without. So "equalling" has no magic e, whereas "equaling" looks like it may do. Thus "hand-written" and "hand-writing", not hand-writen. -- <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothman_030b.html" title="User:Boothman"><font color="#0F6E0A"><b>Boothman</b></font></a> <sub><a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothman_acb3.html" title="User talk:Boothman"><b><font color="#5C9337">/tɔːk/</font></b></a></sub> 14:02, 23 August 2006 (UTC).</p>

<p>"Note that not all spellings are interchangeable; some verbs take the -z- form exclusively, for instance capsize, seize (except in the legal phrase to be seised of/to stand seised to), size and prize (only in the "appraise" sense), whereas others take only -s-: advertise, advise, apprise, arise, chastise, circumcise, comprise, compromise, demise, despise, devise, disguise, and televise. Finally, the verb prise (meaning to force or lever) is spelled prize in the U.S. and prise everywhere else, including Canada."</p>
<p>More of these words don't originally come from Greek words ending "izein" through the Latin "-izare" ending so why are they part of this section?</p>

<dd>I'll add one more remark about one "-ise must", if I may: circumcise. I've seen it written as "circumsize", which I take to be a _very_ poor attempt at irony. (Also, "televise" is an oddity, being another one of those mixed language bastards: "tele" from the Greek + "videre" from the Latin. May its originator - who was German, I think - rot in some suitable purist hell! As may the medic who came up with "neonate" ...) But if you want a source for the Greek/Latin origin distinction, I can do no better than to point you at Eric Partridge's "Usage and Abusage". His gloss on the matter is that, if the word comes *directly* from the Latin, use -ise; otherwise, -ize is preferable. (Example: "excise", from Latin ex- + caedere; but "realize" has no (direct) Latin origin.) (He also makes an exception for words with a "y", such as "analyse" - without explanation.) This is, in essence, exactly what I was taught at school, in the 1960s (in Britain, by the way), and explains the forms which I personally use and prefer. (Note also: it's a guard against laziness - in a certain way!) <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHair_Commodore_cf8b.html" title="User:Hair Commodore">Hair Commodore</a> 21:30, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Michael, there's nothing wrong with a very long references section. However, when you start looking for citations, you're going to find out that much of the "information" on that page is not only not verifiable, it's smack-dab wrong. By the time the unverifiable matter disappears, and the preachy POV matter disappears, and the original research disappears, the total article length will be very similar to what it is now. The difference is that it will be an article that Wikipedia can point to with pride, instead of an abject embarassment.</dd>

<p>I agree that some of the content of the article is a bit POV, and some of it is questionable, but it does give a very useful guide to some of the different writing habits of the Americans, British, etc. Furthermore, I assume that the contributions tend to reflect how people actually (and yes, maybe incorrectly; and yes, maybe not very many people) use and misuse the English language. I like it, warts and all - and I find it actually useful! It contains lots of information not readily available elsewhere. I'd almost go so far as to say it's haphazardness and POV-ness, with contributions from lots of people who clearly feel strongly about the subject, is part of its strength. Please do improve the article - but I think the <i>noncompliant</i> tag is a bit <a href="../../../g/o/i/Going_over_the_top.html" title="Going over the top">OTT</a>. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 08:07, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for that, ClairSamoht. I have taken a good hard look at the article, and I have changed my mind. But not, I'm afraid, in the direction of agreeing with you! There is not nearly as much POV and dubious material in the artcle as I'd thought. In fact, I reckon it's mostly good stuff, instantly verifiable by checking in any standard dictionary. I have done some spot checks on a dozen of the things you tagged as "citation required", and every one of them is there, in plain view in the dictionaries. So it's not only NPOV, it's also NOT original research. I have therefore removed the <i>noncompliant</i> tag. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 17:56, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well done, Snalwibma. Unfortunately, without finding support here above, ClairSamoth already reverted once more... I'll take a look again later on.</dd>
<dd>ClairSamoth, I asssume you have read my yesterday around 2 am UTC reaction on the <a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoodstone_bee1.html#English_-ize_or_-ise" title="User talk:Woodstone">-ize/-ise section on Woodstone's talk page</a>. I do not understand your current behaviour as an edit-warrior who seems to stand alone in seeing Point of View, Original Research and/or insufficient Verifiability. I can not find your arguments for your opinions, not even what kind of POV you have become aware of, or what part would have been OR. Your "<i>much</i>" did not enlighten us about which statement you think to be "<i>smack-dab wrong</i>" either. The ridiculous number of 'citation needed' tags you had inserted in the article as a reaction on my edit comment, was not of much help to improve the article and did violate Wikipedia policy against demonstratively 'proving' a point. My advice: pick two or three <i>specific</i> statements that not one of the references corroborates. As I on the mentioned Woodstone's talk page section, and user Jnestorius here above implied: you need to be willing to look up things in the given references, if anything is not there, you should put a <sub style="line-height:.7em;"><sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></sub>-tag in the article. We do not have to deliver details like on which page and how exactly each source mentions the British and/or American spelling of every word in the article: people checking references are supposed to be able to use a dictionary.</dd>
<dd>In forementioned talk page, I said I had checked the external links behind 'Nature', 'ISO' and 'WHO', and found only the one behind 'Nature' to be irrelevant. I made a mistake in thinking that the ISO generally uses American spelling, that particular external link seems not to show its spelling variant. Other ISO pages are not convincingly consequent (see for instance the mix of "colour" and "color" on <a href="http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2122/327993/327996/1056754/j28n0500_List_of_documents__N500_to_N400.pdf?nodeid=3092153&amp;vernum=0" class="external text" title="http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/fetch/2000/2122/327993/327996/1056754/j28n0500_List_of_documents__N500_to_N400.pdf?nodeid=3092153&amp;vernum=0" rel="nofollow">this single ISO article from Brazil</a>), thus not so easily verifiable as contributor Snalwibma stated in an edit comment today. Unlike contributor JackLumber today said in the edit comment upon removing the last part of the relevant sentence, the WHO reference provided by ClairSamoth was a very good one: it not just showed the use of -ize but also American spelling in general, in casu 3 x (not as part of a name or quote) "center" (Am, and a minor variant in Canada): twice 'center' as position of a photograph, and a 'town center' in India) and 3 x "color" or "coloration" (Am) but 0 x "centre", "colour" (Br, Commonwealth). Thus the WHO at least in that article generally uses American spelling.</dd>

<p>I have just changed the "noncompliant" tag to "verify" (sorry - hit "save page" before I added the edit summary). This seems to me far less controversial, and far less aggresive, than ClairSamoht's tagging of the article. I might even go so far as to agree with the "verify" tag.

<p>OK - point taken! I have put <i>noncompliant</i> back and gone away to count to nine or so. But I would like to discuss the two references for ISO and WHO, as a kind of proxy for the whole issue of what sort of citations are needed through the article. I removed those two convoluted references because I felt they added nothing to the point in question - which is whether the organisations use -ise or -ize. It seems very odd to provide a link to a couple of random documents, when all that is required is a glance at the way they spell their names on their websites. I have now inserted two general references instead (to www.iso.org and www.who.int), but I think even these are unnecessary. It can surely stand as a statement - "the WHO uses the -ize spelling" - and it is so easy to verify that the reference looks like overkill, unless there happens to be a statement from the WHO which actually says "we like the -ize spelling". But the two references which were there had nothing whatever to say on the subject. I think it's a similar case with many (most?) of the statements tagged as "citation required" 24 hours ago. If something can be easily checked by a quick loookup in the dictionaries which are listed at the end of the article, there is no need for a cumbersome reference at every point aloing the way. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 18:56, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I put something on the ISO and WHO in the Verifiability section (I prepared the text for that spot and found myself in an edit conflict with the meanwhile introduced Vandalism sections). Please look also on Woodstone's talk page to which I provided a link. [The whole controversy seems to have become so vivid after Woodstone's modifications of -ize towards -ise on the <a href="../../../d/u/t/Dutch_language.html" title="Dutch language">Dutch language</a> article and my reaction.] – So far, there has been no vandal at work. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../s/e/p/Sep_26.html" title="Sep 26">26 Sep</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 20:36&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Somehuman writes "So far, there has been no vandal at work."</dd>
<dd>As Jnestorius has pointed out, removal of dispute tags without resolution of the problem does constitute vandalism.</dd>
<dd>So is replacing valid citations with useless ones. The references at the ISO and WHO pointed to standards documents issued by each in which the -ize spelling was used. Pointing to the ISO and WHO <i>websites</i> does <i>nothing</i> to verify the fact that -ize is used in their <i>standards</i>. It is necessary for citations to actually CITE something. That's why Wikipedia doesn't just put a link to dmoz.org in the sidebar, and thus call every fact in every article verifiable. Verifiability doesn't mean "theoretically verifiable, I think". It means "actually verifiable", by providing an example of a reliable source that backs up what is being said. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClairSamoht_1970.html" title="User:ClairSamoht">ClairSamoht</a> - <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check_47bc.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check">Help make Wikipedia the most authoritative source of information in the world</a> 22:26, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are you now accusing yourself? "<i>Do not place dispute tags improperly, as in when there is no dispute, and the reason for placing the dispute tag is because a suggested edit has failed to meet consensus</i>". Please mind the difference between vandalism and content dispute, and assume good faith - thus do not call any of the <b>four</b> people that remove your incorrect tagging a 'vandal'.</dd>
<dd>I took out your {{OriginalResearch|article}}; you then made it a {{Sermon|article}} which tag Jnestorius took out together with your approximately 200 <i>two hundred</i> {{fact}}-tags&#160;; you immediately claimed the article to be {{noncompliant}} which was removed by JackLumber&#160;; you placed it back and, while removing your inline external references with an appropriate edit comment, Snalwibma got your tag out whereupon you reverted calling Snalwibma a vandal ("RVV" edit comment) so I can understand his revert with comment "(rvv - and time to discuss before any more)"&#160;; upon your vandalism quote "As a general rule, do not remove other people's dispute tags twice during a 24 hour period." on this discussion page, Snalwibma put the tag in again.</dd>
<dd>Beside 200 'citation needed'-tags, you placed 3 different article-top tags, the last one several times, while none of the people involved in the current discussion agrees with any of those: no less than 4 contributors who have honestly tried to improve the article, have found your tagging improper. Who would then come closest to vandalism, do you think? "So far, there has been no vandal at work" is a mild opinion, assuming good faith. It follows from seeing that each of us has at times tried to improve the article, whether everone sees a real improvement is irrelevant for vandalism accusations.</dd>
<dd>I must agree with your argument for the links, but you should select them more carefully (the one behind 'Nature' had been utterly irrelevant, the one for the ISO showed '-ize' but not whether American or British spelling is used, only the WHO sample had a clear function). On the other hand, as my earlier comment showed by the Brazilian ISO article, a single page does not necessarily prove much. To that respect Snalwibma's solution by pointing to the home pages gives a better opportunity to check for consistant usage, though I do not think this should be needed for Nature of the WHO if the contributor who puts a well chosen sample in as a reference, also verified that a generally consistent usage by the publisher seems assured.</dd>
<dd>So, stop throwing Wikiguidelines and -tags as accusations. Work on improving the article, see also my earlier suggestions about <i>a <b>few</b>, well chosen</i> {{fact}}-tags, be specific in pointing out a weakness in the article, which spellings are found in contemporary quality literature, in professional texts on Law. Such is not original research but a search for sources so as to be able to deliver a properly complete picture to the readers. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../s/e/p/Sep_27.html" title="Sep 27">27 Sep</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 00:30&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<dd>I see that Clairsamoht agrees with me that referencing the website of WHO and ISO doesn't add much. So far, so good. My point, however, is that as currently written (and for some edits past) the sentence in question is saying only that these two organisations use -ize rather than -ise. Maybe at one time it was trying to say something more complex about their general adherence to BrEng or AmEng spellings, but (a) it doesn't any more and (b) this is arguably not the place (under the "ize and -ise" heading) to make such a point. The point here is whether -ise or -ize is used, by whom. In that context, just a mention that WHO and ISO use -ize would suffice. Maybe there's a case for expanding the paragraph a bit, inserting something about the overall AmEng/BrEng habits of WHO and ISO, and finding references which demonstrate (I guess) consistency on one hand and inconsistency on the other. Otherwise, I stand by my assertion that the two references to WHO and ISO documents were pointless. The WHO and ISO websites absolutely and completely back up what is being said in the text. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 08:03, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>JackLumber, the article as a whole is well-documented, except for the fact that <i>it's hardly documented at all</i>.

<p>The reason for the "noncompliant" tag to stay put is that the article is noncompliant. It can be made compliant by removing or rewriting POV statements, and by removing or providing citations for statements that are unsourced.</p>
<p>We've been talking about this for some time, and I don't see citations being added. Are you sure you want <i>me</i> to bring the page into compliance?

Not only was I willing to talk, you never bothered to show in what respect any of my arguments is wrong; you just keep putting wild claims of unverifiability and POV. You say you have no access to the referenced books. That does not make those invalid at all. I too prefer online cut-for-easy-chewing references, but these may not be available and are clearly <i>not</i> imposed by Wikipedia guidelines.

<p>ClairSamoht: '...without a copy of that book, I cannot possibly determine what page numbers to cite for each fact, nor can I determine which of the "most" facts are supported and which are not.' I'm not sure I follow. Suppose every sentence you are dubious of has its own citation with page and paragraph number. If you don't have a copy of the cited book, you still won't be able to verify any of them. If I surreptitiously (and hypothetically) added citations for each line, saying "page 64", "page 97", etc, at random, would you be fooled into being satisfied? Do you see yourself adding citations or verifying those of others? Either way, you really need access to the book.

<dd>I do not know whether Australia and/or New Zealand can be said to have a <i>spelling</i> standard equivalent to the ones for Britain and for America, which is not just the USA but also Canada. Canadian English spelling sometimes follows the US and sometimes Britain, thus most often one of these two spellings that are mainly described in this article. For a large part that is the case for the <i>spelling</i> in other English speaking nations. The exceptions are particularities that should be mentioned in this article, but do not require a similar in-depth comparison.<br />
Furthermore, the present title emphasizes on differences between large regions (and may briefly mention the influence of the two major spelling versions elsewhere). The suggested title might extensively elaborate on spellings according to e.g. more localized usage, differences between newspapers, literature and academical text, an historical overview, etc. That would make the article too complex for its main purpose. — <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeHuman_a533.html" title="User:SomeHuman">SomeHuman</a> <span style="font-size:.87em;"><a href="../../../o/c/t/Oct_6.html" title="Oct 6">6 Oct</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> 03:34&#160;(UTC)</span></dd>

<dd>I agree with SomeHuman. The article is a useful source of reference comparing the two main established ways of spelling the language. Sorry, Australians, New Zealanders, etc - but these are the two principal spelling systems or conventions.

<p>Has anyone researched US/UK spelling differences for words recently adopted from the Spanish language and/or Hispanic culture? I believe this phenomenon is becoming increasingly common (especially in the U.S.) and hence important. Examples: possible differences in pronunciation of Spanish or Mexican foods and dishes; possible differences in pronunciaton of words that were or are often seen in newspapers, e.g. <i>balsero</i>, <i>caudillo</i>, <i>guerrilla</i>, <i>junta</i>, <i>machismo</i>, <i>el niño</i>.--4.245.140.148 15:02, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As a Brit, I've always used "blonde" for a woman and "blond" for a man - reflecting the French origin of these words. I have seen US usage utterly confused over these words: somehow, it rankles to see a man with light-colo(u)red hair called "blonde".</p>

<dd>I don't think "as a Brit" is the right opening. "As someone who believes rather strongly that etymology should guide usage" seems more appropriate to your position. Nor is "confused" the right word (unless one assumes the correctness of your position on the normative role of etymology in orthography -- a position which is not at all weird, of course!). Nor is U.S. usage appreciably different from British, at least according to all of my dictionaries. --Truth About Spelling 11:39, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Point(s) taken! I have no problem over the etymological/orthographical point. However, my point about US practice is based on observation of actual printed usage, rather than dictionaries.

<p>This talk page is, I hope, on the general matters of spelling and punctuation differing between English users on either side of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>I have noticed that, especially in recent years, there has been a tendency (not only in American publications) to capitalize letters after a colon. (Yes - Americans do use colons, and not just for alimentary purposes.) Unless there is some other (/a fortiori/) reason for using a capital (such as the next clause starting with "I", or a personal or company name), surely a colon is merely a means of subdivision of clauses within a sentence, and hence capitals are not needed. To my way of thinking, such usage is solecistic. Alfista inglese 21:17, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The Chicago Manual of Style says that "If the material introdced by a colon consists of more than one sentence, or if it is a formal statement, a quotation, or a speech in dialogue, it should begin with a capital letter. Otherwise it may begin with a lowercase letter." So officially (let's assume the Chicago Manual is a quasi-official guide) the American style is pretty much like British, but perhaps it tends towards greater use of a capital letter after a colon than is usual in British English. In Britain would we use a capital letter in the first and second of these four cases? Maybe we should (it does help the meaning), but we often don't. Also, note the use of the word "may" in the Chicago Manual's final sentence. In Britain I think we'd say "should", or even take it for granted that of course there is no capital letter. In practice, of course, American writers often use a capital letter after any colon. And many publishers (e.g. Cambridge University Press) knock them back down to lowercase, even in books that follow American spelling and punctuation conventions. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 07:35, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Which edition of the Chicago Manual of Style said that? As far as I know, capital letters after colons have never been inserted except perhaps in quotations. In any case, you're mistaken about Americans always using capitals after colons, although I don't doubt that you see it often on the Internet.

<dd>14th ed, 1993, section 5.103. Maybe I need to invest in a newer edition. I won't quote the whole section (though I will if you ask me to) - suffice to say for now that it gives three examples, two with a capital letter after the colon and one without. In British English I don't think a capital would be used in any of the three cases. Anyway - in my experience, many (most? maybe - but I never said "all"!) American authors (in the life sciences) routinely use a capital letter after a colon, and as an editor preparing their texts for publication I routinely knock them down to lowercase. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 14:37, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Are we sure that the article is correct in this case? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.118.231.95_7f3b.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.118.231.95">24.118.231.95</a> (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.118.231.95.html" title="User talk:24.118.231.95">talk</a>) 13:00, 18 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<dd>Judging from Webster's dictionary and personal experience, yes, I'd say it is correct. In BrEng, "insure" is used in a very narrow range of circumstances, mostly these days in connection with the insurance industry. The more general word is "ensure". You ensure <i>that something happens</i> (a positive act); you insure <i>against something happening</i> (a preventive act). You could never use the words the other way round; the meaning is quite distinct. In AmEng the distinction exists, but it is weaker, and there is a tendency to use "insure" in both cases. I think it's probably similar with "assure" too - more distinct in BrEng, less so in AmEng. I have a sense that assure, ensure and insure can all mean much the same in America. They are all much more distinct in Britain. Assure is used for life assurance (= insurance), and in the sense of persuading someone else of the security or truthfulness of something (I assure you I do know what I'm talking about), but can rarely be used in place of ensure or insure. You <i>ensure</i> that the house is safe; you <i>insure</i> it against fire; then you <i>assure</i> your family that they are safe in their beds. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 14:59, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would add my reasons as to why I added the ensure/insure distinction. I'm a European <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patent_attorney.html" title="Patent attorney">patent attorney</a> and a lot of the patent applications I work on have actually been written by American lawyers. I have never seen an American lawyer use the word "ensure". They do use "assure", so I think it might be going to far to add that word to the current list of usage differences, although I agree that there are a number of dictionary definitions that indicate that insure could be used as a synonym for assure in the US.</dd>

<dd>On the point of synonyms, I note that <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">User:Snalwibma</a> changed my wording: "using insure in place to ensure" to "using insure as a synonym for ensure". I chose the original language to get across the point that the word ensure is rarely used. ie it is not that the words are synonymous which is important (although they are), but that one is commonly used in place of the other. A proper dictionary would point out the synonymity of the words, but this article is about usage, so I thought it would be more appropriate to comment on that side of things. I won't change it back myself, since I think the point is still made, but if you agree, Snalwibma, I invite you to change it at the same time as correcting the spelling of synonym&#160;:) <a href="../../../g/d/a/User%7EGDallimore_1dd1.html" title="User:GDallimore">GDallimore</a> 15:28, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks! Yes, you are right - "in place of" is better, in fact. I have changed it back to your version (and thereby obliterated my misspelt (or misspelled, for the benefit of American readers!) <i>synonynoym</i>. Maybe the entry should incude assure, and be extended to say that in America <i>assure</i> and <i>insure</i> are used, more or less synonymously (though I suspect there's more to it than that), with a range of meanings, but <i>ensure</i> is rare, whereas in Britain the three words have distinct meanings. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 15:53, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're welcome! I don't know enough of the American usage of "assure" to ensure the accuracy of the article if I were to change it myself and dictionaries have been known to be pedantic/out of date in highlighting synonyms. Perhaps a native American speaker can help wrt current usage! <a href="../../../g/d/a/User%7EGDallimore_1dd1.html" title="User:GDallimore">GDallimore</a> 16:04, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
