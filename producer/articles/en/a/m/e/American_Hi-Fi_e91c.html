<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Hi-Fi_e91c.html" title="Edit section: American Hi-Fi">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">American Hi-Fi</span></h2>
<p>American Hi-Fi was formed in Boston, MA in 1998. Stacy Jones had been a drummer for several bands (among them <a href="../../../l/e/t/Letters_to_Cleo_d33d.html" title="Letters to Cleo">Letters to Cleo</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Veruca_Salt_86db.html" title="Veruca Salt">Veruca Salt</a>). Stacy had never sang a note nor played guitar so after shows he bought a Mel-Bays guitar book and taught himself to play the guitar in the back of the tour bus. After the Veruca Salt tour, Stacy formed his own band with three of his friends, Brian Nolan, Jamie Arentzen and Drew Parsons. Though all members were in other bands at the time, they found time to "hang out, drink beer, and play Cheap Trick covers."</p>
<p>In the summer, Stacy headed to <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maui.html" title="Maui">Maui</a> to help record Nina Gordan's debut solo album with producer <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Rock_6998.html" title="Bob Rock">Bob Rock</a>. While he was there, he told Bob Rock about his band and slip demos here and there. Mr. Rock was interested and had the band fly to Maui to record an Album. During that time, they played at local bars in Maui for seven months. During this time, their band was called "BMX Girl" but Bob Rock felt that it "sucked" and changed it to American Hi-Fi.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Flavor_of_the_Weak_ece1.html" title="Flavor of the Weak">Flavor of the Weak</a></i> was written by Stacy Jones and was originally produced and written for Nina Gordon's debut album, Jones at the last minute took the song away and kept it for himself as a demo for his new band American Hi-Fi.</p>
<p>Their debut album, <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Hi-Fi_%28album%29_cb44.html" title="American Hi-Fi (album)">American Hi-Fi</a></i>, was released on February 27, 2001. The first single <i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Flavor_of_the_Weak_ece1.html" title="Flavor of the Weak">Flavor of the Weak</a></i> (almost Nina Gordon song) became a huge hit and the song flooded the radios throughout the summer. The album was a success and was followed by a world tour.</p>
<p>Their sophomore album <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Art_of_Losing_44f7.html" title="The Art of Losing">The Art of Losing</a></i> ditched the old school rock style and went with producer <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nick_Launay_79c6.html" title="Nick Launay">Nick Launay</a>. The album was more of a <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">Punk rock</a> meets <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_rock.html" title="College rock">College rock</a> days kind of style. Their first single <i>The Art of Losing</i> was a semi-hit but never became as successful as <i><a href="../../../f/l/a/Flavor_of_the_Weak_ece1.html" title="Flavor of the Weak">Flavor of the Weak</a></i>. The album was not as successful as their debut, and the band was dropped by Island Records during their European Tour.</p>
<p>In the winter/spring of 2004, American Hi-Fi was without a lable and was looking to change the style of the band. The band headed to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> to work on their new album with singer/producer <a href="../../../b/u/t/Butch_Walker_e748.html" title="Butch Walker">Butch Walker</a>. The album <i><a href="../../../h/e/a/Hearts_on_Parade_1b63.html" title="Hearts on Parade">Hearts on Parade</a></i> was released in Japan on July 14 2004.</p>
<p>In 2005, American Hi-Fi were signed by <a href="../../../m/a/v/Maverick_Records_e1fe.html" title="Maverick Records">Maverick Records</a>, Maverick helped promote the single <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Geeks_Get_the_Girls_ed9c.html" title="The Geeks Get the Girls">The Geeks Get the Girls</a></i>, released it as a single and released a music video in February 2005. After many attempts to release the album <i>Hearts on Parade</i> in the U.S. it was first supposed to be released in January 2005 then the date was moved to March 27 2005 but then officially released it on April 12 2005.</p>

<p>In 1999/2000, <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_Records_6082.html" title="Mercury Records">Mercury Records</a> were bought out by <a href="../../../i/s/l/Island_Records_88d9.html" title="Island Records">Island Records</a> at which time <a href="../../../p/o/l/PolyGram_2ed5.html" title="PolyGram">PolyGram</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Records_58a1.html" title="Universal Records">Universal Records</a> were merged. The merger resulted in hundreds of artists/bands, who were not very "popular", being dropped by their labels. In 2001, Island Records then merged with <a href="../../../d/e/f/Def_Jam_80c2.html" title="Def Jam">Def Jam</a>. The company was known more for its Hip-Hop, R&amp;B and Pop taste, began to sign Rock, Indie and Classic Rock bands like Autopiot Off, <a href="../../../h/o/o/Hoobastank.html" title="Hoobastank">Hoobastank</a> American Hi-Fi and more.</p>
<p>In 2003, just before heading to Europe for a European tour with <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matchbox_Twenty_4f40.html" title="Matchbox Twenty">Matchbox Twenty</a>, The band was dropped by Island Records. The record company went on to say that they were looking to go with "Emo" bands instead. The band had no promotion before and during the time when "The Art of Losing" album came out.</p>

<p>In the winter of 2005, <a href="../../../m/a/v/Maverick_Records_e1fe.html" title="Maverick Records">Maverick Records</a> signed the band just before the album <i>Hearts on Parade</i> was near to hit stores in the spring. Maverick, a branch of Island Records, meant the band was signing another deal with their former label. <i><a href="../../../h/e/a/Hearts_on_Parade_1b63.html" title="Hearts on Parade">Hearts on Parade</a></i>, was released in April 2005. There were two singles to the album, <i>The Geeks Get The Girls</i> and <i>Hell, Yeah!</i>, but both failed to even enter the US Modern Rock charts. The album has a much more "pop" sound than their two previous offerings, leaving many fans bitterly disappointed and some going as far to call them "sell-outs".</p>
<p>In the fall of 2005, Maverick decided to drop the band after a poor album sales.</p>
