<p>The article claimed that American flew over 98 million route passenger miles in 2005. This seems off as a single airplane can fly many more than that. I deleted the statement. Does anyone have a correct figure?</p>

<p>does any body know who is editing alaska airlines? they say someone is attacking us here!----------------</p>
<p><br />
I slightly edited this page to delete an inaccurate paragraph. A paragraph stated that after the fall of Pan Am, Eastern and TWA in the early 1990s American Airlines became the most profitable publically traded airline. I'm not sure if this is correct. For one thing, TWA remained in business until 2001 when it was acquired by American Airlines. Additionally, I recall reading in multiple sources that United Airlines had made the most profits of any airline in history in the late 1990s, so it seems that there existed sufficient doubt over the validity of that paragraph for me to axe it.</p>
<p>If anyone has any information here which could go more into depth on this it would be worthwhile to discuss...</p>

<p>I think it's an injustice to Cord to call him a "corporate raider." Raiders are the guys who buy a company, sell off its component parts, and leave. Cord did shuffle companies around a bit, but he was trying to build an empire, not destroy something. He bought Duesenberg, then a makr of excellent cars, and turned it into a company whose cars still inspire awe 70 years later. Then he added Auburn, transforming that into a company whose products made people sit up, take notice, and buy. Then he started a new line, Cord.</p>
<p>I'm less familiar with his involvement in aircraft, but he did seem to be trying to build up something there, too.</p>

<p>Sekicho, Can you please explain why in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_cdc7.html" title="American Airlines">American Airlines</a> <b>External Links</b> you deleted a link placed by 68.162.15.2 at 15:02 on 24 October 2004 (UTC) without a proper explanation, Putting "giving up and rv'ing to last stable version" is not a proper explanation. I checked out the site myself and there is legitimate material relating to American Airlines and the events of <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 Terrorist attacks</a>. It's not like it is a spam site and in fact there are several Wikipedia articles that link to that site and have been for quite a while. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterrick_032d.html" title="User:Misterrick">Misterrick</a> 09:37, 25 October 2004 (UTC).</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't intend to delete that link, actually (I was just trying to get rid of all the vandalism and I reverted to one version earlier than I should have). That said, now that I'm looking at the link, I think it doesn't really belong here. It's not about the airline: it's about 9/11, which was a single event that involved the airline as an unwilling accomplice. Nothing substantial is said of AA that couldn't be gleaned from reading Wikipedia's articles on 9/11. - <a href="../../../s/e/k/User%7ESekicho_869d.html" title="User:Sekicho">Sekicho</a> 10:36, Oct 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>See I have to disagree with you here, Yes it is about 9/11 but since both <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_cdc7.html" title="American Airlines">American Airlines</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Airlines_e78f.html" title="United Airlines">United Airlines</a> were victims in this "Single Event" as you call it there are bound to be people who want to know more about what happened and I feel that the person who created this site is providing historical information. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterrick_032d.html" title="User:Misterrick">Misterrick</a> 18:10, 26 October 2004 (UTC).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I agree with all of what you've just said. However:</p>
<p>(1) Visitors have many options in finding out more. They can click on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, they can click on <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_Flight_11_b841.html" title="American Airlines Flight 11">American Airlines Flight 11</a>, they can click on <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Trade_Center_57c9.html" title="World Trade Center">World Trade Center</a>... they can even click on <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Ong_b37e.html" title="Betty Ong">Betty Ong</a>. We don't need an external link to provide historical information because virtually all of it has been wikified already.</p>
<p>(2) More importantly, a 9/11-related website is not "on point" to an article written about American Airlines. 9/11 makes up only a small part of American's history, and likewise, American was only an accessory to the incident. It makes sense to link Max Miller's site from 9/11 and AA11, because his web site tells a lot about both. However, a person is not going to learn more about American Airlines from Max's site. We don't have a link to Max Miller from <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Qaida_a98c.html" title="Al-Qaida">al-Qaida</a> or from <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a>, even though his web site has a great deal to do with both, because his web site doesn't tell people anything about either!</p>
<p>(3) "External links" are not merely "related links."

In this case, while Max Miller's site is <i>related</i> to American Airlines, it is not <i>relevant</i> to an article about American Airlines any more than a web site about <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbine_High_School_85e4.html" title="Columbine High School">Columbine High School</a> is relevant to an article about <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Moore_f401.html" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a>.</p>
<p>You seem to imply that I have some sort of evil motivation to wipe 9/11 from history. I don't. I'm just trying to exercise good editorial discretion. As a lawyer-in-training, I dislike the "parade of horrors" analysis, but it fits here: if we allow external links with only slight correlation to article content, we're going to end up with a ton of external links that aren't useful. There are a lot of articles that Max Miller's web site should be linked from.

<dd>Aside from other hubs and focus cities, AA serves 15 destinations from Logan. These are either in the Caribbean/Latin America or Europe (with a couple coast-to-coast flights). The route structure AA has around this airport is point-to-point, not for connections. LaGuardia has 13 destinations other than hubs and focus cities. It has a number of flights to the southern US and the Caribbean, but no one is going to connect in LaGuardia to go from Atlanta to St. Thomas, for example. Having a major presence at an airport does not constitute a hub; an airline has to have coordinated incoming and outgoing flights to allow for connections. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">Dbinder</a> 01:35, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Boston is a hub for American Eagle, but not AA mainline. The airline's own 2005 legal filing did not list it as a hub. It specifically stated that DFW, Miami, San Juan, St. Louis, and Chicago were hubs; nothing else. The map included cities in caps if they are mainline or Eagle hubs; the article is only about the mainline, however. The American Eagle article should include Boston and New York. Furthermore, if you insist on using the standard that a city must be in caps on the map, then remove San Juan from the list of hubs, since that is in lowercase on the route map. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbinder_d348.html" title="User:Dbinder">Dbinder</a> 16:39, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
