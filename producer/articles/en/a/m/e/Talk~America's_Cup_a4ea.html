<p>The original name of the Cup has been a contentious issue in the article. Because I'm tired of correcting and re-correcting, allow me to share with you the story behind the name of the Cup. Thank you for your patience!&#160;:)</p>
<p>At a Royal Yacht Squadron meeting on May 9, 1851, it was decided, among other things, to have a race around the Isle of Wight open to all nations--the prize being a 'RYS Cup of' 100 sovereigns. 100 sovereigns is equal to 100 pounds sterling. The RYS minutes of May 9 and July 11, 1851 refer to the cup as the 'RYS Cup' or 'RYS Cup of' 100 sovereigns. In addition to the minutes, a flyer that announced the regatta also refers to the cup as the 'RYS Cup of' 100 sovereigns. I have not discovered any evidence that supports the claim that the Cup was originally called the one hundred guinea(s) cup by the Royal Yacht Squadron.</p>
<p>After the yacht 'America' won the trophy, the American winners dubbed their prize the 'One Hundred Guinea(s) Cup' for reasons unknown. Incidently, 100 guineas is worth about 105 pounds. The name 'One Hundred Guinea(s) Cup' persisted. In fact, on the very trophy itself, an inscription made by the Americans refers to the trophy as the: 'one hundred guinea cup' won by the 'America' in 1851 being offered as a 'challenge cup'.</p>
<p>The Cup was subsquently known simulteneously as the 'America Cup', or the 'Queens Cup', the 'hundred guinea cup', and, of course, the <i>America'</i>s Cup. Today the Cup is officially called the 'America's Cup' without italicizing the name of the schooner.</p>

<p>I guess we are getting a little unencyclopaedic reporting on each race of the current series. Would experienced Wikipedians care to comment on the best direction to take this article? - sub articles on each series? - an article under current affairs on the 2003 series? <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDramatic_bee8.html" title="User:Dramatic">user:dramatic</a></p>

<p>Dishonest? Was Bond's dishonesty related to the Cup racing - no, hence I don't think it is relavant here. It would be like adding the adjective "Libertine" in front of Bill Clinton's name in an article about his administration's foreign policy. The place to mention Bond's dishonesty would be an article on Bond.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it was related. America's Cup racing has been described as "standing in a cold shower tearing up $100 notes". Bond spent a substantial amount - many million - to win the cup, and the money was dishonestly aquired. Not opinion: he wound up in jail for several years, and would still be there had his lawyers not got him out on a technicality.

<p>It seems odd to me to have the boat names linked to the topic that has that same name. There is one broken link that has (yacht) after the name, but all the others are either broken or linked to something that has very little if anything to do with the boat.

<p>I remember reading somewhere that the cup is so large due to a miscommunication of the units as imperial when they were metric. Can anyone confirm this and, if true, write it in? <a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorge_ce73.html" title="User:Porge">porge</a> 12:27, Oct 13, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Seems unlikely, given that the Cup was made in England in the nineteenth century and neither England or America used the metric system back then. <a href="../../../l/i/s/User%7ELisiate_1b7e.html" title="User:Lisiate">Lisiate</a> 22:31, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Given the increasing size of the article (a good thing, don't get me wrong), should we move the length challenger/defender list to a separate page, say List of America's Cup contestants? Also, we could have a List of American's Cup defender contestants and List of American's Cup challenger contestants (which is a bit better than the semi-anachronistic List of Luis Vuitton Cup contestants), to cover all the yachts which competed in any given year, but didn't feature in the main matchup.

<p>Surely the apostrophe does not belong? Surely?</p>
<p>That apostrophe means possession. This means that it is America's Cup; the cup belongs to America. Firstly, it doesn't, and secondly this surely isn't how it's meant to read? It's meant to concern The Americas, as in North and South America, isn't it? And you don't need an apostrophe for that. It should be The Americas Cup shouldn't it? 81.153.182.67 17:42, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you would take the trouble to read the <b>first</b> paragraph, you would know that the trophy is named for the schooner <a href="../../../a/m/e/America_%28yacht%29.html" title="America (yacht)"><i>America</i></a>, the boat that won the first race.

The apostrophe definitely belongs. The America's Cup is called such because it was the cup won by the yacht 'America' in 1851. --<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerCupFan_05cb.html" title="User:AmerCupFan">AmerCupFan</a></p>

<dd>In 1995 as a response to multiple challengers and questions as to how the next challenger would be selected, the Louis Vuitton Cup was created as a fair way to determine who will become the official challenger of the America's Cup.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This doesn't agree with info later on in the article or in the LV Cup article. From memory, something did occur in 1995 in relation to the LV Cup but I'm not sure what <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 19:07, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Louis Vuitton Cup was first awarded to the winner of the challenger selection series in 1983. The multiple challenger format was inaugurated for the 1970 match. AmerCupFan.</p>
<p>I remember when the LV Cup name came into being but I am wondering whether, in the period after 1983, but before New Zealand's wins if there was a name for a cup in the competition for the defender of the America's Cup. This would have been when the US was fielding four or five yachts to compete against each other. I thought I remembered a specific name for the series when the race was held of the coast of San Diego, but my memory plays so many tricks anymore that I could be wrong. Thanks ahead of time to any wikimembers who can help.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnetteD_5345.html" title="User:MarnetteD">MarnetteD</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarnetteD_a71f.html" title="User talk:MarnetteD">Talk</a> 19:16, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to the article, the team with the highest score at the end of the acts wins the Louis Vutton Cup and is declared the challenger. But it appears Alinghi is also taking part in the acts. So what happens if they have the most points? <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 19:10, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Nil Einne. I think that Alinghi is competing so that they avoid the troubles that New Zealand had in the last AC regatta. Through their glory years of the 90's the NZ team had pretty much stayed together in the important competitions. But with the Alighi's team raid of some of the best of the NZ team members one of the downfalls of team NZ was that they just didn't have enough competitive races under their belt when the last AC got down to two teams. In the 70's and 80's when America held the cup there were usually four or more boats sailing against each other in a defender's regatta before the AC finals got going. NZ's first defense did not have this but, as I said, the bulk of their championship team were still together. In their second defense of the cup they simply had their two yachts competing against each other, as they had done before, near the same courses where the the LV cup was being contested. In the upcoming AC Switzerland, ie Alinghi, only has one yacht sailing so I think that they are trying to keep their crew (which has had some important personel changes from their winning team) up to competitive snuff by racing in these acts. Whether this gives them an advantage or not remains to be seen. Of course, I could be wrong and if some other sailing wikimember can straighten us out it will be much appreciated.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarnetteD_5345.html" title="User:MarnetteD">MarnetteD</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarnetteD_a71f.html" title="User talk:MarnetteD">Talk</a> 19:16, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I might have missed it but nowhere in the article did I notice a mention of the frequency of the race. Is it held every 4 years such as the World Cup or the Olympics or is it not as structured as that? A sentence or two on this would be appreciated. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparky132_28db.html" title="User:Sparky132">Sparky132</a> 20:23, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not as structured as that. In the old days it basically happened when a new challenger emerged. Since the 1980s there has been an attempt to make things more regular, but the Big Boat challenge and later the New Zealand victory threw things out of whack (different seasons and all). It's hard to summarise accurately and concisely but I'm sure someone will add a more detailed explanation soon. <a href="../../../l/i/s/User%7ELisiate_1b7e.html" title="User:Lisiate">Lisiate</a> 21:21, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I notice that the article does not have much information regarding the current America's Cup - should a new article perhaps be created which give more information regarding the current competition? On top of that would more information about each team be a good idea? Personally I can contribute a lot regarding Team Shosholoza (Many of the team members are members of yacht club I am a member of and I often visit / can easily get information from Royal Cape Yacht Club).</p>
<p>I was thinking something along the lines of what the Rugby World Cup article has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Rugby_World_Cup#Teams" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Rugby_World_Cup#Teams" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> --<a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilps_f011.html" title="User:Kilps">kilps</a> 19:51, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I for one think that's a good idea. <a href="../../../l/i/s/User%7ELisiate_1b7e.html" title="User:Lisiate">Lisiate</a> 21:29, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Michael Fay had nothing to do with the 1995 winning challenge for the America's Cup. by this stage he had left NZ and I think was living in the UK&gt;</p>
<p>That challenge was led by Sir Peter Blake, representing Royal NZ Yacht Squadron. All of Fay's challenges were from some other club, Mercury Bay I think it was.</p>
