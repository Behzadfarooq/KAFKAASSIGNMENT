<dd>Fine. I plan on moving <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> back to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="American (disambiguation)">American (disambiguation)</a> or some equivalent site, and placing a redirect here (to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>). <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> has a little notifier placed on top already, so the very few who make it to this page meaning <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">Americas</a> or, I dunno, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_cheese.html" title="American cheese">American cheese</a> can make it to the disamb page with just one extra click, and the vast majority (just check out the pages that link here!) can get taken directly to the desired page (<a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>).

<dd>Yes, Matt, I object. This article should remain as the diambiguation page and <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="American (disambiguation)">American (disambiguation)</a> should remain a redirect. The reason is that otherwise Wikipedia users will change this page back and and forth to redirect to either <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> or <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">Americas</a>. It is much better to prevent both sides from doing this by using this page as the disambiguation page. As the debate over what is American is unresolvable, it is better to make it moot with the handy tools available to us on Wikipedia. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 22:06, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Umm, as a matter of fact, Acjelen, we do have a way of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtected_pages_09f5.html" title="Wikipedia:Protected pages">protecting</a> pages like that so that they're uneditable.

<dd>Can pages, especially redirects, be protected permanently? If so, I'd be in favor of having the disambiguation page at <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="American (disambiguation)">American (disambiguation)</a> (and <a href="../../../a/m/e/America.html" title="America">America</a> at <a href="../../../a/m/e/America_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="America (disambiguation)">America (disambiguation)</a>, but I'd also want <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> to be a redirect to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="American (disambiguation)">American (disambiguation)</a> and not <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 02:39, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, pages can be protected permanently (<a href="../../../index.html" title="Main Page">Main Page</a>, anyone?). I think that whatever the consensus we reach is, we should have <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> be a redirect to somewhere, and protect <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a>.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well first of all, it was done without any discussion before hand. And secondly, I think the page should remain at <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> to quickly and directly inform people of its various uses and direct them to the appropriate article in Wikipedia. The debate over what is American is unresolvable. As editors of an encyclopedia, it is not our job to "end" the debate. Moreover, having the page at American instead of American (disambiguation) reduces edit wars over where American redirects to. I also want to address the issue of how many pages link to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> but should link to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. Generally the titles of WP articles are in the singular and the noun form. Thus <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrian.html" title="Austrian">Austrian</a> is a redirect to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austria</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/o/Erotic.html" title="Erotic">Erotic</a> to <a href="../../../e/r/o/Eroticism.html" title="Eroticism">Eroticism</a>, and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monkeys.html" title="Monkeys">Monkeys</a> to <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monkey.html" title="Monkey">Monkey</a>. Ideally no articles should have a link to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrian.html" title="Austrian">Austrian</a>, but instead use the pipe character (i.e. <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrian</a>) and other happy wikiness like <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrian</a>. All those pages linking to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> should be changed so that they link directly to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. A similar problem occurs with the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales_f847.html" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</a>. Since many people mistakenly refer to him as "Prince Charles" (and little wonder since the press does it constantly), there are many <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Charles_07f6.html" title="Prince Charles">Prince Charles</a> wikilinks. Redirects and see references help to send people to the right article, but all those "Prince Charles" occurrences are in error. It should be a regular habit to remove them. I would rather <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Charles_07f6.html" title="Prince Charles">Prince Charles</a> was the disambiguation page so that when editors came upon the list of preferred terms, they would realize that they needed to use <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles%2C_Prince_of_Wales_f847.html" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">Charles, Prince of Wales</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Edward_Stuart_2f08.html" title="Charles Edward Stuart">Charles Edward Stuart</a>, etc. I have not made an effort to switch <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Charles_07f6.html" title="Prince Charles">Prince Charles</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Charles_%28disambiguation%29_8f0e.html" title="Prince Charles (disambiguation)">Prince Charles (disambiguation)</a>, but since <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> is already that way, it makes sense to keep it so. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 02:35, 17 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I can understand your point of view, but the thing is that every day editors continue to link to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> but meaning <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. I accept that this will remain a dab for the forseeable future. Just out of curiosity then, who (exactly) uses "American" in any other way than meaning <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>?

<p><i>American</i> refers to the ones who belong to <a href="../../../a/m/e/America.html" title="America">America</a>. <a href="../../../a/m/e/America.html" title="America">America</a> is the name of a continent and the colloquial short for the country United States of America (USA). Please note that the CIA World Factbook <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html#Govt" class="external free" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html#Govt" rel="nofollow">https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html#Govt</a> does NOT include 'America' as a short name for the USA. It results awkward (if not offensive) for Latin-Americans who have a strong feeling of community toward the continent (<a href="../../../s/i/m/Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar_f23b.html" title="Simón Bolívar">Simón Bolívar</a>'s dream) to assign this word excursively to the inhabitants of the USA. Citizens of any country on the American continent are as Americans as a USA citizen in the same way that Europeans are all the citizens of any countries in the European continent and not only the ones that belong to the European Union or to a particular country. The fact that USA have the biggest economical and military power makes some think that they can ignore the fact that America is the name of a continent and not of a country placed in this continent. The problem get worse by the fact that USA is also not a proper name, given that Mexico is called 'United Mexican States' and the USA is not the only United States of America. Better would be to give a proper name to the country . <a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodolfo_Hermans_ddc0.html" title="User:Rodolfo Hermans">Godot</a> 21:32, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's very nice, but what is an issue here is common usage in the English language, not Spanish or any other language, and not the fact that some Latin Americans might have their feelings hurt by the usage of a word.--<a href="../../../r/w/r/User%7ERWR8189_3944.html" title="User:RWR8189">RWR8189</a> 22:15, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>First, I don't know if I'm in a minority here, but I find any idea of "continental belonging" offensive. If the people of the rest of the western hemisphere wish to see themselves as one, then I'm glad that the United States of America bucks that trend. I'm not going to apologize for my independent and sovereign country. Second, that some don't recognize the two continents of North America and South America is fine, but the society I live in does; and I don't think we should be treated like we failed third-grade geography. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 22:58, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that the self-centered use of the language have made common the improper <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demonym.html" title="Demonym">demonym</a>. The use is in your favor. On the other hand, the somehow official facts provided by CIA World Factbook, is that the country it is NOT named America, and in consequence to call their inhabitants Americans in an exclusive way, creates a conflict. There are 885 million people that deserves the right to use the proper <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentilic.html" title="Gentilic">gentilic</a>, and some wants to restrict it to less than 300 million. BTW, there are seven different models to enumerate the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continents.html" title="Continents">continents</a>, only three of them makes distinction between <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>. Sorry if bothers you to share land with <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudacas.html" title="Sudacas">sudacas</a>.

<dd>You might prefer it if the language had two different words for someone from the Americas and someone from the United States, but it is not Wikipedia's job to dictate how words are used. I think you should apply Wikipedia's <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> policy to regular life and realize people from the United States don't mean to offend anyone when they use "American" to mean someone from their country, it's just an unfortunate trick of the language. I also think everyone should keep in mind that this is the talk page for discussing improvements to the article, not for airing grievances or expressing personal opinions.--<a href="../../../c/u/c/User%7ECuchullain_f14f.html" title="User:Cuchullain">Cúchullain</a> <a href="../../../c/u/c/User_talk%7ECuchullain_0f10.html" title="User talk:Cuchullain"><sup>t</sup></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cuchullain_2c21.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cuchullain"><small>c</small></a> 07:33, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I apologise for including personal opinions. My main interest reach a consensus of the correct <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentilic.html" title="Gentilic">gentilic</a> and help Wikipedia to have the most accurate and complete definitions. Base on the later, I do think that is the job of any Encyclopedia to acknowledge the common use but also to state the correctness of the use. Does it follows the grammatical rules? is it used officially? Is the definition recognized by everybody? If a consensus is reached I would like to include a statement saying that to call American excursively to a US citizen is in principle a mistake that have been validated only by proper context. Why? because from the rules of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentilic.html" title="Gentilic">gentilic</a> American means from America and nor from United States of America, because USA official documents for foreign issues uses US citizen and not American, because the meaning is not recognized by everybody and so on. This IS a business of a Wikipedia editor. I AM assuming good faith, I don't think that the intension is to harm, I just think there are things that have been ignored, in good faith.</dd>
<dd>Any statement on this page about the incorrectness of a U.S.-exclusive use of <i>American</i> needs to be accompanied by another statement that some do not recognize another place called merely and soley "America" that would cause confusion over the label. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 19:46, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Sorry, I was not aware of a single educated person that did not recognize the name 'America' as a continent at least in one of the possible meanings. Let's cite the sources. With 'America' as the continent with first meaning I found: Webster's ,Merriam-Webster, American Heritage,Columbia University Press,Ultralingua.com,rhymezone.com,bartleby.com. I did NOT found a single one that ignored the name America as a continent.

<dd>By that logic, we need to look at English speakers as a whole. According to our page on the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a>, there are about 400-450 million speakers of English as a first language. The US has a population of almost 300 million, of whom most speak English. That's well more than half of all English speakers, so the <i><a href="../../../a/r/g/Argumentum_ad_populum.html" title="Argumentum ad populum">argumentum ad populum</a></i> works against your case there.

<dd>Well, my point is that the improper use of the word <i>American</i> is biased in one side from the self-centered perspective of the US citizens, that comes probably from the fact the US is a pretty big country in population, economy and military power. That is why I am interested in the perspective of other non US <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-America_aae9.html" title="Anglo-America">Anglo-Americans</a>. I acknowledge that there is other side on the problem, and is that there is no proper <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gentilic.html" title="Gentilic">gentilic</a> for descriptive names as 'United States of America', or 'United Arab Emirates' and so on. All would be easier if the US defined an <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_alternative_country_names.html" title="List of alternative country names">alternative name</a> for the country like Mexico, United Kingdom, etc. Indeed it was <a href="../../../u/s/e/Use_of_the_word_American_8aee.html#History_of_the_word" title="Use of the word American">attempted</a> which shows that it is needed.<a href="../../../r/o/d/User%7ERodolfo_Hermans_ddc0.html" title="User:Rodolfo Hermans">Godot</a> 23:52, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Proper?" Well who is to say what is proper? But, Dude, while you replaced what i'd posted. it seems that you did not read it. The term "American" was used in 1835 by a Frenchman to describe the folks living in the USA. This was long efore they were rich and powerful and famous. Pick your fights with more care - is my opinion. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarptrash_5c7f.html" title="User:Carptrash">Carptrash</a> 02:33, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, I'm an idiot: by "publication," I meant an indefinite serial, since anything else could avoid ambiguity by clear context. It sounds like I'm backpedalling, but I really did intend that - if I hadn't, I wouldn't have said "or style guide," since that is a kind of publication. Secondly, every last one of those, with the exception of NAFTA, is either from somewhere where English is not the common tongue, or from the one Anglophone country I purposefully excluded, the United States themselves. Make no mistake, we do use the word (you yourself have demonstrated that), but some publications will use awkward phrasings to avoid accusations of patriotic or even racist bias, especially by our large percentage of native or habitual speakers of Spanish who have learned English. NAFTA <i>does</i> use "American" as a demonym (usually in the phrase "American or Mexican"); though due to the structure of the document, I can't point to it, I count three uses, which a text search should give you. Third, although I said nothing on this, many of them are quite old; by similar justifications, you could argue that "Dutch" should mean "of Benelux." A neologism is so only for a finite period. Finally, addressing your repeated claim to dictionaries, I have never seen a dictionary of the English language that acknowledges one definition and not the other, and I don't think you can find one. <a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwin_Bird_808e.html" title="User:Twin Bird">Twin Bird</a> 05:57, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In that case, I have to agree with you. I didn't even notice you excluded the United States as a source for the publications. I'm not sure what the motivation for using <i>American</i> in reference to the Americas (in the United States) is; it might be to be politically correct (or just to be correct). American in reference to the United States sounds colloquial and unnofficial; this might also be a motivation.</dd>

<dd>I don't think I'm going to find Australian or Irish publications using American to mean "of the Americas" by habit. First, the majority of available scholarly papers on the internet comes from the United States. Second, the United States has a greater influence on the English dialects of Anglophone countries than do Mexico or Columbia. Third, U.S. Americans introduce themselves as Americans everywhere they go, while Mexicans or Canadians don't (for obvious reasons, such as why Irish people don't introduce themselves as U.K.-ean) despite technically being so, thus it might be hard to know there is a long standing dispute on the matter for an Australian or Irish person. Fourth, I don't have access to many Australian or English journals, though it is very likely that Biology or History journals and textbooks routinely refer to objects associated with the Americas as American.</dd>

<p>UK, Canada, Ireland, and the primary use of "American" is the US definition.</p>
<p><i>(response to Matt Yeager - tabs were reset by Ejrrjs)</i> Actually, <i>American</i> doesn't just refer to U.S. Citizens more frequently. Take <i>Latin <b>American</b></i> or <i>South <b>American</b></i> for example. By the way U.S. Citizens rarely call the U.S., <i>United States of America</i>.

<dd>Most articles have more than one word in their title. The use of the word "American" without a word like "Latin" or "South" used as a qualifier before the word almost always refers to a US person in the English language. When someone speaks about an "American writer" or the "American president" an English speaker doesn't stop and wonder which "American" country that president or writer is from. When an English speaker identifies himself as an "American", an overwhelming majority of people will associate that with meaning that he is from the United States.

<dd>That's neither here nor there. "Latin American" is also used to mean someone who is a US citizen and is of Latino background. The bottom line is, like it or not, the primary, unqualified meaning of "American" in the English language is "of or related to the United States".

<dd>I would also say that if this is to remain a disambiguation page, per Manual of Style (disambiguation pages), "A person or attribute of the United States of America" should appear first on the list.

<dd>Since <i>American (U.S.)</i> is derived from <i>America (U.S.)</i> which is derived from America (New World), the continental definition is more correct. Since there is no adequate way to measure which use is more common, taking qualifiers into account, the best way to go about it is chronological or an "etymological" order. Besides <i>American</i> is based on collapsed name when it refers to the U.S. and it is based on itself when it refers to the continent. No matter how you slice it you are doing a disservice to the world (and U.S. Americans) by favoring a misnomer. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeepstratagem_27fb.html" title="User:Deepstratagem">Deepstratagem</a> 13:40, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The term was not dictated from a position of power but was just what the place and people were called. 175 years ago. And mostly still is today.

<dd>This is the "correctness" argument again. It isn't Wikipedia's place to decide which is correct. Both Wikipedia and the English language work by consensus. If I said "Jenny is an American" to virtually <i>any</i> US national, they would assume I meant US American. The same goes for saying this to most of the rest of the English speaking world. If you want some official examples of "American being used this way", here's some: <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Samoa_98b4.html" title="American Samoa">American Samoa</a> is the recognized name for this territory. <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> is an ethnic group in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, according to all US census reports.

They are an ethnic group in <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberia.html" title="Liberia">Liberia</a> composed of descendants of US American slaves. I reiterate that while both uses of the word "American" are perfectly valid, it is dishonest to suggest that without a qualifier, US American isn't the primary use for the majority of English speakers.--<a href="../../../c/u/c/User%7ECuchullain_f14f.html" title="User:Cuchullain">Cúchullain</a> <a href="../../../c/u/c/User_talk%7ECuchullain_0f10.html" title="User talk:Cuchullain"><sup>t</sup></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cuchullain_2c21.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cuchullain"><small>c</small></a> 21:41, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Acjelen. It seems to me that the "pioneers" of the U.S. weren't "immigrants" to America, they were the founders. People who were in the country when the United States was formed automatically became citizens. I think leaving "immigrants" as part of the definition is confusing, since most people wouldn't consider a legal immigrant an "American" until they became a citizen, including the immigrant. —<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleared_as_filed_a7db.html" title="User:Cleared as filed">Cleared as filed.</a> 14:41, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>By pioneer, I meant the people who settled the middle of the country, not the colonists. Many 19th century immigrants never became naturalized, but were clearly Americans. Also, do you think Alexander Hamilton wasn't an American until the ratification of the constitution? It is fine if you do, but it clearly demonstrates the word's ambiguity. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 19:33, 29 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Most of the people who settled the middle of the country came from the edges, didn't they? Alexander Hamilton wasn't an American until the Declaration of Independence; before that, he was a British colonist like everyone else. Why do you say that immigrants who never became naturalized were "clearly" Americans? I think just the opposite. A lot of people become citizens so that they can "become" Americans. —<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleared_as_filed_a7db.html" title="User:Cleared as filed">Cleared as filed.</a> 19:40, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>Originally, I grouped the various items on this dab page by part of speech (e.g. nouns, adjectives, <i>etc.</i>). Later this was altered to the present grouping. The link to 4-4-0 is at the top because it was orginally with the noun group, along with people of the United States and people of the Americas. At present this first section contains uses of American that can stand alone: ("What's that?" "It's an American."). The second section are items where <i>American</i> serves as the adjective or as a portion of a name but frequently appears alone. Native Americans were originally mentioned because of the archaic term "American race" to refer to them. Without mention of American race, they don't really need to be here. I doubt if anyone will search for "American" to find information on American Indians.</p>
<p>Please see the manual of style of disambiguation page (<a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSDAB_2469.html" title="WP:MOSDAB">here</a>).

<dd>I just took a glance at the MOS page you cited. It says <b>Always place the most-common meaning(s) at the top.</b>. That is pretty much what I did.

<dd>Because "American" generally means (1) a person or attribute of the United States; (2) a person or attribute of the Americas; or (3) a particular sort of engine. While which meaning should be first is debated, the choice for third place is obvious. Many people also use "American" when they mean their airline, their credit card company, their cheese preference, or their dialect of English; so we've included these, but separated from the first three. The page contains more links when the correct title on Wikipedia isn't obvious, such as American Recordings, in an attempt to be helpful. I admit that more has been spoken of and written about Native Americans than the 4-4-0 steam engine; and that the former has had a greater impact on the history of mankind than the former, but very seldomly do people use <i>American</i> by itself to refer to Amerindians. Disambiguation pages are not thesaurus's. They are places where Wikipedia asks her users, "When you typed in 'foo', did you mean X, Y, or Z?" -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 21:00, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

English tea, <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">Homosexuality</a> a.k.a. the English disease, or non-<a href="../../../a/m/i/Amish.html" title="Amish">Amish</a> U.S. residents. <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a>, claiming to be a disambiguation page, doesn't include any "used as an adjective" links. If this page linked to all artice's beginning with <i>American</i> it would become unwieldy. Looking at <a href="../../../f/r/e/French.html" title="French">French</a>, though, I may have found a solution for you. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 19:46, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It would be a digression to point out, Cúchullain, that your first comment is invalid (how do you find something you don't know the name of?), and that the proposal wasn't about including <i>all</i> relevantly-prefixed articles; and to Acjelen, that there must be a cultural thing here because English tea plainly refers to English breakfast tea; but what's more important is that the "list of" article you've included is a good solution. I appreciate the constructive and useful response, and the effort you obviously put into finding it.

<dd>I once knew a Polish-Canadian woman who said that in Russia, white tea is called Polish tea, but in Poland it is called German tea. She further went on to say that the Germans call white tea French tea and the French call it English tea. The English, of course, call white tea tea -65.66.103.43 21:56, 7 November 2006 (UTC) -Oops, must have timed out. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 21:58, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My first comment was not invalid. <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Disambiguation pages</a> are not for listing various articles that happen to be related to title in some way, or merely begin with them. They are not <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html#Lists" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">lists or search indices</a>. They are for disambiguating ambiguous terms. If someone didn't know the name of "<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_way.html" title="American way">American way</a>", they shouldn't expect to find it here. The same goes for English tea at English, whatever it's called. As for American cultural hegemony, I don't think that's a very plausible search term for American way, but you should probably bring it up over there.--<a href="../../../c/u/c/User%7ECuchullain_f14f.html" title="User:Cuchullain">Cúchullain</a> <a href="../../../c/u/c/User_talk%7ECuchullain_0f10.html" title="User talk:Cuchullain"><sup>t</sup></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cuchullain_2c21.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cuchullain"><small>c</small></a> 22:10, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
