<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/Amelia_Wil_Tesla_Seyruun_39ad.html" title="Edit section: Biography">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biography</span></h2>
<p>It is described in the story that Princess Amelia is the youngest daughter of Crown Prince Philionel of Seyruun, the <i>Ultimate Pacifist</i> who, for the most part, benevolently rules over the Kingdom of Seyruun, one of the largest white magic using kingdoms of the Slayers universe. Her mother was murdered when she was very young, and the incident reportedly traumatized her older sister, the Crown Princess Gracia, so badly that she ran away from home, while Amelia herself vowed never to use swords in combat (though she did use the Sword of Light once in order to channel the Ra Tilt). A running gag throughout the series is that Amelia looks nothing like her dad, and that Phil looks like a giant dwarf. According to Amelia, tall height runs in her family, and that her older sister was almost as tall as Gourry, which would suggest that Amelia herself, though very small, has not yet stopped growing. According to Amelia, her older sister was "scary" and had a maniacal laugh; it is rumored and hinted at all throughout the different Slayers series that Amelia's long lost sister is actually Naga, the White Serpent (Lina's primary partner in the OAV).</p>
<p>Amelia is first introduced looking for her father when he goes on a secret mission with his brother, Amelia's Uncle Prince Randy, to root out an evil sorcerer who is threatening their kingdom (unaware that it is part of a plot by Randy to overthrow Phil and take the throne for himself), which brings her first into contact with <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gourry_Gabriev_ab9f.html" title="Gourry Gabriev">Gourry Gabriev</a> - who was briefly taking a break from <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lina_Inverse_a5c9.html" title="Lina Inverse">Lina Inverse</a>, as she was waiting to meet Prince Phil without knowing that he was not the boyishly handsome figure that she imagined him to be - when she helps a traveler who is being robbed by a bandit; when her initial passionate speech about justice does not work and she is insulted by the bandit, Amelia strikes the bandit down with a spell and then knocks him into the river. Gourry agrees to help Amelia look for her dad, though her zealousness regarding the distribution of justice leaves him at a loss for words. Later they catch up with Lina and Phil when they confront Randy and his partner in crime. Since neither Phil nor Amelia have any money to pay Lina and Gourry for their services, they decide to join their group and escort the fiery sorceress and idiot savant swordsman to Seyruun and then pay them once they have returned to the castle. Along the way Amelia tries to get Lina to teach her the Dragon Slave, in the interest of using it to spread justice of course, much to Lina's annoyance, until Lina makes it very clear that the Dragon Slave is not a toy, so to speak. When they finally get to Seyruun, it turns out that there is a price on Lina and Gourry (and also <a href="../../../z/e/l/Zelgadis_Greywords_3eb6.html" title="Zelgadis Greywords">Zelgadis Greywords</a>), which sends Amelia into a frenzy of moral outrage and she tries to arrest them herself, or at lest with the help of the various bounty hunters and "warriors of justice", and eventually succeeds in helping Zangulus and Vrumugun, the minions of Eris and the Rezo clone. When Lina &amp; Gourry escape, Amelia gets caught in the crossfire and confronts Lina again about her misdeeds, and Lina tries to force Amelia to confront the fact that she is not seeing the bad guys for who they are, which Amelia tries to resolve by blasting them both with a giant fireball, assuming that the real heroes will survive simply because they are the heroes. When Lina and Gourry manage to survive the explosion, Amelia is convinced, albeit for the wrong reasons, that they are innocent and then offers to travel with them to help clear their names - and also because Phil is mad at her for destroying one of Seyruun's buildings. This later brings Amelia into contact with Zelgadis, with whom she slowly develops strong feelings for.</p>
<p>Like Gourry, Amelia often finds herself on the wrong end of Lina's anger, but over time Amelia stands up to Lina more when she thinks that Lina is wrong. Despite their extremely different personalities, Lina and Amelia develop a surrogate big sister/little sister relationship.</p>
<p>In <i>NEXT</i> Amelia is dispatched by her father to the kingdom Xoana as an emissary of peace, but she was captured and held prisoner, but was "rescued" by Lina, who happened to be in Xoana with the intention of seeing its book to see if it held anything particularly important within its contents (it did not - at least, not for her anyway). Later, Amelia and her friends are caught up in another conspiracy to assassinate her father, which turns out to involve Gaav the Demon Dragon King, who has rebelled against the Monster Race, and later involving the dark lord Phibrizzo.</p>
<p>In <i>TRY</i> Amelia is shown as having risen to more prominence within her kingdom, commanding a whole battalion of magic users when necessary.</p>

<p>Amelia is initially presented as basically a well meaning but slightly scatter-brained little kid who really cannot tell the good guys from the bad guys. She has a tendency to contradict herself; early she states that it is wrong to judge by appearances, but when she first meets Zelgadis she assumes that there is something not Kosher about him because of his freakish appearance (it should be noted that in the manga she was much more friendly towards him when they first met). On the other hand, Amelia is a kind hearted, compassionate person who does her best to support and encourage her friends, even when they are not especially encouraging of her. She is notable for her obsession with spreading justice, a trait she inherited from her father, who taught her all that she knows regarding justice. This could be part of her way of dealing with the loss of her mother and the disappearance of her older sister.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Amelia frequently displays personality traits that are prominent in her friends. On occasion Amelia has shown a passion and zest similar to Lina's (especially for food), sometimes slow-witted like Gourry (though due more to naivety than lack of intelligence), and intensely focused like Zelgadis, albeit to reduced degrees. While she never completely loses her innocent personality, she does change over the course of her adventures with Lina.</p>
<p>Another notable habit of Amelia's is her tendency to address those who are older than her as either "Miss" or "Mr.", even when the person in question is only a year older than her like Lina.</p>
<p>Lastly, Amelia has an affinity for high places, roofs or statue points where she can make a dramatic entrance and deliver a rousing, justice themed speech. This is usually followed by a descent and an ignoble face-first landing. The anime hints that she has feelings for Zelgadis.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/Amelia_Wil_Tesla_Seyruun_39ad.html" title="Edit section: Skills">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Skills</span></h2>
<p>Amelia is a white magic user with a fair amount of skill in shamanism and black magic as well. She calls the Ra Tilt her "killer spell". Outside of her magical abilities, Amelia is well versed in aspects of court life and diplomacy. In a physical fight, Amelia is a decent boxer, but her lack of agility makes her an easy target for a more skilled opponent.</p>
