<p>I've noticed that many of the breed articles are kind of scattered and not all that well-written. It's sort of like everyone threw in a paragraph or two on their personal thing, but no one has taken a look at the whole. I'm taking a stab at cleanup on this one, I'm not a QH expert, so factual errors on bloodlines will have to be for others to fix, but I am a historian and a horse person, as well as an editing geek, so hopefully the changes I've added will improve readability, neutrality, and such. I also suggest more external links and references be added. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanabw_340c.html" title="User:Montanabw">Montanabw</a> 19:48, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, a plea to anyone editing ANY breed page: Let's try to remember neutral point of view and not knock anyone's breed. (I mean, I'm an Arabian afficionado, but I'm trying to make the QH page better too!)</p>
<p>Also, as long as there is no conflict between Wiki style, let's also say and spell things the way the breed registries do...some stuff is a term of art.</p>
<hr />
<p>Does anyone really like the american quarter horse? there is more information at www.aqha.com.</p>
<hr />
<p>The phrasing of the above question is odd. It's almost like: Does anyone <i>really</i> like the American quarter horse?</p>
<p>Uh, yeah! It's the most popular horse breed in the world. Lots of people that like to race horses usually buy a registered American Quarter Horse in my opinion they are the best i have 4 American Quarter Horses and 1 Registered.</p>

<p>I moved the page to be consistent with the title conventions. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrontonian_6c76.html" title="User:Trontonian">Trontonian</a> 15:19, 18 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>While your intentions were good, the correct spelling, as determined from reading material on Quarter Horses, is to spell American Quarter Horse as capitalized. --Bryan</p>

<p>"In addition, it has also been proven to be a very useful horse in the sport of Bullfighting. In Portugal and Spain, they have been known to mix the breed with Lusitanos, making it an exceptional cross-breed. The combination of the two gives the beauty and bravery of the Lusitano, while the strength &amp; speed is from the AQH."</p>
<p>I am also putting back my "external link" of our site as proof of what I am taling about. We are in the sport of "Bloodless Bullfighting" here in California. We give much care to our horses as if they were our children. While the Lusitano horse is bred for bullfighting, we lean towards acquiring a few AQH's as they have shown great strength and endurance in the arena. One of our best bullfighting horse is an AQH, which is highly wanted by a LOT of people from the European countries.</p>
<p>Here is our site... <a href="http://www.ranchcardoso.biz" class="external text" title="http://www.ranchcardoso.biz" rel="nofollow">California Bloodless Bullfights</a> Our site is video and image driven. It's much easier to show a video of a horse rather than trying to explain in so many words how great the horse is.</p>

<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is not a soapbox. Will revise accordingly.</dd>
</dl>
<p>No, Wikipedia is not a soapbox, but some people only write what is "common" and not ALL of the facts related to. It seems that you or whoever took off the bloodless bullfighting portion, because one might think it to be "controversial" rather than a "FACT". Well, here's fact for you. Our AQH is one of a kind, and wanted by so many, that one of the top bullfighters in Portugal purchased him from us and already has made headlines. So, if you are going to talk about the breed, you sometimes have to go to the extent of showing a sample of a horse that exemplifies what you are talking about. Because a lot of times it's all "mumbo-jumbo" and nobody knows any better other than what they are reading. Wikipedia is similar to the encyclopedia where it should be able to educate a person and NOT exclude real facts. And because this is the "internet", it's easier to include a lot more information than your typical encyclopedia.<br /></p>
<p>The reason why I push for "Bloodless Bullfighting" is this.... unlike the traditional style in Spain and Mexico, the bulls at Bloodless Bullfights in California are NOT bled, NOR are they killed at the end. And because they are not bled, it takes an extremely brave and talented horse to outrun and outsmart a bull. In addition, the bloodless bullfight truly shows the art and skill of both the horse and the horse rider.<br /></p>
<p>Does any of this make sense? I hope so.<br />

<p>I think horses are interesting and an amazing species, but American Quarter Horses are highly liked among Americans and over-sea horse-lovers. Lots of horse racers like to have an American Quarter Horse because they are breed to run the quarter mile. These horses have proven themselves what they were breed for. The American Quarter Horse can range from 14.3 to 16 hands in height. They have a wide range of colours also [ any solid ]. A proven fact of these beautiful horses that they can run a quarter mile faster than any other breed. I can't believe in that last discussion the person asked if anyone even liked American Quarter Horses. To me that is just the outrageous comment I have ever heard about horses. In conclusion I think all horses are great horses are like people they have feelings and senses too. They are a very important animal in the world. Nikky Furrie for more comments and information on horses please contact www.stcgirl33@yahoo.com</p>
<p>Um, very nice, but why would some kid's opinion (as opposed to fact) be relevant? QHs are not as popular where people don't ride stock breeds.</p>

<p>This is a really great start on an article, but it seems like a lot of the sentences are ambiguous or unclear. I’ve gone through and tried to fix some ambiguities, like the ones below.</p>
<dl>
<dd>“The versatile Quarter Horses is also shown in English disciplines, driving, and many other horse activities.”</dd>
</dl>
<p>What is this sentence trying to say? That the versatility of the QH is demonstrated by its use in English disciplines? That the “versitile QH” is also used in English discipline? Also, “horse activities” makes me think of the activities horses do on their own, such as eating, rolling in dirt etc (lol), so I’m changing it to “equestrian events.”</p>
<dl>
<dd>“Commonly believed to be the world’s fastest horse…”</dd>
</dl>
<p>Commonly believed by whom? (See WP:CITE) I’ll try to find a citation for this, unless someone already knows of one.</p>
<dl>
<dd>“One of the most famous of these early imports was a <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thoroughbred.html" title="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> grandson of the <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godolphin_Arabian_7586.html" title="Godolphin Arabian">Godolphin Arabian</a>, Janus, foaled in 1746 and imported to colonial Virginia.”</dd>
</dl>
<p>This sentence is unclear: Was Janus foaled in 1746, or was the grandson? Was the Godolphin Arabian named Janus, or was Janus the grandson?</p>
<p>After some research, I’ve reworded it to this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>“One of the most famous of these early imports was Janus, a <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thoroughbred.html" title="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> who was the grandson of the <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godolphin_Arabian_7586.html" title="Godolphin Arabian">Godolphin Arabian</a>. He was foaled in 1746, and imported to colonial Virginia in 1756.”</dd>
</dl>
<p>and hopefully it’s clearer now. I'll keep working on it, and if I've misinterpreted a sentence meaning, please feel free to fix it.<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanyia_c107.html" title="User:Tanyia">Tanyia</a> 19:34, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Looks like some good edits, my earlier edits of what was a complete disaster of an article were only of the most basic "cleanup" variety and I didn't dig too deeply into the overall article to fine-tune some of the weaker spots. I'll look over your changes more carefully and if I see room for improvement will make a few tweaks. I thought I had a cite in there to where QH's have been clocked at 50 mph, but maybe that's on the horse article or the horse racing article...check...seems like I saw the stat on aqha.com <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanabw_340c.html" title="User:Montanabw">Montanabw</a> 23:01, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just looked at AQHA.com to get a citation for "4 million horses wordlwide," but they say there are 3,224,096 horses registered worldwide, so I've changed it. Was the 4 million including something other than the AQHA registered horses? <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETanyia_c107.html" title="User:Tanyia">Tanyia</a> 17:46, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I think technically, an unregistered horse is a "quarter-type" horse and not officially a Quarter Horse--at least, I am sure that's the registry's position. Usually a registerable horse that is not registered is that way for a reason--it's a cull and considered unsuitable for registration (by its breeder, at least). This would be true for any breed. For Wikipedia's purposes, we need to cite verifiable information, so I support using the figures of the AQHA, who, presumably wants there to be as many Quarter horses as possible to boost their claim of being #1.&#160;;-) <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanabw_340c.html" title="User:Montanabw">Montanabw</a> 21:49, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Removed all references to bloodless bullfighting. This is a repeated instance of POV pushing of what is obviously your own personal business. You have repeatedly been violating any number of wikipedia policies with this, across multiple articles, and in absence of citations to verifiable references other than your own self-promotional materials, this material is nothing more than a POV soapbox and business promotion. I really do not wish to submit this issue to formal arbitration, but you really have to let it go. YOU CANNOT PROMOTE YOURSELF ON WIKIPEDIA!!! You must have a neutral point of view. Go fix the bloodless bullfiighting article, list all the breeds you want to there, but leave these breed articles alone, please. There are probably 10 quarter horses in the country that are trick horses or whatever too. We don't put in a laundry list of every last thing you do with horses. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontanabw_340c.html" title="User:Montanabw">Montanabw</a> 04:10, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's called increasing the awareness of what these breeds can do OTHER THAN running around a track or being used for the ranch.</p>
<p>Just an FYI, I am the "3rd party" you are seeking for. This is not my business. I don't make money off these bullfights.... gosh I wish! I'm sure that "once-upon-a-time" long before Wikipedia existed, there's this book called the "encyclopedia", that when certain trends, attributes or what have you in life evolves, changes, or has been known,.... I'm sure that they've re-written it to include these things. It's like our good ol dictionary, when "new" words develop, they add it in there. Words that we consider to be a slang and not a real word, but it still manages to make it into Webster.</p>
<p>In any case, you are being petty about two simple words "bloodless bullfighting". And just because you can't find it while you are googling it DOES NOT mean it doesn't exist. And this is the latest trend in this breed of horse. You wouldn't know because you're not part of the mix.</p>
<p>Well, I'm NOT trying to argue with you here.... just trying to get you to see my point of view. --<a href="../../../p/e/b/User%7EPebs96_42e0.html" title="User:Pebs96">Webmistress Diva</a> 03:35, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think my point has just been demonstrated by your response. Put it in the bullfighting articles. And frankly, if you can't Google it, it probable IS pretty obscure. You can Google almost anything. If you are a "Webmistress" worth your salt, you should know how to make Google work for you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You don't make money off bullfights perhaps, but you clearly are advertising your horses, I've checked the web site, and that is a violation of Wikipedia policy. You also CANNOT be a "third party" on Wikipedia you are the author--that also violates the <a href="../../../n/o/_/WP%7ENo_original_research_1420.html" title="WP:No original research">WP:No original research</a> standard and Wikipedia is not a soapbox standard.</dd>

<p>I'm not obsessed, I'm just a very passionate person. If I was so obsessed, I would be on Wiki everyday, which I'm not. And I didn't say you can't google it.... silly. I said that even if you can't find it, it does not mean that it does not exist. Yes, I am the Webmistress, and true, I can find everything and anyone on the net.... very scary, isn't it. And you're wrong about the horses on the site. I am showing them off. This site is purely hobby..... an expensive one too!</p>
<p>By the way, why aren't you on the list of "arbritrators" to vote on? Isn't that what you do? I was going to vote for you too.
