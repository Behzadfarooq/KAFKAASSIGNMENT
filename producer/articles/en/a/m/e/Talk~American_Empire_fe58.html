<p>"the U.S. is uncontroversially not an empire, because it lacks a legal emperor, king, despot, or other hereditary head of state". S hereditary head of state is in no way a necessity for being an Empire, as our article <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire.html" title="Empire">Empire</a> makes clear. However lacking any other reason to say that the US is "uncontroversially not an Empire" I find it hard ton know what to change this phrase to. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 16:22, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>JereKrischel is correct, the defintion does state that to be an empire you have to have an emporer or emporess. What is interesting is that historically, this is not the case. I was just listen to a lecture series on the British Empire, and Queen Victoria was made an emporeress around the 1890's. No historian would argue that the British empire was not an empire before then. In addition (and please correct me if I am wrong) there were several empires, such as the German and French empires which did not have any royalty at all. Just something to think about. I think JereKrischel contribution should stay.Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 18:46, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><s>DJ Clayworth: You're cutting out the crucial words "in one sense." I would argue that in all important senses the U.S. is an empire - but nevertheless in the sense in which an empire requires an emporer, which is at least one use of the term, the U.S. is not one.</s>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Teach me to respond to the talk page before looking at the article. "One sense" and "another sense" is not very informative, but it's not true to say that "has an emporer" is a more literal definition than "has sovereignty over foreign territory." Both are simple literal definitions of an empire - for the latter, see the reference linked in the article, and remember how "the Empire" in the UK used to refer to just those territories.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Travb: The British empire had a hereditary head of state, the King/Queen. The German empire had a Kaiser. You're right about the French empire, at least 3rd republic and after. <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 04:55, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I thought we already made clear, both in the discussion and the article, that there are three definitions of the word "empire".</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) A <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_jure.html" title="De jure">de jure</a> empire, i.e. a state ruled by an emperor or empress, or that describes itself as an empire.</dd>
<dd>2) A <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_facto.html" title="De facto">de facto</a> empire, i.e. a large and powerful state exerting influence over other countries.</dd>
<dd>3) An empire in the pejorative sense, i.e. an oppressive state that exploits other nations; this is what leftists mean when they say "imperialist".</dd>
</dl>
<p>(I apologise for repeating this, as I've said it before, but I think it's relevant to this question.) What the sentence in question is saying is that the US is uncontroversially not an empire according to definition 1, i.e. it has no emperor or empress. However, the next sentence reads <i>In another sense, the U.S. satisfies the definition of an empire, because it possesses sovereignty over territories which it has not annexed as states, such as Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam and in the past the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and the Philippines.</i> This satisfies definition 2. The main question in the rest of the article is whether or not it satisfies definition 3. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I am not going to argue about How many angels dance on the head of a pin. Although playing the definition game (a very common debate tactic: lawyers use it all the time) has made the article better, I have lost interest in this particular argument.</dd>

<dd><i>Numerous interventions and gunboat diplomacy in Latin America justified by the Monroe Doctrine in countries such as Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua during the late 19th century and early 20th century</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Since Monroe himself is not late 19th Century, you'd think someone would have clued in that "late" is not required here; and I'm thinking of the Nicaraguan campaign; sure it wasn't the US directly, but American adventurists are always proxies, even though Nicaragua didn't wind up as a state (although that was proposed). I'll come back to this to reword the above, and also to add some stuff to <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filibuster_%28military%29.html" title="Filibuster (military)">Filibuster (military)</a> about the post-Nicaragua careers of some of the merc regiments who served there; but the Monroe Doctrine also didn't "justify" anything; it's a purely US policy, not recognized by other powers; but Americans thiknk that it's like Manifest Destiny, something right and valid because God gave America the torch or whatever; so to me, speaking as a non-American, that "justified" word has got to go.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 17:26, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I will; I'm just in the habit of fielding ideas and possible text on Discussion pages first, since my personal writing style is kinda florid and I'm really good at going off on tangents&#160;;-). I'll source the bits above later and add them, as brief as possible; also I'll put in something about US pressure on the British Empire re the <a href="../../../a/r/o/Aroostook_War_cc73.html" title="Aroostook War">Aroostook War</a>, the <a href="../../../o/r/e/Oregon_boundary_dispute.html" title="Oregon boundary dispute">Oregon boundary dispute</a> and the <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska_Boundary_Dispute_5a26.html" title="Alaska Boundary Dispute">Alaska Boundary Dispute</a> - all instances where the US used a threat of war to get its way. Also since the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trail_of_Tears_d650.html" title="Trail of Tears">Trail of Tears</a> is there, the US' wars in the former Oregon Country/Columbia District - the <a href="../../../n/e/z/Nez_Perce_War_362c.html" title="Nez Perce War">Nez Perce War</a>, the <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yakima_War_2734.html" title="Yakima War">Yakima War</a>, the <a href="../../../c/a/y/Cayuse_War_ad6f.html" title="Cayuse War">Cayuse War</a> and the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palouse_War_3506.html" title="Palouse War">Palouse War</a> - all deserve mention, although in terms of the paperwork the area was already American on the map (if not in a practical sense, until these wars were over).<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 22:11, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not to curb your enthuism, but the list here is very limited, in fact I would personally prefer no list here. There is a long list on other pages in this topic: See <a href="../../../a/m/e/Template%7EAmericanEmpire_c8a0.html" title="Template:AmericanEmpire">Template:AmericanEmpire</a> which your very specific examples of American imperialism would be more apt. I work on almost all of them, so you will probably see me there too.</dd>

<dd>I'm going to have to agree with Travb, although there's incidents of U.S. foreign interventions that are not listed, I feel also that its not really necessary to list them all because a simple click will lead to a much more comprehensive list that's far more established and has the necessary citations and peers to maintain it. Also, the Monroe Doctrine although used for imperialist purposes often could be seen as anti-imperialist in nature, it's original purpose to prevent the recolonization of Latin America by Europeans was against imperialism and was nearly a joint declaration with Great Britain so then wouldn't they have accepted it in its original form if they almost made it a joint reply. Good luck editing and don't go too far on a tangent. - <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatman2648_01fe.html" title="User:Patman2648">Patman2648</a> 08:44, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Skookum1 here, starting a new parag because of the multiple indents going on above. Patman said:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>it's original purpose to prevent the recolonization of Latin America by Europeans was against imperialism and was nearly a joint declaration with Great Britain so then wouldn't they have accepted it in its original form if they almost made it a joint reply.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>That's not what we (Canadians) were taught, nor what I remember being said by British diplomatic historians (<a href="../../../a/j/p/AJP_Taylor_111d.html" title="AJP Taylor">AJP Taylor</a>, for one; others I'd have to think what else I'd read), nor any retrospective in our papers/media that might address the Doctrine. Britain was very averse to the US declaration except insofar as it discouraged other Great Powers from meddling in Mexico, but never did they endorse the Doctrine; which for it part was worded carefully so as to exclude relations with Canada or the British Caribbean; and Washington was careful never to invoke it in that regard, although it remains popular myth (only in the United States, and US-originated Wikipedia pages) that the Monroe Doctrine mad something to do with the Oregon and Alaska boundary disputes and the US' assertion of outright ownership to 54-40; but that's not the case, as Britain/the British Empire was exempted from the Doctrine by, as I understood it, careful wording. This also concerns Alaska as well as <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Pierre_and_Miquelon_98af.html" title="St. Pierre and Miquelon">St. Pierre and Miquelon</a>, although France retains the latter; in Alaska's case the Russians could just as well have sold Russian America to Britain, had they so chosen to; it was not a former colony, it was still a colony. Likewise with the British Caribbean and the remaining Dutch and French Caribbean (and S Am of course). So on the one hand you have Britain accepting and even endorsing it (according to the one USian story I'm hearing here) and on the other you have it being used in territorial aggrandizement against Britain (as explained). Interesting also that it wasn't invoked in the case of <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Riel_1dd7.html" title="Louis Riel">Louis Riel</a>'s declaration of a new republic and accompanying rebellions, given that he actively sought US support for it (see <a href="http://www.dickshovel.com/two.html" class="external free" title="http://www.dickshovel.com/two.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dickshovel.com/two.html</a> and two2.html for more on that).

<p>The map basically just shows the Americas and the British Empire with a few other european states. It suggests that by virtue of an alliance with the UK the Americas in some way controlled the British Empire or was a part of it in 1958. I wouldn't warrant its removal but perhaps this needs to be explained more or the map ammended to show the US and Allies in green perhaps, and its allies colonies as well as its own colonies in two seperate colours. It currently appears that africa was a US colony in the 1958 picture because of this. Equally, note how the UK and Argentina are shown in green on the 1982 map. Lest we forget that Argentina and the UK fought a war over the falkland islands in 1982 ending diplomatic relationships between the two. This kind of detail is mis represented on the map as it seems to suggest all these nations in green/blue are united under one alliance. I find it highly misleading without further explanation of what the map ACTUALLY shows.</p>
<p>I think also this article may benefit from being flagged as a controversial and disputed topic. I personally wouldn't agree that the US is an empire in any sense and I think this view would be supported elsewhere to. However I praise the fact that its explained that the US is not in everyones view an empire, and to flag the article as controversial would reinforce that this concept of an 'American Empire' is a controversial and somewhat isolated one. Infact the USA has always been fairly isolationist until recent years in the opinion of many historians.</p>
<p>My view on this article is that in its current state it doesn't help anyone better understand anything, and thus on an encycolpedic level is fairly useless. However it does have potentinal with a few key changes and ammendments. - Ogricken</p>

<p>I have a number of problems with the section entitled as above. First, the title doesn't completely make sense. Secondly, the attribution of postcolonialist, postmodern and globalization theory to Hardt and Negri is not really true - altho the links to Foucault, Deleuze and autonomism are. Third, it underemphasises the massiveness of the difference between Hardt and Negri's position and the idea of an American empire.

<dd>Hardt and Negri are a problem with the organization of this article, because it uses a three-way categorization derived from Stuart Creighton Miller into which they don't really fit. The categorization also has problems dealing with open advocates of American empire like Niall Ferguson, etc. However, if we abandon it, anything we replace it with is likely to be controversial, and won't have a reliable academic source to give it credibility.</dd>
<dd>The attribution of postcolonialism, postmodernism, and globalization theory is literally true, because it uses the phrase "builds on," which could mean anything, but you're right that it's imprecise. If it's removed, those terms should still be mentioned nearby, because there are a lot of other people within those vague areas who hold positions similar to Hardt and Negri in that they believe there was once something like an American empire, but we have passed it for some new sort of structure of domination.</dd>

<p>I does not appear that the word empire is defined well enough for this article to have much merit. There was a deeper meaning to imperium, the origin of the word, than what it currently means today. The conquest of other nations and ethnicities, existence of an emperor, or presence of supreme authority is only one plain of power.</p>
<p>According to Tragedy and Hope by Carroll Quigley, the Greco-Roman world he called Classical Civilization had no concept of separation of religion, state, or commerce. All were deemed the exclusive power of whatever government existed, republic, polis, imperium did not matter. An imperium was government that controlled spiritual, financial, and military affairs. The notion of government being separate was impossible. What freedom existed was only social, but not commercial as it is in Hong Kong, or religious as it is in most of the Western world today. At one point people had to worship their emperor as god in Rome, just like in Egypt and Sumer.</p>
<p>Is America an empire? Not by ancient definition. The separation of church and state, and the free economy would have to be complete usurped for that to be applicable. But my modern definitions the name would not be inappropriate, as long as America continues to influence and police other countries. Whether that is good or bad remains irrelevant to the word, as empires are generally both or neither. Even if the United States began to add more states and commonwealths to its Union under the current government, no real imperial power would exist.</p>
<p>But if the United States adopts an official religion, as well as assume total power over commerce and finance, then indeed we might see the rise of a true empire in the ancient sense. Many barriers would have to be broken for this to happen. A major invasion to ossify the people as 9/11 did on a much smaller scale, a breakdown of the separation of church and state (possibly elevating atheism or agnosticism to a dogmatic and fanatical state as the Soviets had done), and the obvious changing of the constitution and elimination of any state sovereignty. <a href="../../../j/c/c/User%7EJcchat66_6a5e.html" title="User:Jcchat66">Jcchat66</a> 05:36, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I concur with your view that it is not an empire. I would also like to add that classically an empire stretches distance, although not a specific or quantafiable criteria it is none the less valid of an empire. However the US is effectivley contiguous with itself with only two or three minor exceptions like a) alaska and b) hawaii. Take the British Empire for example (the architypal and largest empire in history) which spanned immense distances and was most certainly NOT contiguous with itself. The only control the US has over other sovereign nations is political, that alone does not warrant it to be termed an empire. Putting political pressure on a sovereign nation doesn't make one an emporeur. The British Empire did this to many sovereign nations including Germany...it was one of the contributing factors to WWI. I strongly move that this article be flagged as a disputed topic as many people have voiced concerns over its highly dubious logic and reasoning in calling the US an 'American Empire', down to the very term 'American Empire'...America is two seperate continents...The USA is a nation, they should NOT be confussed.- Ogricken</dd>

<dd>You're thinking only in terms of modern Empires; the immediate example that comes to mind is the Athenian Empire, so-called, which entirely consisted of one sovereign nation (<i>poleis</i>) putting political pressure on others and bringing them to heel (the members of the "alliance"-cum-empire were all theoretically sovereign <i>poleis</i> themselves (er, that's not the right plural; my ancient Greek is rusty...). Similarly the Roman Empire included proxy states, as did the British as well as Napoleon's and Hitler's...and Alexander's and Genghis', too; and the Chinese Empire was all about putting power on neighbouring kings/emperors, whether it was the Dalai Lama or the kings of Thailand, Vietnam, Korea etc. The idea of a contiguous polity (even if contiguous is joined by sea, as with the British, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Danish and Swedish empires... and the Japanese one, too) being a defining paramater is a bit of a modern conceit rooted in ideas of the nation-state. The empires of Carlos V, the Athenians, and more were NOT rooted in anything resembling a nation-state-turned-empire as seems to be the onus being placed on the term "American Empire" here.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 20:27, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whic ancient definition is that? A definition that had to do with unity of church and state? Look, that ONLY applied in relation to the Roman (pagan and Christian empires) and not really anyone else. OK, OK, the Egyptian pharaohs, of course, but it's their model the Roman Emperors were partly emulating (as well as Alexander's, born demigod that he was and all...but he never imposed a state religion, either). The Holy Roman Empire also contained a separation between church and state (i.e. the dynasty), although there was a lot of intermixing (the appointment of dynastic scions as archbishops and cardinals, for example); it was only in the Eastern Orthodox Christian Empires were state and church were truly inseparable (the Byzantine and Russian Empires); but even there the church was at the heel of the Emperor, not the other way around as the Popes preferred to have it in the West (but rarely got their way).<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 21:06, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am going by the definition of imperium as studied by Carroll Quigley in his book Tragedy and Hope. Since I own the book I have no online citations, but I’m sure a Google search will bring something up. The word had more meaning than just empire as defined today, as the ancient world perceived it much differently then. As you mentioned, the Eastern empires like Byzantium and Russia are examples of church, state, and commerce being under the power of the government, though certainly not as complete or absolute as the case with the pharaohs and Sumerian city-states. The Japanese Empire, and most of its history, does seem to correlate more with a Sumerian-pharaonic system, as the emperor was also deemed the spiritual leader of the people. All empires, no matter how much power the emperor has, puts responsibilities upon its lesser governors and provincial leaders, so that has no bearing on the meaning. The healthiest empires naturally creates a balance between the crown and the autonomy of the regional authority, otherwise the Ottoman Empire, with its many diverse cultures, would have collapsed long before it had.</p>
<p>If America is to be deemed an empire, then it would be more like the Athenian or British empires, as neither was an imperium. The Athenians Empire evolved from the Delian League, which was very much like the modern League of Nations or United Nations. So it would not be too far a stretch to see America’s power increase substantially by way of the UN today, as it does finance most of its funding as Athens did with the Delian League.</p>
<p>Oh, and please leave the “use of the word American” to that other Wiki debate raging out of control. I have already asserted that America is the proper name of a country, as per the Articles of Confederation, in addition to it being the name of two continents. “American Empire” is completely valid, especially since all of Latin America would most likely be conquered first if it did become a true imperium, for military and strategic reasons. <a href="../../../j/c/c/User%7EJcchat66_6a5e.html" title="User:Jcchat66">Jcchat66</a> 22:44, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't have much to add to this argument. I think I am simply burned out by it. Every few weeks someone comes along, usually an American, but sometimes not, and says, America isn't an empire, so therefore this article doesn't have merit, etc. They all play the definition game, or variations on it. Most, like the users above, never seem to read past the introduction, or selectively ignore sections, where three conflicting points are made:

<li>America is an empire, yes.</li>
<li>America was once an empire.</li>
<li>America never was an empire.</li>

<p>I don't think anyone here is saying "American isn't an empire so therefore this article shouldn't exist" - But they are saying that they personally, and several of the historians have disagreed with it. It seems so be a significant number of people who aren't in any level of agreement here. <b>This article NEEDS to be flagged as a disputed topic ASAP</b>. What does it tell you if every few weeks/days someone comes here and raises these points - there is clearly a high level of disagreement over the fundamental concepts of this article. I find it to be of a highly dubious nature to suggest that the US constitutes anything more than a sovereign nation as any control it has over other soveriegn states is purely economic or political. Imposing a level political infulence over a sovereign nation doesn't constitute an empire. There are serious fundamental misunderstandings here as to what actually is 'an empire'. This article currently lacks any positive encyclopedic qualities, and on an encylopedic level is misleading and therefore of use to NO ONE. As I raised earlier the map is an absolute farce for one thing, it suggests that Africa was in someway part of a giant US empire. It suggests that all of the nations shown are in some singular alliance and that they are all diplomatically active with each other when this is not the case. I'm absolutely stunned this article has made it this far without being flagged. - Ogricken</p>

In fact, you ignore that there are three, distinct arguments in this article, including your own--that empire never existed--(which Miller says most historians disagree with). The problem is not the balance of the article, because there are clearly three point of view here, it is not the encyclopedic nature of the article, because this is one of the most well referenced articles on wikipedia, the problem is that (it appears) you want only one argument presented: your own. That America is a "beacon on the hill" And you appear intolerant of other's views.

<p>I'm working on a total re-wording of the opening paragraph to clearly identify the views held there in. I've flagged it as POV for the reasons above but to save you some scroll bar action it was because the article is full of weasel words, improperly identified opinion and is (I hate to say it) over citated in an attempt to add credibility to it. With some contributors using their citations as solid fact... Just because Noam Chomsky said it doesn't make it a fact and although I have no problem with such sources being cited, they need to be given in context as opinions not a factual basis for the confirmation of an American Empire. Note how the Oxford English language dictionary is cited...twice!? The article generally smacks of people (usually Americans) editing it in small chunks which has made it bity and uncohesive. I can honestly say, I dont think this article would be of any use, absolutely none at all, to anyone researching modern America, the concept of an American Empire or any of the concepts discussed in its present form.</p>
<p>I'm sorry some people feel i'm being harsh as many 'wikipedians have contributed hundres of hours to this article' but there efforts aren't good enough.

<dd>Empire means others are subjegated. Subjegation, of course, does not have to be by force. And subjegation means some kind of slavery. I would say when political units, as opposed to individuals, are subjegated, <i>that</i> is empire.</dd>

<dd>To say that "empire" is dishonorable is too rigid. Though slavery is certainly dishonorable in that it convinces a person that they are unfree to act on their own, that is not the same as subjugation. Empires can form in many ways, most notably as a response to hostilities initiated by others. It is not always greed or the desire for more land and slaves, but the desire for peace that drove many of the more advanced empires. Once a nation conquers another out of necessity, however, it is like a bear tasting human flesh for the first time. Power is craved thereafter. The act of defending a nation by routing the source of the warmongers entirely results in power. And power corrupts.</dd>

<dd>"Ethnic studies professor Ward Churchill is almost alone, however, in extending this critique further to argue that at least some of the victims of the 9/11 attacks - the "little Eichmanns" who "formed a technocratic corps at the very heart of the US' global financial empire – the 'mighty engine of profit' to which the military dimension of U.S. policy has always been enslaved" - deserved their fates."</dd>

<dd>It seems a valid citation - Churchill is not be critiqued, he is being quoted, showing a point of view that exists regarding the American Empire.

<p>I removed the "Quote" section from the article, but it was restored. That quote isn't even a famous quote by any notable person... it's just a line from a magazine editorial. Surely it must be possible for the idea behind the quote to be expressed by prose elsewhere in the text rather than copied verbatim in its own section. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCoffee_bcb6.html" title="User:TheCoffee">Coffee</a> 23:45, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>User:TheCoffee thanks for your work on this article, and pointing this out. For example, in articles such as <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colombian_Armed_Conflict_ff6d.html" title="Colombian Armed Conflict">Colombian Armed Conflict</a>, with ten quotes, there are so many quotes that the quotes deserve their own section. I usually add a quotes section hoping that other people, over time, will add more quotes, even quotes which are contrary to my own POV. Since this quote has been orphaned and alone at the very bottom of the article for so long (months and months), I moved it up to the relevant section, when you intuitively point this problem out.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In your studies, if you find relevant quotes which can be included in this article, please don't hestiate to add them. Maybe someday we can restore the quotes section, but for now, I agree with you that there is no point in this one quote having its own section. I look forward to your future edits and continued hard work. Best wishes, Travb (<a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETravb_6387.html" title="User talk:Travb">talk</a>) 17:02, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have a new organizational plan. I'm going to move Hardt and Negri to the "heart of U.S. policy" section, in a new subsection entitled "theories of empire." 2 reasons. First, I have a source for a new subclassification - a talk by Ashley Smith, a left-wing journalist, for which audio should soon be available online. He divides theories of the U.S. as an empire into 5 general versions: liberal 'it's the neo-cons', social-democrat or right-isolationist 'military-industrial complex', traditonal Leninist 'universal effect of monopoly capitalism', Hardt &amp; Negri-ite, and U.S.-centric 'super-imperialism'. I think that would be useful to include, though at only slightly more length. Second, I recently learned that Hardt himself has written that the Iraq War shows we are not yet out of the age of 'imperialism' and into the age of 'Empire', but only beginning the transition. I'll do this when the talk shows up online and I have more time. But first, any comments? <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 18:48, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is a really ambitious page and one that you should be commended for. One important note, however: have you considered differentiating between "empire" and "imperialism" in the standard (e.g., not H&amp;N) sense? These are, in my view, two separate categories. The first refers to a form of political organization, the second to an ideology and/or policy of expansion through some combination of subordination of previously independent polities and colonization. Regardless, a good essay on the subject of American Empire that you might want to look at is <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060701fareviewessay85416a/alexander-j-motyl/empire-falls.html" class="external text" title="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060701fareviewessay85416a/alexander-j-motyl/empire-falls.html" rel="nofollow">Alex Motyl's "Empire Falls"</a>--DN 07:05, 5 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That distinction is alluded to in the article, in the section on the definition of empire. As that section should make clear, this is really an article on U.S. imperialism, but since "empire" is slightly less loaded, "American Empire" parallels the titles of articles on earlier empires, and very few people keep strictly to the distinction between an imperialistic state and an empire anyway, the article goes with "empire" where possible.</dd>
<dd>I've seen that Foreign Affairs essay before and I'm not a fan. Motyl is disingenuous about how power can be exercized to the extent that I have a hard time believing even he takes his argument seriously. Take the following, one of the only criticisms he makes of the traditional military-economic imperialism thesis (which he tends to unfairly conflate with the "cultural imperialism" thesis):
<dl>
<dd><i>U.S. military bases dot the world and may facilitate Washington's bullying, but they would be indicative of empire only if they were imposed and maintained without the consent of local governments.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Please. Isn't the point of the power to bully that it allows one to obtain expressed consent? If the local governments did not consent, that would be a state of war, not an empire. More generally, the fact that control is maintained through proxies is a sign of strength of an empire, not evidence against its existence (if of course control is really maintained). The Roman empire did so, usually; the British empire did so, in the early part of the 19th century when it was effectively unchallenged in global supremacy. Proxy rule is cheaper. Direct rule is historically usually a last resort to prevent losing control to locals or another empire, occuring most commonly in periods of competition like the Scramble for Africa. You can see the dynamic today in Iraq, where the Bush administration wanted to install a friendly government and leave only a few permanent military bases, but has been forced by the insurgency to maintain an indefinite full military occupation.</dd>
<dd>Well, anyway. Off to work on the article...&#160;;) <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 16:13, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My problem with your answer, which isn't necessarily impossible to defend, is that you claim to be surveying different positions on US empire, yet your schools of thought do not cover important existing alternatives. Motyls argues (see the Empire page) that the US has engaged in imperialism, but still rejects some of the claims about American Empire you discuss (basing policy, etc.) on clear analytic grounds. You may not agree with Motyl, but that does not mean he's being "disingenuous" (for the record, he's not being disingenuous; this is the position he comes to after a great deal of thought on the matter). Specifically, you arguably conflate indirect/direct rule with indirect/direct <i>influence</i>. Motyl's position is that none of the examples commonly used to describe American empire fall under the category of <i>indirect rule</i> at all; he elaborates the position in his <i>Comparative Politics</i> review of Ferguson and Hardt and Negri. For the record, I disagree with him (and say so in a forthcoming article-length treatment of the question of American Empire), but the issue hinges on what threshold we use to describe a relationship as one of rule not, to repeat myself, on the indirect/direct distinction -- --DN 22:04, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Following through the same objective LOGIC of this and other related articles - should there not be a link to an article of the form 'white imperialism'? I believe that previous conflicts and present current day conflicts warrant an analysis that is very much in the spirit of observing the similarities of America's undue influence throughout the globe and how this is concommittant with wars whost outcomes determine racial survival (for example, the Vietnam war, and also the Iraqi war - both of which have/had strong racial elements to them that determine the capabilities of respective peoples in regards to survival).

<dd>I guess I was curious if the arguments for imperialism were 'invertible' or 'fuzzy'. I mean does 'imperialism' truly have necessary properties such that if they were removed then imperialism is removed or is it a family resemblence concept-- what is the nature of the boundary between being imperial and not. Im not sure what the article impact is since I got one vote for ACGI with a qualified B,E.

<p>a world map of the countries which USA has occupied/protected via its military would explain better. past and present examples like Vietnam and Iraq etc. <a href="../../../i/d/l/User%7EIdleguy_eb71.html" title="User:Idleguy">Idleguy</a> 12:12, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I changed some wording -- in a minor sense. I took out "(see: Commies)" after the phrase "New Left" in one of the earlier sections of the Article. It's a biased observation of the ideology of the New Left and shouldn't be in a Wikipedia entry.</p>

<p>While this maybe a page about American Imperialism in general, I think it would do good to include references on the American Imperial adventure in the Philippines.</p>

<p>Since Russian territorial aquistions in Central Asia (for example) are considered imperialist, I suggest we should apply same logic to Mexican-American War to avoid double standarts.

<p>I have updated the map - it was based on a map by Clevelander that didn't take into account the very difficult relationship between France and NATO (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO</a> )</p>
<p>I believe that the honest coloring of the map would reflect this with a medium blue for France, especially since Sweden and ROI are shown in an extra light blue.</p>

<dd>I think this update is incorrect though. I think France SHOULD be included as full time NATO ally.</dd>
<dd>1st, because it only quit the NATO military command but officially stayed in NATO as a political entity (and we are talking about politics, not military here)</dd>
<dd>2nd, because it only did so in 1967, and before that it was a full-time ally.</dd>
<dd>Sweeden and ROI are shown in extra light blue because they were not allies per se, but they were part of American-led Marshal Plan/OEEC/OECD organization.</dd>
<dd>I reverted the map and put France back in NATO for now. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Kami888 (<a href="../../../k/a/m/User_talk%7EKami888_e547.html" title="User talk:Kami888">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kami888_b768.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kami888">contribs</a>) 21:43, 15 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>But this page is not about NATO membership. The NATO dispute simply outlines the issues regarding France. France's socialism always pulled it towards the Soviet bloc. France was a key US ally during the second world war, but with regards to the cold war, it cannot honestly be described as such! I maintain that the map: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Anti-Communist-Block.png" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Anti-Communist-Block.png" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Anti-Communist-Block.png</a> would be more accurate</dd>

<p>I'm not going to change the map again, but given that it is disputed, I'm going to change the text underneath it. It looks highly official, and has the authoratitive statement "Map showing key US allies during the Cold War."</p>
<p>The fact is that the map is a subjective analysis by a Wikipedia user. Such a thing is highly controversial. There are states there that are certainly more blue than "gray", and vice versa. It puts in black and white (or gray and blue) things that are a lot more complicated.</p>
<p>I've changed the title to "User-submitted map indicating key US allies during the Cold War."</p>
<p>It would be better to have references to US government documents. Then the title could say "Map showing key US allies during the Cold War."</p>
<p>Deipnosopher 22:27, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I've fixed it. "User" has no meaning in this context. If you believe the map is in violation of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> (which it may well be, I have no idea), why not bring it to <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a>? That'd be the appropriate place to deal with it. Or the map's talk page. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 16:38, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>WilyD, the description of the image is misleading. It does not reflect official US policy, and that should be reflected in the description of the image. Prepending the word "unofficial" is not editorialising. Deipnosopher 22:11, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>That's simply not true. The word <i>unofficial</i> is there to lead the reader to a conclusion. The map doesn't pretend to reflect any official list, nor is there any implication that it's somehow official. The description without qualifiers is neutral. If you think the map is wrong, discuss it at the map's talk, or nominate it for deletion. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 22:40, 17 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The word 'unofficial' is precisely so that the reader is not led to the false conclusion that the map is academically sound. The map itself is unreferenced information. I am trying to find some way to express that fact. I don't want the map deleted; it is useful. But I would prefer that it was referenced academic information. I will add a citation needed tag, although I suspect you will also find that unacceptable. Deipnosopher 12:35, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Academically sound things are unofficial all the time (and conversly, official things are often academically unsound). If you have a <i>content</i> dispute with the map, you should really take it up on the map's talk page. Stuff tagged with "citation needed" usually gets deleted after a bit ... I'm kind of lost on what you're trying to do, so I'm not sure how you'll feel about that. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 15:38, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Indeed! It should be one or the other though - academically sound <i>or</i> official, despite the failings of each. Surely the research could be done. Or perhaps if it's too hard for the State Dept. to come up with such a map, it's too hard for Wikipedia too</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure, the map is controversial, and so is more than half of material here on Wikipedia. That's no reason to put "citation needed" there though, if you feel like the map is incorrect, you are free to explain your point of view here and correct it. Of course there is no official list of all US allies besides official political blocs like NATO, SEATO, and CENTO, but including only the members of those blocs on the map would not be sufficient for the topic this map strives to illustrate. I made this map similar to the map in "Soviet Empire" article, and originally I described it as "Map showing key US allies during the Cold War in blue and other states US believed to be friendly in light blue", which, I believe, was more accurate than just "Map showing key US allies" because it reflected the fact that many of those light-blue countries were not officially allied to United States or not allied at all. I ask that "citation needed" thing be removed, and caption changed to reflect the purpose of the map more broadly than just "key US allies". -- Kami888</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of France... Yes, France did have certain Socialist elements, one could say, French Communist Party was rather strong, and France was one of the few NATO countries which maintained relatively normal relations with USSR. Yet France WAS, despite all this, a key American ally in Europe during the entire Cold War, even when the American troops were forced to withdraw. My intention was to reserve the dark blue color for official US allies (which France was), and lighter blue to unofficial US allies (which France wasn't). Therefore, I believe France should stay as dark blue. But I am not categorical in this - if you really feel like there is a need to reflect the Franco-American relations better than they currently are reflected, feel free to make necessary modifications and perhaps change the meaning that "dark blue" color stands for. On a related note, I'd appreciate if someone added a small legent to the map itself, explaining the colors. --Kami888</p>
