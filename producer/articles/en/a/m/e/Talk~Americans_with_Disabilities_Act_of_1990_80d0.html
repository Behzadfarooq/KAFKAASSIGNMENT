<hr />
<p>I fully intend to summarize each section and provide a number of cases that are important to the implementation of this act. For this reason, I removed the remarks about public accommodations, which are only a small part of this act, but the most visible. Further, public accomodation has to be defined and this is not that simple. I ask that everyone be patient, or base their entries on the act itself and other "ADA" documents. The most important recent case, here, is one decided this year, that, incredibly enough, the Supreme Court, by one vote, found that the states immune from lawsuits against them under the ADA. This means that if a state facility is inaccessible to a job applicant and he cannot work there, he cannot sue on the grounds of discrimination. If the same thing happened at a city faility, or even, your public library, that would be grounds for a suit. That was one step backward, that was provided by the courts. They may be forced to act, but not necessarily in everyone's best interest.</p>
<hr />
<p>I added the link to the law itself, but if you intend (as seems apparent) to wikify the whole text of the law that would of course be much better. The public accommodations part may be a "small part" (by some measure) of the law, but it is indeed very visible and often talked about, and should be prominently mentioned in the article for precisely that reason; perhaps saying exactly that would be best, e.g., "a small but controversial part of the law..." etc. I will "be patient" as you suggest and let you finish before commenting further.</p>
<p>I share your revulsion at the very concept of "sovereign immunity" on which the decision you mention was based. It has led to many greater injustices than discrimination as well.---- I am not entering the entire law here. It is available on line. I am trying rather to summarzie the 5 titles and later offer the most important or controversial decsions that have resulted from lawsuits, orders by the doj, eeoc, etc., under each title. Also, I intend to put up a page on how to make an ADA complaint, which is much easier than most people think. I am actually working from paper copies of all relevant laws which I have had for, well, 10 years, including The Fair Housing Act, the Rehabilitation Act, etc. Since 1990, bodies like the Architextural Guidelines Board have been established. Their regulations take up many books, are quite technical, and probably not of interest to the average reader. They can simply be linked to, as I believe they are online too.</p>

<p>"The ADA is notable because many disparate groups, many of which had never worked before..." C,mon if this article is not biased then my name is Jim Crow. Lets have some real information on the act, what it entails, and who it effects. Such information as the "undue hardship clause" or what the act considers disabled would be appropiate. 137.71.23.54 05:50, 2 March 2006 (UTC) John Titancloud</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, this article is not very neutral. It seems to me that it's taken from a critical standpoint of the act. I'm not one to rewrite it, as I do not know much about it (I merely found it when editing supreme court cases), but I do think the neutrality of this does need to be looked into. <a href="../../../%5E/d/e/User%7E%5Edemon.html" title="User:^demon">^demon</a>, 22:06, March 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think the criticism presented is generally valid, although it needs to be toned down a bit, and balanced with a discussion of views in support of the ADA. The ADA is still one of the most controversial parts of American law.</p>

<dd>On that topic, does the 'political support' section really needed to be included? If so, it should probably be edited for NPOV (i.e. if it's supported by the "political Left", why is it opposed by the "political Right"?) Is this even still accurate/relevant? <a href="../../../a/s/c/User%7EAsciident_0317.html" title="User:Asciident">asciident</a>, 20:33 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Dudes, this article is not neutral. Somebody should revise it to be more balanced or remove the criticism, which is overlarge. Rhombus 6 April 2007</p>
<p>The large majority of this article is over the controversy and criticism, not about the Act or what the Act grants. Claiming that the Act makes a haven for "professional plaintiffs" is not in the best interest of an article that is about the act and its provisions itself. Moreover, the supporters section has more information and justification on the detractors of the bill than its supporters, adding to a growing trend of a bias against the Act in this article. More information needs to be added about the Act itself and/or its benefits to balance the article, or much of the criticism/controversy section should be deleted. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOffkilter_bb51.html" title="User:Offkilter">offkilter</a></p>
<p>Well, I believe that the criticism here is Netrual POV, BUT...the ratio of introduction to criticism makes the article POV. Removing the criticism makes the article to short, so therefore an additional section(such as ACCOMPLISHMENTS/History) would be nice instead of "here is its name, why its bad, and oh.. here is one link with all the text of the act...have fun" Just my 2 pennies. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All%28MTG%29_f816.html" title="User:Voice of All(MTG)">Voice of All(MTG)</a> 23:35, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am disabled, but somewhat critical of this act. In fact the criticisms mentioned I mostly agree with to varying degrees. That said that isn't the whole story of it. Right now the article is not very informative at all. I'm not very knowledgeable in the ADA debates though, many disabled people aren't, so I don't feel comfortable trying to fix it just yet.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<p>I'm hoping that my addition of groups who worked to pass ADA will help swing it in the NPOV direction, as it shows the large amount of support for it. (By the way, it's an incomplete list -- those were just the most active players, according to my source).

<dd>What this article needs is a good description and a lot more information. The criticisms are valid, but the article is so short and crappy that the criticisms take up most of it. What it needs is someone who really knows about the law and can describe all of the relevant issues - the cost of low-floor vehicles in comparison to high-floor ones, for example. That's why I came to this article. I'm generally very much opposed to this sort of act, but I'd like to have a lot more information about its specifics, the provisions, requirements, mandates, etc. The specifics. <a href="../../../k/n/u/User%7EKnuckle50_884a.html" title="User:Knuckle50">Knuckle50</a> 15:31, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually a lot of the criticisms aren't valid (as far as Wikipedia is concerned anyways) because they're original research/unsourced, and tend to use <a href="../../../w/e/a/WP%7EWEASEL_bba5.html" title="WP:WEASEL">weasel words</a> ("some believe", "others complain"). I wish I knew more about it (it was actually part of the reason I came here), but I don't. If I find some reliable info elsewhere I might try and rewrite parts of this, but I'd rather someone with a better legal background worked on it. —Locke Cole • <a href="../../../l/o/c/User_talk%7ELocke_Cole_92ea.html" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Locke_Cole_6f88.html" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 15:37, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The criticisms which I added to this page were a paraphrase of the articles in Linda Krieger's book (cited in References). Of course, I should have provided specific page cites, but that was before I learned how to do WP footnotes using the ref and note notation.

<p>I added four references to what seem to be some of the most cited evaluations of the ADA and tried to write a neutral summary.

<p>I am not really sure how to use this. I like the changes Amead.

<p>Regarding the article as an overview of the ADA, it provides a useful reference for the basic structure, criticisms, and basis of the law. However, with regard to specific details it was lacking as a representation of the law as passed by congress. In my research on this site for government actions I have seen many well written articles. If a section detailing the history preceding the law and statistics on its effects were including it would provide great factual help. As for NPOV, by representing the view points of both the propponents of the law and the opponents (Congress members, lobbyists), and structuring extant and future view point content under these headings, both views could be represented, allowing readers to make informed decisions with all sides in mind on this law, which encompasses a still largely unresolved and controversial issue. In this way cntent and POV concerns could be addressed while expanding the use of the article. 69.250.51.226 05:41, 8 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi! I am new to Wikipedia. I know quite a bit about the ADA and I think I have a pretty balanced view. This article needs a lot of work. When I have an opportunity, I hope to continue working on this article to make it one of the best articles on wikipedia.--Travelingman 04:53, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am disabled. At birth, I was stricken with spina bifida, a very severe spinal affliction that relegates most to either crutches or a wheelchair, and usually causes any level of learning disability or mental retardation (luckily I am not in the latter group). Personally, I witness daily blind and unflagging support of the ADA, due in large part to some people's unwillingness to speak what they actually feel, because they don't want to "step on our toes". I fear this article is slowly going in that direction. Although the references begin to address this, I would love to see a list of links to detractors, just like there's that loooooong list of "Groups who worked to pass the ADA". It would be a lot clearer than sifting through the references.</p>
<p>Also, neutralize the language a bit. I like Wikipedia for its NPOV, but the article is too far in support of the ADA withough giving space to the detractors.</p>
<p>"The late Justin Dart worked tirelessly, travelling to all 50 States, to bring these many groups together in common cause." Tirelessly?!?! Sappy, and very npov (Pro ADA).</p>
<p>"Criticism The ADA is frequent target of criticism. For example, conservatives claim that lesser disabilities including clinical depression or minor neck or back pain (see neuropathy) are being accommodated when they should not be. Second, the ADA allegedly creates a class of "professional plaintiffs" who make a living out of collecting monetary damages from noncompliant businesses." Those dang conservatives.</p>
<p>On the bright side, this article does mention how the ADA collides with capitalism. I do appreciate that.</p>

<p>I don't understand the following placement of neuropathy:</p>
<p>"Criticism The ADA is frequent target of criticism. For example, conservatives claim that lesser disabilities including clinical depression or minor neck or back pain (see neuropathy) are being accommodated when they should not be."</p>
<p>Why is neuropathy placed in brackets after back pain? Perhaps this is a typo? I use a power chair, can only walk a couple of steps, have little use of my right arm or hand, I have weak trunk support, bladder and bowel difficulties etc. etc. etc. because of neuropathy. Neuropathy affects everything in my body. This is not a lesser disability. And guess what! I have no back pain!</p>

<p>Pardon my lack of sophistication with the Wikipedia. I am a law student, and what I am about to say is nothing more than a rant, although I must point out that the discussion page is a perfectly acceptable place to put such material, since it futhers academic discuission on the subject. I need accommodations for AD/HD, but under the current state of the law, the ADA is reserved for the "super-disabled" only. The ADA is a mess. A conservative supreme court has made sure that I will not be able to follow my dream to the best of my ability, and there is a very real chance that I will fail out. Just like the UPS driver without perfect sight, or the Airline pilot who is disabled but unable to fly affter she fixes her disability (see the circularity here?) I have been squeezed out of the ADA. I cannot recieve accommodations because I am not "disabled enough". Does anyone have an answer to my problem? I think the solution is to shift the burden onto society, i.e. the ruling classes who make up these laws, and have it be said that they fail to accommodate persons who are not fully functional.</p>

<p>I don't understand how substance abuse and transsexuality could be considered disabilities. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.17.217.200_a251.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.17.217.200">70.17.217.200</a> (talk) 23:47, 6 February 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
<p>"The ADA is frequent target of criticism. For example, some claim that lesser disabilities including clinical depression or minor neck or back pain (see neuropathy) are being accommodated when they should not be." Who has the right to determine "lesser" and "greater" disabilities? I have severe clinical depression, and although it is episodic, it can leave me completely disabled for months and even years at a time. We all have different struggles, and I would hope that we would join together for support rather than exluding those who may not look disabled.</p>

<p>I was found disabled as of July of 2003. I wasn't declared disabled until Oct. 2005...And yes it took that long to have a hearing to determine my disability. During which time child support arears increased. No court would modify child support until I got my hearing. Now the State of GA. wants to charge me TWICE the amount that i received in back pay. My children(who live with there mother)have drawn back pay for this time period also and are currently drawing checks under my disablilty. The State of GA refuses to go back to the date I was found disabled. They will only go back to the date of my hearing. Which means I owe $37,289.00 in back child support. I noticed the post here slam the ADA... Can anyone of you tell me this is fair treatment? Or can you say that some ADA rules don't cover what they truely need to? And yes,this is a real story. If you would like to post back with legal advice or with any tips on how to solve this problem, Please do so..... (70.187.95.67 20:56, 5 April 2007 (UTC))</p>
