<dd>Please read the 60 minutes article. This is not a "group" nor does it "accredit" schools. It is set up by one man for one fake school, Hamilton (now Richardson University). This should be merged. Unless you have an independent source that is group (ie contradicts the 60 Minutes investigation) it is part of the Hamilton article. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 09:59, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are other reasons why this article should remain separate of Hamilton. Its either a front and/or back by numerious other organizations and even some religious ones. The article can be used as a focal point to all of them. Hamilton is only one part of this. --<a href="../../../s/g/r/User%7ESgrayban_0d5b.html" title="User:Sgrayban">Scott Grayban</a> 11:51, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>1) What proof (I've asked this three times now) do you have that any other school is connectioned to this "group"? 2) If any article should be the "focal point" it is the most famous out of the front groups according to media sources. That is far and away, Hamilton. 3) What evidence do you have that "Hamilton is only one part of this"? <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 11:54, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That isn't helpful nor what I asked. I want proof that Hamilton and ACPCU are separable (the other two "organizations" were created by the Hamilton operator and they all shared the same address). This would demonstrate why a merge isn't needed. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 19:50, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry for weighing in, if this group accredits schools then we need an article for it. If it is just a front for Hamilton then the two articles might be profitably merged. However, if it does not accredit, why is it listed on our <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_unrecognized_accreditation_associations_of_higher_learning.html" title="List of unrecognized accreditation associations of higher learning">List of unrecognized accreditation associations of higher learning</a>? Also can someone explain why the NPOV tag was added to this? -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 12:24, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It does not accredited any other schools. It only accredits Hamilton and the other two fronts for Hamilton. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 19:50, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I added the POV tag because the dispute is whether to merge this into the Hamilton page or not. I say no because it isn't Hamilton University but rather a front for it to get support. However ACPCU is also supported by other fake organizations which are not tired to Hamilton University at all. So where do you merge that? --<a href="../../../s/g/r/User%7ESgrayban_0d5b.html" title="User:Sgrayban">Scott Grayban</a> 12:33, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Ok let me put in a structure that I hope you understand. The article says "American Council of Private Colleges and Universities" which has its <b>own</b> website. It does <b>not</b> say "American Council of Private Colleges and Universities and Hamilton University". If it had I would agree to a point that it should redirect but it doesn't. "American Council of Private Colleges and Universities" is a totally new subject on who backs it and who they are associated with. That does not mean that "Hamilton University" isn't part of it. It would be the same as saying the CIA should be part of the US Homeland Security site since they are now connected in the US Gov. --<a href="../../../s/g/r/User%7ESgrayban_0d5b.html" title="User:Sgrayban">Scott Grayban</a> 12:28, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just because it has its own webpage doesn't mean it gets an article, when the two are inseparable. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 19:50, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>Thanks for your response. I would tend to agree at this point that a merge seems premature. Even if they are functionally close, why not have two articles? Having said that, the NPOV tag may also be premature because the dispute looks to be centred on the merge and not on the underlying content. Perhaps you could remove the tag? -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 12:47, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Guys, can you just cool it please? This fight makes no sense. The article clearly identifies that this is an accreditation mill; the way forward is to identify which, if any, other institutions claim its accreditation. If, in time, it becomes clear that this is funtionally inseparable from Hamilton, so be it, but in the mean time there is little chance of anyone being misled, as the article makes it perfectly plain that this is not a reputable body. Neither of you seems to hold any brief for these charlatans or their degree mills, so why not work together? Arbustoo, you in particular should see the value of another potential ally. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:33, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
