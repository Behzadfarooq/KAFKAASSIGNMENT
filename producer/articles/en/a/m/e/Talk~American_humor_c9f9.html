<p>As it stands now, this "article" is merely a few anonymous opinions about general concepts in American humor.</p>
<p>In reality, America is an enormous country with tastes in humor ranging from <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Chappelle_2cbc.html" title="Dave Chappelle">Dave Chappelle</a> to reruns of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dick_van_Dyke_Show_43d8.html" title="The Dick van Dyke Show">The Dick van Dyke Show</a>.</p>

<li>This article needs to be rewritten with facts about American comedians, sit-coms, personalities, etc. from history to the present.</li>
<li>References to certain types of humor (e.g. scatalogical, absurdist, etc.) should be restricted to facts about their use.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is room for a lot more than I'm thinking of, but these are just guidelines.--<a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBantosh_fa6c.html" title="User:Bantosh">Bantosh</a> 19:32, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The reason nobody has written much is because there is no real image of the American sense of humour (at lest not a favourable one), due in part to the large exportation of American comedy that makes it commonplace wherever you go, but also to a lack of any distinctive style. When most non-Americans think of the American sense of they just think of slow, obvious humour lacking satire and subtlety.</p>
<dl>
<dd>We tend to use the word "comedy" more than humor. I see that "American comedy" would come out red though. I was tempted to put in a great deal about American comedy, but I assumed this article wanted to mostly revolve around humorists so I focussed on writers or old-time comedians. If comedy in general can be dealt with in this article it indeed needs a great deal of improvement. One thing is that America is a very large nation of numerous regions and cultures. Trying to find an overarching/distinctive "American comedy" I think is difficult. There are satirists, see <a href="../../../a/m/e/Category%7EAmerican_satirists_7eae.html" title="Category:American satirists">Category:American satirists</a>, in the US and fairly intelligent comedy too. You just might not be getting them because there's a tendency to think that stuff won't make sense outside the US. (Just like a great deal of <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_humour.html" title="British humour">British humour</a> is completely obscure to Americans and mostly watched by nerdy USers who know the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Lords_efb8.html" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a> as well as they know their own families)--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<p>Looking at the other humor articles and noticing there is no "American comedy" article I've decided to just redo the whole thing after all.

<p>Just passing by but I can't help thinking it a bit odd that Laurel and Hardy should be considered American humourists but Charlie Chaplin is not. After all, Stan Laurel and Chaplin were both British and both travelled to America in Fred Karno's Army and, arguably, Chaplin is the greater figure in the development of Hollywood film comedy.217.154.66.11 12:09, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You almost had me. <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Hardy_a2fc.html" title="Oliver Hardy">Oliver Hardy</a> was American, Chaplin was not. Chaplin is also associated with Europe about as strongly as the US as he spent the majority of his life there. He retained British citizenship in his 38 years in the US.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 12:51, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>All true but Laurel was the creative force in their partnership so really it was his humour rather than Hardy's that was on display. However, my main point was, despite the fact Chaplin was British his global superstardom was the result of the films he made in Hollywood. Surely the films of Charlie Chaplin are among the most iconic images of American cinema. Nobody ever talks of Chaplin's films as European. Anyway, if people who weren't born in the USA are omitted, doesn't that potentially exclude rather a lot of 'American' entertainers of the early 20th century?217.154.66.11 16:56, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not necessarily enough to be meaningful. See the US is a nation of 300 million people or something so it's able to produce humorists and comedians on its own without British imports. (I'm just being snarky there because the original version of this article was in effect "American humor is British humour's poor relation.") I'm mostly hesitant to put Chaplin in as America rejected him and he rejected America. Plus he was often, possibly always, dealing with themes that are as or even more European than anything. Still if you want to add him add him, the film section needs expansion.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 17:07, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is this seriously all there is about American humor? There are huge articles about British, New Zealand, and who-knows-where-else humor... Could somone either put a 'stub' tag on it or bring it up to the level of the British Humour article? <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolyhymnia_e62f.html" title="User:Polyhymnia">Polyhymnia</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I concur. The British Humour article is quite comprehensive, this is vague and in a different format. American humour isn't really well understood in most other parts of the world, or at least not very well liked, because it makes a lot of self-references.Someone Stateside who actually understands the foundations of modern US comedy should re-write this, though the existing history stuff should definitely be retained.</dd>

<dd>I moved your post down to make it clearer it's more recent. Anyway I tried to rewrite going roughly by the format of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_humour.html" title="Canadian humour">Canadian humour</a> rather than the British humour article. That might have been an error, but I think there was a logic to doing so in that Canada is our nearest neighbor. Still I knew it was a patch up job and I'd hoped someone would improve it in the last two weeks.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<dd>Also out of realization that many British editors have seen this article I tried to name American comedians that were placed in the British <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Comedian%27s_Comedian_437f.html" title="The Comedian's Comedian">The Comedian's Comedian</a> show and so may have cross-over appeal at least for the UK. Still I am getting a bit tired of the "most of the world doesn't like your humour" thing and I don't even like most modern American comedies. Most of the world doesn't like humor from any particular nation so the statement is not very meaninful. Humor is one of the more culturally specific things out there. Even within America comedy of one sub-culture sometimes fares poorly with another. Most Americans don't like much of the "Ivy League" humor that had been the focus of NBC comedies or the "blue collar" humor of parts of the South. I think it's unlikely that most of the world likes British humor or Canadian humor or what have you. Britain has some advantage in being dominant over more cultures for a longer period of history, but I'd presume that for most of Latin America or Central Asia British humour is no more likeable than any other nations outside their own.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<p>I think this article is better than the British humour article in that it is more than just a list of examples from BBC tv shows. You have at least tried to show that there are different mediums as well as different styles. One thing I see missing is mention of vaudeville and details about the slapstick humour mentioned in the lead. Many of the early comedians started in vaudeville. I also agree that it is difficult to distinguish "humor" from "comedy." But, if I have time I will try to get some references and additional info to add. -- --<a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinned_Elk_9a9c.html" title="User:Tinned Elk">Tinned Elk</a> 00:39, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>okay, I added some. I am confused on the cultural "confusions" part of the article. I think the point in the lead that there are lots of culturally different types of american humor is probably enough. Not sure why the article is referencing a book about why people hate america. does the book discuss american humor or is this just in response to the comment here? I don't think the article can analyze any further why people from other countries don't "get" a country's humor. As said above that is just the way it is. I don't get Benny Hill (intellectual humor??). Oh well. --<a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinned_Elk_9a9c.html" title="User:Tinned Elk">Tinned Elk</a> 02:19, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you and neat improvements. As for some specific points when I came here the article was largely about how American humor compares to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_humour.html" title="British humour">British humour</a>, with the comparison generally being unflattering to Americans. In addition to that so many at the talk pages were like "we don't get American humor, this should deal with that." So I tried to look for American humorists who are also popular outside the US and mention cultural issues. In fairness the British humour article also does this a bit.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 20:29, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
