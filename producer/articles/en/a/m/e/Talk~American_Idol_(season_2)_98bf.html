<p>Chip Days Singer/songwriter/actor</p>
<pre>
Desire, excitement and pure stimulation.  There are no other words to describe the alluring vocals of Chip Days.  With a style of his own, he not only starts the party with his club tracks but seductively lays down the “one on one” after party with his smooth ballads. Vocally gifted, Chip Days is also a talented songwriter, which gives his album a true personal appeal and emotion. Chip, like many other young artists, discovered his love for music at an early age in church. "I came up in South Carolina singing in [the] church. Then I started doing local talent shows. At that point of my life writing became a way to express what I was feeling or say what I wanted to say. For example: If I had a crush on a girl I wouldn't just tell her, I would write all my thoughts down and sing them."  He was influenced by an array of talented artists such as R. Kelly, Brian McKnight and Joe and later worked with the platinum-recording artist, Montell Jordan as well as other top producers. "I got the most inspiration from them as far as vocal and songwriting is concerned, I could really feel the music and that's what I aspired to do as well." Most recently Chip has placed songs with Bad Boys own recording artist B5, and Jazze Pha’s dynamic quartet Nephu, and is currently working with many other established artists.
</pre>
<p>At the age of 24, Chip has had a taste of the business. In 2001-2002 he had two commercials for national fast food franchise ‘Mrs. Winners’. He has also been featured on major recording projects such as Bubba Sparxxx’s “Bright Days Dark Nights, Keith Sweat hits like “Kiss You” and “Don’t Have Me” featuring Dave Hollister, and Pastor Troy’s “Atlanta” and “Boys to Men” featuring. Eight Ball. Chip later auditioned for the award winning show "American Idol". After toughing his way to the top fifteen out of more the 70,000 hopefuls, Chip was featured as a semi-finalist, promoted to the wildcard show, and debuted live in front of more than 20 million viewers. He describes it as a time of preparation and growth. “I feel like being on the show made me a better artist." He also debut on “Half &amp; Half” with an original song he wrote on the UPN sitcom along side of Grammy Award winning producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. He also had three songs placed on the show after his appearance.</p>
<p>Recently Chip entered into the “Ford Video Casting Call” and made it to the finals out of thousand of submissions, his 45-second video was debuted on fordvehicles.com/americanidol, where viewers voted for their favorite contestant. Since then he has been chosen to play the role of Norman in “The Secrets Men Keep” a highly anticipated stage play based on a novel by Dr. Ti-y Muhammad. He has finished 3 songs for the upcoming Tyler Perry movie ‘Daddy’s Little Girl &amp; is currently writing songs for Keith Sweat. Chip has sung the National Anthem for the Atlanta Falcons, &amp; sung at ‘The HERO Awards for the Atlanta area Boys &amp; Girls Clubs. Look for Chip to visit many other Atlanta based organizations in the near future; look out for the album, ladies and gentlemen I bring to you Chip Days.</p>
