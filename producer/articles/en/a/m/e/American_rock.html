<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_rock.html" title="Edit section: Covers: Early 50s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Covers: Early 50s</span></h3>
<p>Through the late <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a> and early <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950s.html" title="1950s">1950s</a>, rhythm and blues music had been gaining a stronger beat and a wilder style, with artists such as Fats Domino and <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Otis_1d26.html" title="Johnny Otis">Johnny Otis</a> speeding up the tempos and increasing the backbeat to great popularity on the juke-joint circuit. Despite the pioneering efforts of Freed and others, black music, or "race music", was still taboo on many white-owned radio outlets. However, savvy artists and producers quickly recognized the popularity and potential of rock and roll and raced to cash in with white versions of this black music. Black performers saw their songs recorded by white performers, an important step in the dissemination of the music, but often at the cost of feeling and authenticity. Most famously, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Boone_7b0f.html" title="Pat Boone">Pat Boone</a> recorded sanitized versions of <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Richard_892a.html" title="Little Richard">Little Richard</a> songs (Little Richard retaliated by getting wilder, creating in "Long Tall Sally", a song so intense that Boone <b>What it do paul wall?</b> couldn't find a way to cover it). Similarly, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricky_Nelson_176b.html" title="Ricky Nelson">Ricky Nelson</a> recorded Fats Domino. Later, as those songs became popular, the original artists' recordings received radio play as well (though this seldom resulted in any remuneration to the original artists). The cover versions were not necessarily straightforward imitations. For example, Bill Haley's incompletely bowdlerized cover of "<a href="../../../s/h/a/Shake%2C_Rattle_and_Roll_4372.html" title="Shake, Rattle and Roll">Shake, Rattle and Roll</a>" transformed <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Joe_Turner_18ed.html" title="Big Joe Turner">Joe Turner</a>'s humorous and racy song into an energetic teen dance number, while <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georgia_Gibbs_dad1.html" title="Georgia Gibbs">Georgia Gibbs</a> replaced <a href="../../../e/t/t/Etta_James_2be5.html" title="Etta James">Etta James</a>'s sarcastic vocal in "Roll With Me, Henry" (covered as "Dance With Me, Henry") with a perkier vocal more appropriate for an audience unfamiliar with the song which James's song was an answer to (<a href="../../../h/a/n/Hank_Ballard_3a77.html" title="Hank Ballard">Hank Ballard</a>'s "Work With Me, Annie").

<p><i>Main article: <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockabilly.html" title="Rockabilly">Rockabilly</a></i></p>
<p>At the same time that R&amp;B was turning into rock and roll, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_%26_western.html" title="Country &amp; western">country &amp; western</a> music was undergoing a similar transformation to faster tempos and more aggressive playing. In cities like <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memphis%2C_Tennessee_649e.html" title="Memphis, Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, country and blues <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_producer.html" title="Record producer">record producers</a> such as <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Phillips_228f.html" title="Sam Phillips">Sam Phillips</a> combined this "hillbilly" music with the driving rhythm of rock and roll and <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rockabilly.html" title="Rockabilly">rockabilly</a> was born. In <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a>, an unknown performer named <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> would come into Phillips' studio with a request to record a disc for his mother. Recognizing talent in the shy young man, Phillips arranged to have Elvis record some ballads with professional musicians, but that date quickly turned into a jam session as Elvis sang the R&amp;B songs he loved. Elvis' first release for Phillips' <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_Records_715d.html" title="Sun Records">Sun Records</a>, "<a href="../../../t/h/a/That%27s_All_Right_Mama_c318.html" title="That's All Right Mama">That's All Right Mama</a>" became the first rockabilly hit and established Elvis as the first true rock and roll star.</p>
<p>But it was in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1955.html" title="1955">1955</a> that the rock era really began to take off with <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Haley_and_the_Comets_2838.html" title="Bill Haley and the Comets">Bill Haley and the Comets</a>' seminal recording, "<a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Around_the_Clock_a159.html" title="Rock Around the Clock">Rock Around the Clock</a>". The song was a breakthrough for both the group and for all of rock and roll music. If everything that came before laid the groundwork, "Clock" certainly set the mold for everything else that came after. With its combined rockabilly and R &amp; B influences, "Clock" topped the U.S. charts for several weeks, and has since been featured on the soundtrack to such films as <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackboard_Jungle_ef96.html" title="Blackboard Jungle">Blackboard Jungle</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Graffiti_d219.html" title="American Graffiti">American Graffiti</a></i>, as well as the original theme music to the TV series <i><a href="../../../h/a/p/Happy_Days_98db.html" title="Happy Days">Happy Days</a></i>.</p>

<p>With the runaway popular success of rock, the style began to influence other genres.

Young adults and teenagers across the country were playing in amateur rock bands, laying the roots for local scenes, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garage_rock.html" title="Garage rock">garage rock</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_rock.html" title="Alternative rock">alternative rock</a>. More immediately, places like Southern California produced their own varieties of rock, such as <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surf_music.html" title="Surf music">surf</a>.</p>

<p>The rockabilly sound reached the West coast and mutated into a wild, mostly instrumental sound called <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surf_music.html" title="Surf music">surf music</a>.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_rock.html" title="Edit section: British Invasion">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">British Invasion</span></h3>
<p>American rock and roll had an impact across the globe, perhaps most intensely in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a>, where record collecting and trend-watching were in full bloom among the youth culture prior to the rock era, and where color barriers were less of an issue. Countless British youths listened to and were influenced by the R&amp;B and rock and roll pioneers and began forming their own bands to play the new music with an intensity and drive seldom found in white American acts. This set the stage for Britain becoming a new center of rock and roll, leading to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Invasion_612b.html" title="British Invasion">British Invasion</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958.html" title="1958">1958</a> to <a href="../../../1/9/6/1969.html" title="1969">1969</a>.</p>
<p>By the early <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a>, bands from England were dominating the rock and roll scene world wide, giving rock and roll a new focus. First re-recording standard American tunes, these bands then infused their original rock and roll compositions with an industrial-class sensibility. Foremost among these was <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>, comprised of four youths from <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liverpool.html" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> who became the single most important and influential act in the history of rock and roll. The Beatles brought together a near-perfect mix of image, songwriting, and personality and, after initial success in the UK, were signed in the US and launched a large-scale stateside tour to ecstatic reaction, a phenomenon quickly dubbed <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatlemania.html" title="Beatlemania">Beatlemania</a>.</p>
<p>Although they were not the first British band to come to America, The Beatles spearheaded the Invasion, triumphing in the U.S. on their first visit in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964.html" title="1964">1964</a> (including historic appearances on the <i><a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Sullivan_Show_7d90.html" title="Ed Sullivan Show">Ed Sullivan Show</a></i>). In the wake of Beatlemania other British bands headed to the U.S., notably <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rolling_Stones_0666.html" title="The Rolling Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>, who disdained the Beatles' clean-cut image and presented a darker, more aggressive image, as well as other bands like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Animals_0e4d.html" title="The Animals">The Animals</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Yardbirds_9c9b.html" title="The Yardbirds">The Yardbirds</a>. Throughout the early and mid-'60s Americans seemed to have an insatialble appetite for British rock; one of the groups who made a greater mark in the USA than on the UK was <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herman%27s_Hermits_fd1a.html" title="Herman's Hermits">Herman's Hermits</a>. Other British bands, including <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Who_01bd.html" title="The Who">The Who</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Kinks_a7b7.html" title="The Kinks">The Kinks</a>, would have some success during this period but saved their peak of popularity for the second wave of British invasion in the late 1960s.</p>

<p>The British Invasion spawned a wave of imitators in the U.S. and across the globe. Many of these bands were cruder than the bands they tried to emulate. Playing mainly to local audiences and recording cheaply, very few of these bands broke through to a higher level of success. This movement, later known as <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garage_Rock_017f.html" title="Garage Rock">Garage Rock</a>, gained a new audience when record labels started re-issuing compilations of the original singles; the best known of these is a series called <i><a href="../../../n/u/g/Nuggets.html" title="Nuggets">Nuggets</a></i>. Some of the better known band of this genre include <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sonics_2d61.html" title="The Sonics">The Sonics</a>, <a href="../../../3F/_/%26/__%26_the_Mysterians_3ed7.html" title="? &amp; the Mysterians">? &amp; the Mysterians</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Standells_1c52.html" title="The Standells">The Standells</a>.</p>

<p><i>Main article: <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk-rock.html" title="Folk-rock">Folk-rock</a></i></p>
<p>As the British Invasion led by The Beatles picked up steam, a homegrown American trend was making itself felt, led by <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>. By 1963 the 22 year old Dylan had assimilated a deep variety of regional American styles and was about to work some alchemy to create an entirely new genre, usually dubbed "folk-rock". From 1961 to mid 1963 Dylan had kept his distance from rock and roll even though his first musical forays back in high school owed more to early rockers like <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddy_Holly_7119.html" title="Buddy Holly">Buddy Holly</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Richard_892a.html" title="Little Richard">Little Richard</a> than to any of the more obscure folk and blues artists he would later embrace. He and others on the new folk circuit tended to view The Beatles as "bubblegum", but admitted to a grudging respect for their originality and energetic style. In 1963 Dylan's release of the album <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Times_They_Are_A-Changin_a550.html" title="The Times They Are A-Changin">The Times They Are A-Changin</a></i> was a watershed event, bringing "relevant" and highly poetic lyrics to the edge of rock and roll. The Beatles listened to this album incessantly and moved away from the exclusive love themes of their work to date. In 1964 and 1965 Dylan threw off all pretense to roots purity and embraced the rock beat and electric instruments, climaxed by the release of the song "<a href="../../../l/i/k/Like_a_Rolling_Stone_e109.html" title="Like a Rolling Stone">Like a Rolling Stone</a>" which, at over six minutes, changed the landscape of hit radio and ushered in a period of intense experimentation on both sides of the Atlantic. Dylan would continue to surprise fans and critics with tour-de-force albums in many different styles, but, after 1964, rarely strayed far from the rock and roll framework. His influence on all rock sub-genres is incalculable, probably equaled only by The Beatles'. Among Dylan's most important disciples was <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Young_9315.html" title="Neil Young">Neil Young</a>, whose lyrical inventiveness, wedded to an often wailing electric guitar attack, would presage <a href="../../../g/r/u/Grunge_music.html" title="Grunge music">grunge</a>.</p>

<p>A number of groups in the early 1970s continued the trend towards heavier and heavier rock and roll begun by 1960s supergroups such as Cream and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Jeff_Beck_Group_624e.html" title="The Jeff Beck Group">The Jeff Beck Group</a>. The most notable of these groups was undoubtedly British supergroup <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_cf85.html" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>, who in a very short span of time rose to the apex of the rock world. Their hard-edged, loud approach to the blues and guitar rock, the epic span of many of their compositions and their unhinged lifestyle would be a great influence on many American acts of the time. What is more, they, along with fellow British group <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Sabbath_9b9c.html" title="Black Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>, would later be recognized as the roots of <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_metal_music.html" title="Heavy metal music">heavy metal</a>. The early albums of American group <a href="../../../a/e/r/Aerosmith.html" title="Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a> would greatly reflect these influences.</p>

<p>Prog Rock can largely be seen as an expansion on the supergroup idea. It was highly technical rock that attempted to move past the dominance of blues rock improvisation into a compositional framework more reminiscent of <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_classical_music.html" title="European classical music">classical music</a>.

<p>Fed up with what they perceived as the excess and decadence of arena rockers like The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin, a number of groups centered in urban New York and London began playing a stripped down sound that came to be called <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">punk</a>. These groups felt that rock had lost sight of its rebellious, cutting-edge origins and had become obsessed with money and fame. Bands like Britain's <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Clash_8395.html" title="The Clash">The Clash</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sex_Pistols_3b6d.html" title="The Sex Pistols">The Sex Pistols</a> and America's <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ramones_d4f9.html" title="The Ramones">The Ramones</a> would lead this musical revolution.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_rock.html" title="Edit section: Grunge">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Grunge</span></h3>
<p>Early grunge bands, particularly <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_in_Chains_161d.html" title="Alice in Chains">Alice in Chains</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/d/Mudhoney.html" title="Mudhoney">Mudhoney</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soundgarden.html" title="Soundgarden">Soundgarden</a>, took much of their sound from early heavy metal and much of their approach from punk, though they eschewed punk's ambitions towards political and social commentary to proceed in a more purely nihilistic direction. Grunge remained a mostly local phenomenon until the breakthrough of <a href="../../../n/i/r/Nirvana_%28band%29.html" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana</a> in 1991 with their album <i><a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevermind.html" title="Nevermind">Nevermind</a></i>. A slightly more melodic, more completely produced variation on their predecessors, Nirvana was an instant sensation worldwide and immediately made much of the competing music seem stale and dated by comparison. Nirvana were a great success during the nineties but they really hit the big time with their hit <i>Smells Like Teen Spirit</i> which is their most well-known song.</p>
<p>Nirvana whetted the public's appetite for more direct, less polished rock music, and one place it was found was in the debut album from a hard-rocking West Coast band with ties to the grunge movement, a band named <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearl_Jam_a09d.html" title="Pearl Jam">Pearl Jam</a>. Pearl Jam took a somewhat more traditional rock approach than other grunge bands but shared their passion and rawness. Pearl Jam were a major commercial success from their debut but, beginning with their second album, refused to buy in to the traditional corporate promotion and marketing mechanisms of <a href="../../../m/t/v/MTV_b498.html" title="MTV">MTV</a> and <a href="../../../t/i/c/Ticketmaster.html" title="Ticketmaster">Ticketmaster</a> (with whom they famously engaged in legal skirmishes over ticket service fees).</p>
