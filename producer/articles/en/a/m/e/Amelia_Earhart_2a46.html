Amelia Earhart</div>

</div>
<p>Amelia Mary Earhart, daughter of Samuel "Edwin" Stanton Earhart (1868-1930<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup>) and Amelia Otis Earhart (1869-1962 <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup>), was born in <a href="../../../a/t/c/Atchison%2C_Kansas_cbae.html" title="Atchison, Kansas">Atchison, Kansas</a>.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> in the home of her maternal grandfather, Alfred Otis, a former <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_federal_judge_2a40.html" title="United States federal judge">federal judge</a>, president of the Atchison Savings Bank and a leading citizen in Atchison. Alfred Otis had not initially favoured the marriage and was not satisfied with Edwin's progress as a <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawyer.html" title="Lawyer">lawyer</a>.</p>
<p>Amelia was named, according to family custom, after her two grandmothers (Amelia Josephine Harres and Mary Wells Patton). <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup> From early on, "Meeley" (sometimes "Milie") was the ringleader while younger sister (two years her junior), Grace Muriel (1899-1998<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup>) or "Pidge," acted the dutiful follower. Both girls continued to answer to their childhood nicknames well into adulthood. <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup>Their upbringing was unconventional since Amy Earhart did not believe in molding her children into "nice little girls."<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup> Meanwhile their maternal grandmother disapproved of the "bloomers" worn by Amy's children and although Amelia liked the freedom they provided, she was aware other neighborhood girls did not wear them.</p>
<p><a name="A_sense_of_daring" id="A_sense_of_daring"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">A sense of daring</span></h3>
<p>A spirit of adventure <sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup>seemed to abide in the Earhart children with the pair setting off daily to explore their neighborhood for interesting and exciting pursuits. As a child, Amelia spent long hours playing with Pidge, climbing trees, hunting rats with a rifle and "belly-slamming" her sled downhill. The girls kept "worms, moths, katydids and a tree toad<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup>" in a growing collection gathered in their outings. Some biographers have even characterized the young Amelia as a <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomboy.html" title="Tomboy">tomboy</a>. <sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> In 1904, with the help of her uncle, she cobbled together a home-made ramp fashioned after a roller coaster she had seen on a trip to <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis%2C_Missouri_7f9c.html" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis</a> and secured the ramp to the roof of the family toolshed. Amelia's well-documented first flight ended dramatically. She emerged from the broken wooden box that had served as a sled with a bruised lip, torn dress and a sensation of exhilaration. She exclaimed, "Oh, Pidge, it's just like flying!" <sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although there had been some missteps in his career up to that point, in 1907 Edwin Earhart's job as a claims officer for the <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_Island_Railroad_f389.html" title="Rock Island Railroad">Rock Island Railroad</a> led to a transfer to <a href="../../../d/e/s/Des_Moines_db34.html" title="Des Moines">Des Moines</a>, <a href="../../../i/o/w/Iowa.html" title="Iowa">Iowa</a>. The next year, at the age of 11, Amelia saw her first <a href="../../../f/i/x/Fixed-wing_aircraft.html" title="Fixed-wing aircraft">airplane</a> at the Iowa <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_Fair_fe58.html" title="State Fair">State Fair</a> in Des Moines. Her father tried to interest her and her sister in taking a flight. One look at the rickety old "flivver" was enough for Amelia, who promptly asked if they could go back to the merry-go-round.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup> She later described the biplane as “a thing of rusty wire and wood and not at all interesting.” <sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Education" id="Education"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Education</span></h3>
<p>While her father and mother found a small home in Des Moines, Amelia and Muriel (she never used Grace) remained with their grandparents in Atchison. Until she was 12, Amelia and her sister received a form of home-schooling from her mother and a governess. She later recounted that she was "exceedingly fond of reading"<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup> and spent countless hours in the large family library. In 1909, when the family was finally reunited in Des Moines, the Earhart children were enrolled in public school for the first time with Amelia entering the seventh grade.</p>
<p><a name="Family_fortunes" id="Family_fortunes"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Family fortunes</span></h3>
<p>While the family's finances seemingly improved with the acquisition of a new house and even the hiring of two servants, it soon became apparent Edwin was an alcoholic. Five years later (in 1914), he was forced to retire, and although he attempted to rehabilitate himself through treatment, he was never reinstated at the Rock Island Railroad. At about this time, Amelia's grandmother Amelia Otis died suddenly, leaving a substantial estate that placed her daughter's share in trust, fearing that Edwin's drinking would drain the funds. The Otis house, and all of its contents, was auctioned; Amelia was heart-broken and later described it as the end of her childhood. <sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1913, after a long search, Amelia's father found work as a clerk at the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Northern_Railway_%28US%29_198a.html" title="Great Northern Railway (US)">Great Northern Railway</a> in St. Paul, Minnesota, where Amelia entered Central High School as a junior. Edwin applied for a transfer to <a href="../../../s/p/r/Springfield%2C_Missouri_e491.html" title="Springfield, Missouri">Springfield, Missouri</a> in 1915 but the current claims officer reconsidered his retirement and demanded his job back, leaving the elder Earhart with nowhere to go. Facing another calamitous move, Amy Earhart took her children to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> where they lived with friends. Amelia was enrolled in Hyde Park High School but spent a miserable semester where a yearbook caption captured the essence of her unhappiness, "A.E.- the girl in brown who walks alone." <sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>Amelia graduated from Hyde Park School in 1916. Throughout her troubled childhood, she had continued to aspire to a future career; she kept a scrapbook of newspaper clippings about successful women in predominantly male-oriented fields, including film direction and production, law, advertising, management and mechanical engineering. <sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup>She began college at Ogontz School in Rydal, Pennsylvania but did not complete her program.</p>
<p>During Christmas vacation in 1917, she visited her sister in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>. <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> had begun and Amelia saw the returning wounded soldiers. After receiving training as a <a href="../../../c/e/r/Certified_Nursing_Assistant_d169.html" title="Certified Nursing Assistant">nurse's aide</a> from the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Cross_7021.html" title="Red Cross">Red Cross</a> she began work at <a href="../../../1/_/s/1_Spadina_Crescent_48bd.html" title="1 Spadina Crescent">Spadina Military Hospital</a> in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a> with the <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volunteer_Aid_Detachment_01bc.html" title="Volunteer Aid Detachment">Volunteer Aid Detachment</a>. Her duties included preparing food in the kitchen for patients with special diets and handing out prescriptions in the hospital's dispensary. <sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup> She continued to work in the hospital until after the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armistice.html" title="Armistice">Armistice</a> ending World War I was signed in November, 1918.</p>
<p>At about that time, she visited an exposition held in Toronto with a young woman friend. One of the highlights of the day was a flying exhibition put on by a World War I "ace." <sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup> The pilot overhead spotted Earhart and her friend, who were watching from an isolated clearing, and dove at them. "I am sure he said to himself, 'Watch me make them scamper,'" she said. Earhart characteristically stood her ground, swept by a mixture of fear and exhilaration. As the plane came close, something inside her awakened. "I did not understand it at the time," she said, "but I believe that little red airplane said something to me as it swished by." <sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>She had a serious sinus infection that year. This was before anti-biotics were available and she underwent surgical treatment. The procedure wasn't successful and Earhart subsequently suffered from sharpening headache attacks.

"By the time I had got two or three hundred feet off the ground," she said, "I knew I had to fly." <sup id="_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#_note-28" title="">[29]</a></sup> After that ten-minute flight, she immediately became determined to learn to fly. She drove a truck and worked at the local telephone company to earn $1000 for lessons. Earhart had her first flying lessons, beginning on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_3.html" title="January 3">3 January</a> <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>, at Kinner Field near Long Beach but to reach the airfield Amelia took a bus to the end of the line, then walked four miles. <sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[30]</a></sup> Her teacher was <a href="../../../n/e/t/Neta_Snook_2bc2.html" title="Neta Snook">Anita "Neta" Snook</a>, a pioneer female aviator who used a surplus <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtiss_JN-4_aad5.html" title="Curtiss JN-4">Curtiss JN-4</a> "Canuck" for training. Amelia arrived with her father and a singular request, "I want to fly. Will you teach me?" <sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
<p>Six months later, Amelia purchased a second-hand bright yellow <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinner_Airplane_%26_Motor_Corp_78b0.html" title="Kinner Airplane &amp; Motor Corp">Kinner</a> Airster <a href="../../../b/i/p/Biplane.html" title="Biplane">biplane</a> which she nicknamed "The Canary."

<p>According to the <i><a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Globe_1f5c.html" title="Boston Globe">Boston Globe</a></i>, she was "one of the best women pilots in the United States", although this characterization has been disputed by aviation experts and experienced pilots in the decades since.<sup id="_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#_note-33" title="">[34]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[35]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[36]</a></sup> Amelia was an intelligent and competent pilot <sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[37]</a></sup> but hardly a brilliant aviator, whose early efforts were characterized as inadequate by more seasoned flyers. One serious miscalculation occurred during a record attempt that had ended with her spinning down through a cloud bank, only to emerge at 3,000 ft. Experienced pilots admonished her, "Suppose the clouds had closed in until they touched the ground?"<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[38]</a></sup> Earhart was chagrined yet acknowledged her limitations as a pilot and continued to seek out assistance throughout her career from various instructors. <sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[39]</a></sup> Gradually her skills and professionalism grew and, by 1927, "Without any serious incident, she had accumulated nearly 500 hours of solo flying - a very respectable achievement"<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[40]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Throughout this period, her grandmother's inheritance, which was now administered by her mother, was constantly depleted until it finally ran out following a disastrous investment in a failed <a href="../../../g/y/p/Gypsum.html" title="Gypsum">gypsum</a> mine. Simultaneously, Earhart's health problem persisted as her old sinus pain sharpened, so in early 1924 she was hospitalized for another unsuccessful sinus operation. Consequently, with no immediate prospects for recouping her investment in flying, Earhart sold the "Canary" as well as a second Kinner and bought a yellow <a href="../../../k/i/s/Kissel.html" title="Kissel">Kissel</a> <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roadster.html" title="Roadster">roadster</a> which she named "the Yellow Peril." After trying her hand at a number of interesting ventures including setting up a photography company, Amelia set out in a new direction. Following her parents' divorce in 1924, she drove her mother in the "Yellow Peril" on a transcontinental trip from California with stops throughout the West and even a jaunt up to <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary.html" title="Calgary">Calgary</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberta.html" title="Alberta">Alberta</a>.

<p>Earhart maintained her interest in aviation, becoming a member of the American Aeronautical Society's Boston chapter, and was eventually elected its vice president.

After deciding the trip was too perilous for her to undertake, she offered to sponsor the project, suggesting they find "another girl with the right image." While at work one afternoon in April 1928, Earhart got a phone call from publicist, Capt. Hilton H. Railey, who asked her, "Would you like to fly the Atlantic?"</p>
<p>The project coordinators (including book publisher and publicist <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_P._Putnam_17c8.html" title="George P. Putnam">George P.

<p>Trading on her physical resemblance to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Lindbergh_87dc.html" title="Charles Lindbergh">Lindbergh</a>, <sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[44]</a></sup> whom the press had dubbed "Lucky Lindy," some newspapers and magazines began referring to Amelia as "Lady Lindy.<sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[45]</a></sup> The United Press was more grandiose; to them, Earhart was the reigning "Queen of the Air." <sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[46]</a></sup> Immediately after her return to the United States, she undertook an exhausting lecture tour (1928-29). Meanwhile, Putnam had undertaken to heavily promote her in a campaign including publishing a book she authored, a series of new lecture tours and using pictures of her in mass market endorsements for products including luggage, "Lucky Strike" <a href="../../../c/i/g/Cigarette.html" title="Cigarette">cigarettes</a> (this caused image problems for her, with McCall's magazine retracting an offer<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[47]</a></sup>) and women's clothing and sportswear. The money that she made with "Lucky Strike" had been earmarked for a $1,500 donation to Commander <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Evelyn_Byrd_6854.html" title="Richard Evelyn Byrd">Richard Byrd</a>'s imminent South Pole expedition <sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[48]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Rather than simply endorsing the products, Amelia actively became involved in the promotions, especially in women's fashions. For a number of years she had sewn her own clothes, but the "active living" lines that were sold in 50 stores such as Macy's in metroplitan areas were an expression of a new Earhart image. Her concept of simple, natural lines matched with wrinkle-proof, washable materials was the embodiment of a sleek, purposeful but feminine "A.E." (the familiar name she went by with family and friends).<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[49]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[50]</a></sup> The luggage line that she promoted (marketed as Modernaire Earhart Luggage) also bore her unmistakable stamp. She ensured that the luggage met the demands of air travel; it is still being produced today. The endorsements would help Amelia finance her flying. <sup id="_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#_note-50" title="">[51]</a></sup>Accepting a position as associate editor at <i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine, she turned this forum into an opportunity to campaign for greater public acceptance of aviation, especially focusing on the role of women entering the field. <sup id="_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#_note-51" title="">[52]</a></sup>In 1929, Earhart was among the first aviators to promote commercial air travel through the development of a passenger airline service; along with Charles Lindbergh, she represented Transcontinental Air Transport (TAT), and invested time and money in setting up the first regional shuttle service between New York and Washington, DC. (TAT later became TWA).</p>

<p>Although she had gained fame for her transtlantic flight, Earhart endeavored to set an "untarnished" record of her own. <sup id="_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#_note-52" title="">[53]</a></sup> She made her first attempt at competitive flying in 1929 during the first Santa Monica-to-Cleveland Women's Air Derby (later nicknamed the "<a href="../../../p/o/w/Powder_Puff_Derby_0bd7.html" title="Powder Puff Derby">Powder Puff Derby</a>" by <a href="../../../w/i/l/Will_Rogers_0819.html" title="Will Rogers">Will Rogers</a>), placing third. In 1930, Earhart became an official of the National Aeronautic Association where she actively promoted the establishment of separate womens' records and was instrumental in the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) accepting a similar international standard. <sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[54]</a></sup> In 1931, flying a <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pitcairn.html" title="Pitcairn">Pitcairn</a> PCA-2 <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autogyro.html" title="Autogyro">autogiro</a>, she set a world altitude record of 18,415 feet (5613 m) in a borrowed company machine.</p>
<p>During this period, Earhart became involved with <a href="../../../n/i/n/Ninety-Nines_5935.html" title="Ninety-Nines">The Ninety-Nines</a>, an organization of women pilots providing moral support and advancing the cause of women in aviation.

George Putnam, who was known as GP, was divorced in 1929 and sought out Amelia, proposing to her numerous times before she finally agreed. <sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[58]</a></sup>" After substantial hesitation on her part, they married on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_7.html" title="February 7">7 February</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1931.html" title="1931">1931</a> in Putnam's mother's house in Noank, Connecticut. Earhart referred to her marriage as a "partnership" with "dual control." In a letter written to Putnam and hand delivered to him on the day of the wedding, she wrote, "I want you to understand I shall not hold you to any medieval (midaevil [sic]) code of faithfulness to me nor shall I consider myself bound to you similarly.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[59]</a></sup>" <sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[60]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
<p>Amelia's ideas on marriage were liberal for the time as she believed in equal responsibilities for both "breadwinners" and pointedly kept her own name rather than being referred to as Mrs. Putnam. When <i>The New York Times</i>, per the rules of its stylebook, insisted on referring to her Mrs. Putnam, she laughed it off. GP also learned quite soon that he would be called "Mr. Earhart.<sup id="_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#_note-61" title="">[62]</a></sup>" There was no honeymoon for the newlyweds as Amelia was involved in a nine-day cross-country tour promoting autogyros and the tour sponsor, "Beechnut Gum."

Although this transoceanic flight had been attempted by many others, most notably by the unfortunate participants in the 1927 <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dole_Air_Race_adb6.html" title="Dole Air Race">Dole Air Race</a> which had reversed the route, her trailblazing <sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[66]</a></sup> flight had been mainly routine, with no mechanical breakdowns. In her final hours, she even relaxed and listened to "the broadcast of the Metropolitan Opera from New York."<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[67]</a></sup></p>
<p>That year, once more flying her faithful Vega which she had tagged "old Bessie, the fire horse," Earhart soloed from <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> to <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico_City_fae1.html" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a> on 19 April. The next record attempt was a nonstop flight from Mexico City to New York. Setting off on 8 May, her flight was uneventful although the large crowds that greeted her at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newark%2C_New_Jersey_17a7.html" title="Newark, New Jersey">Newark, New Jersey</a> were a concern <sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[68]</a></sup> as she had to be careful not to taxi into the throng.</p>
<p>Earhart again participated in long-distance air racing, placing fifth in the 1935 <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bendix_Trophy_4677.html" title="Bendix Trophy">Bendix Trophy Race</a>, the best result she could manage considering that her stock Lockheed Vega topping out at 195 mph was outclassed by purpose-built air racers which reached more than 300 mph <sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[69]</a></sup>. The race had been a particularly difficult one as one competitor, Cecil Allen, died in a fiery takeoff mishap and rival Jacqueline Cochran was forced to retire due to mechanical problems and the "blinding fog"<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[70]</a></sup> and violent thunderstorms that plagued the race.</p>
<p>Between 1930–1935, Amelia had set seven women's speed and distance records in a variety of airplanes including the Kinner Airster, Lockheed Vega and Pitcairn Autogiro. By 1935, recognizing the limitations of her "lovely red Vega" in long, transoceanic flights, Amelia contemplated, in her own words, a new "prize... one flight which I most wanted to attempt - a circumnavigation of the globe as near its waistline as could be <sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[71]</a></sup>." For the new venture, she would need a new aircraft.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Planning</span></h3>
<p>Earhart joined the faculty of <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purdue_University_4925.html" title="Purdue University">Purdue University</a> in 1935 as a visiting faculty member to counsel women on careers and as a technical advisor to the Department of Aeronautics. <sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[72]</a></sup> In July 1936, she took delivery of a <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed_10E_1cbe.html" title="Lockheed 10E">Lockheed 10E</a> Electra financed by Purdue and started planning a round-the-world flight. Not the first to circle the globe, it would be the longest at 29,000 miles (47,000 km), following a grueling equatorial route. Although the Electra was publicized as a "flying laboratory," little useful science was planned and the flight seems to have been arranged around Earhart's intention to circumnavigate the earth along with gathering raw material and public attention for her next book. Her first choice of crew was Captain Harry Manning, who had been the captain of the <i>President Roosevelt</i>, the ship that had brought Amelia back from Europe in 1928.</p>
<p>Through contacts in the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> aviation community, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Noonan_c31f.html" title="Fred Noonan">Fred Noonan</a> was subsequently chosen as a <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_officer.html" title="Flight officer">navigator</a>. He had vast experience in both marine (he was a licensed ship's captain) and flight navigation. Noonan had recently left <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_Am_792d.html" title="Pan Am">Pan Am</a>, where he established most of the company's seaplane routes across the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Ocean_bdb7.html" title="Pacific Ocean">Pacific</a>. He hoped the resulting publicity would help him establish his own navigation school in <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>. The original plans were for Noonan to navigate from Hawaii to <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howland_Island_d9dc.html" title="Howland Island">Howland Island</a>, a particularly difficult portion of the flight; then Manning would continue with Earhart to Australia and she would proceed on her own for the remainder of the project.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Patrick%27s_Day_ca65.html" title="St. Patrick's Day">St. Patrick's Day</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_17.html" title="March 17">17 March</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>, they flew the first leg from <a href="../../../o/a/k/Oakland%2C_California_0bc0.html" title="Oakland, California">Oakland, California</a> to <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honolulu%2C_Hawaii_53af.html" title="Honolulu, Hawaii">Honolulu, Hawaii</a>. In addition to Earhart and Noonan, Harry Manning and Hollywood stunt pilot <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Mantz_18cc.html" title="Paul Mantz">Paul Mantz</a> (who was acting as Earhart's technical advisor) were on board. Due to lubrication and galling problems with the propeller hubs' variable pitch mechanisms, the plane needed servicing in Hawaii. Ultimately, the plane ended up at the U.S. Navy's Luke Field on <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Island_fbb5.html" title="Ford Island">Ford Island</a> in <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearl_Harbor_865a.html" title="Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>. The flight resumed three days later from Luke Field with Earhart, Noonan and Manning on board, but a tire apparently blew on takeoff and Earhart <a href="../../../g/r/o/Ground_loop_%28aviation%29.html" title="Ground loop (aviation)">ground-looped</a> the plane. The circumstances of the ground loop remain controversial. Some witnesses at Luke Field said they saw a tire blow. Earhart thought either the Electra's right tire had blown and/or the right landing gear had collapsed. Some sources cite pilot error.</p>
<p>With the plane severely damaged, the flight was called off and the aircraft was shipped by sea to the Lockheed facility in <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burbank%2C_California_6496.html" title="Burbank, California">Burbank, California</a> for repairs.</p>
<p><a name="Second_attempt" id="Second_attempt"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Second attempt</span></h3>
<p>While the Electra was being repaired Earhart and Putnam secured additional funds and prepared for a second attempt. This time flying west to east, the second attempt began with an unpublicized flight from Oakland to <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami%2C_Florida_f9df.html" title="Miami, Florida">Miami, Florida</a> and after arriving there Earhart publicly announced her plans to circumnavigate the globe. The flight's opposite direction was the result of changes in global wind and weather patterns along the planned route since the earlier attempt. Fred Noonan was Earhart's only crew member for the second flight. Earhart and Noonan departed Miami on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_1.html" title="June 1">1 June</a> and after numerous stops in <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a>, the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_subcontinent.html" title="Indian subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southeast_Asia_4c93.html" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a> they arrived at <a href="../../../l/a/e/Lae.html" title="Lae">Lae</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Guinea_eecc.html" title="New Guinea">New Guinea</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_29.html" title="June 29">29 June</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a>. At this stage about 22,000 miles (35,000 km) of the journey had been completed. The remaining 7,000 miles (11,000 km) would all be over the Pacific.</p>
<p><a name="Departure_from_Lae" id="Departure_from_Lae"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Departure from Lae</span></h3>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">2 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/3/1937.html" title="1937">1937</a> (midnight <a href="../../../g/m/t/GMT_24fe.html" title="GMT">GMT</a>) Earhart and Noonan took off from <a href="../../../l/a/e/Lae.html" title="Lae">Lae</a> in the heavily loaded Electra. Their intended destination was <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howland_Island_d9dc.html" title="Howland Island">Howland Island</a>, a flat sliver of land 6500 ft (2000 metres) long and 1600 ft (500 metres) wide, 10 feet (3 m) high and 2556 miles (4113 km) away. Their last known position report was near the <a href="../../../n/u/k/Nukumanu_Islands_77ca.html" title="Nukumanu Islands">Nukumanu Islands</a>, about 800 miles (1,300 km) into the flight. The <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Coast_Guard_52b9.html" title="United States Coast Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> cutter <a href="../../../u/s/c/USCGC_Itasca_5981.html" title="USCGC Itasca"><i>Itasca</i></a> was on station at Howland, assigned to communicate with Earhart's Lockheed Electra 10E and guide them to the island once they arrived in the vicinity.</p>
<p><a name="Final_approach_to_Howland_Island" id="Final_approach_to_Howland_Island"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Final approach to Howland Island</span></h3>
<p>Through a series of misunderstandings or errors (the details of which are still controversial), the final approach to Howland Island using radio navigation was never accomplished. Some sources have noted Earhart's apparent lack of understanding of her Bendix direction finding loop antenna, which at the time was very new technology. Another cited cause of possible confusion was that the USCG cutter <i>Itasca</i> and Earhart planned their communication schedule using time systems set a half hour apart (with Earhart using Greenwich Civil Time (GCT) and the <i>Itasca</i> under a Naval time zone designation system).<a href="http://www.travelportel.com/ia_to_Amoc/amelia_earhart.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.travelportel.com/ia_to_Amoc/amelia_earhart.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> Motion picture evidence from Lae suggests that an <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antenna_%28radio%29.html" title="Antenna (radio)">antenna</a> mounted underneath the fuselage may have been torn off from the fuel-heavy Electra during taxi or takeoff from Lae's turf runway.</p>
<p>During Earhart and Noonan's approach to Howland Island, the <i>Itasca</i> received strong, relatively clear voice transmissions from Earhart but she apparently was unable to hear transmissions from the ship. Earhart's transmissions seemed to indicate she and Noonan believed they had reached Howland's charted position, which was incorrect by about five nautical miles (10 km). The Itasca used her oil-fired boilers to generate smoke for a period of time but the fliers apparently did not see it. The many scattered clouds in the area around Howland Island have also been cited as a problem: their dark shadows on the ocean surface may have been almost indistinguishable from the island's subdued and very flat profile.</p>
<p><a name="Radio_signals" id="Radio_signals"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Radio signals</span></h3>
<p>After several hours of frustrating attempts at two-way communications, contact was lost. Don Dwiggins, in his biography of <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Mantz_18cc.html" title="Paul Mantz">Paul Mantz</a> (who assisted Earhart and Noonan in their flight planning), noted that the aviators had cut off their long-wire antenna, due to the annoyance of having to crank it back into the plane after each use.</p>
<p>Her last voice transmission received on Howland indicated Earhart and Noonan were flying along a line of position (157 - 337 degrees, presumably through Howland Island). Subsequent attempts were made to contact the flyers by radio using both voice and <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morse_code.html" title="Morse code">Morse code</a> transmissions. Apparent signals from the downed Electra, although usually unintelligibly garbled and/or weak, were received by operators across the Pacific. Some of these transmissions were later revealed to be <a href="../../../h/o/a/Hoax.html" title="Hoax">hoaxes</a> but others were deemed authentic. Bearings taken by <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_American_Airways_1e3c.html" title="Pan American Airways">Pan American Airways</a> stations suggested the distress calls were originating in the vicinity of <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikumaroro.html" title="Nikumaroro">Gardner Island</a>. These signals would indicate Earhart and Noonan were on land (or at least partially so) because the Electra's right engine had to be running in order to charge the power-hungry radio's battery, though questions of fuel consumption remain. Signals from the plane were heard intermittently for four or five days following the disappearance; however, none of these transmissions yielded any understandable position for the downed Electra. Incredibly, a couple of short wave radio listeners on the US mainland may have heard distress calls on upper harmonic frequencies.</p>
<p><a name="Search_efforts" id="Search_efforts"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Search efforts</span></h3>
<p>The <i>Itasca</i> made an ultimately unsuccessful search north and west of Howland Island based on initial assumptions about transmissions from the plane. The <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Navy_1b88.html" title="U.S. Navy">U.S. Navy</a> soon took over the search and over a period of about three days sent available resources to the search area in the vicinity of Howland Island. Based on bearings of several supposed Earhart radio transmissions (along with her last known transmission giving a line of position), some of the search efforts were eventually directed to the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_Islands_997b.html" title="Phoenix Islands">Phoenix Islands</a> south of Howland Island. Naval aircraft flew over remote Gardner Island and reported "signs of recent habitation" but the pilots were not aware the island had been uninhabited since 1892. Other Navy search efforts were again directed north, west and southwest of Howland, based on a belief the plane had ditched in the ocean.</p>
<p>The official search efforts lasted about nine days but Earhart, Noonan and the Electra 10E were never found. At $4 million, the air and sea search by the Navy and Coast Guard was the most costly and intensive in history up to that time but <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_and_rescue.html" title="Search and rescue">search and rescue</a> techniques during the era were rudimentary. Some of the search was based on erroneous assumptions and flawed information. Official reporting of the search efforts was influenced by individuals wary about how their roles in looking for an American hero might be reported by the press. Despite an unprecedented, extended search by the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Navy_1b88.html" title="U.S. Navy">U.S. Navy</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coast_Guard_32fd.html" title="Coast Guard">Coast Guard</a>, no physical evidence was found <sup id="_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#_note-72" title="">[73]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Possible_fate" id="Possible_fate"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Possible fate</span></h3>
<p>Two possibilities concerning Earhart and Noonan's fate have prevailed among researchers and historians. As with many aviation mishaps, poor planning is often cited as a contributing cause.</p>
<p><a name="Crash_and_sink_theory" id="Crash_and_sink_theory"></a></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline">Crash and sink theory</span></h4>
<p>Many researchers believe the plane ran out of fuel and Earhart and Noonan ditched at sea. This "crash and sink" theory, researched for 35 years primarily by <a href="../../../e/l/g/Elgen_Long_2f1f.html" title="Elgen Long">Elgen Long</a> and his wife, Marie K. Long, is the most widely accepted explanation for the disappearance.<sup id="_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#_note-73" title="">[74]</a></sup></p>
<p><a name="Gardner_Island_hypothesis" id="Gardner_Island_hypothesis"></a></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline">Gardner Island hypothesis</span></h4>
<p>Immediately after Earhart and Noonan's disappearance, the US Navy, Paul Mantz and her husband G.P. Putnam all expressed belief that the flight had ended in the <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix_Islands_997b.html" title="Phoenix Islands">Phoenix Islands</a> (now part of <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kiribati.html" title="Kiribati">Kiribati</a>), some 350 miles southeast of Howland Island.</p>
<p>The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (<a href="../../../t/i/g/TIGHAR_b02a.html" title="TIGHAR">TIGHAR</a>) has suggested Earhart and Noonan may have flown for two-and-a-half hours along the standard line of position Earhart noted in her last transmission received at Howland, arrived at then-uninhabited Gardner Island (now <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikumaroro.html" title="Nikumaroro">Nikumaroro</a>) in the Phoenix group, landed on an extensive reef-flat near the wreck of a large freighter and ultimately perished. TIGHAR's research has produced a range of documented, archaeological and anecdotal evidence supporting this hypothesis.<sup id="_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#_note-74" title="">[75]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#_note-75" title="">[76]</a></sup> For example, in 1940, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerald_Gallagher_6df7.html" title="Gerald Gallagher">Gerald Gallagher</a>, a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">British</a> colonial officer (also a licensed pilot) radioed his superiors to inform them that he believed he had found Earhart's skeleton, along with a sextant box, under a tree on the island's southeast corner. He was ordered to send the remains to <a href="../../../f/i/j/Fiji.html" title="Fiji">Fiji</a> where, in 1941, British colonial authorities took detailed measurements of the bones. In 1998, an analysis of the data by forensic anthropologists indicated the skeleton had belonged to a "tall white female of northern European ancestry." TIGHAR's executive director Ric Gillespie authored the book <i>Finding Amelia</i> (2006) which describes almost two decades of research regarding Earhart's world flight attempts.</p>
<p>Artifacts discovered by TIGHAR on Nikumaroro have included an aluminum panel (possibly from an Electra) a woman's shoe and "Cat's Paw" heel dating from the 1930s (which resemble Earhart's footwear in a pre-takeoff photo), a man's shoe heel, crude tools and an oddly cut piece of clear Plexiglas which is the exact thickness and curvature of an Electra window.<sup id="_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#_note-76" title="">[77]</a></sup> The evidence remains circumstantial but Earhart's surviving stepson, George Putnam Jr., has expressed enthusiasm for TIGHAR's research.<sup id="_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#_note-77" title="">[78]</a></sup></p>

Cover from 1977 reprint of Earhart's <i>The Fun of It</i> (1932)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Amelia Earhart was a successful and heavily promoted <a href="../../../w/r/i/Writer.html" title="Writer">writer</a> who served as aviation editor for <i><a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmopolitan_%28magazine%29.html" title="Cosmopolitan (magazine)">Cosmopolitan</a></i> magazine from 1928 to 1930. She wrote magazine articles, newspaper columns, essays and published two books based upon her experiences as a flyer during her lifetime:</p>
<ul>
<li><i><a href="../../../2/0/_/20_Hrs.%2C_40_Min._d128.html" title="20 Hrs., 40 Min.">20 Hrs., 40 Min.</a></i> (1928) was a journal of her experiences as the first woman passenger on a transatlantic flight.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fun_of_It_1c32.html" title="The Fun of It">The Fun of It</a></i> (1932) was a memoir of her flying experiences and an essay on women in aviation.</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Flight_%28book%29_5d1e.html" title="Last Flight (book)">Last Flight</a></i> (1937) featured the periodic journal entries she sent back to the United States during her world flight attempt, published in newspapers in the weeks prior to her final departure from <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Guinea_eecc.html" title="New Guinea">New Guinea</a>. Compiled by her husband GP Putnam after she disappeared over the Pacific, many historians consider this book to be only partially Earhart's original work.</li>

<p>Two notable memorial flights by female aviators subsequently followed Earhart's original <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circumnavigation.html" title="Circumnavigation">circumnavigational</a> route.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1967, Ann Dearing Holtgren Pellegrino and a crew of three successfully flew a similar aircraft (a <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed_Model_10_Electra_1b31.html" title="Lockheed Model 10 Electra">Lockheed 10A Electra</a>) to complete a world flight that closely mirrored Earhart's flight plan. On the 30th anniversary of her disappearance, Pellegreno dropped a wreath in Earhart's honor over tiny Howland Island and returned to Oakland, completing the 28,000-mile commemorative flight on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_7.html" title="July 7">7 July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>.</li>
<li>In 1997, on the 60th anniversary of Amelia Earhart's world flight, San Antonio businesswoman Linda Finch retraced the final flight path flying the same make and model of aircraft as Earhart, a restored 1935 <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lockheed_Model_10_Electra_1b31.html" title="Lockheed Model 10 Electra">Lockheed Electra 10E</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Myths, urban legends and unsupported claims</span></h3>
<p>The unresolved circumstances of Amelia Earhart's disappearance, along with her fame, attracted a great body of other claims relating to her last flight, all of which have been generally dismissed by serious researchers and historians for lack of any evidence. Several of the conspiracy theories have become well-known in popular culture.</p>

Purported photographs of Earhart during her captivity have been identified as having been taken before her final flight. Amy (Otis) Earhart first heard similar rumors days after Amelia's disappearance.<sup id="_ref-Goldstein_and_Dillon_1997.2C_p._260._0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Goldstein_and_Dillon_1997.2C_p._260." title="">[79]</a></sup> A <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>-era movie called <i>Flight for Freedom</i>, starring <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosalind_Russell_7997.html" title="Rosalind Russell">Rosalind Russell</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_MacMurray_562f.html" title="Fred MacMurray">Fred MacMurray</a> has helped further the popular <a href="../../../m/y/t/Mythology.html" title="Mythology">myth</a> that Earhart was <a href="../../../s/p/y/Spy.html" title="Spy">spying</a> on the Japanese in the Pacific at the request of the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_Roosevelt_8ba9.html" title="Franklin Roosevelt">Franklin Roosevelt</a> administration <sup id="_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#_note-78" title="">[80]</a></sup> By 1949, both the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Press_ac7e.html" title="United Press">United Press</a> and US Army Intelligence had concluded these rumors were groundless.

<h5><span class="mw-headline">Tokyo Rose rumor</span></h5>
<p>Another rumor claimed Earhart had been forced to make propaganda radio broadcasts as one of the many women known as <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokyo_Rose_05de.html" title="Tokyo Rose">Tokyo Rose</a>. According to several biographies of Earhart, George Putnam investigated this rumor personally but after listening to recordings of numerous Tokyo Roses he was unable to recognize her voice among them. <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacqueline_Cochran_1f9c.html" title="Jacqueline Cochran">Jackie Cochran</a> (herself a pioneer woman aviator and one of Earhart's best friends) made a postwar search of files in Japan and similarly dismissed the theory of Japanese involvement in the Earhart disappearance.<sup id="_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#_note-79" title="">[81]</a></sup></p>

<p>In November 2006, the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_Channel_f606.html" title="National Geographic Channel">National Geographic Channel</a> aired episode two of the <i>Undiscovered History</i> series about a claim that Earhart survived the world flight, moved to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>, changed her name, remarried and became <a href="../../../i/r/e/Irene_Craigmile_Bolam_b12f.html" title="Irene Craigmile Bolam">Irene Craigmile Bolam</a>. This claim had originally been raised in the book "Amelia Earhart Lives" (1970) by Joe Klaas. Irene Bolam had been a banker in New York during the 1940s, denied being Earhart, filed a lawsuit requesting $1.5 million in damages and submitted a lengthy affadavit in which she refuted the claims. The book's publisher, <a href="../../../m/c/g/McGraw-Hill_24ce.html" title="McGraw-Hill">McGraw-Hill</a>, withdrew the book from the market shortly after it was released and court records indicate that they made an out-of-court settlement with her.<sup id="_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#_note-83" title="">[85]</a></sup> Subsequently, Bolam's personal life history was thoroughly documented by researchers, eliminating any possibility she was Earhart.

<p>The story of Amelia Earhart has also spurred the imaginations of many writers. Stories featuring her have ranged from straightforward biographies to flights of fantasy. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 1943 <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosalind_Russell_7997.html" title="Rosalind Russell">Rosalind Russell</a> film <i>Flight for Freedom</i> was a fictionalized treatment of Earhart's life, with a heavy dose of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> propaganda.</li>
<li>In the 1962 play written by <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Kopit_f78e.html" title="Arthur Kopit">Arthur Kopit</a>, "Chamber Music," which takes place in an insane asylum, one of the characters believes that she is Amelia Earhart. Ironically, in the context of the play, it is suggested that she could actually be Amelia Earhart, based on the time frame.</li>
<li>In David Lippincott's 1970 novel, <i>E Pluribus Bang!</i>, the protagonist, the former President of the United States disappears and is taken to a Pacific island where he meets an aged Earhart and is told that until his death, Judge <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Crater_7164.html" title="Joseph Crater">Joseph Crater</a> lived on the island.</li>
<li><i>World Flight: The Amelia Trail</i> (1971) recounts the flight of Anne Pellegrino who flew Amelia Earhart's route with the same type of aircraft.</li>
<li>Possibly the first tribute album dedicated to the legend of Amelia Earhart was by Plainsong, "In Search of Amelia Earhart," Elektra K42120, released in 1972. Both the album and the Press Pak released by Elektra are highly prized by collectors and have reached cult status. <sup id="_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#_note-84" title="">[86]</a></sup></li>
