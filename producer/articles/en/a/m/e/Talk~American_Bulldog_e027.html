<p>We have a male American Bulldog aged four. He is a calm, gentle, handsome dog who tolerates our two small dogs very well. He literally lets them walk all over him. He is also an excellent watch dog but he warms to some strangers a bit too easily. A good travel dog which helps me as I do have to travel at night when I am on call. His size alone is a deterent. Very clean and has moderate tolerance to water. I don't know how he acts around children because we don't have any yet. Somewhat a picky eater. Very affectionate and quiet. He has plenty of room to play and run and any dog his size needs it. This is not a good apartment dog in that it is not good for them. Oh yes, and an American Bulldog is not a pitbull.

<dd>It's sad that Pit Bulls and anything that even vaguely resembling them have been demonized.

<p>This article is written in a VERY POV tone. I'm sure that some people could probably raise a bear to be an affectionate, loving animal. Personal experience isn't valid evidence.</p>

<p>Yes it is sad. Pitbulls can be sweet and gentle too. It is people who don't have any regard for them that torment them and use them as staus symbols that make them dangerous. Our baby boy is like a child to us. We are very fortunate to have our babies, Monica, Amber and Bernie. Dakota.</p>

<dd>I would love a Pitbull, but to get one i would need a dangerous animals liscence, which is hard to get and even harder to keep. stupid UK law! I like american bulldogs too, but you dont see them over here, so thats out of the window too! Perhaps i should move to america!<a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETekana_60c9.html" title="User:Tekana">Tekana</a> | <a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETekana_c27c.html" title="User talk:Tekana">Talk</a> 19:04, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Did not know that Pits are required dangerous license in the UK. Some cities and counties of states in the US ban them also. American bulldogs are not common here. The pups are expensive also. We did not buy our boy (we would not buy or sell any being), he was a rescue dog as a 3 months old pup. His owner died suddenly and his widow allowed us to adopt him. American Bulldogs are sometimes used in Switzerland as police dogs and in some other parts of the world also. <a href="../../../d/a/k/User%7EDakotaKahn_841e.html" title="User:DakotaKahn">Dakota</a> 03:13, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was the person who originally expanded this article, so here's my two cents....</p>
<p>Yeah, it really is terrible for large bulldog-type breeds as everyone thinks they will be sweet as pie one minute, and then Cerebrus the next. Both pits and american bulldogs can make great pets; both are noted for being very loyal and energetic. I have known/met both here in NYC and the funny thing is most of the time you catch them doing the exact OPPOSITE of what the stereotype projects, and not one was ever muzzled or even needed it. (On the other hand one of each breed all but knocked me over in waggy attempts to lick my face off when I was talking to their master...)</p>
<p>Tekana, you're right: having a pitbull in England is tricky. Muzzles, paperwork, licenses, all focusing on a few breeds that aren't exactly the typical British dog to begin with (not one has a UK origin and I doubt if any ever made the top ten in terms of ownership) But don't be too disheartened. They can't plausibly keep it up forever. They will have to keep expanding the list, because if a Fila is a bad dog, then so must be a Rottweiler since they both are guarding dogs and can leave a nasty bite. Or how about the American Bulldog; it looks like a pitbull, it has a similar temperment, so why not? Or what about the Malamute, since they practically look like wolves anyway? Fact of the matter is, all dogs bite. Should we ban them outright, then?</p>

<p>Yeah, quick question.... are we allowed to advertise American Bulldog pups for sale here? Because I just had 11 puppies born and I'm looking to sell them. I'll check back at this site soon for answer, and if it is yes, will supply contact info then. Thanks! --- Anonymous User at this time.</p>

<p>1)I took out any mention of Spain, it's tangential at best, totally bullshit at worst. I have heard about Bulldogs being imported into Spain, but who knows how many and where to (Mallorca, the British colony perhaps?). I'm not trying to pick fights here, but nothing I've read and nothing I've heard point to a significant introduction of English bulldog blood into the strains of any Spanish breeds, nor the English bulldogs popularity there.</p>
<p>2)Calling the bulldog of England pre-1835, the Olde English Bulldog is silly, it just is. The "Olde English Bulldog" is a modern breed bred of several different bulldog-types, meaning it has other breeds infused - the pug, the White English Terrier and modern English Mastiff specifically. Further, the bulldog of pre-1835 was not distingushed as the "old" bulldog or anything like that. Who have you known who ever called his early model Mustang the <i>old</i> Mustang. "Old" suggests something of the past, for people who owned these dogs at any time up until 1835 they're ownership was in the present. Further, adding an "e" to the word old, is cheesy and never happened for as long or as often as people like to think. Finally, distinguishing the pre-1835 bulldog as something different than the modern bulldog is tricky. But we can say this, genetically they are the same breed and the English Bulldog in its pure form - the AKC variety is a bastardized version - still exists, just that his place of residence has changed.</p>
<p>ABNA is listed under registries, they are neither a registry or a club and should not fall under either category. They simply sanction shows where AB owners may show their dogs.</p>
