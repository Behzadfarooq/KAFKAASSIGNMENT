<p>ANUS is divided into several divisions, and one of its oldest is the metal division (comprised of anus.com/metal and www.hessian.org and www.deathmetal.org).

<p>It seems to me, that ANUS's stance on dualism is rather complicated, but to say they support it doesn't seem to be fully truthful.

See "What Dualism?". Clearly it is not as simple as "promoting dualism", since they are obviously against supernatural, Judeo/Christian forms of Dualism. JunblaA 05:50, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see the main issue with this article on Wikipedia is notability so one should leave the references in there and add more if anyone finds any. ANUS seems to be an interesting group, I've seen their trolls in Michelle Malkin's trackback and various conservative blogs. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollHistorian_f3a9.html" title="User:TrollHistorian">TrollHistorian</a> 14:55, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>More than likely you've seen many other ANUS trolls and didn't know they were ANUS-related&#160;:). However,ANUS has never agreed with sentiment on ethnic genocide and it isn't even wanting to genocide against Christianity, just Judeo-Christians and even that is tounge-in-cheek. The hate index site doesn't need to be mentioned, does it? It is just some idiot with a website calling ANUS a hate site because ANUS isn't liberal. On second thoughts, The Hate Directory is kind of an amusing glance at the lonely life of a man who has nothing better to do than to find websites and leabel them hate, so I think it should be mentioned. --24.252.38.144 15:17, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The criticisms are weak but they show ANUS exists.

<p>This page should be deleted because ANUS is not notable. The article makes it out to be some large underground organization with a long history but in reality it consists of one nerd putting his musings up on the internet and more recently a host of barely-affiliated forum-goers. At most two individuals are heavily involved in maintenance of the largely unnotable ANUS page, which is really the only manifestation of ANUS; as a website. The only difference between ANUS.com and a Livejournal is the domain name.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Factual inaccurate, and it's already been nominated for deletion before. And been deleted before...and allowed back on. If you are just going to use the same rhetoric those in the past have used to get ti deleted, I don't think you are going to get anything done. <a href="../../../o/u/r/User%7EOurs18_47e9.html" title="User:Ours18">Ours18</a> 19:20, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I say delete it. --Kingkingkingking 00:05, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Delete. It is not notable.</p>
<p>About Google hits- ANUS related trolls are spamming several forums, often just to provide articles from ANUS, but also in some cases provoking people (TROLLING) and this affects the hits in Google as well. This small group is trying to generate sense of influence and importance for ANUS by such actions. <a href="http://www.infoterror.com/horde/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.infoterror.com/horde/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>If ANUS would truly grow, it's a diffrent story. Right now I cant see any reason for to exsist in a encyclopedia. Any site could gain hits temporarily with spamming. But does it make it truly notable? No. Mentioning Google hit amounts for certain site from short timeperiod isn't really a proof of being notable. Leyjaefforson 01:28, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've performed some research on <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa.html" title="Alexa">Alexa</a> and I have found the following results. When compared to other metal websites, anus.com does not even come close in terms of ranking. I've decided to perform a little comparison between anus.com and other popular metal websites, and here is what I discovered (source: <a href="http://www.alexa.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/" rel="nofollow">Alexa</a>)</p>
<p>Remember, the lower the number, the higher that website is ranked, meaning that the website has a greater popularity across the internet.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anus.com's alexa rank: <b>67,696</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Compare this with other popular metal websites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metalstorm.ee's alexa rank: <b>44,619</b></li>
<li>Metal-Archives's alexa rank: <b>4,317</b></li>
<li>Thegauntlet.com's alexa rank: <b>22,454</b></li>
</ul>
<p>If anus.com was truly massive as the article claims, then it should of trounced these websites single-handedly. I have even created a graph on alexa showing anus.com's pagerank compared with the pagerank of other metal websites (in this example, I compared anus.com with metalstorm.ee and thegauntlet.com): <a href="http://traffic.alexa.com/graph?u=anus.com&amp;u=metalstorm.ee&amp;u=thegauntlet.com&amp;u=&amp;u=&amp;r=1y&amp;y=r&amp;z=3&amp;h=400&amp;w=700" class="external autonumber" title="http://traffic.alexa.com/graph?u=anus.com&amp;u=metalstorm.ee&amp;u=thegauntlet.com&amp;u=&amp;u=&amp;r=1y&amp;y=r&amp;z=3&amp;h=400&amp;w=700" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>With all of these facts in mind, I believe it is fair to say that anus.com is in no way notable whatsoever. --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFatalism%2C_lol_2d4c.html" title="User:Fatalism, lol">Fatalism, lol</a> 18:36, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Notability has already been established. Please read over the AFD. While you are at it compare the Alexa page ranks of GNAA.us versus ANUS.com.

<dd>Hi, I read your userpage and you say that you are interested in the history of Internet trolling.

<p>I don't believe the overthrow.com article is a reliable source. Article seems to be non-independant—based on a now non-extant page from anus.com itself. Can't find <i>any</i> news source to confirm it, nothing in LexisNexis news archive suggests that anybody offered to sell his bones, let alone was investigated for it. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Hand_Luke_f0fc.html" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Hand_Luke_084b.html" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 00:28, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You don't think he's "officially" involved? Who <i>are</i> you anyway? No, I doubt his is either, but the article seems to be based on unverified content from anus.com itself. The article's lighthearted tone suggests that even it takes the claim serious. And, as I said, nothing else seems to support the claim of FBI investigation. Anyhow, I didn't previously understand who Bill White was, but am now certain that the claim fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>&amp;<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> for several reasons (extraordinary claim, sourced without corroboration to an extremist group).
