<ul>
<li>There is no "best defense". In fact, the 4-4 can be argued as being a very bad defense, especially against the pass (which, most modern teams pass more than they run). You can say there's a "most popular" defense, which would be the 4-3, with the 3-4 a close second.</li>

<p>We need to do some fixing here. "Cover 2" has nothing (directly) to do with the defensive front - you can run Cover 2 out of any front that provides 7 cover defenders. Lots of teams run it out of a 3-4 front. I'll try to clean that up when I get time. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschorr_7389.html" title="User:Bschorr">-B-</a> 18:06, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not really, no. Cover 2 is a 2-deep, 5-under zone coverage. There is also a 2-man which is 2-deep man-under (typically 5 man defenders, but sometimes less). --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschorr_7389.html" title="User:Bschorr">-B-</a> 05:48, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think unless the description is going to be more than about two paragraphs, we should just include it here instead of a separate (and at this time non-existant) article. As an example, see the difference between running plays and pass plays right now. I do think it's appropriate that the Hail Mary links to another article because of it's link, but the others are inline. I'd love to see the same done for running plays.

<p>There seems to be some confusion about the origin and meaning of the West Coast Offense. In this section it is accredited to Bill Walsh, but in the West Coast Offense stub it explains this isn't the case.

<p>I know that there is much to write about in football strategy but this page is getting rather long(already 39 KBs).

<p>I'm just now learning about football and I appreciate more, shorter articles. The long pages can quickly get too complex to take in in a reasonably short period. I assume this article is a work in progress? There's very little here. (unsigned)</p>
<p>There's another page describing football formations here <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formation_%28American_football%29_67b3.html" title="Formation (American football)">Formation_(American_football)</a> I think defensive strategies can be added there instead of here. That page also has diagrams to explain defensive formations. It seems this page is getting very long, and that can be discouraging to people who want to learn about it in a relatively short period. I suggest deleting the whole list of defensive schemes on this page and referring it to the page I mentioned or one of the other pages mentioned here. What do you think?

<p>This is probably the best place for this comment. Anyway I think something needs to be done to sort out the articles about different plays. I have improved the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trick_play.html" title="Trick play">Trick play</a> article, but some of the others (eg. <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halfback_option_play.html" title="Halfback option play">halfback option play</a>) just repeat what is said, and are basically not needed unless we get rid of the trick play article and make separate articles for each play, which seems a little silly. Perhaps there should be one article for Offensive strategy (maybe include special teams in that) and one for defensive strategy, and then the existing trick play article. comments on this subject would be appreciated. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECryomaniac_6ae9.html" title="User:Cryomaniac">Cryomaniac</a> 23:06, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree. This is very redundundant with American Football Strategies' Defense section. We need just one place to put this kind of information for people who are looking for the basic information.

<p>These recent edits to the 4-3 while certainly enhancing the content are not entirely accurate. The "over" and "under" tackles are one variation of the 4-3 but are not universal.

<dd>It is in many ways similiar to the rules for a punt: If the ball is <b>behind</b> the line of scrimmage the kicking team can recover it and attempt to advance it.

<p>Should this actually be 4-6 (<i>four-six</i>)? This is in line will all the other defensive formations. I read 46 as <i>forty-six</i>. --<a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPinkkeith_2966.html" title="User:Pinkkeith">Pinkkeith</a> 15:50, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No. The 46 defense that became famous with Buddy Ryan and the Bears was named for Safety Doug Plank's jersey number, 46. The defensive alignment is actually similar to an older defense, the 5-3. The key features of the alignment are 3 defensive linemen over the center and on the outside shoulder of the guards, with a middle line backer behind them, not easily reached for a block. Plank's alignment was as an additional linebacker, across but a few yards away from one of the offensive tackles. Bringing a safety up as an inside linebacker was unusual, which led to the naming of the defense for him. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulmeisel_05b0.html" title="User:Paulmeisel">Paulmeisel</a> 14:33, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm completely wiping out the comments on the run and shoot. NO ONE in the NFL since the June Jones Falcons have used the run and shoot and to say that the Colts and Bengals are currently running it is ludicrous.</p>

<p>"("better to run" is correct, not "to better run." The latter is a split infinitive and thus WRONG. Learn english before correcting my writing.)" My my, looks like someone's a little touchy about their edits. Funny how I'm told to "learn english before correcting my writing", and whoops, English is supposed to be capitalized. Regardless, the phrase "...its philosophy of spreading a defense in order better to run the football lives on..." sounds awkward as all hell (at best), even if it's grammatically proper (not the best source, but Word's grammar checker approved both "better to run" and "to better run"), so let's just get rid of the point of contention and rewrite that bit.

<p>I added a simple bullet to the basics explaining that if a team fails to achieve any of the (previously) listed outcomes within four downs it results in a turnover on downs. ---CFoster</p>

<p>As there was still content on this page about defensive strategy, I merged it with <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football_defensive_schemes.html" title="American football defensive schemes">American football defensive schemes</a> together; the entire defensive portion can be forked off into its own article (I would suggest an article title of Defensive strategy in American football next time), but it needed to be put together, first. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">theProject</a> 17:21, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article originally said that spiking the ball didn't count as an incomplete to the quarterback. Don't know if that's true or not, but someone added a line saying "Are you sure about that" to the main article. As the article main page isn't really the place for discussing the article itself, I removed the argument, plus the line in question until a definitive answer could be found. 207.12.238.59 19:10, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This portion of the article seems to approach the offensive play calling nomenclature as definitively how its done versus just an example of a particular scheme. I think it should be noted that it is just an example and there are many other ways and naming schemes for offense. Bfjksig201 00:10, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
