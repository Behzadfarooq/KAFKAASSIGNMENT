<p><i>American Flagg</i> was one of the first titles to be published by the newly formed First Comics in 1983. It proved to be a major success for Chaykin and First Comics and fans were won over by Chaykin's handling of more mature themes not common in comics at the time, the intense mix of <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satire.html" title="Satire">satire</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_fiction.html" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> and his dynamic and expressive art. The first twelve issues form one complete story which has become a huge influence upon current comic creators such as <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Michael_Bendis_7343.html" title="Brian Michael Bendis">Brian Michael Bendis</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Ellis_25d7.html" title="Warren Ellis">Warren Ellis</a>.</p>
<p>After issue 12, Chaykin continued the story but began to lose interest in the title. Chaykin began to concentrate on other projects such as his revamp of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Shadow_1fea.html" title="The Shadow">The Shadow</a></i> for <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Comics_9a75.html" title="DC Comics">DC Comics</a> and <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_Squared_%28comic%29_b18d.html" title="Time Squared (comic)">Time<sup>2</sup></a></i>, which was introduced in a one-off special of <i>American Flagg!</i> in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>. Eventually Chaykin left to be replaced on a regular basis by <a href="../../../j/2E/m/J.M._DeMatteis_9346.html" title="J.M. DeMatteis">J.M. DeMatteis</a> after seeing <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Moore_f74a.html" title="Alan Moore">Alan Moore</a> write several issues. The Moore issue was not well received and the DeMatteis run saw the title's sales decline. Chaykin returned to the title for a brief run but the series was cancelled in March <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> and relaunched a few months later as <i>Howard Chaykin's American Flagg!</i>. This run saw Chaykin return to artwork duties as well as writing the series but it failed to recapture its early success and was cancelled after only twelve issues.</p>
<p>The first twelve issues were released by First as a series of <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphic_novels.html" title="Graphic novels">graphic novels</a> but after the collapse of First they went quickly out of print. Dynamic Forces and <a href="../../../i/m/a/Image_Comics_b411.html" title="Image Comics">Image Comics</a> reprinted the first twelve issues in both hardcover and paperback editions in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>.</p>

Chaykin's cover for the first <i>American Flagg!</i> hardcover edition from Dynamic Forces.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The story takes place in the year 2031, after a series of worldwide crises called the Year of the Domino (<a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>) has forced the U.S. government and the heads of major corporations to relocate to Hammarskjold Center, on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars_%28planet%29.html" title="Mars (planet)">Mars</a> ("temporarily, of course"). In the wake of the American government leaving the planet and the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> collapsing from <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islamic</a> insurrections, there was a power shift throughout the world, with Brazilian Union of the Americas and the Pan-African League becoming the new superpowers on Earth.</p>
<p>However, the exiled American government, its corporate backers, and a group of technicians in the defected Soviet lunar colony of Gagaringrad form the <b>Plex</b>: a giant, interplanetary union of corporate and government concerns that conduct commerce and govern the United States from its capital on Mars. Many population centers are grouped around massive, fortified <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arcology.html" title="Arcology">arcologies</a> called Plexmalls and the law is enforced by the Plexus Rangers, the absentee Plex's Earthside militia.</p>
<p>The Plex has formed the Tricentennial Recovery Committee, to get America "back on track for '76", but the TRC is in reality a plan to sell the United States off to the new superpowers and to leech off the remaining inhabitants before gaining true self-sufficiency. As a result, the Plex has outlawed non-combat related education, organized sports such as basketball and personal aircraft, restricted media to only one outlet, the Plex itself (although it has multiple channels), and advocates and glorifies the use of political violence amongst independent policlubs by providing money and firearms for its hit TV show <i>Firefight All Night LIVE!</i>, and covertly sterilizes the population by using a combo contraceptive and antibiotic called Mañanacillin to reduce the population.</p>
<p>This all changes when former television star Reuben Flagg is drafted and transferred to Chicago's Plexmall to replace the local Ranger Hilton "Hammerhead" Krieger's fallen partner. He witnesses widespread graft and corruption throughout the Plexmall, but also a series of subliminal messages implanted in a television show that are causing outbreaks of gang violence. After he uses his emergency powers to interrupt the broadcast, he not only ends the violence, but also brings forth a series of events that causes the Plex to send in covert agents, the death of Hilton, and the unveiling of Q-USA, a secret pirate TV station owned and operated by Krieger that opens Flagg's eyes to the nature of the Plex.</p>
<p>As the series progressed, Chaykin took less and less of a direct role in scripting and plotting the stories out, and by the third year of its run, he really had nothing to do with the book any more. Stories began to violate wildly the rules that Chaykin had explicitly stated in the writer's bible for the series (For instance, California was said to have slid into the Pacific Ocean, but in the final year of the book, California was merely shown to have been abandoned for reasons that were vague at best), and characterizations began to drift considerably as well. (Flagg, for instance, abandoned his interest in 30s Jazz, and was frequently shown listening to late-60s rock, as well as becoming more of a traditional stern-jawed good-guy hero) Complex stories were replaced by cartoonish over-the-top weirdness (As when Flagg meets up with an army of "Reuben Flagg Worshippers," or, as some disgruntled ex-readers called them, "Flaggots.") Whatever spark had flourished in the early years of the book was lost, and readership declined rapidly. After trying and failing several times to shore up declining interests, it was decided to lure Chaykin back into the writer's seat. "American Flagg!" wrapped up its principle storyline in issue 50. By this time, Reuben Flagg had traveled to Mars, overthrown the Plex, and become President of the United States. He then decided to separate Illinois from the United States and run it as his own personal fiefdom. All issues of this series took place in the year 2031.</p>
<p>The next year, the comic was re-launched under the name <i>Howard Chaykin's American Flagg!</i> and picked up from where the earlier book had left off. (In 2032) There is some difference of opinion as to whether this new book was intended to be a limited run, or open ended as is the norm with comics. In either case, it ended after twelve issues. Though it definitely came as a breath of fresh air after the previous 24 issues of drek, it still never quite managed to recapture the fun of its initial early-80s run. The first four issues of this book were mostly geared towards cleaning up the mess that American Flagg universe had deteriorated into in the previous couple years. Flagg was arrested in Europe, the Plexmall was destroyed in an accident, and Illinois re-joined the Union. Eventually sprung from Spandau prison, Flagg makes his way to Russia, where he again takes a job as a Plex Ranger, and has several adventures before eventually marrying.</p>
<p>The final issue ends with a 'photo album' of the Flagg's future domestic life, with lots of kids, a screaming shrew of a wife, and a balding, overweight Flagg himself.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Flagg%21_ae3d.html" title="Edit section: Characters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Characters</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Reuben Flagg</b>, born in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> at Hammarskjold Center, Mars, to Axel and Rebecca Flagg, was a stand-up comic and popular <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> star of the show <i>Mark Thrust, Sexus Ranger</i>. After he was made superfluous by <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_generated_imagery.html" title="Computer generated imagery">CGI</a> technology, he joined the Plexus Rangers and emigrated to Earth, being stationed in the Chicago Plexmall. Flagg is Jewish, and his parents' "undesirably bohemian" attitudes have given him an idealistic view of the United States that runs contrary to the Plex. He has a desire to set things right again, and through inheriting Q-USA, begins to set on that path.</li>
<li><b>Raul the cat</b>, an intelligent, talking orange tabby <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housecat.html" title="Housecat">housecat</a>. With the exception of his intelligence and his ability to speak (an ability whose origin is never explained), he appears to be otherwise a normal house pet. However, he has a customized set of cybernetic gloves, designed by Mandy Krieger, that give him opposable thumbs.</li>
<li><b>Hilton "Hammerhead" Krieger</b>, was Flagg's superior at the Chicago Plexmall. A founder of the Genetic Warlords motorcycle gang, but after his 13th arrest, the Plex drafts him because of his criminal experience. Intending to take advantage of the fledgling organization, he meets his future wife Peggy and stayed with the Rangers. He doesn't trust anyone, not C.K., the mayor, not his wife Peg, not his daughter Mandy, and, while he was a Plexus Ranger, he especially did not trust the Plex. He ran an underground pirate television station called Q-USA that broadcast illegal sports, pornography, and pre-collapse movies and television shows. He is killed by a Plex secret agent, and gives Flagg the station.</li>
<li><b>Amanda "Mandy" Krieger</b>, daughter of Hilton, she is the air traffic controller for O'Hare Chicago Plexport. However, since the O'Hare Plexport only receives two flights a week, Mandy spends her time tinkering with electronics or getting into mischief. She later becomes a deputy to Flagg.</li>
<li><b>Jules "Deathwish" Folquet</b>, captain of the Skokie Skullcrushers basketball team. Despite his <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_fashion.html" title="Punk fashion">punk</a> appearance, his hulking size and the extreme nature of the sport he plays, Jules is quite intelligent. He is referred to as the "king of the two finger lobotomy." He first teams with Flagg to resolve a hostage crisis, but later forms the Video Rangers auxiliaries, and then becomes a Ranger deputy. He also later hosts a talk show with Raul called the "Him and It Show". In the second series, he renounces his violent ways, and, through a remarkable series of events, becomes <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a>.</li>
<li><b>Charles Keenan Blitz</b>, also known as The Honorable C.K. Blitz, a co-founder of the Genetic Warlords along with Hilton Krieger, also ended up getting drafted into the Plexus Rangers, but ended up leaving to become mayor of Chicago. Blitz has his hand in every deal, regardless of how illegal it may be; is extremely wealthy and corrupt; and has killed political opponents. As a side venture, he runs the Skokie Skullcrushers blackmarket basketball team. He is usually flanked by his two robot bodyguards, Bert and Ernie, named after "<a href="../../../s/e/s/Sesame_Street_dd3a.html" title="Sesame Street">a private joke no one under 40 understands</a>". He has had affairs with Mandy Krieger and with Peggy Krieger, while Hilton was fighting a brushfire war in Carracas, which lead to her being kicked out by Hilton and giving birth to...</li>
<li><b>Medea Blitz</b>, the offspring of C.K. and Peggy. Early in the series, Medea is a wild child and hangs out with Cyril Farid-Khan, gang leader of current Genetic Warlords. She has a secret affair with Hilton Krieger, but after his murder, is considered a suspect and is involved in a traffic accident, which causes her to miscarry Krieger's child. In order to clean up her act, C.K. Blitz has her join the Plexus Rangers to straighten her out. As the series progresses, Medea is shown to become more and more accepting of the Rangers and becomes a decent team player in Flagg's group.</li>
<li><b>Sam Louis Obispo</b> also known as Ned Beaumont, also known as Tom Slick. A hustler Reuben meets in Havana while escorting the Skokie Skullcrushers, he later partners with Flagg for most of his time in South America. He has an affair with the wealthy daughter of the Brazilian ambassador, which causes all sorts of problems for Flagg and himself.</li>
<li><b>William Windsor-Jones</b>, but his best friends just call him Bill. Bill is the youngest member of the Witnesses, a gang of octogenarian rebels. He helps Flagg out from time to time, giving him intelligence and technical support. He later has becomes a newscaster for Q-USA. Bill is <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_William_b388.html" title="Prince William">Prince William</a>, and the rightful heir to the now-abolished British throne.</li>
