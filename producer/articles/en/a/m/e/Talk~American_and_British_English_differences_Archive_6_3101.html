<dd><i>In the UK, from is used with single dates and times more often than in the United States.

<dd>I doubt that any educated speaker of English would have such a fundamental problem with the word 'from' even if it was not part of their usual idiom. Also, the comma belongs inside the quotation marks regardless of what kind of English you speak. The comma belongs inside if quoting someone, and outside if the quotes are being used to offset a "special term", unless the comma forms part of the term.--<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffro77_a4f8.html" title="User:Jeffro77">Jeffro77</a> 22:01, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You've got the comma problem half right. The true error is that it is within the quotation marks one time, and outside it a second time-- and in the same sentence! <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 06:10, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the statement <i>In the UK,</i> from <i>is used with single dates and times more often than in the United States</i> is true enough. I would just drop the bit about Americans being confused by the UK phrasing; as Jeffro77 says, while <i>from</i> doesn't sound natural to them (speaking as one, myself), it isn't exactly nonsense, either. The possible misinterpretation suggested by Boothman sounds like pure speculation, since Americans wouldn't be using <i>from</i> interchangeably with <i>after</i> if they meant 'after'. Positioning of quotation marks is a separate topic that has already been addressed, I believe.â<a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMjb_eccd.html" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a> 22:36, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll agree with Mjb. Americans are used to hearing "from" always paired with "to", "through" or "until". To hear "from Tuesday" implies that you will be hearing or reading an "until" date. While the British useage is jarring (and sounds actually "wrong" to Americans, who would rather say either, "The new museum opens on Tuesday", or "The new museum will be open as of Tuesday"), there isn't a problem of misinterpretation of "from" with some other word. --213.46.139.101 10:49, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mutual intelligibility between American and British/Commonwealth English</span></h2>
<p>There are often heated discussions, for example on the Brazilian Portuguese and Quebec French talk pages, concerning mutual intelligibility between European and American varieties of major world languages. I am curious to know how native speakers of American and British/Commonwealth English feel about this issue. I was told once that U.S. speakers occasionally have trouble understanding Scottish/Irish accents or even the working-class speech from England itself. However, not being a native speaker of English myself, I don't know how accurate those opinions are. I would appreciate if you could share your POV on that topic.Mbruno 01:33, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It generally depends upon the level of education of the speakers. But yes, most Americans do have some trouble with certain Scottish/Irish accents as well as the working-class speech in England. There is a wildly funny scene in a movie from about 5 or 6 years ago (I don't remember the name) where <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Pitt_26bd.html" title="Brad Pitt">Brad Pitt</a> is playing an Irish gypsy whose speech is totally incomprehensible to ordinary English people. Of course, the possibility of misunderstanding is much less when the speakers in a given conversation are both highly educated, but it is quite high for encounters between Americans and Scots/Irish when both speakers have never traveled before and are completely unfamiliar with English dialects in other parts of the world. --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 04:20, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It also has to do with the intent of the speaker, whether he wants to be understood ouside his circle. Moast people who use an argot to their friends, know how to make themselves intelligble if they need to.<a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 06:10, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it's often the case that the BrE speaker can understand the AmE speaker, but the AmE speaker doesn't understand the BrE speaker. I think that's because of two things; one the bigger influence AmE has becausee of Hollywood etc, and also the level (and type) of education the AmE speaker has. Americans, in my experience, are barely taught about any other country than the US itself, so this could have an impact. I would agree that it would be harder for an American to understand a person from the <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shetlands.html" title="Shetlands">Shetlands</a> or <a href="../../../t/r/u/Truro.html" title="Truro">Truro</a>, for example, than someone from the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>.

<dd>Someone's just a little condescending. I don't think the fact that it is atypical for an American to be coached in different dialects of English indicates a lack of learning about the world abroad. And after all, American English has more speakers than any other variety. â<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_J._Morris_847b.html" title="User:Casey J. Morris">Casey J.

<dd>I'm sorry, I'm just repeating what an American told me about their education system. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe there is a feeling amongst some aspects of American society that the US is the be all and end all. This is represented in the education system by the neglect of lessons like Geography (outside of the US) and Foreign Language. This is not meant as an attack at the system, I'm just saying that it's different. It happens to a lesser degree in the UK also. For example I was talking to an American who asked me where I was from. "<a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>", I said, half-lying, "Oh," he said, "is that near <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a>?". -- <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothman_030b.html" title="User:Boothman">Boothman</a> 11:17, 21 April 2006 (UTC).

<dd>You're probably right about the geography issue. In a geography survey conducted by the National Geographic Society in 2000, a fairly large percentage of Americans (I believe it was reported to be between 1/5th and 1/4th) thought that <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Mexico_2a18.html" title="New Mexico">New Mexico</a> was part of Mexico. I vaguely recall there is an entrepreneur who sells fake "New Mexico passports" for practical jokers who want to make fun of such ignorant people. Foreign languages are quite important, though, since foreign language study is necessary in many states to graduate from high school and is required for a bachelor's degree by most quality colleges and universities. Most educated Americans do know quite a bit about the country where their foreign language of choice came from.</dd>

<dd>I think the widespread ignorance about the Commonwealth and the UK simply comes from the fact that they are not covered very much. Certainly, UK history is covered in European History in high school; it goes from William the Conqueror to Magna Carta to the English Civil War, but in-depth coverage usually ends at the rise of heavy industry in the second Industrial Revolution. After that the UK is covered only where it directly intersects with American history---primarily, the two World Wars. It wasn't until I took Modern European History in college that I learned all about more recent issues like the Statutes of Westminster (which started the transformation of the Empire into the Commonwealth) and the foundation of European institutions like the EEC and the EU.</dd>

<dd>The thing about the survey smacks of urban legend. As for your thing about U.K. history: this is far from uniform across states or even districts (one of the funny things about American education). And as far as foreign language, meeting a high school foreign language requirement hardly indicates competency in that language or any of its history. â<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasey_J._Morris_847b.html" title="User:Casey J.

<dd>To make what I just posted clearer: Most American colleges have some kind of breadth requirement that forces all candidates for the bachelor's degree to take a history course. The problem is that the breadth requirement can usually be satisfied by taking almost <i>any</i> history course. So for most educated Americans who specialize in majors outside history, their knowledge of history may be limited to the superficial coverage they got in high school, plus in-depth coverage of one particular history specialty, which could be the history of practically any one country in the world or a specialty independent of geography, like the history of science. --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 14:08, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe the connotation that all Americans speak a substandard form of English, is due to the vast differences of many parts of the country. While some view the Southern Drawl as "charming", others see it merely as a lazy or unlearned tongue. Also the influence of Hollywood to the world is biased. Not all from the urban "hood", "ghetto", or "slums" speak in broken English and slang. The level or education has a lot to do with it, as does the place of birth of ones parents. Remember, most "Americans" are not natives to the country, with any form of English being a second language. This may account for the constant changes in American English, bent to fit the new influx of immigrants who bring their own slang with them and intermingle it with their everyday speech.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">German influence on American English</span></h2>
<p>After many years of living in Germany, I realised that the american use of numbers (one-hundred-ten) mirrors exactly the German way of speaking. There are other examples too. e.g. "Ice Rink" Does the word Rink derive from the English "Ring" spoken with a (german/yiddish) accent? My question is, is it thought to be the case that English spoken by newly arrived non-english speaking immigrants from Europe influenced spoken American English?|<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsarSteve_80c6.html" title="User:IsarSteve">IsarSteve</a> 22:35, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Rink comes from the Middle English word renk (which means "racecouse") which is from Old French "renc", of Germanic origin. "ring" comes from the Old English word "hring" which is from the Proto-Germanic word *hrengaz, if I remember correctly. Both of them ultimately derive from the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proto-Indo-European_language_3a39.html" title="Proto-Indo-European language">Indo-European</a> word sker-. So, yes, both "ring" and "rink" words are related, but Indo-European was spoken over 6000 years ago, and it has nothing to do with the final consonant devoicing rule of Modern High German. It is true that German influenced some North American dialects of English such as the North Central accent spoken in the U.P. of Michigan, and some areas of Wisconsin, and Minnesota, as well as eastern North Dakota, and part of Saskatchewan. Some of these dialects have final consonant devoicing, from German influence. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreetingz_a245.html" title="User:Greetingz">Greetingz</a> 04:44, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

(The part-of-speech subquerys in the SARA interface game me spurious-looking breakdowns.) I suspect intransitive senses of "fit" use "fitted" less often than transitive senses, but "fitted" in BrE is definitely more common than "fitted" in AmE, and probably more common than "fit" in BrE.

<dd>As an American, I've never heard anyone say, "He fitted," when referring to someone who has just had (or thrown) a fit. Maybe it's common slang similar to "she freaked", or maybe it's commonly used among healthcare workers to refer to a recent serious event. This seems like a very odd example, and not at all widespread. Meanwhile, the example of "fitted sheets" is erroneous, as it refers not to the past tense of the verb "to fit", but to an adjective describing something which has been tailored, or subject to a fitting (noun). E.g.: a fitted bodice (goes with a pleated skirt). I cringe as well when I hear British speakers saying "fitted-out with", when Americans might say "outfitted with" or far better, "equipped with"; but I have no idea at all what a "fitted kitchen" is.</dd>

<dd>Even in the "fitted kitchen" is almost unnecessary now as almost all kitchens are fitted. It describes a kitchen where all the worktops, tables, etc are the same style, with built in appliances. Back in the 60s this was considered really upmarket, and a lot of people would have a collection of freestanding cupboards, benches a separate cooker and if you were lucky a fridge and a washing machine. The term <i>Fitted kitchen</i> meant a modern, superior kitchen, and for some reason a lot of advertisers still use it. As far as I can gather in the USA, a fitted kitchen was the standard by the 50s (though I don't know if the phrase was ever used), so very few people even remember the alternative and feel the need to point out the difference. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Q_1529.html" title="User:Chris Q">Chris Q</a> 14:14, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Trevor, as some days have gone by you've probably already made a lot of progress on this. So I may be a little late in making this suggestion. A lot of these articles on English usage give no information on whether the differences in usage would arise in writing or only in speech. English speakers often know the answer to this question from their own experience so contributors often don't bother to clarify this. But it seems to me that an article in Wikipedia should be aimed at intelligent readers who are not familiar with the subject. Most articles apply this rule but the ones on English language often assume that the reader is already fully competent in English. I'd suggest that if the aim is to explain the topic (rather than score points over other contributors) it should at least take into account the needs of a competent, though not necessarily fully fluent, non-native speaker - a university student, for example.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>People like this need to know whether a term is used in formal writing or only in speech; and if only in speech, whether it is colloquial, vulgar, etc. So I'd suggest that in the introduction you should impose a structure that obliges those that come after you to make this kind of distinction clear when they add new expressions to the article. The differences in spoken language are such that most English speakers would be able to make a guess about where another speaker comes from (or at least rule out vast areas where they probably don't come from) after hearing just three or four words spoken. By contrast, the differences in written English are far fewer, even in relatively informal writing on Wikpedia discussion pages! For example, many writers say where they come from on discussion pages because they know that their use of language may not immediately reveal this. This highlights that most of the differences in dialect apply to spoken language. I think it would be very helpful for those who turn to an article like this for guidance on English language usage to know whether a particular word or phrase is used in written English or only in spoken English. The introduction can guide later contributors to remember to add this small detail. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_Robson_f616.html" title="User:Adrian Robson">Adrian Robson</a> 08:35, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Adrian, I actually finished my first draft of the rewritten intro yesterday! Now you've raised it, I agree wholeheartedly with the points you make, but my initial thoughts are that they apply primarily to the 3 lists of words rather than to the main article, so I don't think it really impinges on what I've done so far. In fact, when the main intro has been finished and if people are happy with what I've done, I had in mind to tidy up and standardise the intros for the lists as well - e.g. at present some lists use an asterisk to mean 'vulgar', while other lists use it to mean something else. At that point I would certainly incorporate your suggestions. Thanks for your input. -- <a href="../../../t/d/w/User%7ETdw_dd74.html" title="User:Tdw">TrevorD</a> 10:55, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Feels like you guys can read my mind. One of the reasons for the changes I have made to these articles is exactly the needs of learners of English. As Trevor correctly pointed up, this applies in chief to the lists of words. An example---the list of American words used to have "gasoline: petrol" and "teeter-totter: seesaw." But a learner must know that "petrol" is only British and that "seesaw" is standard in both Englishes. Learners should be taught what is or sounds British, what is or sounds American, and what is both; and---as Adrian wrote---what is fit for written English and what is not. And I always try to make this clear---for example, I wrote that "off of" is common in American _speech_ although objected to; and that "out the door/window" are standard in AmE, but British _writing_ prefers "out of..." etc. I recently wrote somewhere that <i>immediately</i> can be a conjunction in BrE (meaning "as soon as"); a fellow editor noticed that it's informal usage, and an appropriate tag was immediately (ha!) added. Even dictionaries can be misleading in this respect---the M-W definition of <i>femme</i> reads just ...1: <small>WOMAN</small> 1a... but the two terms are obviously not interchangeable. [to Trevor: And I've been thinking all along of the asterisk issue too; I think it's best used to denote currency---e.g. no asterisk for <i>gasoline</i> (outnumbered 34.6&#160;: 1 by <i>petrol</i> in the BNC) but asterisk for <i>power plant</i> (6.4&#160;: 1 with <i>power station</i>).] --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber">JackLumber</a> 12:15, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jack, a few comments on your recent changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Meet" - I agree in general with what you say about British usage. I think the only extra point is that we are probably more likely to use the construction "have a meeting with" rather than just "meet" if there is ambiguity or just "meet" doesn't seem natural. Certainly, personally I think of "meet with" as an Americanism!</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, I could find just a few examples of transitive <i>meet</i> meaning "have a meeting with." OTOH, the 2 meanings of <i>meet with</i> have about equal frequency in the British National Corpus.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"benefits"- I don't think I've ever heard of "to claim <i>for</i> benefits". It would be "to make a claim for benefit(s)" or "to claim benefit(s)".</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, intransitive <i>claim</i> seems to be slowing down. Googling "to claim for benefits," "claiming for benefits," etc. nonetheless shows some results. And <a href="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=13795&amp;dict=CALD" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=13795&amp;dict=CALD" rel="nofollow">CALD</a> allows this construction, without regional labels.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"in hospital" etc. - Again, I agree with what you say. If we were to say that a patient is "in <i>the</i> hospital" or a student "at <i>the</i> university", the listener may have the unspoken question "which hospital / university?", because the "the" would imply a specific one, whereas "in hospital" or "at university" implies a general state rather than a specific location.</li>
</ul>

<dd>In America we can say "he was brought to <i>the</i> hospital" even if there are many in the neighborhood... and we didn't drop the article in "at the university" because we don't use the phrase as much as the British---we talk about <i>college</i> rather than <i>university</i> (and <i>college</i> takes no <i>the</i> in both systems, in spite of the different meanings of the word.)--<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber">JackLumber</a> 19:34, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not quite so, I don't think, JackLumber. In the UK we might say, "He's at the college", meaning either the one we were just speaking of, or perhaps the one in this town. Saying, "He's at college" describes a state or a time of his life.
<dl>
<dd>Yes, absolutely, just like a nurse would be in <i>the</i> hospital in Britain also. (Unless she's hospitalized, of course...) As in AmE, "in college" describes the state of the student, just like "in prison" for a con---and this was what I was talking about. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber">Jack</a></dd>

<p>Is this not the same in the US? We do have colleges here, but they're a different type of establishment to Universities. Colleges here can also be parts of Universities, although in that case usage is not usually as in my examples. Where that happens everybody in the University is attached to one or other of its colleges, so we might say, "He's in this college" or, "He's from Darwin College". --<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENigelj_f250.html" title="User:Nigelj">Nigelj</a> 20:03, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

But I have the impression that Brits use the preposition <i>at</i> before words like <i>college</i> or <i>school</i> more often than <i>in</i> (as in "when I was in college I used to date a lot of girls"); in AmE, <i>in</i> would be more usual.

<dd>To claim for benefits? I used to work in the government benefits field. We always said "to file a claim for benefits" or to "claim benefits." For example: "The plaintiff filed a claim for benefits on..." or "The plaintiff claimed benefits under the Social Security Act pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 1396a..." Which regions in particular are using the idiom "to claim for benefits?" We're definitely not using that on the West Coast (or anywhere in American federal administrative law, as far as I know). --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 20:07, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Cool, Cool... Cool down! We obviously were a-talkin' about Olde Englande. My recent edit to the article suggests precisely that the verb <i>claim</i> is *never* (not just in law) used intransitively in AmE. (obviously, when <i>claim</i> is a noun you do need a preposition.) <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber">Jack</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In UK usage, I would say that if "claim" is a noun it's followed by a preposition, but if it's a verb it's not (usually) followed by a preposition. In the cited CALD item, the only (optional) intransitive use of "claim" was "to claim (for) your travelling expenses". I think this is different from "benefit": "benefit" is what you (hope to) receive, whereas "travelling expenses" have been paid out by you and what's you're actually claiming (implied) is "a repayment" or "a refund" of the expenses.</p>
<p>"I claim the benefit of the doubt." (that certainly could NOT have a "for" in it in BrE! <a href="../../../t/d/w/User%7ETdw_dd74.html" title="User:Tdw">TrevorD</a> 20:42, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Benefits or not, this proves that intransitive <i>claim</i> exists, at least to some extent, in BrE; maybe the verbal illustration I chose was not the best possible---we can just change it. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber">JackLumber</a> 11:47, 5 May 2006 (UTC) Btw, I would more likely say a "reimbursement" of the expenses.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hours time/Minutes time</span></h2>
<p>As an American who watches plenty of BBC news, I am puzzled by the (to my ears) redundant use of the word "time" by British presenters. "The changes are scheduled to take place in two months <b>time</b>". Americans would just say, "...in two months.". What other form of measurement could a month be than one of time? The same practice is used in BBC English for minutes and hours: "Coming up, in two hours <b>time</b>." It would certainly be silly to say, "You'll come to a fork in the road after about three miles <b>space</b>". Perhaps the distinction of "minutes time" is necessary since we also measure degrees of latitude and longitude using minutes and seconds. But is this useage as extended to months and years just a lazy habit gone unnoticed?--213.46.139.101 11:08, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, as a Brit, I've certainly not noticed it! I agree it's redundant, and both forms (with or without "time") sound natural to me. Now I'm forced to think about it, I don't even know which I would say naturally, but I think that personally I would omit the "time", especially when writing rather than speaking. -- <a href="../../../t/d/w/User%7ETdw_dd74.html" title="User:Tdw">TrevorD</a> 11:55, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To my (British) ear, the word '...time' in this sense means '...from now'. Without it there can sometimes be a risk of ambiguity. In the first example, "The changes are scheduled to take place in two months" could mean that they are scheduled to take place within a two-month time span, at some point in the future. On the other hand, "The changes are scheduled to take place in two months' time" clearly means that two months from now they will take place. It's not time as opposed to space, but time as opposed to duration. Note the apostrophe I added above: this is because I would also say, "The changes are scheduled to take place in a month's time" or "... in one month's time". --<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENigelj_f250.html" title="User:Nigelj">Nigelj</a> 16:05, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is an interesting point. It arises because of the ambigous English usage of "in" in these contexts. French, by contrast, is more specific and translates "in an hour" as either "en une heure" or "dans une heure" depending on whether the meaning is that the task will last an hour or that the event will take place after the passage of one hour (regardless of whether its duration is a minute, a second or whatever).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>British usage is sometimes amibiguous but sometimes it makes the distinction clear by adding the word "time". "In three weeks' time" can only mean (in British usage) that the event will happen three weeks hence.</dd>

</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>

<dd>As another British ear, I don't wholly agree with Nigelj above. I agree that "the word '...time' in this sense means '...from now'". But often the meaning is perfectly clear without the "time", e.g. the expression quoted above "Coming up, in two hours time." must mean "from now", so "time" is superfluous. But, more importantly, (and ignoring loose speaking) I would say that "in two months" must mean "in two-months' time" (and I agree with Nigel on the necessity of the apostrophe!). If the intention is "within a two-month time span", then it should be "<u>within</u> two months" not "in two months":
<ul>
<li>"in two months" - it is scheduled to happen after the lapse of two months from now, and the duration of the event is unspecified.</li>
<li>"within two months" - it is scheduled to happen within a period of two months from now (maybe in 1 week's time; maybe in 6 weeks' time), but the duration of the event is still unspecified.</li>
<li>"over two months" - it is scheduled to have a duration of two months, but the start time is unspecified.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Yup, the example is poorly phrased, but I guess it means that Americans say "quarter of 2" and Britons "quarter to 2."

<p>To me, as a Brit, <i>off of</i> always sounds like extremely bad usage (that's not to say some Brits don't use it!). Is it standard US usage or just informal usage?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The use of The/the within proper nouns</span></h2>
<p>There is some discussion on an article, where it has been decided that local dialect (in this case UK English) takes precedence over standard Wiki policy, that the capitalisation of "The" in the name the subject is not grammatically correct. This argument is proposed by a US grammatician, but is resisted by the UK based editors who believe that it is an example of US/UK language differences. An example of this point of contention would be the phrase, "It was reported by <i><b>The</b> Independant</i> that former members of <i><b>The</b> Who</i> were...", where it is suggested it should be grammatically, "It was reported by <i><b>the</b> Independant</i> that former members of <i><b>the</b> Who</i> were..." (nb. neither of the subjects mentioned above are part of the article.)</p>
<p>Is this a difference between US/UK grammer (and therefore worthy of inclusion within this/your article?) or a bunch of limeys unable to speak/write their own language?<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELessHeard_vanU_f2c1.html" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> 22:00, 19 May 2006 (UTC) (one of the limeys)</p>

<dd>Personally, I can't comment on US/UK grammer differences, but (as a Brit), I would say that if the word "The" is part of the proper name of the subject - as it is with both the cited examples - then it should be capitalised, otherwise not.

<p>Are there other, similar usages?</p>
<p>It's interesting, as English normally tolerates verbs becoming adjectival nouns in this way - "I teach children" makes the speaker a "teacher".</p>

<dd>It is. We (Americans) tend to capitalize all acronyms, so the only way an acronym stops being capitalized is when people don't know that's it's an acronym (laser, radar, etc.), which usually happens after it becomes so commom that people use the acronym almost exclusively instead of the full word/phrase (PIN, ATM, etc. are this way now and will most likely stop being capitalized sooner or later).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Americans may have a Â¢ or c after the 24, ..."</span></h2>
<p>"<i>Americans may have a Â¢ or c after the 24, but in British English the p is only used when the amount is in pence, so Â£3.24 is correct, as is 324p, but Â£3.24p is considered incorrect.</i>"</p>
<p>Are you saying that Americans would say "$3.24Â¢" or 324Â¢? I'm pretty sure that is incorrect in American English as well. Even if it isn't technically incorrect it happens so rarely that it isn't worth mentioning.</p>

<dd>I am British, and I would probably use "Did you hear the news..." and "because I've broken my leg". In this case the first form implies to me some deliberate action. "I've broken my computer", through some accident but "I broke my computer" deliberately because I got sick of it crashing.

<dd>I agree that both "have you heard" and "did you hear" would be natural to an American in this context. I do think, however, that British speakers and American speakers differentiate between these two tenses somewhat differently. With the "I've broken my computer"/"I broke my computer" example, my personal usage would be to use "I've broken" in a context where the event is in the very recent past and its consequences are continuing into the present, while using "I broke" when the event is more completely in the past. Thus, "I've broken my computer and now I can't finish the assignment" but "I broke my computer and couldn't finish the assignment." I believe it is the case, based on listening and reading, that British English uses "have done" and "did" more interchangeably than American English does. Or am I just imagining it?</dd>

<dd>I couldn't say for sure what's standard, but I'd say "Have you heard the news?" and "I've broken my leg" (I'm British, by the way), since both seem to suggest to me an event in the past whose effects are still continuing. "Did you hear the news?" and "I broke my computer" sound to me like they're describing events in the past which no longer affect the present day, like stories from a personal history. This difference never occurred to me until just now! Terraxos 17:45, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's the last few remnants of the subjunctive. I don't know what that phrase is in British English, but I do know that the subjunctive is starting dying out in British English, whereas North American generally still preserves it-- so it's actually the other way around: in North American English, it is: "If I *were* you." Other uses of the subjunctive are: "Long live..." as opposed to "long lives..."</dd>
<dd>"If I were you" is normally recognised as the correctform in BrE, as far as I know; use of the other form is normally regarded as incorrect, similar to "I was sat"/"I was sitting". <a href="../../../s/e/t/User%7ESetokaiba_c483.html" title="User:Setokaiba">Setokaiba</a><sup><a href="../../../s/e/t/User_talk%7ESetokaiba_f21b.html" title="User talk:Setokaiba">â</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Setokaiba_1aeb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Setokaiba">â</a></sub> 18:02, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're both wrong in a sense... Wutzofant, your teacher (as, alas, many others) was plumb WRONG. Setokaiba, the "type" of subjunctive that is still in everyday use in North America is the _mandative_ subjunctive (<i>the City Attorney recommends that the matter not be tabled</i>)---and it's making its way back in Britain btw, according to corpus data; so this difference is bound to disappear in a few years. As for <i>If I were you</i> vs. <i>if I was you</i>, the traditional rule requires that <i>if I were you</i> be used&#160;;-) but <i>if I was you</i> has been common in both speech and writing on both sides of the Atlantic for decades, perhaps centuries, so why bother? Wutzofant---remember that an "if" clause can stand the subjunctive IF &amp; ONLY IF what you're talking about is something false/unreal/hypotetical (if I were you---but I can't be you), otherwise you _must_ use the indicative mood. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber"><font face="bookman old style"><i>JackLumber.</i></font></a> 22:37, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"If I was you" may heard in American English. The usage is considered substandard, but it may be heard in ordinary situations where the context permits informal speech -- especially when the sentence structure has the dependent clause following the independent clause rather than the other way around. Even sophisticated speakers might use "if I was you" for a humorous or folksy effect. "Were I you" may also be heard, especially when the sentence structure is inverted so that the dependent clause precedes the independent clause, but this has a stilted sound and would not be used in good writing. Generally, it is stylistically better in American English to avoid the subjunctive as much as possible. The example, "the City Attorney recommends that the matter not be tabled" sounds legalistic and "the City Attorney recommends against tabling the matter" or "the City Attorney recommends not tabling the matter" would sound more natural to the American ear. Apart from the specific example of the phrase "if I were you," the subjunctive is likely to be considered too fussy in American English. Thus, "if that was my car" would be preferable to "if that were my car," notwithstanding the technical correctness of the latter. Careful American English writers often rewrite their sentences to avoid the need (temptation?) to use the subjunctive.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Come with" and "sleeping with" -- not Dutch-specific?</span></h2>
<p>From the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In most areas of the United States, the word with is also used as an adverb: "I'll come with" instead of "I'll come along". However, in some British Dialects, 'come with' is used as an abbreviation of 'come with me', as in "I'm going to the office - come with" instead of "I'm going to the office - come with me". This particular usage is also used by speakers in Minnesota and parts of the adjoining states: "Want to come with?" It is similar to South African English, where the expression comes from Afrikaans, and is also used by Dutch speakers when speaking in English.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In college (university), a fellow student of my acquaintance who was a native speaker of German, had a tendency to ask when speaking of a couple, <i>"Are they sleeping with?"</i> Meaning, of course, <i>"Are they sleeping together?"</i> So I do not think this is specific to Dutch- or Afrikaans-native speakers. --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 06:04, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Possibly it's common to all languages of that ilk (German, Dutch, Friesian etc), something probably to do with direct translation from the native language to English (ich komme mit &gt; I come with). I'd like to point out that "come with" is used as a short form of "come with you" in some BrE dialects, as in <i>"You going to the shop? I'll come with."</i> This part of the article needs a bit of a cleanup and clarification. -- <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothman_030b.html" title="User:Boothman"><font color="#0F6E0A"><b>Boothman</b></font></a> <sub><a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothman_acb3.html" title="User talk:Boothman"><b><font color="#5C9337">/tÉËk/</font></b></a></sub> 10:01, 27 June 2006 (UTC).</dd>

I think this may be due to the Society's choice of using "sit for" an exam in their literature, so perhaps students use said phrase in order to sound more acceptable to authorities in the field. However, when a student is speaking to another student, the phrase normally reverts to "take" an exam.</p>

<p>Sorry but I don't see why in both languages you would say The Beatles are a well-known band and you couldn't say The Beatles is a well-known band in American English.</p>
<p>"BrE: "Pittsburgh are the champions." AmE: "Pittsburgh is the champion." Both: "The Steelers are the champions"."</p>
<p>I don't think I've ever heard people say Pittsburgh is the champion (and I'm not making fun of Pittsburg, I just haven't heard this being used at all). Also, shouldn't the period in that sentence be inside the quotation mark?</p>

<p>What is with the inconsistent punctuation style? We should either have the commas inside or outside the quotes, consistently.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It has to do with how most literate Americans, like myself, are trained from a young age to put commas and periods inside quotation marks because it looks more attractive from a typographical perspective. In many fields, putting commas and periods outside the quotation marks is considered to look sloppy and may result in a lowered grade (sometimes the difference between a B and an A) in the academic context. At some American law schools, including the one I went to, consistently putting commas and periods outside the quotation marks is considered to be a sign of incompetence. In combination with a couple of other signs, such as the occasional misspelling or run-on sentence, it will garner an F grade. Yes, our law schools are that strict.--<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 00:50, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not particularly an American English specialist, but I can say that the article is correct in saying that some American schools teach students to drop the "and" except when reading a decimal point, so that 102.56 is <i>one hundred two and fifty-six hundredths</i>. That's how I was taught (in Iowa, although I imagine it's the same elsewhere), although in practice I never hear anyone convert the decimal to a fraction so it's <i>one hundred two point five six</i>, which is how I read numbers. However, I tend to hear people insert an <i>and</i> before the tens or units place more often than not. This may be because I was taught to say it the other way, so inserting an <i>and</i> sounds wrong to my ear and I might notice it more readily. I've lived in several states and this usage seems to be the same everywhere I've been. For a citation, maybe someone can dig up an elementary school math textbook and see if it says how to read numbers. I'll check the library in a day or two and see what I can find. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilbert2.71828_248c.html" title="User:Philbert2.71828">Philbert<sup><tt>2.71828</tt></sup></a> 04:14, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Punctuation (commas in quotes)</span></h2>
<p>I've not entirely convinced that British use has moved as far towards "logical" punctuation as this article suggests.</p>
<p>As a quick test I just grabbed two paperbacks I've read within the last week. The first is "One Fine Day in the Middle of the Night" by <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Brookmyre_d318.html" title="Christopher Brookmyre">Christopher Brookmyre</a> (Abacus "printed and bound in Great Britain"- 2000).

<p>Both of these are fairly unequivacably (though very different) British authors.</p>
<p>Flicking through the first finds <i>'I thought you said this place was disused,' Dawson grumbled. 'There's shit everywhere.'</i></p>
<p>In the second I just as rapidly found <i>He ought to have shrunk by six inches or so, but he didn't. 'True,' he admitted.</i></p>
<p>The commas seem pretty conclusive - it's much harder to work out what a full stop inside a quote is doing, but a comma when the person involved has finsished speaking must be to link it with description of who is speaking, not part of what they said.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Practise/Practice</span></h2>
<p>As I can't find a reference to this in the article, I'll raise my point here:</p>
<p>I have often noticed, in American texts, the word "practice" (with the -ce ending) used as a VERB: for example, "you must practice the technique until it is perfect".</p>
<p>In British English, we make a clear distinction between "practi<b>s</b>e" (-se, <i>verb</i>) and "practi<b>c</b>e" (-ce, <i>noun</i>). This draws a logical parallel with words like "advise" (verb) and "advice" (noun). In this case, the difference is much clearer, because advice and advise are pronounced differently. However, because practise and practice are pronounced exactly the same, the different is not so clear.</p>
<p>What I am wondering is, in American English, IS it the case that "practice" is actually used as the verb? Is this a difference between British and American usage? Or do Americans also make the difference, as between advice and advise, and all usage of "practice" as a verb is just a common mistake?</p>
<p>I ask, because every time I see "practice" as a verb it looks strange to me, and I wonder whether I should correct it. If it's legitimate American English, and the article in question relates to the USA and/or the major contributor's style is American, then it's a legitimate spelling and I shall leave it alone. However, if it is indeed a mistake, then I should go ahead and correct it. In any British article, this would be corrected. But... can someone please enlighten me? Is this a legitimate difference across the Atlantic, or is it just a case of Americans making mistakes?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Use of bespoke as BrE version of Custom made</span></h2>
<p>Bespoke is (almost) universally a tailoring term; in tailoring there is a world of difference between bespoke and custom made. Custom made involves making the suit from scratch, exactly to the customer's measurements. Bespoke is the same, but has three main differences that I know of: 1) the roll of cloth which the customer picks is held for that customer (thus, it is spoken for, or to use the older term, 'bespoke'). 2) the canvas interlining of the coat is loose, and not fused to the outer cloth. 3) there are hundreds of threads stitched across the canvas interlining to make it hold its shape in bespoke tailoring, this is not done in custom made. All this makes bespoke last longer and look better.</p>
<p>Anyway, all i'm trying to say is that bespoke isn't the same as custom made, and we should think of a different example.</p>

<p>Even in MSWord it's not obligatory. All you need to do is to go to Autoformat, then to Autoformat as you type, and turn off the box for "Ordinals", and then do the same for the tab "Autoformat". It's an attempt to match print. In more sophisticated work, the Expert version of many Adobe fonts has all the superscript charaters. But I remember doing with typewriters: Most good typewriters let you move the roller up or down by half a line.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Lanes 1, 2 and 3?</span></h2>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p><i>UK traffic officials, firefighters, and police officers refer to Lanes 1, 2 and 3, referring to the 'slow', 'middle' and 'fast' lanes respectively. In the U.S. the meanings are exactly reversed with Lane 1 referring to the fast lane and so on.</i></p>
<p>Is this right? It just seems to me that labelling with the fast lane as 1 would be inconvenient, as the lane numbers would change when the number of lanes change. Driving in the slow lane where there are three lanes you would be lane 3, and if the road narrowed to two lanes you would find yourself in lane 2 without physically changing lane. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Q_1529.html" title="User:Chris Q">Chris Q</a> 08:08, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suppose this could be a badly worded way of saying that in the UK the lanes are counted from the side nearest the verge and in the US they're counted from the side nearest the central reservation. But that's just a guess! <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajabl_8635.html" title="User:Majabl">Matthew</a> 14:08, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At least in the US, lanes come and go more often on the right (slow) side than the left side. (Think of all the acceleration/deceleration lanes at entrance and exit ramps; also, "truck lanes" on steep hills usually come from splitting the right (slow) lane, and then having the trucks merge back left at the top of the grade.) Thus starting from the fast side keeps the numbering from changing all the time. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConeslayer_540b.html" title="User:Coneslayer">Coneslayer</a> 14:58, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's also wrong to call the lanes "fast", "middle" and "slow" - as this implies that variation amongst lanes is dependant upon speed, not upon overtaking. According to the highway code these are just referred to as "left", "middle" and "right" lanes, all lanes, except for the left lane are deemed to be overtaking lanes. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.14.29.111_82cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.14.29.111">86.14.29.111</a> (talk) 22:19, 28 December 2006 (UTC).</small></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Use of articles with numbered highways</span></h2>
<p>I believe usage of articles before the name of a highway is consistent with highway naming in the U.S. As I understand it, usages like "I-495" and "Route 66" lack articles because the unabbreviated form would have no article ("I traveled up Interstate [Highway] 495", "I get my kicks on Route 66"). Roads with non-numerical proper names get an article throughout America: "the Boston Post Road," "the New Jersey Turnpike," but "I-95." Southern Californian highways (referred to by Southern Californians as "freeways") all have proper names, which are used interchangeably with their numbers: "the San Diego Freeway" or "the 405 Freeway" is shortened to "the 405," "the Santa Monica Freeway" becomes "the 10 Freeway" or simply "the 10."</p>
<p>I can verify the usage in Southern California and New England, but have not lived in other parts of the country; can anyone verify that this is the case? If so, I suggest changing the paragraph on roads to read:</p>
<p>"In BrE numbered highways usually take the definite article (for example "the M25", "the A14") while in America roads usually do not ("I-495", "Route 66"), unless they have proper names ("the Boston Post Road," "the San Diego Freeway,"). Southern Californians use freeway numbers interchangeably with their proper names ("the San Diego Freeway" is also "the 405 Freeway" or simply "the 405.")"Articulatron 02:13, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>AmEng</b> usage is double quotes in all situations, except for quotes within quotes, where single quote marks are used. So: the Chicago Manual of Style says "Quoted words, phrases, and sentences run into the text are enclosed in double quotation marks." [It really does - section 10.26 in the 14th edition]</dd>
<dd><b>BrEng</b> usage is generally the opposite: single quote marks are standard, and double are used for quotes within quotes.</dd>
<dd><b>Neither style</b> makes any distinction between quoted speech and other words placed in quotes to set them apart and mark them as "special" (like that) for whatever reason. I am not aware of any word for a word within quotes. I'm sure someone will enlighten me if there is such...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>EXCEPT THAT:</dd>
<dd>(a) some authors try to maintain a distinction between speech and other types of quote-marked material. But IMHO such a distinction is almost always doomed to failure because of boundary-drawing difficulties, and is likely to be hard for a reader to follow, and I would always advise against - as would, for example, Butcher's Copy-Editing (Cambridge University Press, 2006).</dd>
<dd>(b) in some fields (e.g. linguistics and philosophy) it is apparently the convention to use single quotes for certain things (individual words, letters) even in the American double-quote environment. This is what the Chicago Manual says, anyway (again, section 10.26).</dd>

<p>The article states that the subjunctive mood is more common in American English, yet the examples "They suggested that he apply" and "They suggested that he should apply" are both subjunctive. The only difference between the two is a shade of meaning. "They suggested that he apply" means that they thought it was a good idea, whereas "They suggested that he should apply" means that they thought it neccesary that he apply. Though some may regard the addition of should as redundant, that construct is no less common in America. Similarly "If I had cooked the pie" and "If I would have cooked the pie" are both common subjunctive forms in America with only a slight differenc in meaning. "If I had cooked the pie" means 'if the pie had been cooked', whereas "If I would have cooked the pie" means 'if I had wished to cook the pie.' However the usage of "would" is seen as immature or uneducated if wish had nothing to with the completion of the action. For example, in the construction "If I would have remembered to buy ingredients, I could have baked a pie", most Americans would prefer "had remembered." Additionally subjunctives with "would" imply that the action should have happened were it not for an individual's wish often with a sense of accusation. For example, the construct "If you would have cooked the pie, I could have been eating it now" places the blame for the incompletion of the action on the listener.--Jr mints 20:02, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I will not get involved in discussions of whether changes in language use and idiom are a good thing or not - but I feel I should point out that (IMHO) "whilst" and "shan't" are perfectly standard and common British (English) English. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 13:30, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Both "shan't" and "whilst" are common in Northern England and Midlands England English. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.14.29.111_82cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.14.29.111">86.14.29.111</a> (talk) 00:16, 8 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<dd>Sounds right to me. In America we always say "at" for phone numbers because we analogize them to physical addresses. The same goes for Internet Protocol addresses and domain names, but not ports, though. So when I use my Web browser to access the Web page <i>at</i> www.microsoft.com, my Web browser contacts the Web server located <i>on</i> port 80 <i>at</i> IP address 207.46.199.30.--<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 20:37, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why do Americans use the word "momentarily" when they mean "soon". In BrE, doesn't it mean "briefly"? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Haslam_8750.html" title="User:David Haslam">DFH</a> 16:05, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They don't. "Soon" means in the near future, so it could be several hours or even days from now depending on the context. "Momentarily" means in the immediate future - in other words, the next thing that is going to happen. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKoweja_a591.html" title="User:Koweja">Koweja</a> 16:15, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">American Vs. America</span></h2>
<p>I learned English in the US, but I'm from Chile. Sometimes I feel quite offended when Yankees proclaim themselves "Americans." I am not sure the point I am trying to make, however, when I hear the word American, for me it means Native Americans (Mayas, Incas, Mapuches). I don't know if there is another word rather than American for Yankees...Yankees sounds informal. If not, I'm going to have to "suck it up" and use "Americans" to describe Yankees in my papers.</p>

<li><b>American</b> transcends all <a href="../../../r/e/g/Register_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Register (linguistics)">registers</a>, no other adjective or noun does so. U.S. is occasionally used as an adjective, but mostly in informal writing. Some other informal ones exist, and you can always say <i>Citizen of the United States</i> or some such device. <a href="../../../u/s/e/Use_of_the_word_American_8aee.html" title="Use of the word American">Use of the word American</a> is not very informative, since it focuses on oddities rather than standards. <i>American</i> is the usual adjective for people from the Unites States, and English speakers are likely to get confused if you use <i>American</i> to mean <i>Of or pertaining to the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">Americas</a></i>. Some anglophones from the New World will also get uppity if you refer to them as Americans, because it may be perceived as Culturally Imperialist. If someone insisted on calling me an American, I doubt I could have a civilised dialogue with him, such a terrible insult to my culture and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">country</a> would be pretty intolerable. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 04:16, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Perhaps mentioning the British words, "fiver" and "tenner", meaning Â£5 and Â£10 respectively, would be useful? <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 88.144.58.74 (talk â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_88.144.58.74_68f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/88.144.58.74">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>And, pre-decimalisation we used to have the names 'tanner', 'bob' etc for coins. Americans still use 'quarter', 'dime' etc, I believe, for some of theirs.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"No fear!"</span></h2>
<p>The article says that users of BrE would say "No fear" which is synonymous to the AmE, "No way". I'm British and I've never heard "no fear" until I read this article. I don't think it is accurate.</p>
