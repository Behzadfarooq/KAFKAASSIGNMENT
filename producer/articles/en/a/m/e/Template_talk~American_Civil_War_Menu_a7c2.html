<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/Template_talk%7EAmerican_Civil_War_Menu_a7c2.html" title="Edit section: Rationale and usage guidelines">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rationale and usage guidelines</span></h2>
<p><i>(Please keep this section at the top of the Talk page and do not archive it.)</i></p>
<p>This section records the rationale for <b>American Civil War Menu</b> inclusions or omissions. It is obvious that this large menu could become dramatically larger and unusable if new entries are added without discrimination. <b>We would like to establish the precedent that any changes to the menu are discussed in this Talk page prior to implementation.</b></p>
<p><b>General Usage:</b> This list is exclusively for active Wikimedia article and category links. Do not include external URLs. Do not include red links (Wikipedia articles that have not been written yet). Links to <a href="../../../s/t/u/WP%7ESTUB_7484.html" title="WP:STUB">stubs</a> and multiple redirects to the same article are discouraged.</p>
<p>Rationale for the major headings in the menu:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Issues &amp; Combatants</dt>
<dd>The subcategories <b>Prelude</b> and <b>Slavery</b> should be pretty obvious. The <b>Combatants</b> are intended to be only the "countries" and their highest level armies and navies. We cannot afford to include military units smaller than this (e.g., regional armies, corps, regiments).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Theaters &amp; Campaigns</dt>
<dd>The <b>Theaters</b> are those named by the five articles plus the Union naval blockade. The <b>Campaigns</b> are those that have articles written about them. Since there are no campaign articles describing, say, the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Chancellorsville_6ca4.html" title="Battle of Chancellorsville">Battle of Chancellorsville</a> or the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Fredericksburg_aa81.html" title="Battle of Fredericksburg">Battle of Fredericksburg</a>, these battles are covered only in the following section. If new campaign articles are written (and they are not simply redirects), they will be legitimate additions to this subcategory.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Major Battles</dt>
<dd>In our judgment, the current list represents the most important battles of the war, with unique strategic or political consequences. Please discuss any proposed changes to this list here in the Talk page, citing your justification, before editing the menu.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Key CSA Leaders</dt>
<dd>The Confederate leaders are listed before the United States leaders because of alphabetical order and to give them a gray background. The <b>Military</b> leaders selected commanded major armies or corps, were cavalry leaders with strategic significance, or in a few cases (Gorgas, Cooper) had important positions in CSA headquarters. There is also the single most important naval captain. This list will quickly become useless if people add their favorite commanders, ancestors, or movie characters at lower levels in the hierarchy.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Key USA Leaders</dt>
<dd>The United States leaders come second so that they can have a blue background. The Military leaders are those with the highest positions in the Army and Navy, with only a few exceptions. Hunt had unique significance as an artillery leader. Meigs is included for the same reason as Gorgas. The same warning about adding favorite commanders applies.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Aftermath</dt>
<dd>This row is limited to significant social and political articles about the postbellum era, with demonstrable links to the war.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Other Topics</dt>
<dd>This row is difficult to characterize. New entries or subcategories should not be added without discussion on the Talk page. The <b>State involvement</b> subcategory is intended only for comprehensive articles, such as the current entries.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Categories</dt>
<dd>This row is intended to include, indirectly, all of the smaller units and biographies not explicitly named above. Please do not include subcategories of categories that are already in this list without discussion on the Talk page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>InterWiki</dt>
<dd>Obvious. Please do not change.</dd>

<p>Here is an alternative version. I think it should be superior for readers who have narrow browsers and it will allow us to expand some of the abbreviated entries if needed. What do you think? <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 02:37, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Tweaked. Unless anyone objects to this version, I'd like to replace the live version with this one. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 16:17, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>IMHO, the big black square dots are distracting. Look at the bullet I just placed after "Origins." (Alt 8) Isn't this much softer; doesn't this draw more attention to text? Other than the bullet styling, it the box looks good to me. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 17:08, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I guess that does look better. Updated below. Any others want to comment? <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 17:42, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I tweaked the font size down a touch; if you think it looks better at 95%, please bump it back, but make sure not to revert, leaving the orphan stick after "Confederate Navy". <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 19:45, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>OK. If I hear no objections in the next day or so, I'll pull the switch. In the meantime, I can't recall--did I put Stoneman in the list or did you? I would not rank him in with the other USA guys; I'd put in Pleasonton, Hancock, Custer, Meigs, Sedgwick, Sickles, Sumner, McPherson, or Warren before him. And I'm not thrilled by Anderson, although I guess I see why. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 21:41, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Stoneman was probably the last Union person I put on the list. It was late, and I thought someone would come up with at least 8 stronger guys on edit, but the name fit. At the moment, I was trying to stick to soldiers who had Army or Department commands, Corps command for Confederates. Hunt and the sailors get in because they're damned important, like Gorgas and Semmes, Stoneman had similar specialty. Room for more now, almost seems a shame not to use more of the space, but I've had my fill of my own opinion for now. I'm currently beefing up the Topics list as previously announced. Finding some neat stuff, and adding a bunch of ACW people tags. Very rough of course, but some neat surprises. At least the "what links here?" tool is serving a useful purpose; I've screened about 2500 links so far. One last: is there a wiki "soft return" to use instead of two hard returns? <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 01:15, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>OK, I have no shortage of opinions, so I replaced Stoneman with Meigs. When we introduce this version, do you think we have the stomach to add it into the ACW main page, where it will be RJensened to death and the Confederate flag brigade will rise again?</p>
<p>I don't know what you mean by a "soft return." I maintain a watchlist (<a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_wl_e8e3.html" title="User:Hlj/wl">User:Hlj/wl</a>) of ACW articles I've found and have only half of 2500, so I wonder if you can publish the list or otherwise provide details. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 02:06, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In <a href="../../../d/e/s/Desktop_publishing.html" title="Desktop publishing">DTP</a>/<a href="../../../w/o/r/Word_processing.html" title="Word processing">WP</a> software, a <i>soft return</i> refers to an line break without new default paragraph styling (otherwise automatically imposed when return is pressed). It's not important anyway. The root list I'm piling through is the "What links here?" link which is on the ACW main page, which yields about 8200 pages (which of course link to the ACW page). Many of these are not important, but I've stumbled onto a few things I liked and didn't know about. At the very least I'm getting people like Buffalo Bill and Mark Hanna correctly tagged as American Civil War people. Is <a href="../../../e/m/i/Emily_Dickenson_67f6.html" title="Emily Dickenson">Emily Dickenson</a> an ACWp? My call is No. Was <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Ward_Beecher_e0c1.html" title="Henry Ward Beecher">Henry Ward Beecher</a>? Yes, IMHO. Let's tweak a bit further before placing this on the ACW talk page or other obvious red flag location. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 02:58, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One more thought: Might we craft a usage guidelines before the posting change already setup to defend against trivia insertion contests? Perhaps even rename the menu/template so as to have a blank talk page? Just an idea, I don't know the wiki custom. The current structure is quite capacious still, but if we've already staked out a bill of particulars and rationale, fewer controversies may ignite. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 03:14, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>OK, I've added the usage up front. Also added 3 state articles that we overlooked. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 15:34, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>can interested editors now go ahead and add this to 'see also' sections of ACW articles? Thanks <a href="../../../h/m/a/User%7EHmains_e270.html" title="User:Hmains">Hmains</a> 04:42, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Only if they are really interested.&#160;:-) Try to avoid any pages that RJensen lurks around. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 19:45, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My intention when I created the first version was that it should go into the <b>See also</b> sections of the more popular ACW articles, the ones that casual readers would likely find. Thus, I would not expect that every obscure battle and biography would include it. Perhaps an algorithm to consider for some time in the future would be to place the menu into every article that is listed in the menu itself.

<dd><b>Endorse</b> Morgan's. However, I deliberately did not write Stones River Campaign as a separate article because there is very little that happened outside of the one major battle. Separate campaign articles make sense, IMHO, only when there are a lot of battles that need to be summarized. Otherwise, a Background or Campaign section is adequate to discuss the movements prior to the major battle. There are a number of examples of this: Chancellorsville, Fredericksburg, Chickamauga, etc. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 17:02, 8 August 2006 (UTC) (on vacation)

<dd>Yet <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStubbleboy_4a78.html" title="User:Stubbleboy">Stubbleboy</a> makes a fair case for campaign article inclusion (<a href="../../../b/u/s/User_talk%7EBusterD_cf4d.html#ACW_Template" title="User talk:BusterD">qv</a>). <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 22:26, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When you go to the battle article, the first major heading describes the campaign. The Hartsville battle is described in there in just the amount of detail that a separate campaign article would use. (I know, because I believe I have written all of the campaign articles.) Although it is possible to copy all of that first section into another article, I don't see the point, particularly since that is another article to monitor and keep in sync. I'd like to limit separate campaign articles to those that contain a significant number of battles. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 22:21, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>More on why Confederate states don't show up with articles or categories on their involvement -- they don't exist as of yet from what I could tell from a brief survey. This sounds like a good project for somebody who much better knows Civil War history. My main intention with my efforts was to group Kentucky's articles in that regard and properly categorize and place them in the overall scheme of things.

<dd>Well, watch out for BusterD's Terrible Swift Sword to smite you for this. (Just kidding.)

<dd>Thanks, Stevie for participating in discussion here.

<dd>I certainly understand why guidelines are necessary for a template like this, but I think contributors will necessarily view any guidelines up against <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">being bold</a>; that is, there really is no general expectation in Wikipedia to discuss before making a minor change in good faith. In my case, I know my initial revision wasn't the correct approach, but I think a reversion of that with the immediate suggestion of where to add states would have been an optimal response. I guess I'm saying, try to sort out those who are trying to make the template better from those who just want to add obscure data. Just my 2 cents. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><font color="green"><b>Stevie is the man!</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 13:44, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are technically correct, but in this case BusterD and I are engaged in a bit of an experiment. Since this template may eventually be stored in dozens or hundreds of ACW articles, we realized that random changes from people who did not understand the intent could cause widespread blemishes or confusion. The alternative would be for us to simply swoop in and revert changes of which we disapprove, with only a one line explanation of our rationale in the editing history. Directing people to the Talk page first seems like the most efficient (and polite) approach. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 14:26, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just want to point out that the state abbreviations just added are U.S.-centric and thus are probably not helpful to Wikipedia users outside the U.S..

<dd>It would probably be better to use state abbreviations that were common prior to the USPS two-letter standardization of the 60s, such as Minn., Mich., Cal. However, I would doubt that any international reader who would be interested enough in US history to read, say, Wisconsin in the Civil War, would be unfamiliar with US state abbreviations. Also, with the most browsers, holding your cursor over the link will explain things pretty well anyway. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 20:01, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd like to reply that listing involvement by state is redundant, and could easily be linked by its own category, and thus relieve the already packed template with trivia. So I'm no fan of listing each state anyway. I think it a waste of space on this limited real estate. That being said, the state abbreviations used are the correct ones under US Federal postal law, and as such perfectly acceptable (and perhaps preferable) to non-English speakers or non-US readers. Since each one is discoverable by clicking the link, I'll hold for the accurate postal abbreviations. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 01:29, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>On reflection, I'd like to add the following: as the pedia grows, it's inevitable that we add links to previously unwritten articles or categories or in this case, realms of coverage to this menu. This is a good thing, and since it's inevitable, we need to carefully discuss these new additions as they arise, specifically the state involvement in this case. That seems to be an issue of current interest on the new task force page and I welcome this addition to wikipedia's coverage of the subject matter. That being said, right now the state involvement subcat (on this template) uses both articles and categories, with no guideline as to which is preferable. I'd like to see the comprehensive listing of all states which have even slight involvement with the conflict cut from the page. I'd like to see additions of two new listings under created categories: [[Category:Civil War involvement by state (article)|State articles]] and [[Category:Civil War involvement by state (category)|State categories]] . That is my humble two pennies. What do others think? <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 04:31, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If only the world adhered to U.S postal guidelines (sheesh, let's at least try to think outside the bounds of the U.S.)--I prefer the states spelled out, actually, but was willing to compromise. Anyway, I thought everyone understood that the state categories in the list were simply placeholders for what should ultimately be a list of state articles. I think the current category structure regarding state involvement in the Civil War is all right as it is--it's about as straightforward as it gets. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><font color="green"><b>Stevie is the man!</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 06:17, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's not as much distance between us as it may seem, Stevie. I'm also uncomfortable with using abbreviations anywhere on this pedia. Even "ACW" has such a narrow understanding base, outside of historical interest groups. I was brought up outside the US, and I live in the most culturally diverse city in the world, so I AM thinking outside the US by my suggestions. Those young readers and those learning English need to be pointed in the modern direction of English language use, not down an archaic one. As Hal mentioned earlier, the postal changeover happened almost 50 years ago, so we're not trying to break any ground here. I'm always concerned what "everyone understood", but I see no discussion about any such understanding on this talk page. I might equally contend that we should list every single battle and campaign on this template, but since space prevents that happening, we make concessions. As in that case, a reference toward the complete list seems a perfectly sensible and economical alternative to an unordered comprehensive list which could run to 102 links (articles and categories including DC). <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 07:03, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure where the 102 number comes from, as we should list articles <i>or</i> categories, not articles <i>and</i> categories. Articles should be the preferred links, and categories only listed if articles don't exist. So that would make 51. A template should ultimately direct to articles, not categories; templates were not meant to be used as category compendiums (as far as I can tell). Also consider the fact that these state articles are categorized in their state categories, and users should be able to move on to related state articles if they so choose. As far as "everyone understood", this was brought up in talk at an earlier time (I'll find it shortly)--everyone means everyone who was following the discussion. Re: State abbreviations, I have no intention of contesting a consensus on that, if there is one, but it's clear that the template is already huge, so spelling out the state names isn't going to make a big difference at this juncture. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevietheman_a9e5.html" title="User:Stevietheman"><font color="green"><b>Stevie is the man!</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevietheman_47c4.html" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stevietheman_ecb3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a></sup> 17:27, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Now that the <a href="../../../a/c/w/P%7EACW_c2df.html" title="P:ACW">ACW portal</a> is mostly constructed, Kirill has suggested we adjust colors for this "topics list". When viewed as a part of the portal, the colors look extreme. While we're on the topic (and I know the watchlist for this page is still low) please feel free to visit the portal and provide feedback before I ask the same of the ACW task force.

<dd>Well, make a proposal. I'm no HTML color wiz. I find the colors you've selected for the portal to be mostly Confederate gray, whereas I deliberately emphasized both blue and gray in the menu. If the menu is going to be placed in that portal, you could eliminate the portal's duplicate listing of other Wikimedia links. My general comment is that the portal has way too much information for anyone to pay attention to it. You should try for something that is not longer than one or two screens and collapse some of the duplicative displays, such as separate sections for maps, flags, photographs, and other images. I would think that "image of the week" would cover all of those well enough, particularly since the multiple featured articles (battle, weapon, biography) will probably include images inside their boxes, too. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 01:02, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Re: crowded--you're right of course. I wish some of the other nice folks I asked had reminded me to KISS early on. Looper5920 tried to say it nicely but I respond better to bluntness, so thanks. When I look at featured portals, I see the proportional scroll bar seems large; on mine, little bitty. So I need to trim it down a bunch and I'll do that before I go further. Frankly, I've be playing with colors and would enjoy some help if you're interested. I really like the soft grays and with the blue titles and links, it seems balanced to me. I was wondering a butternut and blue might be nice. Maybe a blue background box with some butternut title bars and gray or very light tan boxes. I think Kirill's point was that since we might use even more space and open it up a little with lighter colors. Good catch on the wiki links; I'll delete the box. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 03:41, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm no HTML color guy, as I said. I assume that we are limited to the "web safe" colors, as shown in <a href="http://www.pagetutor.com/common/bgcolors216.html" class="external free" title="http://www.pagetutor.com/common/bgcolors216.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pagetutor.com/common/bgcolors216.html</a> for instance. Given those, there is little room for differentiation with the available shades of gray and blue. One alternative for the menu would be to keep the dark colors for the left-hand column and to use a single neutral color, like FFFFCC, for all of the right-hand column. Or, make the whole thing neutral. Or, copy the links into the portal in whatever format and organization you like. For example, a portal box about battles could have the links included right there, or a box about the states. That assumes that you would keep the rather detailed breakdown that you have now, which I have argued against. (Another reason to restrict the number of boxes, beyond the length of the page, is similar to what we did in the menu, to forestall proliferation. For instance, what if someone said that they wanted the political article of the week or the African-American contribution of the week or the Naval ship of the week? You would have little ground on which to stand to resist such expansions. But if you limited the boxes to, say, 1 article, 1 image, news, DYK, links, and a task force to-do list, you would have all the flexibility you need.) <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 15:53, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The blue is light with a green cast that does not remind me of the dark blue Union uniform. The gray is so light as to be almost indistinguishable from white.

<p>Out of curiosity why are there no references to 1861 campaigns? (maybe the articles haven't been written yet?) Thanks <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmericasroof_3ff1.html" title="User:Americasroof">Americasroof</a> 11:34, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, our methodology here is to avoid red links in the menu. The National Park Service, which we generally use for campaign classification, defines 12 campaigns in 1861, although some of these are very minor or have only a single battle in them, so I doubt that there will be many campaign article written. It is conceivable that someone may write articles about the campaigns in Missouri, Kentucky, West Virginia, and possibly North Carolina, after which we can discuss putting them into the menu. But we have to be circumspect, or this menu will become so large as to be unusable. My own algorithm for writing separate articles on campaigns is that they have to represent a significant series of battles and the reader will benefit from a brief discussion of each, along with a good background section and an aftermath. For example, "Operations at the Ohio and Mississippi River Confluence" has not been written as a campaign because it consists solely of the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Belmont_da2f.html" title="Battle of Belmont">Battle of Belmont</a>. In more of a gray area, the First Manassas Campaign has not been written because the two additional tiny battles are completely overwhelmed by the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Battle_of_Bull_Run_8962.html" title="First Battle of Bull Run">First Battle of Bull Run</a> and there is adequate explanation in that battle article (well, that article is not all that good, but it ought to be).</dd>

<dd>By the way, I believe you added <a href="../../../p/r/i/Price%27s_Raid_8291.html" title="Price's Raid">Price's Raid</a> to the menu without discussion here on the Talk page first, which is our custom for maintaining the menu.

<p>Since I made a change without discussion, here's the discussion. <a href="../../../p/r/i/Price%27s_Raid_8291.html" title="Price's Raid">Price's Raid</a> should be on the list of major campaigns in 1864 because it marked a last gasp offensive to bring Missouri into the Confederacy and involved a offensive that went from border to border.

<dd><b>Endorse</b> I'll admit bias, as I had ancestors involved in both sides of the campaign, but a pretty good article adds something useful to the menu.

<dd><b>Endorse</b>, too. My bias is that I wrote the article in question, but forgot about it because it doesn't have the word "campaign" in the title. This kind of article is not very difficult to write, by the way. It consists of a little introductory material and then the battle descriptions are shoveled in from <a href="http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/bycampgn.htm#West64" class="external free" title="http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/bycampgn.htm#West64" rel="nofollow">http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/abpp/battles/bycampgn.htm#West64</a> with a bit of editing, followed by Aftermath.

<dd>Annoyed? No, discussion is always a good thing. The original algorithm for the contents of the battle list was those battles that I remembered to type in without looking at external references. I figured that if I remembered it, it was prominent enough for others to remember, too. I think it is possible that we have added a few over time, although I cannot recall doing so. I would not object to adding Westport, even though it did not come to the top of my mind when I wrote the list. Other opinions? The reason we have these discussions is that there is a fine line between important and obscure, and if we ever cross that line, we will have no good basis for resisting the addition of dozens of minor battles, which would overwhelm the menu. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 18:57, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that this discussion is always welcome. On the merits, I can list several articles which are IMHO more important to the war and don't appear on the menu: <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Mansfield_5b3d.html" title="Battle of Mansfield">Battle of Mansfield</a>, which reversed the Federal advance in the <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_River_Campaign_50cc.html" title="Red River Campaign">Red River Campaign</a>; <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Port_Hudson_9646.html" title="Siege of Port Hudson">Port Hudson</a>, which was the final Confederate outpost on the Mississippi; <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Cedar_Creek_92d6.html" title="Battle of Cedar Creek">Battle of Cedar Creek</a>, Early's final defeat; <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_Tavern_6fc7.html" title="Yellow Tavern">Yellow Tavern</a> sees no mention; and weren't a few battles fought at <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winchester%2C_Virginia_6ad4.html" title="Winchester, Virginia">Winchester, Virginia</a>? <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harpers_Ferry%2C_West_Virginia_78f1.html" title="Harpers Ferry, West Virginia">Harper's Ferry</a>? <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Fisher_6b8e.html" title="Fort Fisher">Fort Fisher</a>? Of all those I listed as examples (and I could go on for a while) only Cedar Creek belongs on the menu (can't believe I missed that when I was helping compile the list). I like an unofficial two click rule: every major article must be no further than two clicks from this template. Adding the campaign suffices.

<dd>Wow, you are so strict!&#160;:-) I am not sure how you can cite a two click rule and then say you want to include Cedar Creek. I can see from this list that you are a Phil Sheridan man; maybe you can review my big updates to his biography recently. I think the Valley Campaigns of 1864 as a series of campaigns are more important than any of the individual battles. Cedar Creek was a rather lopsided battle that was only interesting because Sheridan got caught with his pants down. As for Yellow Tavern, that is a very overrated battle, barely worth mentioning if it were not for the mortal wounding of JEB Stuart. Sheridan portrays it as a grand victory, but it simply was a distraction from his normal cavalry operations that were needed during the Overland Campaign. As cavalry battles go, both Brandy Station and Trevilian Station are a lot more interesting. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 22:30, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah!

My obsessions lie in Missouri-Kansas and there's always a belief that the conflicts there are ignored as trivial compared to what happened in the east. At the risk of expressing too up to date opinons, quite frankly of many the battles and skirmishes in Missouri boil down to the issues we are seeing in the <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_War_58f4.html" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a> in which the U.S. has to decide whether <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_Fighters_8f6d.html" title="Freedom Fighters">Freedom Fighters</a> are non-uniformed combatants are<a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorists.html" title="Terrorists">terrorists</a>.

I am concerned that requests for data about the war will get completely out of hand. If we try to answer questions such as why there are 13 stars on the flag, then what is next? The sizes of the armies and the number of casualties on each side? Indicators of which battles were Confederate victories and vice versa? Perhaps the answer is that the portal can be used for summary data of this type (similar to the infobox on the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> article itself) and the menu can be reserved entirely for navigational links. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 16:53, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I propose to add the <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knoxville_Campaign_d73b.html" title="Knoxville Campaign">Knoxville Campaign</a> to the menu. As I was reviewing it, I noticed that Chickamauga is listed in Campaigns and in Battles. I propose to remove the former because there is no actual campaign article.

<p>I'm starting to have some of my templates dinged for not having a category. It would probably be a good idea for this template to have a category. Wikipedia is not very good right now on a logical or consistent heirarchy. Initially I would like to see a heirarchy of&#160;:</p>
<dl>
<dd>History templates
<dl>
<dd>War templates
<dl>
<dd>American Civil War templates</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Short term I think the "American Civil War templates" should be instituted and the various Civil War templates could be brought in. This proposal would involve creating the "War templates" as well the "American Civil War templates" category. But I wanted to discuss this. The History templates category is where the World War II navigation box is.</p>
