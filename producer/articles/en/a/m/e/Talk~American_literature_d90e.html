	    <p>This article is seriously in need of attention. It does not even start at the beginnings of American literature, in the colonial period, but rather the early 1800s.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This seems to be fixed</dd>

<hr />
<p>I'd like to suggest a greater section for science-fiction literature. Its one of the major American contributions to popular literature and deserves more than a couple sentences. Why not mention SF authors along with others in the piece?</p>
<hr />
<p>I guess this is just an aside, but is the fact that Walt Whitman "manages not to sound like a crass egotist" really NPOV? That's how he always came off to me, to tell the truth. Also, although I guess the "literary value" could be disputed, but I'm surprised not to see Stephen King listed among more recent American writers. I've never personally read any of his books, but they've been undeniably popular. Of course, as the previous writer(s) says, discussing current literature in this light is dangerous.&#160;:) Seems like I should be able to think of more writers if I put my mind to it, too.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This whole article is a mess. I got as far as Washington Irving sounding "comfortably European" and realized it was very much POV. Claining Poe is the first "American" fiction author is certainly not an opinion that is beyond dispute. -- <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDecumanus_9e44.html" title="User:Decumanus">Decumanus</a> 20:38, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I didn't really think it was that bad, although the claim about Poe bothered me, too. (I'd forgotten by the time I got to the Whitman thing.) The article roughly parallels works of American fiction I read in high school. Maybe my teacher wasn't very NPOV.&#160;:)</p>
<p>Does literature encompass non-fiction? Certainly one of the great early contributions to American writing would be <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Paine_c9d3.html" title="Thomas Paine">Thomas Paine</a>'s <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_Sense_8af3.html" title="Common Sense">Common Sense</a>, which was found in an enormous percentage of households of the day. (This is often cited as evidence that the early U.S. had an amazingly high rate of literacy before compulsory education.)</p>

<p>From reading the Post-modernism section that was omitted, I definitely agree that it should have been cut. On the other hand, should a post-postmodernism section then be included? And is this really an academic term anyway? It gets some hits on google, but I have never heard of a style called post-postmodernism in any of my undergrad or graduate Lit classes nor have any other of my student acquaintances that I've asked. A great many critics are trying to retool or cast off the label of postmodernism itself because it is too broad and widely abused, so, I would think post-postmodernism is probably a label that many writers and critics would not want to apply to anything.</p>
<p>It also says this movement started in 1970, but Gravity's Rainbow, the most widely recognized po-mo text, wasn't published until 1973. Morrison and DeLillo are frequently described as postmodernists, but the bulk of their work is from the 70s and 80s. How could post-postmodernism have begun while postmodernism itself was at best a nascent movement? As far as the description of the movement, the characteristics mentioned are either vacuous (what is a "soulful plot" anyway?) or identical to those associated with postmodernism. And the John Irving and David Sedaris works that I am aware of hardly qualify under the description offered; I'd seriously question if the latter, at least, even has any business in the article. I think maybe the whole section should just be ditched, but I didn't want to just do it without posting this first.</p>
<p>Also, with the postmodernism section cut, there is no mention of Pynchon, DeLillo, or Barth. These are three of the most highly regarded post-WWII American authors (three of the top four for Harold Bloom), and it seems like they should be mentioned. Roth and Morrison are relegated to being mentioned in lists in the ethnic writers sections, as though they are footnotes. Roth is Bloom's fourth author, and Toni Morrison is one of the few American authors to have won a Nobel. I think they deserve a little better treatment. 24.7.172.141 09:38, 3 November 2005 (UTC)MOB</p>

<dd>Postmodernism is most definitely a term that is used, unfortunately, and often. Contemporary fiction is also used, though, and I think we might consider changing the title here to Contemporary American Fiction. Essentially, this category should include all notable literary contributors who are not, well, dead. Thoughts?</dd>

<dd>Also, we absolutely do not need a "post-postmodernism." That's just silly. -Solana-</dd>

<p>I moved the article back to American literature. I believe the reason this article gets so few edits and attention is because it is listed under a strange title that is rarely used to identify the subject. American literature appears on Google a hundred times more frequently than "literature of the United States". You can see that the Wikilinks mostly direct to <b>American literature</b>. Also, 'of the United States' does not include literature of the American colonies. It also implies a contemporary focus, as in the body of the United States literary culture today. Other Wikipedias use American literature, and it is overwhelming the term used in the academic discourse. Most other literature articles use a national or ethnic adjective to introduce them. I don't think we should change this just because a few people object to the adjective that has mostly defined this subject. If they want to counter the most widely used term in the field, they can add a section at the bottom of the article with their objections. <a href="../../../t/f/i/User%7ETfine80_356f.html" title="User:Tfine80">Tfine80</a> 22:15, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does anyone else feel as if a work of literature should either stand alone as American Literature or go unlisted on this particular page? We might put a list at the bottom, with links, but a work is either American Literature or it isn't. It either fits into one of our (sloppy) periods of time, or it doesn't.</p>
<p>In short, I think that these works need to either be integrated or removed. Toni Morrison shouldn't be listed as a "black" author. She should be listed as an author - an American author. Much of the lower half of this page is ridiculous, and I'm going to start working on it if there aren't any objections.--<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackDayton_4fc1.html" title="User:JackDayton">J.Dayton</a> 15:05, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Theater isn't literature. Theater is theater. If we're going to start working with mediums outside of straightforward prose we'll need to decide how far we're willing to go. What about the Graphic Novel? I almost placed a section in on the American comic, myself, before I considered the problem of medium. The title of this page is not American Narrative, it's American Literature.</p>
<p>A section on American Theater should be added to the American main page, linked to the American Theater page, and removed completely from the American Literature page. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackDayton_4fc1.html" title="User:JackDayton">J.Dayton</a> 15:05, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>And, speaking of the Post-World War II Lit page, might we adjust the title to American Modernism? This, coming from most of the professors who I've spoken with on the matter, seems more appropriate. In general, the various sub-categories on this page make little to no academic sense.</p>
<p><br />
Just so you all know, I've completely re-written Post-World War II. I think it's making sense now. Cheers. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackDayton_4fc1.html" title="User:JackDayton">J.Dayton</a> 00:37, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
