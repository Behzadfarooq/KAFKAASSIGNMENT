<p>hi, i just checked the objectivity page discussion and history. I am not qualified to have a serious opinion on objectivity but i think no-one would fail to remark that you have done some really good additions to the article and that its a pity that instead of being congratulated you had to cope with criticism. By the way what do you think of the introduction to the article ["Objectivity may be considered as a synonym of neutral point of view..."]best--<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreece666_00f8.html" title="User:Greece666">Greece666</a> 18:33, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>My objections to "Objectivity may be considered as a synonym of neutral point of view" are well documented on the talk page and in the history of the article, which I deleted because of the the originality of the research, and which is also not allowed at Wiki. I believe the article in its current state is malarky. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerindianarts_504b.html" title="User:Amerindianarts">Amerindianarts</a> 02:55, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also might add that a "neutral point of view" in reporting, journalism, and editing according to Wiki policy is fine, but has little to do with the term "objectivity" in philosophy. In writing an article on objectivity in philosophy for Wiki the author should follow the guidelines for Wiki and the neutral point of view demanded for journalism. But such notions have little to do with objectivity as a concept of philosophy. You can check the various Encyclopedias and Dictionaries of philosophy and you won't find much on the concept, and there is a reason for this. The term is basically indefinable according to philosophic standards. For this reason it would be extremely difficult to write the article according to NPOV and without any original research, and the content of the article would also erroneous if referencing NPOV.<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerindianarts_504b.html" title="User:Amerindianarts">Amerindianarts</a> 21:48, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear friend, many thanks for your clear and quick reply.</p>
<ul>
<li>I agree with you that the article as it is now makes little sense.</li>
<li>since wikipedia is not the right place to post original research, i think the article is close to a dead-end.</li>
<li>i would also like to add that i found the section on plato highly misleading. i doubt that plato had the objectivity/subjectivity distinction in mind when he talked about episteme and doxa.</li>
<li>by the way, an effort is taking place to ameliorate the article on casuistry- as it is now it is quite confusing. maybe you would like to help a bit.</li>

<p>Hello, Ameridianarts. I noticed your attention to the Nietzsche page and how you added a little to the discussion there. If you'd like, you're more than welcome to the fray. The article could always use more competent people to contribute to it. Anyway, it's only a suggestion.

<p>Sorry that it took me a while to get to the third paragraph you were asking about. When I first saw your request on my talk page, I just saw "Kant" and jumped right in to the article. Eventually realized what you were asking for.&#160;:) I hope that my suggestions have been helpful for improving the article. Working on wikipedia is certainly a strange experience, as it attracts some strange editors (duck's breath, etc.). I can see why people often give up on wikipedia. Anyway, please let me know if I can help further with the Kant article.

<dd>Yes, Thanks. And yes, I have come close reaching the point of no return on WIKI a couple of times. The Kant article has a ways to go for 'A' quality and I will be quite busy with other responsibilities the next few months. Citation should be top priority for any editor since the article is considered "core". I am again looking at the 1st and 2nd of <i>Kritik der Reinen Vernunft</i>, re: <i>deises Begriffs</i>, and the translations by Meiklejohn of 1 and Smith of 2. The difference being the former translates it to "conception" and the latter to "concept", which makes a considerable difference when deciding if the statement in the article "time and space, which are not concepts" is verifiable without footnoting or qualifying. I will post the change to the talk page for comment. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerindianarts_504b.html" title="User:Amerindianarts">Amerindianarts</a> 20:40, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Any reason why not the cambridge texts in the history of philsophy edition (Guyer and Wood trans.)? They too use concept for 'begriff'.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, I'm coming to agree more and more that citation is paramount for the Kant article; but the article has so very far to come in terms of substance that I think it'll be awhile before its anywhere near 'A' quality anyway.... Li3crmp 20:35, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>All the more reason for tough scrutiny of new edits.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have the Meiklejohn and Smith editions handy for one thing. Second, to translate it as "conception" seems a better illustration of the genitive case as well as Kant's own writings (despite the "improvements" claimed for the Meiklejohn translation by others). Kant was explicit that the "original" representation of space is not a concept, and that there is but one space. Smith and translator's use of "concept" seems to contradict Kant's explanation of the construction of concepts when they use "concept of" to describe both "space", and "spaces", and Smith does. You can refer to the "concept of spaces" because in Kant the concept is a collection of intuitions, and spaces are intuitions of things where limitations are placed by the understanding within the "one space", but to use "concept" and "space" seems confusing at the very least, and "conception" better captures this point. So, comparison of these two translations suffices to illustrate this point as well as comparing Meiklejohn to Guyer, I think. I think also that the sentence in the article should be modified to the "original presentation of space is not a concept" and then a footnote added with an explanation.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Some time ago it was I who pushed for the addition of "not concepts", and it was a hot topic of discussion for awhile among the original editors of this article's current form. But I also think a detailed explanation is warranted. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerindianarts_504b.html" title="User:Amerindianarts">Amerindianarts</a> 23:45, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry I haven't been involved lately. Wiki editing is a particularly deadly form of dissertation procrastination, and I have been trying to be more disciplined lately. I have been loosely following some of the latest issues on the Kant page, but not closely enough to contribute.

Francis Schonken recently made a significant revision, which I reverted. We could of course talk about it. I really don't feel I or we own the article, but what he did to it is just ugly, IMO.

<p>Don't whether you checked the history but the article survived because I rewrote it completely. Peer review is likely to be negative because the term cannot and is not universally applied in philosophy. The lack of resources and the amount of original research needed to make the term comprehensible without actually defining it is the reason it was nominated for deletion-twice.<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerindianarts_504b.html" title="User:Amerindianarts">Amerindianarts</a> 06:58, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for your work on the topic. One of the reasons I nominated the article for peer review is that I find that having multiple interested editors working on an article tends to make it more well-rounded and neutral than having a single dominant author. If you think the article is in bad shape, then all the more reason to request assistance, I guess. Certainly there are many concepts (e.g. <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil">evil</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint.html" title="Saint">saint</a>) that have no universal definition, but for which there are quite adequate NPOV articles. When there are multiple points of view, instead of attempting to reconcile them into a universal definition, we simply give an overview of the various schools of thoughts, usually with links to other articles for more details. -- <a href="../../../b/e/l/User%7EBeland_b814.html" title="User:Beland">Beland</a> 18:24, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The best way I can describe it is that formal fallacies are a violation of a rule of logic, see e.g. the fallacy of <a href="../../../a/f/f/Affirming_the_Consequent_3de3.html" title="Affirming the Consequent">Affirming the Consequent</a> or Denying the Antecedent. Informal fallacies I would describe as intuitive, e.g. <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">Ad hominem</a> arguments can be a matter of opinion as to if the content is actually attacking the person, or the person's argument, etc.<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerindianarts_504b.html" title="User:Amerindianarts">Amerindianarts</a> 08:24, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
