<p>Especially in Germany AFN has been of great influence during the time after Worldwar II in getting more knowledge about the English language even it has been the American way of English.

<p>I did some cleanup work on the paragraph regarding DINFOS since it was...not untrue, but borderline (professionals in the broadcast field? Most are former/current military broadcasters) and misleading (not all broadcasters go through the advanced broadcast operations courses).</p>

<p>The Japan section implies that the station is only big in Okinawa and Kyushu, when in reality it stretches across the country, most notably in Tokyo on the Kanto Plain, and as far north as Misawa. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Halterman_044d.html" title="User:Mike Halterman">Mike H.</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Halterman_f64b.html" title="User talk:Mike Halterman">That's hot</a> 19:37, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As far as I can remember, there is a brief scene in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forrest_Gump_3eb5.html" title="Forrest Gump">Forrest Gump</a> where Forrest is watching a network that is apparently AFN and another soldier tells him something to the effect of "turn that junk off." May be worth noting just as trivia or to illustrate an anti-AFN attitude in Vietnam (if there was one). 71.211.48.49 22:06, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The actual line was someone asking "How can you watch that stupid shit??" when Gump was watching Gomer Pyle. While there was certainly an anti-AFN attitude when I served overseas about twenty years after this scene took place, I believe the context of the scene questions how anyone with combat service in Vietnam could possibly watch something like Gomer Pyle, which offered a very corny and unrealistic portrayal of military service during that era.</p>
<p>There's an anti-AFN attitude in every war, not just Vietnam and in every country, I know many other servicemembers will agree when I slur AFN with several derogatory insults and expletives. You have no idea how bad the broadcasting is until you must endure it yourself. - 203.205.122.196 22:58, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What does this string of words mean? "As of 2005 the Network has not liberal/progressive talkers Al Franken from Air America Radio and Ed Schultz from Jones Radio Network"?

<p>I spent three years overseas in varous postings from 1989-1992 and AFN was the only english language TV available. Most of the programming, with the exception of news and sports, was at least six months old. Moreover, instead of commericals, they air pentagon produced public service announcements, many of which were corny and rediculously condescending. This makes me wonder if entertaining the troops was actually a secondary goal of the service. I did applaud their effort to bring live sports to the troops overseas, however, the disadvantage to this is that in Japan, Sunday football broadcasts would begin at 2AM Monday and Monday night football would begin at 10 AM Tuesday Morning.</p>
<p>Oh c'mon I live in Japan and the games are nothing, (when the good ones are even shown on TV) whats even better is when they are tape delayed by 15 hours - 203.205.122.196 23:00, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article <a href="../../../f/a/r/Far_East_Network_499e.html" title="Far East Network">Far East Network</a> is listed in the backlog of articles needing wikifying from May 2006. The problem with that article, however, seems to be that most of it belongs in this one. There is text about AFN-Japan, post 1997 when FEN ceased to exist, which could perhaps be merged with what is said here about AFN-Japan. I was going to do just that, but I think you regular editors here would do a much better job. There is also a long chunk of unwikified history of the predecessors of FEN from 1942 to 1945 that might also come in here to complement the history of the same period in Europe. I know nothing about these subjects, just trying to help clear the wikification backlog.

<p>If I understand it correctly, the AFN is a government institution, since the military is one too, of course. Then how come the AFN broadcasts politically biased shows, such as Rush Limbaugh's?
