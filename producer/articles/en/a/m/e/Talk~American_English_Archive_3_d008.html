<p>Sorry I don't know how to fix this myself, but I noticed that there is an article for Trinidadian English (well, a stub), but it is not listed in the table on the side of this article. Someone who knows out how to edit that table should add it in.</p>

<p>(In the case of zydeco, there's a suggestion that it comes from a song beginning, "Les haricots...", but the Wikpedia article says this is contested and it certainly seems a long way from <i>les haricots</i> to <i>zydeco</i>.)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Questionable loanwords</span></h2>
<p>The loanwords list is goofy. Many of the loanwords, I'd guess 30%, are generally not considered English. They are considered foreign words, but everyone knows what they mean; there is a profound difference. <i>Cojones</i>, <i>frijoles</i>, <i>jefe</i>, <i>hombre</i>, <i>lagniappe</i>, <i>pirogue</i>, <i>Barangay</i>, <i>klahanie</i>, <i>skookum</i>, <i>da kine</i>, and <i>sayonara</i> are no more considered English than the equally commonly used <i>agua</i> or <i>adi√≥s</i>. <a href="../../../t/e/m/User%7ETempshill_7c70.html" title="User:Tempshill">Tempshill</a> 21:52, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Totally agree, for a loanword to be relevant it needs to express something not available in the host language. "Machismo" would seem correct, but "hombre" is just a figure of speach. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStamford_spiney_6c6c.html" title="User:Stamford spiney">Stamford spiney</a> 19:38, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not convinced that a list of actual loanwords is even relevant, is it? <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> 23:38, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>For the record, I have every intention of editing the article to get rid of the list in a few days if no one says anything. I think that the concept of loanwords in American English is relevant, but a list of them should only be used (in this article) to illustrate that concept, and, as such, only about five good examples would be reasonable. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickelShoe_2d9b.html" title="User:NickelShoe">NickelShoe</a> 16:06, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It certainly needs to be clarified. What does it mean to say that this is a list of words common in American English but not common in British English? Take <i>raccoon</i> for example. I don't suppose there are any raccoons in Britain, so the need for the word is relatively limited. But that doesn't mean that the word is unknown. I would guess that 99.9% of the population has seen them on American films and has no trouble coming up with the word when needed. Americans see raccoons more often so they use the word more often. But so what?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>By contrast, turkey and potatoes, both exports from America to Britain, have their names used all the time in Britain because people see them both every time they visit a supermarket. So all three words are known in both countries but the subject of one of them (raccoon) is seen more often in one country than the other. This may tell us something about the wildlife of the two countries but does it tell us anything useful about the language?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the rest of the list I would guess that most British know the words in the following list. But I doubt whether it's particularly relevant in an article about American English whether these words are commonly used by the British (or the Australians, or Canadians, or South Africans or anyone else, for that matter.)</dd>

<dd>It might be interesting to have a list of English that <i>verifiably</i> first entered the language in the United States (with no assertions concerning their recognizability in Britain, Australia, and elsewhere), but such a list should be a separate article, not part of this one. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">t…îk t…ô mi</span></sub></a> 18:50, 1 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's probably too strong a statement; as the following discussion shows, there are many ways in which American English is more conservative than English English, but there are also many innovations AE has gone through, and in those respects EE is more conservative.

<dd>It may be a brazen-sounding statement, but the fact of the matter is that Webster would likely have advocated abandoning "unnecessary r"s, if they were not pronounced in that day and age... Since he was one of the strongest advocates of retaining only "necessary" letters [and indeed, would have liked to have seen the abandonment of a great many that remain in American English spelling], I think that it would serve us best to give the benefit of the doubt to scholars who insist that General American, and the Midwest American English from which it stems, is the closest reflection of the pronunciation of that time, rather than some entirely contrived pronunciation that developed as a rebellious reaction to 17th century English imperialism... <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 06:40, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Where has the statistic <i>"As of 2005, it is estimated that more than two thirds of native speakers of English use various forms of American English"</i> come from?

<dd>Presumably someone has vaguely calculated that the USA population is approx 2/3 of the total populations of all countries that are "English speaking". I agree that this figure appears to be unsubstantiated. For example, if my quoted method of how this figure is arrived at is correct, then this would be to ignore the substantial number of the population in the US for which English is not their first language, and also to ignore the large number of people in other countries, for example, Sweden, Jordan and India, who speak English perfectly albeit as a second language (and which, by and large, tend to favour a non-American English flavour of English). What, after all, is a "native speaker" - the term seems rather ill defined, and is only being used because of common usage in the US educational community, where presumably it is equally ill defined if people were to think--jrleighton 15:01, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_speaker.html" title="Native speaker">Native speaker</a> is a very clearly defined technical term of linguistics.

These sources estimate that there are 337,297,000 native speakers of English, of whom 226,710,000 <s>thousand</s> live in the United States. (They estimate only 320,000 native speakers of English in India.) There may a problem identifying "native speakers of English who live in the United States" with "native speakers of Ameican English". After all, there are native speakers of other dialects of English who live in the United States, and there are native speakers of American English who live in other countries (like me!).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Assorted Comments</span></h2>
<p>I'm really enjoying this article - nicely done! I would like to put a vote for doing a pass throughout the article to ensure that easily understood examples of the often arcane characteristics discussed are present. These really help make the article readable by anyone (with a bit of skimming over the scary looking technical bits of it by us mere mortals) when given, and I would love to encourage more! An example of this might be in the:</p>
<p><b>English words obsolete outside the U.S.</b></p>

<dd><i>The subjunctive mood is livelier in North American English than it is in British English; it appears in some areas as a spoken usage, and is considered obligatory in more formal contexts in American English. British English has a strong tendency to replace subjunctives with auxiliary verb constructions.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Here, I was a little unclear (after reading the subjunctive mood link) on just what this was in the end - an example would be great for who are unfamiliar with this.</p>

I think they're pretty distinctive of Am.E. <small>‚Äî<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 171.64.133.51 (talk&#160;‚Ä¢&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_171.64.133.51_b868.html" title="Special:Contributions/171.64.133.51">contribs</a>) 23:52, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Unsourced? Sure! Vowels preceding [n] are nasalized most of the time, especicially if they are followed thereafter by another consonant phoneme. As I've said elsewhere previously, "can" (the modal verb (not the object, which is [k ∞√¶n]), is [k ∞…ôn] and "can't" is [k ∞√¶‚Åø î]. Interestingly enough, "cant" is actually usually [k ∞√¶nt ∞], my guess is because of the infrequency with which it's used in common speech. A particular favorite of mine, pursuing this example, is that a sentence in vernacular upper Midwestern such as "You can't help me?" is pronounced as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ju k ∞√¶‚Åø n…õlpÃö mi]</span> or emphatically (emphasis on any of the words) <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ju k ∞√¶‚Åø î h…õ…´pÃö mi]</span> or a positive question "you can help me?" <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ju gnÃ© …õ…´pÃö mi]</span> or emphatically (on the "can") <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ju k ∞√¶‚Åøn h…õ…´pÃö mi]</span> or emphatically with emphasis on any of the other words, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[ju k ∞nÃ© …õ…´pÃö mi]</span>. Delving further into this (which I find fascinating) will require bringing intonation markers into the IPA symbology as well. Whereas languages like Spanish and even German bring the emphasized word forward in a sentence, English instead changes the stress pattern of the sentence or phrase in a schema parallelling that of Yiddish and Hebrew. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 09:41, 26 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(A couple of irrelevant points. You should be using square brackets, like this: <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[skwÃ• eÀê'b…π√¶k ∞…ôts]</span>, because you're giving a very detailed account of the sounds, not slashes, which are only used when you're showing phonemes. Also, in the IPA, <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[y]</span> is a front rounded vowel, French <i>u</i> or German <i>√º</i>; the glide spelt in English with a <i>y</i> is spelt in the IPA as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[j]</span>. The American habit of pronounced "can't" so that it sound like "can" as you mention is very annoying. You should also stop it, and start pronounce "can't" like me, as <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/kaÀênt/</span>. ‚Äî<a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECassowary_89f2.html" title="User talk:Cassowary">toÀêk</a> 14:14, 26 January 2006 (UTC))

<dd>Yeah-yeah, the colon's enough to make it not even close.

(Ironically, I pronounce his surname <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">/k√¶Àênt/</span>, the same as I say the word "cant" as in jargon.

<dd>I recall a recent article in the Journal of the IPA mentioned that although lexically <i>four</i> and <i>for</i> are homonyms, the latter (and many other function words and pronouns) is more likely to have a reduced vowel. so "<b>I can di</b>p <i>that</i>" would be <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[a…™knÃ©d]</span> or <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[a…™k…ôÃÉnd]</span>while "<b>I canned i</b>t in <i>June</i>" would be <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[a…™k√¶ÃÉnd…™]</span> (notice they aren't stressed) while when both words are stressed they are the same. <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 21:49, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Accentless Dialect</span></h2>
<p>I have done a lot of observations as to determine what exactly the "typical" accentless General American dialect is. Far from being closed-minded or arrogant, I believe I speak with such a dialect. I have grown up in Eastern Pennsylvania between Harrisburg and Philadelphia, which means I am pretty much far enough away from "Pittsburghese" and the "wooder" of Philadelphia. I retain the rhotic "r" sound and only merge a few vowels. "Marry" is different from "Merry" and "Mary", which sound the same to me. "Pin" and "Pen" have very different vowel sounds. For me, "Cot" and "Caught" sound exactly the same to me, unlike the New York accent, where they drink cooahfee and wook the doo-og. I do not execute Canadian Raising as well (fire/fuire and about/aboat). I think these are the main characteristics of such a theoretical accentless American dialect. There may be others. Oftentimes dialects vary even in well-defined dialect regions. For example, the Rochester, NY accent pronounces the city as "Rachester" and they eat "sneeacks". This very much resembles some of the mountain dialects of the south. People from rural areas on the eastern seaboard seem to have very similar pronounciations whether they live north or south of the Mason and Dixon line. These are just some of my cursery observations.</p>

<dd>Some speakers, especially those in San Francisco, retain the distinction. According to <i>A Course in Phonology</i> by Rocca and Johnson, the vowel of <i>caught</i> can be lowered "to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[…í]</span> in North America, from where it can unround into <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[…ë]</span>" and the vowel of <i>cot</i> can also be "unrounded to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[…ë]</span>, and then often advanced to <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[…ëÃü]</span> or even <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[aÃ†]</span> in most words in GA and in most of the US south." <a href="../../../a/e/u/User%7EAeusoes1_f937.html" title="User:Aeusoes1">AEuSoes1</a> 07:29, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've looked at some of the lit. now. The natives I heard who didn't merge were in fact from in and around SF (The others, who didn't merge, were not necessarily Cal. natives.)

<dd>Those maps are not entirely accurate. The area of non-mergers in San Francisco is pretty much restricted to the city of San Francisco. Everywhere else in the Bay Area, the merger is regular among natives from the area. I have lived in the San Jose area my entire life (except when I went away to college and learned about the existence of the /…î/ phoneme), and have asked many people about their accents, and have never found anyone who grew up here but did not have the merger. I also work with several linguists who grew up in the Bay Area, and they agree that the cot-caught merger is a completely standard part of the local accent. I think the Phonological Atlas maps that claim San Francisco as an exceptional area is based on an extremely small set of data for the area. Not to mention the fact that San Francisco isn't even the largest population center in the Bay Area. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 19:29, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not only is it a non sequitur, but it's wrong as well. Non-central dialects of a language (dialects away from the main cultural hub of a language or from its point of origin) tend to be more conservative, and this goes for most languages; the idea that English has its own special reason for following this very typical pattern needs some strong support.

So the question is, why do some Brits feel the need to be so rude, and why would anyone get so upset by the spelling of "color"? <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 11:35, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's it exactly. Just as in the case of Spanish and Portuguese, New World users of English numerically outweigh those of the UK and its former colonies. What galls is the suggestion that American English is some sort of <i>d√©class√©</i>, upstart, bastardized speech. Fowler's <i><a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_English_Usage_b2a6.html" title="Modern English Usage">Modern English Usage</a></i> even stooped so low as to make fun of place names like "<a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>," as if "<a href="../../../w/e/s/Weston-super-Mare_49d9.html" title="Weston-super-Mare">Weston-super-Mare</a>" and "<a href="../../../w/o/k/Woking.html" title="Woking">Woking</a>" were their superiors in euphony.

<dd>I don't get why people think our two dialects are so different. So American spelling is slightly more latinized/latinised and British spelling is slightly more Frenchified. We sound almost the same, we use 99.99% the same words, and my guess is with the world "shrinking" our dialects are going to move closer together.<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECameron_Nedland_3a36.html" title="User:Cameron Nedland">Cameron Nedland</a> 17:18, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">American English and German roots</span></h2>
<p>Hi Angr- I also thought there were some problems with the new paragraph in the intro history section, but calling them "speculative" is not quite right. It's not sourced, to be sure, but the idea that American English is closer to the non-Norman roots of English is not speculative. I would certainly want a source for the idea that the British wanted to "beautify" English, but a slight variation on that notion wouldn't be very controversial either: that many in England, especially Samuel Johnson, held the view that Norman spellings were more "fine." I think rewriting that new paragraph would be better than expunging it (if only to encourage contributions by people who seem to be serious). I've no time at the moment, but I might take a stab at it in a couple days, unless you or others would object. --<a href="../../../c/u/l/User%7ECultural_Freedom_ebef.html" title="User:Cultural Freedom">Cultural Freedom</a> <a href="../../../c/u/l/User_talk%7ECultural_Freedom_51ac.html" title="User talk:Cultural Freedom"><i>talk</i></a> 08:31, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For the sake of discussion, here's the paragraph in question again:
<dl>
<dd><i>American English is considered closer to its Germanic roots in spelling and phonology than British English, which attempted to "beautify" the language by taking on many aspects of the Romance languages, especially French. The "a" in "bath," for example, is open and round in British English, whereas American English uses the ae-sound, as in the Germanic "√§". Many speakers of American English argue, then, that if someone says "can" with a flat a, then the word "can't" should be no different. Multiple examples of British English deviation from its Germanic roots exist. Also, words used in American English are reminiscent of those of the Middle English spoken and written by Chaucer, such as "fall" for "autumn" and "sick" for "ill," or "I guess" for "I suppose." American English intonation is more monotone and flat in comparison to the highly aspirated and up-and-down British.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I find little or nothing salvageable here. "Closer to its Germanic roots in spelling and phonology" is just nonsense. The vast majority of words spelled differently in Britain and America are words of Latinate origin (French, Latin, or Greek) anyway. The issue of when American English is phonologically and lexically more conservative and when it's phonologically and lexically more innovative than British English is already discussed on this page, in a much more coherent manner. The <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broad_A_1e2b.html" title="Broad A">broad A</a> of <i>bath</i> is a regular phonological change that, like all phonological changes, happened subconsciously in the speech of users of some dialects; to imply it was a conscious effort to make the language sound somehow "more like French" is absurd. As for American English being monotone, it might be possible using published sources to show that American English has less variation in intonation than British English, but even if it is, that doesn't support the poster's contention that American English is somehow less Romance-influenced than British English. And I don't have any idea what "highly aspirated" is supposed to mean; intonation has nothing to do with <a href="../../../a/s/p/Aspiration_%28phonetics%29.html" title="Aspiration (phonetics)">aspiration</a>, nor have I ever heard that British English in general has more heavily aspirated stops than American English in general. (Cockney is said to have heavy aspiration, but not all British English is Cockney.) <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 09:12, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree completely that the bit about the <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broad_A_1e2b.html" title="Broad A">broad A</a> and "aspiration" is highly questionable. As for the rest, I was trying to "interpret sympathetically." That the matter of American linguistic conservativism is discussed later on in the article, and doesn't need to be mentioned here, I can agree with. But the matter of the Normanophilia of British English (what the person meant, I think, by "beautify" -- again, I'm trying to interpret kindly) is an important aspect of the history of the divergence of American and British English, one that I think is worth salvaging. This matter has been studied somewhat extensively, in part by Shakespeare scholars. (Take a look at his first folios -- which can be found via a Google search within around 40 seconds: the question of why the first folios contained mostly -or spellings of words like <i>color</i>, along with, mostly, "center" instead of "centre," was one of the empirical data points examined by people looking into this Normanophilia.) Then there's Samuel Johnson's dictionary. --<a href="../../../c/u/l/User%7ECultural_Freedom_ebef.html" title="User:Cultural Freedom">Cultural Freedom</a> <a href="../../../c/u/l/User_talk%7ECultural_Freedom_51ac.html" title="User talk:Cultural Freedom"><i>talk</i></a> 2006-06-26 09:27 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I can't point to anything specific right now, but I've learned that the tendency toward the broad A in British English was an attempt to emulate the <i>a</i> of the Latinate languages in general, not necessarily just French. Remember that during Shakespeare's time and after many writers were pretty enamored with Italian. And although we might have a hard time finding a citation for this, I think the "fall" for "autumn" and "sick" for "ill," or "I guess" for "I suppose" idea has some merit.--209.242.228.152 18:26, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree that the fall/autumn &amp; guess/suppose idea has some merit, but sick (from OE) and ill (from ON) are both Germanic, so I don't know where the contributor got this bit.--<a href="../../../h/r/a/User%7EHraefen_512a.html" title="User:Hraefen">Hraefen</a> 20:08, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I always thought that the main reason Americans pronounced the 'a' in bath the way they do is because most English speakers who went to America were from either Northern England or Ireland. The long A, (is it called a Broad A) is only used in Southern England, and I think I've read in Melvyn Bragg's History of English that it originated in the cockney (working class London) dialect. Does anyone know any more about this?</p>
<p>The most obvious attempts in Britain to "beautify" English are 19th Century attempts to introduce French words for culinary instruments, cuisine etc. hence words like cuisine (which Americans use too, don't they?) courgette instead of zuchinni, aubergine instead of eggplant. 217.196.239.189 10:58, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm pretty sure the main reason Americans use the "flat A" in bath is because the "broad A" currently used in the south of England hadn't developed yet at the time America was first being settled by English people; or at least, it hadn't spread far enough yet. I don't know whether or not it started in Cockney, but I don't think it started until the 19th century. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 12:03, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Doesn't the debate (fist pounding argument) in England about the beautification of English go back to the 16thC., when the construction of new words from classical roots was considered by some to be a source of romanisation? Perhaps there was a conscious effort in the new world colonies to eschew these developments. Also, English people often remark that the Irish accent is much closer than their own to the American. Then they launch into a twangy trans-Atlantic verse of <i>House of the Rising Sun</i> (recorded by an English band) and spill beer over their shoes.--<a href="../../../s/h/t/User%7EShtove_8f32.html" title="User:Shtove">Shtove</a> 21:08, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Remarks by User:Cwalenta</i>:</dd>
</dl>
<p>OK - I have been attempting to edit the article on American English. Essentially the article argues that the greater range of accents in the eastern US vis-a-vis the western US is due to imitation of prestidgous forms of British English. While I acknowledge that there are MANY facotrs influencing the development of regional accents, the single greatest cause of language divergence is isolation. I specifically discount the imitation of British prestidgous British pronounciation because as little as 50 years after Jamestown, people begin to remark about colonial accents and the like and by 1776 there is clearly an 'American' accent.</p>
<p>If you take 20 people who speak English, split them into two groups and continue to isolate those two groups for 1000 years, odds are their progeny will speak two different languages. Essentially only two developments and the general increase in literacy have changed the pace of language divergence. The first was the printing press which standardized lexicon and syntax. The second was modern media, which was essentially the radio but of course the television cannot be ignored. This invention permits people to actually listen to a 'standard' form of the language over distances that in pre-industrial eras used to be isolated from each other. The longer any given area is in isolation the more language divergence you will see. In medieval times, isolation was much more common and we see this effect in the modern forms of English as spoken on the British isles. Considering the size of the UK its difficult to imagine how such language divergence could occur until you consider the length of time these areas were isolated from each other (really, people didn't travel like they do today, there is no interstate!) before the advent of the printing press and before the advent of modern media. In the case of Germany, the issue becomes even clearer: cross the Alps from Baden Wurtemburg into Switzerland and you travel from one German dialect to another that can't understand the others dialect.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while the word dialect is technically correct, the term accent is more descriptive in this case. The distinction between British English and American English and the various varieties really don't rise to the level of a different dialect in my view because the various forms are mutually intelligible, the spelling, syntax and grammar differences are relatively insignificant.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I have attempted to edit this article on several occasions and it continues to be edited back. I finally logged on and created a username. I went to the edit page and it acknowledges my theory but says that it should go up for discussion first. I am not particularly familiar with this system. But really this change should be made.</p>

I personally feel the explanation that Eastern Seaboard accents are distinct because of British influence to be more compelling, because frankly they <i>weren't</i> isolated from the rest of America; but my personal beliefs are neither here nor there. We need to find what the published sources say about it, and cite them. As for the difference between dialect and accent, it's true that "dialect" has several different meanings. The meaning you're thinking of -- largely mutually unintelligble spoken varieties that use the same standard written language -- is called "traditional dialect" by some people (J.C. Wells for example) and is more commonly used in reference to languages in Europe (not only Germany but also Britain: Yorkshire dialect, for example, means the traditional dialect that's virtually incomprehensible to everyone else; some Scottish people also refer to speaking Scots as "speaking dialect"). But the meaning of dialect that's usually intended by theoretical linguists -- especially when referring to American English -- is more like "set of idiolects sharing a large number of common features". Your accent is part of your dialect, but only the part pertaining to pronunciation/phonology. So we have to see what specific aspects of Eastern Seaboard English is being discussed. If it's only matters of phonology (non-rhoticity, "broad A", retention of the Mary/marry/merry contrast, etc.), then we can go ahead and refer to accents. But if the sources also claim that aspects of Eastern Seaboard <i>vocabulary</i>, <i>morphology</i>, or <i>syntax</i> are attributable to either British influence or isolation, then we have to say "dialect" rather than "accent". <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">User:Angr</a> 04:53, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Source for my theory is the "Story of English" - and actually the notion that the 13 original colonies weren't completely isolated is true, but there is still a high degree of relative isolation. When Thomas Jefferson went to Philadelphia he described the experience akin to travelling to a foreign country. In the other examples that I cite, ie. the major differences in dialect between Baden Wurtemburg and Switzerland, its difficult to say that the German speaking Swiss cantons were COMPLETELY isolated from the rest of Germany. Many people did not leave the counties that they resided in. And frankly the root cause of 'greater' language divergence being imitation of prestidgous forms of the English language as spoken in the UK doesn't really make sense because the English ships were sailing to ALL ports at ALL times and in particular as English in England was in a 'state of flux' (English has been in a state of flux since the Saxon invasion). Relative isolation of linguistic groups has caused language divergence in virtually EVERY language, including Spanish (where a variant takes on the form of a completely different language in Portuguese), French (look at the development of Provencal), difference in Italian between North and South. Long before the fall of the Roman Empire, Latin had slowly begun its drift into the various Romance languages despite the Roman roads and significant trade. So, really I have to lobbby for this change in the article to be made.</dd>

<dd>Well, actually the sentence "...these areas were in contact with England, and imitated prestigious varieties of British English..." is in the section on *Phonology*. But the "Regional differences" section, which is broader in scope, clearly states that "...After the Civil War, the settlement of the western territories by migrants from the Eastern U.S. led to dialect mixing and leveling, so that regional dialects are most strongly differentiated along the Eastern seaboard." When it comes to vocabulary, grammar, and syntax, the extent of British influence on Eastern seaboard dialects is mostly negligible. But such phenomena as r-lessness and, in New England, the broad A clearly show imitation of British speech. 100 years ago many people thought that r-lessness was "correct," now most people think it's "wrong"; Franklin D. Roosevelt, for instance, was non-rhotic to his bones; r-lessness used to be the norm in, say, New York. Yet some East Coast areas have been fully rhotic from the very beginning. And anyway physical and social mobility in the U.S. have doubtless favored dialect leveling, much, much more than in England---we don't have "U" and "non-U" words, for example. The bottom line is that the disputed sentence can be actually misleading and should be probably downplayed a little. Just my two cents' worth (or pennyworth?&#160;;-)... <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber"><font face="bookman old style"><i>JackLumber.</i></font></a> 13:20, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">American Lexicon: Red Light</span></h2>
<p>I made a very small change to this section in the seventh paragraph, sixth sentence. I changed the terminology from "Jump" a red light to "run" a red light. The reason I changed this is that in all of my life I have never heard anyone refer to driving through a red light as jumping a red light. Rather, the normal colloquial use is running a red light. Maybe the original author lives in an area where this is said...but I have lived in the South, Midwest, Rocky Mountain West, Southwest, and West Coast of the United States and have never heard this before. It could be an East Coast thing, but I know a ton of Easterners from DC, NYC, Boston, and Philly that have never used it either. Just my two cents...if someone needs to change it back to jump all I ask is that someone notes what part of the country it's typically used in.

<dd>No doubt that <i>run</i> has replaced <i>jump</i> _in current U.S. usage_, but that's pretty irrelevant to the sentence you modified, which illustrates some American-born traffic/transportation-related words that are now used *outside of the U.S.* <i>Run</i> (a red light) is not such a word (yet)---and indeed it's featured on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_words_having_different_meanings_in_British_and_American_English_e65a.html" title="List of words having different meanings in British and American English">List of words having different meanings in British and American English</a> (I put it there myself a couple months ago); <i>jump</i> is, and it's American-born too (source: <a href="../../../o/e/d/OED_54e7.html" title="OED">OED</a>). <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber"><font face="bookman old style"><i>JackLumber.</i></font></a> 12:52, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I generally hear run the light myself. I have, however, rarely heard the word jump, the context was 'jump the tracks' (ignoring red railroad crossing signals) - cwalenta</p>
