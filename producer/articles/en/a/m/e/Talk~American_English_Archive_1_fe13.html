<h2><span class="mw-headline">Spelling reform</span></h2>
<p>Having personally lost a city wide spelling bee over plough/plow (my elementary school used an Australian grammar series, American grammar books having already gone to hell) I still hold a grudge against Noah Webster. And its not anecdotal. Is there a page yet for spelling reform? There are certainly lots of 'em. This entry is going to shift to more substantive issues (17th century English as the base for American dialects, etc.) when a dialectician gets ahold of it, but I'm not up to that. --MichaelTinkler</p>

<p>Interesting readings about borowings in the American English. One small question. As there are a lot of <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovenes.html" title="Slovenes">Slovenes</a> in the States, did American English borrowed any words from <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovene_language.html" title="Slovene language">Slovene language</a>? I am missing any borrowings from <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German language</a>, too. I know some by heart - but I know just they are from <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a> (<i>flak</i>, <i>Einsatz</i>, ...), because I had never learned American English in deep. -- <a href="../../../x/j/a/User%7EXJamRastafire_2aa5.html" title="User:XJamRastafire">XJamRastafire</a> 18:58 Jul 29, 2002 (PDT)</p>

<dd><b>To Zoe</b> (edit conflict+)</dd>
<dd>We slightly do not understand each other&#160;:-). I didn't wrote that <i>Ansatz</i> is an American English word. I just wrote that I saw it sometimes in English articles, specially at math pages (see the link above). And I just asked for another borrowings to the American English (e.g. German, and specially for Slovene). I know common English, let us say for a 70-80 %, but I must say that this culture is still so different than mine. So that is why it is quite a big curiosity for non-native-English reader to get such useful (<i>why not usefull</i> - these are those 20-30 % of ignorance) informations and vice versa for English reader from different cultures and languages. And the Wikipedia is a good place for this!!!! Any futher help is very much appreciated. Best regard.</dd>
<dd><b>To Brion</b></dd>
<dd>Yes, Americans would know better than anyone. I am looking here of course for those with no obscure usages. Check the above link, too for instance. And by heart I think I saw it on many places. -- <a href="../../../x/j/a/User%7EXJamRastafire_2aa5.html" title="User:XJamRastafire">XJamRastafire</a> 15:59 Jul 30, 2002 (PDT)</dd>

<p>In the article <a href="../../../p/r/o/Problem_solving.html" title="Problem solving">Problem solving</a> <i>Ansatz</i> is simply translated to <i>an approach</i>. I would better tranlsate it as more general term <i>an equation</i> or <i>a formula</i>.

<dd>Likewise I dumped the above as being very common in the UK. I wondered about "fiesta" and "cookie" too, but I think they're not that common. Honestly who thought us Britons don't use "kosher" or "ok"?</dd>

<dd>The way <i>OK</i> was included was a little odd, I agree, but <i>OK</i> originated in the United States, and furthermore, its origin is well known and has been since approximately 1965. But I don't like working on articles with tables in them and usually avoid them, so it is up to someone else to fix this. (If I worked on the article, the tables would go.) The story on <i>OK</i> is, briefly, that there was a <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word_game.html" title="Word game">word game</a> popular in the United States in the early <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> of misspelling phrases and using only the initials -- not unlike the transformations of <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockney_rhyming_slang.html" title="Cockney rhyming slang">Cockney rhyming slang</a> -- in which "O.K." stood for "oll korrect". This origin was obscured by the subsequent combination of the phrase with the nickname of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Van_Buren_a34f.html" title="Martin Van Buren">Martin Van Buren</a> in the campaign slogan "Old Kinderhook is O.K." and the proliferation of many, many a <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_etymology.html" title="Folk etymology">folk etymology</a> in later years. The research by A. W. Read tracing the origin as stated here is accepted by both the <i><a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_English_Dictionary_872c.html" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a></i> and <i>Webster's III</i>. <i>OK</i> is, perhaps, the best known of all Americanisms and certainly belongs in the article on <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_English_16a3.html" title="American English">American English</a> as well as in an article of its own, which I have just half written. (Why the "Ask Oxford" article is less positive on this is a mystery since their own, more authoritative <i>OED</i> presents it, but "Ask Oxford" is a good source for all the folk etymologies.) <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">loanwords comemntary</span></h2>
<p>I think it should be noted that not all of the loanwords are common in all parts of the United States. In my section of the Midwest at least many of these borrowings, especially the Yiddish ones and Spanish ones not dealing with food, have not yet become standard vocabulary.</p>
<hr />
<p>A couple of the loanwords currently listed are, in my opinion, placed under the wrong headings. "Gumbo" is ultimately of African origin, but it entered English via Louisiana French. The same goes for "bayou" -- it comes from Louisiana French, which took it from Choctaw. In short, if English gets a word from French, it should be irrelevant where the French got it from. After all, we're not listing "adobe" as an Arabic loanword. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 19:54 20 May 2003 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Webster POV</span></h2>
<p>This page seems a bit disparaging of Webster, perhaps written from the perspective of someone who doesn't like his spelling reforms.

The situation is similar in countries like Pakistan, Ghana, Nigeria and Singapore etc. etc. When English is taught as a foreign language in Europe and elsewhere it is very often taught as British English through organizations like the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Council_e1fd.html" title="British Council">British Council</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">IHCOYC</a> is correct, at least regarding number of speakers. There are 341 million first language speakers of English, 210 million of those are in the United States (228 million in North America). There are 508 million including second language speakers, and 240 million of those are in the United States (260 million in North America). I'm not even accounting for some English usage being American rather than British (or another Commonwealth country) in origin outside of North America. It is also worrisome that some Wikipedia editors feel obliged to move pages and alter spelling on the basis that Commonwealth English is not only more correct, but is also more common than either American English or North American English. (My United States figures are actually a bit low since they date from 1984 and most of the other figures are from the late 1990s.) I believe the US probably has the most influence on the English language today, although only partially due to the influence of numbers. More of the influence is through movies, television, books, the internet, and other media. More immediately, I think Wikipedia would benefit from a clearer definition and analysis of the various types of English, including different orthographies.

<dd>The main thing that concerns me is when British English is taken as a familiar norm in descriptions of other languages. I've seen pronunciation guides that say to pronounce <i>Goethe</i> as "Gertie," for example. Reference to the variety of broad A and O sounds in British English are other frequent sources of confusion; most North Americans don't even hear the sounds as separate phonemes. Since the introduction of the IPA this sort of thing is seen less often, but there's still a lot of it in older reference books; and older reference books have a way of being perpetuated here.</dd>

<dd>Some writers on British English treat American English with profound condescension. This annoys especially when you realize that the prestige dialect of British English is strongly bound to social class --- you had to have gone to a handful of the "right" boarding schools to get it exactly right --- and a dialect spoken by a much smaller percentage of the population of the British Isles than Standard American is in North America. There's a passage in Fowler's <i>The King's English</i> that mocks American place names like <i>Indianapolis</i> and <i>Memphis</i>, as if <i>Bognor Regis</i> or <i>Stow-on-the-Wold</i> were superior in euphony or dignity. This tradition is not wholly dead among the prescriptive usage writers, and I think that some North Americans are still cowed by it. -- <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">IHCOYC</a> 13:58, 4 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Proper" British English is not simply the preserve of the public school elite - whilst it may be true that those from the public schools may be more likely to use RP in their everyday speech, most across the nation know how to use the correct form and do so for official documents etc., even if they revert to their local dialect for normal usage. Even though I was comprehensive-schooled (in Scotland nonetheless) I still know how to correctly use the English Language and so do those around me.

<p>Oh the superiority of everything American! Hah! Considering the linguistic inabilities of your president, the hilarity of watching winners of Oscars trying to construct sentences and the sheer inability of an astonishing number of American students to communicate in any even moderately articulate manner (which is why a number of European universities in the last five years have been forced to start summer courses for visiting American students with special 'basic english' grinds explaining such things as use of verbs, definite and indefinite articles, how to use the past tense!!!) America can hardly brag about its skill or knowledge of english. The lame excuse about comparing population numbers is a nonsense. American english (well at least the lliterate variety) is found on the American continent. The result of the world uses British english or a nativised version of British english, in which some aspects of American english may make an appearance. In no sense can American english claim the right to be <i>the</i> international brand of english and it is a particularly ludicrous form of arrogance to think it can, based on the fact that there are more people in America that in Britain, Ireland, Australia. But the worst form of 'so called' english has got to be MTV english, which consists of nothing more than a string of empty-headed, poorly constructed cliches with all the substance of a quarter pounder and fries.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">Fear√âIREANN</a> 14:41, 4 Aug 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not sure of the point of this discussion. Whoever added "oxymoron" to this article was obviously aiming tickle a few ribs with some humo<b>u</b>r. I am given to understand from the couple of business trips I've made to Sweden that they very sensibly take courses in Business English (which leans towards British English as much of Sweden's business is cent<b>r</b>ed on the EU) and Technical English (which leans towards American English for spellings like 'program' and 'color' extensively used in software). Whatever the figures say (and I dispute the validity of your source Daniel which quotes only 11 million speakers of English in India from a 1960s survey) there's no denying that a significant number of people prefer to read and write in British English. It's just the same with American English of course; only the vast majority of British English speakers don't live in the state of technical bliss that is the USA. On Wikipedia we quite rightly have a policy at <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPOV#Americo-centric_point_of_view" class="external free" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPOV#Americo-centric_point_of_view" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPOV#Americo-centric_point_of_view</a> decrying Americo-centrism in view of the fact that this is an international encyclop<b>a</b>edia.

<p>You are a bit behind the times as regards english dialects. The days when Oxbridge english was viewed as the correct version have long long since gone. Right now, a BBC programme is on using scouse (a dialect I hate, BTW. It sounds to me like a cat chewing a wasp.) But BBC Four seems to require it. 'Proper english', ie, Oxbridge, has been out of fashion for decades, with Estuary English, Scouse etc far more popular. BTW 2 (sounds like a TV station that!:-) I came across a US student's history essay that has down in my university's history as one of the worst attempt at communication ever witnessed. (You'll enjoy this!) Writing about the Irish <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_Rising_cc3a.html" title="Easter Rising">Easter Rising</a>, an American woman (allegedly a history major, though I find it hard to believe!) wrote:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>It is like the Irish don't like the english and their rules. So they like rebel in Easter. Patrik (sic) Pierce (sic) leads the rebells (sic) and they take a big post office in Oconnel (sic) street, and they gang up on the British. And they tell them like 'no queen here'. But the english don't like it and send in their soldiers from the first world war in France or somewhere to stop them. And the english like arrest Pierce and devillera (sic) and lock them in a big prisom (sic) but the Irish keep rebelling and rebelling and get their new republic with devillera as president and Michael Collin's (sic) becomes his right hand man. And then they fight a war of independents. And the Irish throws the english out and then have a civil war, where Collin's is killed at Bale na Bla (sic) and Northern Ireland joins england and the queen.</i></dd>

<p>AAAAAGH! And that is only <i>one</i> paragraph. The strange thing was that the woman could not understand when she got a fail mark for the paper! She said she had never failed anything before in her life. The question on all our lips was, how could she have possibly <i>passed</i> a single exam in her life, let alone make it to college?

There are indeed many US high schools who would look at that paper and see that the student had learned where the event took place, who the combatants were, and kept in mind enough proper nouns to make small talk about the Uprising.

When they get to MO, Southern Il, and Arkansas they don't tend to do enough studies, especially as the demographic centor of the US is in MO. I can't find the article, or perhaps it was this one, but there was one a few days ago which listed the differences in the Saint Louis Metro Area from Midwestern English. The blurb wasn't quite right but it was right in the fact that the Peoples inside Saint Louis City and in parts of the county talk different than lets say 30 miles away in Franklin and Jeffereson counties and that the dialect is unique to St. Louis. It was wrong becuase it grouped accents in the saint louis area which are actually in deep Franklin Counties and Jeff Counties. The accent in Tennessee is actually pleasent compared to that of your typical Ozarkian.</dd>

<p>I'm confused by this too. The first definition of 'hacienda' isn't distinct from 'estate' as used by Americans, so I figured not to include it.

The SAMPA annotations are cumbersome, not as well-understood or commonly used, and pointless in the dawning age of Unicode.

<dd>"American English" is an unambiguous name for the subject matter. <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_English_5a4b.html" title="US English">US English</a> is the name of a rather controversial political advocacy group for the exclusion of other languages from American public life. The top Google hit for the expression "US English", by the way, is that group: <a href="http://www.us-english.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.us-english.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.us-english.org/</a> That might make "US English" a rather <i>more</i> ambiguous expression, oddly enough -- Wikipedia should have an article about the group, and what should that article be called? --<a href="../../../f/u/b/User%7EFubar_Obfusco_9a7a.html" title="User:Fubar Obfusco">FOo</a> 04:45, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with the current title. "American" is commonly understood to indicate the United States. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaurreen_1d2b.html" title="User:Maurreen">Maurreen</a> 04:52, 7 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Firstly, please don't pedantically expound on what <i>I'm</i> objecting to. It comes off as rude, especially when you're wrong.</dd>

<dd>"American English" is obviously <i>not</i> unambiguous, as you'd see if you'd read this talk page. Some people writing here are assuming the article covers <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_English_79ce.html" title="Canadian English">Canadian English</a>, which it doesn't. A good example of "<i>ambiguous usages that confuse people.</i>" Why do you think there's a disambiguation page at <a href="../../../a/m/e/America.html" title="America">America</a> and a whole disambiguation article at <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a>?</dd>

<dd>I've never heard of the "U.S. English" advocacy group, and no Wikipedian has found it significant enough to write about. This can be handled using the standard disambiguation methods. The organization can be at U.S. English (organization), and the language at <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._English_7f1a.html" title="U.S. English">U.S. English</a>, or if you really think someone will confuse one with the other, at U.S. English language.</dd>

<dd>To a linguist, "American English" means only English as spoken in the United States, unambiguously and precisely. English spoken in North America is "North American English". English spoken in both North and South America (which isn't really a meaningful grouping from a linguistic perspective) is "Pan-American English" or "English as spoken in the Americas". There is nothing ambiguous about "American English". The fact that some people may be confused by that doesn't make it ambiguous, it just means they're not familiar with how the terminology is used. That's why it says <b>in the first sentence</b> that American English means English spoken in the United States‚Äîto clarify for those people who might be confused. The proposed alternative, "U.S. English" has the disadvantage of not being the normal term used by experts in the field in addition to being the name of a controversial organization. The ambiguity cased by the name "American English", which only affects those people who think that American primarily refers to the continents, is much less significant than the ambiguity caused by "U.S. English". On balance, "American English" should be preferred. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 00:57, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
