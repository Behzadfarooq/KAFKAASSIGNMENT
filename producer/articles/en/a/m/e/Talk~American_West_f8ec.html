<dd><i>Most commentators today recognize the distinction of the Census Bureau for a number of reasons including ... examples being laws restricting sex toys.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I've spent the last couple of days trying to find any source that defines the <i>American West</i> using these criteria. Admittedly I'm an amateur, but I found no such source. I did find the <i>American West</i> to be an academic study area, with many museums and heritage centers scattered across the country (from Oklahoma to California), and that it is a major part of the tourism industry in those many states. It would seem to me that if <i>most commentators today</i> (or even <i>many</i> or <i>some</i>) were true, I would have at least found a trace. A reputable source would be helpful if this section is to be verified. <a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDialUp_ed76.html" title="User:DialUp">DialUp</a> 8 July 2005 14:12 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have seen it before and I will try to find something. But the rest of the passage is facts. The official west does not include states such as Texas. I have lived in the West my entire life and have never heard such a thing. We are not only different by location but philosophical outlooks as well. I would say that to include Texas in the modern west is inaccurate, esp. as the Census is the definitve source for the modern west. To include such states as the historical west before Manifest Destiny is fine, but not in the present. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlobeism_e3ea.html" title="User:Globeism">Globeism</a> 23:01, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Visit cnn.com or any other news organization, only the states considered to be the West by the census are such at the present time. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlobeism_e3ea.html" title="User:Globeism">Globeism</a> 23:05, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>It's taken a long time but I tried my best to check CNN (although they're not my view of an ideal source). I didn't find any articles saying the <i>American West</i> was defined by prostitution, same-sex marriages, polygamy, and such. Here are my searches: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=gambling&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;c2coff=1&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=american+west&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=cnn.com&amp;safe=images" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=gambling&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;c2coff=1&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=american+west&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=cnn.com&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">"american west" +gambling (0 hits)</a>; <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=same+sex+marriage&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;c2coff=1&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=american+west&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=cnn.com&amp;safe=images" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=same+sex+marriage&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;c2coff=1&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=american+west&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=cnn.com&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">"american west" +same +sex +marriage (0 hits)</a>; <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=marijuana+medical&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;c2coff=1&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=american+west&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=cnn.com&amp;safe=images" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=marijuana+medical&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;c2coff=1&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=american+west&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=cnn.com&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">"american west" +medical +marijuana (1 hit, but the terms were unrelated)</a>; <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=polygamy&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;c2coff=1&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=american+west&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=cnn.com&amp;safe=images" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=polygamy&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;c2coff=1&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=american+west&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=cnn.com&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">"american west" +polygamy (2 hits, but they refered to the American West, not the census region)</a>; and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=prostitution&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;c2coff=1&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=%22american+west%22&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=cnn.com&amp;safe=images" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?as_q=prostitution&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;c2coff=1&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=%22american+west%22&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;lr=&amp;as_ft=i&amp;as_filetype=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_dt=i&amp;as_sitesearch=cnn.com&amp;safe=images" rel="nofollow">"american west" +prostitution (0 hits)</a>.</li>
<li>Also some of the facts presented are incorrect. For instance, polygamy, while not specifically authorized, does not appear to have been illegal in any US territory before 1862, and was never legal in Utah. Polygamy was prohibited in the territories by Congress under the Anti-Bigamy Act of 1862, the Poland Act of 1874, the Edmunds Act of 1882, the Edmunds-Tucker Act of 1887, and by the Utah constitution before statehood was granted. I believe Utah is actually the only state with a constitutional clause banning polygamy. The same-sex marriage facts are wrong and also something of a red herring when trying to identify the West; Utah for instance amended its constitution in 2004 to define a marriage as being between a man and a woman, and anyone anywhere can propose any law. And prostitution, although allowed in about 10 counties in Nevada, prohibited in a couple more, and neither prohibited nor legal in the rest, appears to relate only to a single state, not a region. Even so, no source has been provided that says any of this is relevant to delineating the borders of any geographical area.</li>
<li>Also, the US Census Bureau region "West" is not the <i>American West</i> and was never intended as such by the Census Bureau. The Bureau is alway quite specific that their regions are for statistical reports only and do not define historical, cultural, or geographical regions. From their website—"Census regions are groupings of states that subdivide the United States for the presentation of data." Other agencies have official regions too. One might want to look at the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Image%7EBureau_of_Reclamation_regions.png_ffc3.html" title="Image:Bureau of Reclamation regions.png">Bureau of Reclamation map</a> to see the only congressionally approved "West". As stated on the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Talk%7EAmerican_West_archive1_e405.html" title="Talk:American West/archive1">archived talk page</a>, the term <i>American West</i> was never used to refer to any region east of the Mississippi, and the history of those regions is addressed in <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trans-Appalachia_b8f6.html" title="Trans-Appalachia">Trans-Appalachia</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manifest_Destiny_e614.html" title="Manifest Destiny">Manifest Destiny</a>. The frontier ended in the 1890s with the opening of Indian Territory and there has been no further westward migration which might have moved the borders.</li>
<li>I'll copy this section over to the other article when it's completed, if that's all right. <a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDialUp_ed76.html" title="User:DialUp">DialUp</a> 03:34, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>In American West studies the West has always been defined by a sense of libertarianism, not the authoritarianism prevelant in the South. Those above mentions are facts, while Utah amendmed their Constitution it was nowhere near the level of support seen in the south and the Governor is the one who proposed the bill to allow another form of recognition, not just somebody.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If the American West article gets merged with the Western United States it should be in the history and the map should not reflect the purported territory of the American West. The Western United States is defined by the government, namely the Census, however we can use a different shade to designate states that have been considered Western by history. For users this is the best approach, it allows them to easily identify the government recognized region and the historical regions at the same time. With your approach they can only identify the historical West and not even the whole thing, its missing the Northwest Territory for example.</li>

<dd>Dailup can you propose any solutions that will take both into account? I suggest we have a color to designate the government recognized region and another shade to designate the historical region.

<li>Well, the article has been redirected, but I still hope that some responsible administrator will fix it.

I would point out that we also have a topic <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_West_dfa6.html" title="Wild West">Wild West</a>. <i>American West</i> seems to be an effort to cover a culture, somewhere between the outright myth of <i>Wild West</i> and the factuality of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_United_States_afd6.html" title="Western United States">Western United States</a>. It seems to me that any cultural issues covered at <i>American West</i> could as easily be handled at <i>Western United States</i>. If there is eventually enough material to merit an article on Culture of the American West or Culture of the Western United States, we could spin that out of <i>Western United States</i> at a later date. I don't see the advantage of an article at the title <i>American West</i>. If there is a case for that, someone should state it clearly.</li>

<p>You're right. I'm a dumb illiterate. That's why I can't read or turn pages. Maybe that's why I can't find the references you say says Oklahoma and Texas are <i>may</i> or <i>may not</i> Western states and why I can't find the consensus you talk about.

<dd>Well, I've lived in Texas virtually all of my life. Also, I don't think anybody here has said Texas isn't part of the West. What I personally have said is that it's part of both -- a curious, wonderful amalgamation. It's its own entity. It takes from both geographic regions and cultures. It is both West, and South, and because of that not quite exactly either. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 03:37, July 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You've got the question backwards. The question is, "Is there any definition of the West that doesn't include Texas?" The answer is no. No university in the West that has a Western Studies chair or department ever ignores Oklahoma, Texas, or any of the plains states in any comprehensive study of the West. I notice that someone has erased this article and forwarded readers to a page that now tries to pretend California and the other West Coast states are not part of the West. How bizarre.

<p>Stressed. Hardly. This is the kind of activity you expect from teen-agers. Disappointed. Yes. The welcome on my discussion page listed a lot of pages that talked about citing sources and all kinds of noble ideas. Since my interest is the American West I have quite a number of books published by some of the most respected people in the field. I thought some of that would make a nice addition to the American West article. Turns out that all that noble talk was hot air. Nobody here cares about references and sources. Yes, I am disappointed. You know, if you and your buddy really believed yourselves, you would both be over fixing the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_United_States_764b.html" title="Southern United States">Southern United States</a> that say Texas is <i>always</i> part of the South and the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> page that never mentions the West. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDHarjo_e00d.html" title="User:DHarjo">DHarjo</a> 22:34, 19 July 2005 (UTC) If you really are teenagers, I apologize.
