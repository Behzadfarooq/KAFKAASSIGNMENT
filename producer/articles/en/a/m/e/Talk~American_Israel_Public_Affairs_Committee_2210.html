<p>A large portion of AIPAC's strength is derived from right wing christians who believe Israel is the key to armageddon; so I'm suprised they aren't included in this article. It would be helpful if someone knowledgeable in this topic could add something to the article. --<a href="../../../h/o/k/User%7EHokiefan_d6c6.html" title="User:Hokiefan">Hokiefan</a> 01:37, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the role of evengelical Christians in the Jewish lobby is generally exagerated, and anyways religious Christians are not really represented in AIPAC itself. Since this article is not really about the entire Israel-US relationship I don't think that the role of right-wing christians is particularly relevant.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 01:46, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P.S. It is customary to add new sections to the bottom of the talk page rather than the top of the page.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 01:46, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, the role of Evengelical Christians in their support of Israel is incredibly strong and is not based on Israel being the key to Armageddon. The bond exists because Christians in general believe in the Jews as the Chosen People of God and respecting Jews and Israel is instrumental in being a good Christian. Some ministers like Pastor John Hagee go even further and make ministering about Israel a top priority. Pastor Hagee is the Founder and National Chairman of Christians United for Israel. Other well-known ministers like Rev. Jerry Falwell and Gary Bauer are on the Executive Board of Directors of CUI as well. However, I do agree with Moshe that the Christian-Jewish relationship would be beyond the scope of this article. <a href="../../../j/t/p/User%7EJtpaladin_87ec.html" title="User:Jtpaladin">Jtpaladin</a> 22:49, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wikipedia should be NPOV. And whether your views of AIPAC are positive or negative, noone can deny their power as a lobbying organisation. Indeed, they boast of it on their websites as a key attribute. Therefore the section on "Lobbying Power" should remain.</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you think AIPAC lists lobbying as one of its strengths, you can quote them doing so in the "Strengths" section. As for the other quotes, there is a section for them all down below, and you can add any relevant ones. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:05, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lobbying power requires its own seperate section as it is absolutely integral to the way the organisation works. If you accept that the material should be there just in seperate sections, then this is really an argument over semantics, and the Lobbying power section should remain 12 May 2005
<dl>
<dd>The article already has plenty of material dealing with this, as well as a section for quotes. Just because you think it is important doesn't mean it requires its own section, which in fact includes nothing from AIPAC itself, and instead just has your own POV about AIPAC, combined with a couple of quotes from American politicians. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 12:15, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The quotes are from AIPAC's own site. They provided the material, and indeed openly publicise it. The fact that you want to suppress information about this organisation suggests strongly that you are trying to impose your own POV on the article. Lobbying power is a key part of what AIPAC is. I think if anyone is trying to impose their own POV it is you. May 12th</dd>

<p>Jayjg, perhaps you should reedit the article including the quotes, in the activities section if you think that is best. I don't think it is fair to just remove content - the article is way under the maximum under current guidelines, and the content is important. Otherwise we will just be repeating these childish tit for tat changes, and it would really be better to come to some kind of consensus.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article already contains this information. Lobbying is mentioned right up front, so is pro-Israel. If you think the quotes are extremely important, why don't you include a couple at the end. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:00, 12 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article as it is currently written comes across to me as if it came directly from AIPAC's PR department. It needs major POV work. -<a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECab88_fc4f.html" title="User:Cab88">Cab88</a></p>
<p>It seems that AIPAC is more loyal to Israel than the USA itself.AIPAC should be outlaw as a terrorist organization for promoting business and arms to the terrorist state of Israel.With these organization,the possiblity of a Palestinian state is Zero</p>
<p>User Cab88 is correct. The current entry is 100% Zionist propaganda that fails to acknowledge AIPAC's life or death power over American politicians and journalists. Tell the truth!!!</p>
<p>I've rewritten the article to at fix the POV issues such a making sure all subjective or debatable pro-AIPAC claims are attributed to it's AIPAC and it's supporters and making sure the views of it's critics are covered to at least some degree. Hopefully now we can stop having a edit war over the appropriateness of NPOV tag. -<a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECab88_fc4f.html" title="User:Cab88">Cab88</a></p>
<p>Please, will those trying to keep the blantantly POV version stop waste our time by removing from my NPOV additions as I am more then willing to revert them back as often as needed. If you have a problem with any additon of mine then please discuss on the talk page first. -<a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECab88_fc4f.html" title="User:Cab88">Cab88</a></p>
<p>As I promised I reverted to the NPOV rewrite once again. I would say to Jewbacca, who suggests I need to talk about revisions befor making major edits, so far as I know no such rule exist. Besides, my revision was not exactly a wholesale rewrite. I keep much of the original material, simply adding attribution to the claims made to AIPAC and it's supporters so as to separates simple facts from debatable claims. The main POV issues with the original article and why it was POV are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The article's claims as to why AIPAC is a effective as they is in POV.</li>
<li>The claim that AIPAC represent both Israel and US interest is also POV. Some people disagree with claim.</li>
<li>AIPAC does have it's share of critics and for this article to be NPOV it must include their views on AIPAC.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now Jewbacca, as I stated before, If you have problem with any part of my rewrite then please discuss it here. As long as you refuse to explain what it is about my rewrite you don't like and simply revert the article then I will revert it back. -<a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECab88_fc4f.html" title="User:Cab88">Cab88</a></p>
<p>Jewbacca, your rewrite was less POV then the old version you kept reverting too but you can't simply leave out the critisisms of AIPAC just because you disagree with them. Articles like this need to have a counterbalancing viewpoints. Only presenting AIPAC and it's supporters views is not NPOV and I'm sure you know that. I've added back the paragraph omn it's critics after doing a rewrite and citing external sources. Let's not have another round reverts as you must know by know I do not give in easially. When you make major edits or reverts it is best if you explain what your concerns/complaints were here at the talk page just as I have done above. -<a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECab88_fc4f.html" title="User:Cab88">Cab88</a></p>

<p>Greetings. I just completed a substantial revision. It's not a rewrite, because I did not delete any existing text or opinions. I added information on AIPAC's activities and accomplishments, and noted some important missing information such as the resignation of president Steiner and other controversies. I also added a quotations section, to which I invite contributions. I especially would like quotations specifically and overtly praising AIPAC. I could not find enough of those on my own.

<dd>That's a very apt quote, thanks Jayig. It's great that you found one from the same May 2004 conference pictured at the beginning of the article. A couple more like that ought to round out the quotations section.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A. S. A.</a> 17:38, Feb 4, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I thought it went well with the picture. I'll try to see if I can find other quotes. However, I have a fundamental problem with all these quotes; I believe they should actually be transwiki'd to Wikiquote, and a link provided here. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:49, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I confess I am still a newbie in many respects, and transwiki-ing to Wikiquotes is above my head. I will have to read up on that soon. Mainly when I've added quotations to articles I just used other articles which already had such a segment as a guide. I know there's a lot more to it under the surface though.

<dd>I do not. What specifically do you regard as POV, and what is your suggested NPOV rewording?--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">A. S. A.</a> 16:23, Mar 19, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well maybe it shouldn't have an NPOV tag. But it definitely needs more critical sources and analysis. There are many sources extremely critical of AIPAC, and currently (with quotations section, etc) this article reads like an AIPAC press release. Lots of the information (particularly quotes about how great Aipac is, over and over throughout the article) doesn't seem particularly relevant, or at least redundant. There doesn't seem to be any objective analysis of what AIPAC does --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacobolus_a4a3.html" title="User:Jacobolus">jacobolus</a> <a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacobolus_e323.html" title="User talk:Jacobolus">(t)</a> 21:15, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The "controversy" section is currently larger than the actual description of the article. The quotes list both criticism and praise. It's hard to understand how it could be more NPOV. What percentage of the article should be devoted to criticism; 70%? 90%&#160;? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 05:46, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've reorganized the material so that it is better serperated into appropriate sections.

<p>Given "its analysis of the voting records of U.S. federal representatives and senators" I think that it is fair to say that AIPAC <i>keeps a close watch on said representatives</i>.</p>
<p>Given that "its (<a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew_Watch_3bfd.html" title="Jew Watch">Jew Watch</a>) stated purpose is "Keeping a Close Watch on Jewish Communities &amp; Organizations Worldwide."" qualifies it as *anti-semitic as a matter of fact* --Tony Sidaway|Talk 15:05, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC) and Exactly right. Jayjg (talk) 15:54, 5 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is logical to deduce that Jew Watch is anti-semitic because it is keeping a close watch on these organizations because they are Jewish.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, logical to deduce that AIPAC is anti-congress and anti-senate because it is keeping a close watch on these organizations.</p>
<p>Given that these officials represent a significant element of the U.S. representitave system, it could be said that <i>AIPAC keeps a close watch on the workings of the U.S. representitave government</i> (democracy), it is, therefore, logical to deduce that AIPIC is, in fact, <b>anti-democratic</b>.</p>
<p>As a result, I'm still puzzled as to why this article describes "They (AIPAC critics) also say that AIPAC wields undue influence over Congress". It is obvious that AIPAC is <b>anti-democratic as a matter of fact</b>. This should be changed. --<a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle.bungle_6936.html" title="User:Uncle.bungle">Uncle Bungle</a> 02:04, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Let's get quite frank for a moment. I love Jews, and I am a big Jew-lover from way back. In fact, I'm 1/4 Jewish! Got a nice Jewish grandma, that I call my Nan. She is a kind old lady who would never advocate the daily slaughter of Palestinian people. My point is, hey, if you're a Jewish American, that is great, more power to you. Right on, Jewish-American! But if you want to go on about how Israel is such a great country and BLAH BLAH BLAH like almost every hyper-pro-Israeli Jew does in America, then I say, WHY HAVEN'T YOU MADE ALIYAH YET??? GET YOUR ASS TO ISRAEL NOW, YOU FRIGGIN' HYPOCRITE! Quit dragging me, a Gentile, into your silliness by lobbying MY government to fund your routine killing of the indigenous population. If you want to kill Palestinians, do it on your own dime, asswipes! Better yet, make ALIYAH now and beautify America by ridding us of your grotesque and hypocritical Zionist selves.

<dd>typical rightwing old-school Zionist BS, Jayjg. But let's lay out a fact... 99% of Americans are not Jews. The continued lobbying of the US government to tow a 100% pro-Israeli line has already had negative repurcussions for the majority of the people of the United States and will eventually have VERY negative repurcussions for Israel and quite possibly American Jews. AIPAC doesn't care about the Jewish people, they care about an already outdated idea. The point of the surely nutty rhretoric above (what you labeled as "I love Jews, Jews out of US" or such, is probably there simply to alert American Jews to the fact that AIPAC is hypocritical at best. Israeli Jews consider even so called "left-leaning" pro-Israel American Jews to be slightly to the right of Sharon. The basic message of the post, though obscured by silliness at times, seems to be: if you think Israel is great and worthy, then make aliyah. And that is so bad?

<p>I don't know how keeping on eye on the voting records of Congress makes AIPAC "anti-Democratic". Lots of organizations watch the voting records of Congressmen. That's what political orgainzations do. AIPAC is interested in seeing that a pro-Israel stance is followed by Congress. What's wrong with that? Nothing. Groups like "Jew Watch" post links to some very absurd things like, "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion", whereas to my knowledge, AIPAC does not post links to scams and lies. So there's a huge difference between AIPAC and Jew Watch. That I even have to point this out is absurd. <a href="../../../j/t/p/User%7EJtpaladin_87ec.html" title="User:Jtpaladin">Jtpaladin</a> 23:10, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that the article is biased, but am more concerned with the introduction and the general statements about this organization's aims. We read "on behalf of a strong U.S. - Israel relationship", and "in the best interests of Israel and the United States" and so on as if AIPAC is equally devoted to both countries and balanced between them. This is of course rubbish and one only has to read AIPAC's own description of itself to see that it is rubbish. "AIPAC members are involved in the most crucial issues facing Israel.", "For more than two decades, AIPAC's Political Leadership Development Program has educated and trained young leaders in pro-Israel advocacy", these are accurate statements from AIPAC's own summary <a href="http://www.aipac.org/documents/whoweare.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aipac.org/documents/whoweare.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. And AIPAC's list of its "current agenda": "Stopping Iran From Acquiring Nuclear Weapons", "Standing By Israel to Ensure the Security of the Only Democracy in the Middle East", "Defending Israel Against Tomorrow's Threats", "Preparing the Next Generation of Pro-Israel Leaders", "Educating Congress About the U.S.-Israel Relationship". It is completely obvious that AIPAC is <i>primarily</i> interested in Israel's welfare and that their support of American interests consists mostly of the "Israel's interests are also America's interests" type of argument. Wikipedia's description is more whitewashed than AIPAC's own description. Surely we can be at least as honest as they are. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 07:53, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>AIPAC has often been a controversial organization, and I believe the simple coverage in the article of the relatively recent public scandals and controversies gives to some an impression of bias which does not actually exist. Are we to refrain from mentioning that these investigations, resignations and public embarrassments occurred, simply to avoid the appearance of unbalance? That would be censorship. To justify the placement of a POV tag, actual inaccuracies, falsehoods and defamations must be outlined and proved, must they not? Let us begin this dialogue on a point by point basis, to resolve the concerns of POV. Also, if balance is what some editors are looking for, perhaps some research into concrete and specific accomplishments of AIPAC can be included? We already have a list of quotations of praise alongside those of criticism, but the "Successes" section are could use a little more specificity. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 11:02, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Paul Findley despite what you say, is today considered radical. It is common poilicy to be respectful of your opponent after winning an election, I would hardly say he was well-respected after he publicly accused Zionists of virtually blackmailing the entire American government. Even so I could see how quotes could be used in certain passages of this article to understand the criticism of Aipac, however, the passage that I removed supported no greater thesis, it basically exists as a one line attack on the organization. It is completly inappropriate to stand alone as it does.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 20:55, 28 February 2006 (UTC)P.S. Sorry, I originally meant to say congressman not senator.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here is the review from Amazon.com of his book <i>They Dare to Speak Out</i>, bold emphasis added:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The first book to speak out against the pervasive influence of the American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) on American politics, policy, and institutions resonates today as never before. With careful documentation and specific case histories, former congressman Paul Findley demonstrates how the Israel lobby helps to shape important aspects of U.S. foreign policy and influences congressional, senatorial, and even presidential elections. Described are the undue influence AIPAC exerts in the Senate and the House and the pressure AIPAC brings to bear on university professors and journalists who seem too sympathetic to Arab and Islamic states and too critical of Israel and its policies. Along with many longtime outspoken critics, new voices speaking out <b>include former President Jimmy Carter, U.S. Representative Cynthia McKinney, Senator Robert Byrd, prominent Arab-American Dr. Ziad Asali, Rabbi Michael Lerner, and journalist Charles Reese</b>. In addition, the lack of open debate among politicians with regard to the U.S. policy in the Middle East is lamented, and AIPAC is blamed in part for this censorship. Connections are drawn between America's unconditional support of Israel and the raging anti-American passions around the world-and ultimately the tragic events of 9/11.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is entirely POV to take upon yourself to declare who is discredited and for what reason. If a man can serve 22 years in Congress and write best-selling books that deal directly with the subject of this article and still not be considered worthy of being quoted along with other critics of AIPAC, then there is something very rotten in the state of Denmark. It's censorship anyway you slice it.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 21:22, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Give me a break, show me a review on amazon that isn't positive, they're in the business of selling stuff. Do you cry censorship everytime someone deletes something that you write? This is wikipedia, people delete stuff when they don't belong in an article, get over it. One more revert and you'll break the 3RR.</dd>
<dd>I haven't seen anything that says "They dare to speak out" was a bestseller, and even if it was it is irrelevent. When someone decides to blame all of a nations problems on a vast Zionist conspiracy that means they are not a neutral source, it doesn't matter who they are.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 22:16, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are <i>thousands</i> of reviews on Amazon.com that are HORRIBLE and extremely negative. It is their policy to let stand any unfavorable reviews that readers want to append to a book or movie. Yes, people delete stuff on Wikipedia all the time, and do you know what else happens all the time? Other editors disagree and do not allow the deletion to stand. That's something <i>you</i> will have to get over. I do not cry censorship everytime something is deleted. Only when they advance such directly biased arguments as you have done. The man served in Congress for 22 years! And you don't even know what he actually has to say. By no manner of means does he "blame all of a nations problems on a vast Zionist conspiracy". He alleges vast undue influence of a foreign government on the Congress of the United States resulting in unbalanced American foreign policy. Regardless of your opinions or mine, he is a successful author and long time congressman and you simply will not be allowed to censor his remarks on AIPAC.</p>
<p>Also, you clearly have no idea all what the <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia%7EThree-revert_rule_1a38.html" title="Wikipedia:Three-revert rule">3RR</a> is! I suggest you read it properly. I made <b>one</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Israel_Public_Affairs_Committee&amp;diff=41598684&amp;oldid=41462578" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Israel_Public_Affairs_Committee&amp;diff=41598684&amp;oldid=41462578" rel="nofollow">revert</a> on 02/28/2006, and one minor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Israel_Public_Affairs_Committee&amp;diff=41598996&amp;oldid=41598684" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Israel_Public_Affairs_Committee&amp;diff=41598996&amp;oldid=41598684" rel="nofollow">edit</a> involving uniform Wiki style section and subsection spacing. To violate the 3RR, you have to revert 3 times in a 24-hr period. I reverted once, not twice. Just to show you how wrong you are about Wikipedia policy, even if that second edit was a revert instead of a minor organizational edit, I could still have reverted a third time on 02/28/06 and not violated the 3RR. To commit that violation, you have to actually make a fourth edit. As it happens I made one revert only.--<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 13:29, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually your exagerating, the fact that you reverted my edit three times without making any other substantial additions would constitute a violation of the 3RR, although looking back it was not in a 24 hour period. Also I'm sick of people arguing that anything a person says is relevent in an article by virtue of the fact that they hold a position of authority, or because they have excelled in something that should be irrelevent. Just because Gary Trudeau was successful as a satirist doesn't mean it is okay to quote him stating the George Bush Sr. is an idiot on Bush's article.</dd>
<dd>Also your talking about the reader reviews, I was referring to the professional review at the top, I have never encountered one for any product that isn't positive.</dd>

<dd>Your tenacity in holding on to the assertion that Paul Findley is still well respected and "mainstream" is just wrong. Obviously his rhetoric isn't as explicit as what may appear in Jew watch, but it is clear what his beliefs are. It is his position that America invaded Iraq primarily on behalf of Israel and called this "America's darkest time". It was an exageration when I said <i>"blame all of a nations problems on a vast Zionist conspiracy"</i> I should of said <i>"blame all that is wrong with a nation's government on a vast Zionist conspiracy"</i>.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 03:35, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You still persist in manifest misinterpretation of policy. You are flat wrong about what constitutes the 3RR, and I would lay off your 3RR threats in edit summaries here and in other articles until you digest the concept that 4 reverts in a 24 hour period constitute a 3RR violation. As for condescension, if you would reexamine your "advice" for me to "get over it", you may want to heed your own advice where condescension is concerned. An editorial review on Amazon.com is more valid <i>because</i> they allow readers to post negative ones alongside them. In any case, the positive review is not exaggerating or falsifying when it quotes collaborations from <b>former Presidents</b> and current public figures in Findley's updated books. You don't get that it doesn't matter what you or I think his views are or if you or I think they are too extreme, you may not take it upon yourself to disallow his criticism. Furthermore, you are falsely quoting me. I never said he was "mainstream", I said he was a 22 year US Congressman and a best selling author, one who moreover wrote a book dealing mainly with AIPAC, and you are flat out trying to censor his comments and saying he is irrelevant and extreme.

Frankly, the lunatics who expressed their opinions in the book, "They Dare to Speak Out", are for the most part are disgruntled wackos. Former President Jimmy Carter, U.S. Representative Cynthia McKinney, Senator Robert Byrd, Jesse "Hymie Town" Jackson, and Dr. Ziad Asali are nut-jobs with an axe to grind. While I agree that their quotes regarding AIPAC are appropriate and should be allowed into the article, I would also caution that these people have a screw loose and display hostility towards Israel. The problem is that some of these people were or are still in Congress and other areas of govt. and by that qualification alone should be allowed to be quoted in the article. If we were dealing with people outside of govt., like private citizens, then unless they have some qualified, special knowledge of AIPAC, then their quotes would not be appropriate for the article. Regardless, caution should be taken in who is quoted. I hope this helps. <a href="../../../j/t/p/User%7EJtpaladin_87ec.html" title="User:Jtpaladin">Jtpaladin</a> 23:30, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The relevance of David Duke's opinions on a working paper is unclear. Presumably David Duke also supported Bush against Kerry in 2004, but notation of that fact is probably not included on Bush's wiki page. There already exists criticism in the paragraph directly suggesting that the authors are anti-semites, and the inclusion of David Duke seems needless, provocative, and out-of-context.

<dd>I know it was... I don't deny that he said that.

<dd>Since they've been accused of being as grossly anti-semitic as Duke, and since they support Duke's thesis, it's obviously quite relevant here.

<dd>That is faulty logic. Do you have proof that they "support" his theses? Indeed, they do not "support Duke's thesis", nor, for that matter, are there any references to such. If you can reference that they support his "arguments", that would be great. Otherwise, it quite clearly appears to be an attempt to blacken their names via association. Unless we are back in the McCarthy hearings, it is disheartening to see such "evidence" here. You are also engaging in a common argument fallacy: A supports B, therefore B supports A.

<dd>Your argument is specious. Hitler supported abortion, but it would be completely inappropriate to describe pro-choice arguments as, say, "Pro-choicers argue, like Hitler, that..." simply because of all the additional baggage of Hitler. David Duke is known as more than an anti-Semite, but as a Ku Klux Klan racist: to associate the paper's authors with him in a similar such manner is aggressively POV. If the paper's authors specifically paid homage to Duke, or otherwise even referenced him, that would be one thing. But simply because his detractors make that association is insufficient. That several pro-Israeli newspapers and organizations made the comparison, just as many pro-life organizations connect Hitler to pro-choicers, is irrelevant and, again, specious. <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiloki_c505.html" title="User:Lokiloki">Lokiloki</a> 07:24, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is a well-known pro-Israeli news source. While it might fit the standards of wikipedia's "reliable sources", it simply seems needless and specious to include the Duke reference, as it is clearly designed to associate the authors with him in an unflattering way. I don't see how it is any less relevant than, say, including the Carter statements on settlements to others who hold similar anti-settlement views in the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_settlement.html" title="Israeli settlement">Israeli settlement</a> article (which you deleted). I understood your point about not including the Carter statement there, but I can't help but question when you assert that this roundabout association is somehow relevant here. <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiloki_c505.html" title="User:Lokiloki">Lokiloki</a> 07:51, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Loki, it's clearly relevant that a Kennedy School of Government paper on supposed pro-Israeli influence in the U.S. was praised by an anti-Semite like David Duke, the PLO's mission to Washington, and a senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood. This is mentioned by the source we link to, and so it isn't original research, regardless of your view of the source. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:57, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(can't keep up with how many colons to include)... I never claimed it was OR, but that its relevance as criticism to the referenced article is questionable, not least because the criticism already includes multiple assertions, including those of anti-Semitism. To say, in effect, "look, look, that crazy David Duke guy also says similar things" is specious. Simply because A and B might share similar beliefs about a particular topic, does not mean that A should be associated with B's other beliefs, as this implication herein suggests. I do not deny that such references should be included on Duke's own page, but to include said references on the page of this reports authors who have never expressed any relation, knowledge, or association with Duke is inappropriate. <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiloki_c505.html" title="User:Lokiloki">Lokiloki</a> 08:07, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Scarborough is a right-wing political opinionist, and the WaPo reference was to the Sun mention. Regardless, I do not doubt that he made the quote, it is just that the relevance is debatable. Care should be taken when associating a scholarly article published under the (arguable) aegis of Harvard with the views of an admitted Ku Klux Klan member. It seems a devious way to discredit. <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiloki_c505.html" title="User:Lokiloki">Lokiloki</a> 08:34, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

If you can find other people supporting the paper, it would make sense to mention them as well. I didn't go out searching for Duke; rather, the sources listed him as the most notable supporter. As for the scholarly nature and Harvard's aegis, the former is debatable, and the Harvard seems to be distancing itself as far as possible from the article. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 08:38, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a pretty low opinion. The inability to criticize AIPAC without associations with anti-Semitism, or its sad proxy David Duke, is disturbing. I have not yet read the report, but I try to assume good faith on two presumably very well-educated PhDs at two of the top institutions in the US. Again, the relevance here is debatable: Jayjg deleted my inclusion of cited claims by Jimmy Carter that settlements were at the heart of the PIC saying "so?"... why should the opinions of a US president, who brokered the most long-standing peace treatment in the ME, on a subject of international significance bear any less than, say, the opinion of a marginal racist on a scholarly publication? <a href="../../../l/o/k/User%7ELokiloki_c505.html" title="User:Lokiloki">Lokiloki</a> 08:45, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're making a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman.html" title="Strawman">strawman</a> argument here. No-one is asserting that criticism of AIPAC is anti-Semitic; frankly, I'm none too impressed with the organization myself. However, people are asserting that this particular paper by Mearsheimer and Walt, which claims an organized cabal of Jews has taken control of America's foreign policy (to the detriment of the United States), is anti-Semitic. It's not hard to understand why some people would view that as anti-Semitic, seeing as it's the same nonsensical conspiracy crap that anti-Semites regularly spout. As for your continual repetitions of the "Jimmy Carter" argument, to begin with, we're talking about <i>this</i> article, not some other article. In addition, as has already been explained, Jimmy Carter has no particular connection to issues of Israeli settlements. On the other hand, David Duke has quite a strong connection to both American politics, and accusations of Jewish cabals controlling American foreign policy. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 09:08, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry to butt in so late in the game, but the David Duke/Jimmy Carter comparison struck me. I think Lokiloki is right. If Carter, an elder statesman who routinely travels around the world on peace missions (and moreover was the architect of the Camp David peace), and comments on all sorts of iniquities and problems, if such a man can be deleted as irrelevant re the Settlements, then the inclusion of Duke's comment here is flimsy indeed. Its a guilt by association ruse, and unworthy of this article. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 15:39, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Carter is an ex-president, who has nothing to do with the settlements, and whose Camp David accords never dealt with them. He may comment on all sorts of things, but I don't see the papers running to him for his opinions about the settlements. On the other hand, Duke talks about the Jewish lobby and its insidious effects on American foreign policy all the time, and the media has apparently run to him to find out his opinion on this specific issue. There is no comparison. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:36, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can see two editors who have objected, you and AladdinSE. The key to deciding whether to include material is whether it's properly sourced and relevant. There's no disagreement about its sourcing, so the argument is over whether it's relevant. Given that David Duke frequently takes the same position as the report does, and is vilified in part for that reason, it's clearly relevant that he publicly voiced his support. Readers can then take one of three positions: (1) maybe Duke isn't so bad after all, (2) maybe there's an anti-Semitic thrust to the report, or (3) this is guilt-by-association; I'll judge the report on its own merits. What isn't acceptable is for us to decide on behalf of the reader that only (3) is the appropriate response. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:58, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think the main problem is the fact that it mentions David Duke, it's that the manner in which it mentions him is obviously done to discredit the report. To make this article NPOV, someone needs to do a little bit more research into the reaction to the report, and provide some more detail other than just saying "David Duke supports it, but everyone else..." There have been other people besides David Duke who have either voiced support, or made the point that it at least highlights the need for more open dialogue about our Israel policies. For example, Daniel Levy, an advisor to the Israeli prime minister, wrote in Haa'retz that the case made in this paper is a "potent one" and that "Israel must not be party to the bullying tactics used to silence policy debate in the U.S. and the McCarthyite policing of academia by set-ups like Daniel Pipes' Campus Watch. If nothing else, it is deeply un-Jewish. It would in fact serve Israel if the open and critical debate that takes place over here were exported over there".71.129.159.1 01:45, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In answer to Jayjg's rebuttal to my post above: Carter is an elder statesman that has traveled to the occupied territories on peace missions and who has <b>direct expertise</b> with the Arab-Israeli conflict. He is more qualified then most to comment on Settlements. You don't see the press running to him for comments? I disagree.

This is what Duke is. Under Wikipedia's own guidelines, he is by no means a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable source</a> qualified and untinctured by bias.

<dd>I agree that the inclusion of Duke is an attempt to negate by association and "poison the well". I think it is inappropriate and pretty low-down; the original reference to him was clearly a guilt by association tactic by a well-known pro-Israel newspaper. This fallacious argument seems similar to, say, referencing Erik Rudolph when discussing pro-lifers, or Hitler when discussing pro-choicers (both of which are frequently referenced in quasi-mainstream press).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It sounds like you have some good references to Carter and his capacity for valid commentary on the settlements. Perhaps my initial inclusion was injudicious, but given your research, I encourage you to include the reference in <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_settlements.html" title="Israeli settlements">Israeli settlements</a>.</dd>

I was asked to take a look here - if Duke's opinion has indeed been propagated in the media, but others feel that the inclusion of his opinion here is 'pretty low', would people mind if the reference to him was rephrased a little just to lessen the perceived 'well-poisoning' look of it? Something like: <u>The paper was referenced as a "wake-up call" by Daniel Levy,[16] a former advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.[17] A Haaretz editorial declared: "it would be irresponsible to ignore the article's serious and disturbing message...The professors' article does not deserve condemnation; rather, it should serve as a warning sign."[18] Separately, the paper was also praised by <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Duke_357b.html" title="David Duke">David Duke</a>, the former Louisiana representative and white supremacist known for his anti-Semitism.</u> Would this be a bit better? <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERamallite_7adc.html" title="User:Ramallite">Ramallite</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../r/a/m/User_talk%7ERamallite_904e.html" title="User talk:Ramallite"><font color="DarkBlue">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 06:09, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course there is... inclusion of highly polemic individuals as supporters or opposers of particular arguments is old-hat for propagandists. It is akin to including references to <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josef_Mengele_eb4b.html" title="Josef Mengele">Josef Mengele</a> (who published on abortion, and who ran an abortion clinic) when discussing pro-Choicers. It is guilt by association. The report was published by two highly reputable academics (to wit, Harvard and UofC are two of the best Unis in the world)... a pro-Israel newspaper included references to Duke to imply that the report was nothing but base anti-Semitism.

<dd>Except that David Duke is still highly respected for some people, it may be hard to understand because you reside in New York and I'm in California, but David Duke is highly respected in some circles, not the circles you or I would want to be around, but still they exist. Mengele's supporters are far more on the fringe. I would say Duke is more along the lines of Al Sharpton, because he has adopted or at least pretended to adopt more moderate views.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 07:09, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree with that. I think the public views of Al Sharpton were once pretty damn similar to the ones David Duke used to have. Obviously us on the western and eastern seaboards know he is a ignorant douchebag, but in southern states people still generally support him. Look at the accusations that Sharpton levied at people during Tawana Brawley scandal, and that was even after he had become mroe mainstream. I really don't think Sharpton is that different from David Duke.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 08:44, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Moshe, you don't come back from the KKK, you just don't, not in America. Sharpton has come a long way since Tawana Brawley, but he was never a <i>racist</i>, he fell flat on his face for wrongful <i>accusations</i> of racism. Since that debacle, he has built up a genuine record of civil rights credentials (and this coming from a person who was never a big fan of his). There is a gulf impassable between the two personalities and political realities. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAladdinSE_2015.html" title="User:AladdinSE">AladdinSE</a> 22:24, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We are clearly at variance as to the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> guideline. The issue is very much that David Duke is not reliable. The plenty of press you refer to has no qualitative analysis of his considered opinions, only shock value that this racist has supported it. Your "reference" is the right-wing neo-con New York Sun, and all they say is: <i>"The paper has won praise from <b>anti-Semite</b> and <b>white supremacist</b> David Duke"</i>. That's <i>it</i>. Zilch analysis. No comment or quotation from Duke himself. It is a unadulterated case of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_fallacy.html" title="Association fallacy">Association fallacy</a>, specifically <a href="../../../r/e/d/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum_0887.html" title="Reductio ad Hitlerum">Reductio ad Hitlerum</a>. <i>David Duke likes this paper, therefore this paper must be bad</i>.

<dl>
<dd>For years – even decades – U.S. citizens have been the subject of a political action campaign designed and executed by Israel. Currently, Israel's campaign is part steady-as-she-goes and part improvisation to neutralize an unexpected and – for Israel – worrying development. So far, Israel's covert political action is succeeding hands down. Americans are gradually being indoctrinated to believe Islamists are today's Nazis and that there is no "Israeli lobby" in America. <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/scheuer/?articleid=8827" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.antiwar.com/scheuer/?articleid=8827" rel="nofollow">[18]</a></dd>

<p>A link to the complete transcript between former AIPAC president David Steiner and Haim Katz was deleted because they said the source was unreliable. However, if the editor had bothered to click the link they would have seen that the page has a photo of the original Chicago Tribune article on the controversy over Steiner's remarks. They would have also noticed that the page includes the transcript that is completely accurate (except for the small inaccuracy of the letters "ds" coming up as "David Steiner AIPAC" each time, but this is a minor issue. The fact remains the transcript is accurate and should be linked to in the article since it is available for everyone to read.</p>

<p>I think it is clear that there is nothing wrong with this being added to the page. I would encourage others to read over the transcript and add more to the article to explain the situation even more. Walkerson 21:10, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What makes a section too long when it has relevant and informative information? Also the tapes authenticity is not in dispute by anyone. The original tape was turned over to The Washington Times and reported by many press outlets.

<dl>
<dd>It's an unreliable source. That means everything on it is unreliable, including transcripts, scans, and anything else. As for "relevant and information information", that's your take. In fact, it made the article about a single conversation with one individual, rather than an article about the organization. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:11, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That is how you add to an article on wikipedia, piece by piece, bit by bit. This is how an article becomes a more thorough article. Next someone will fill out a different section, but it won't get anywhere if you keep deleting things. The episode in question is very significant and that is not only my take but, that of the weekly magazine Forward as well, to mention only one source that you may think is relevant and informative. If we went by your standard of what is an unreliable source we wouldn't be citing any sources as even the NY Times and the Washington Post get it wrong some of the time. We have to judge each page on its own merits and the page I linked to has no incorrect information. AIPAC never disputed the transcript. IN FACT, David Steiner admitted to the authenticity of the tape. If you look up AIPAC on Nov. 12, 1992 in the Chicago Tribune archive website you will find the article and you can also look up AIPAC on the Nov. 4 and Nov. 5 1992 in the Washington Times archive or look it up at the News Library News Bank website where you will also find corroborating evidence. The information may be difficult for some to comes to terms with, but it is both factual and relevant and should not be deleted.Walkerson 22:36, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Again, you must provide reliable sources; anything not reliable sourced can be removed. You can't just assert such sources exist, you must provide them. As well, the article is about AIPAC, not about one conversation Steiner had. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 22:46, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I gave you all the sources you need. All you have to is follow the directions. The Chicago Tribune 300 word article can be found in their archives to prove the first scan. The Washington Times has a 936 word article on Nov. 4 1992 breaking the story and a follow-up article of 736 words the next day. To repeat, these are available at the News Library Newsbank. As I also stated the Jewish weekly The Forward thought this was a very significant episode in the history of AIPAC and said so in a one-page editorial. This episode had real repercussions on the relations between the Clinton administration and Israel which is exactly what AIPAC was concerned with at the time. It is their very raison d'etre so please don't poo poo it and call it only a conversation. The conversation has some very interesting things to say and people visiting an encyclopedia should be able to read it. If you have a problem with style help to finesse the passages. Haim Katz, the gentleman on the other end of the line told the Washington Times that he taped the conversation because "as someone Jewish, I am concerned when a small group has a disproportionate power. I think that hurts everyone, including Jews. If David Steiner wants to talk about the incredible, disproportionate clout AIPAC has, the public should know about it." Please stop deleting factual info. Walkerson 23:07, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If this is true then why don't you link to the actual chicago tribune article? Instead you link to this strange "What really happened" propaganda website. I am once again deleting your additions until you can link to a reliable source.

<p>If you would do a little digging instead of knee-jerk reverts you would see that a portion of the Chicago Tribune article is on the What Really Happened page. I have no concern with the rest of the site. I only link to this page since all of the information is fact and it has pictures of the original articles and transcript backing up the quotes provided. Please stop deleting factual information. Go to the Washington Times website or the Chicago Tribune website to see the corroborating evidence. Jayjg is the one that has almost violated the 3RR and you have come awful close as you deleted three times without even coming here to the discussion to discuss your reasons, failing to recognize the sufficient corroboration that has been provided, or doing just the least amount of leg work to see the facts for yourself. I am editing the passages, adding more facts, providing more sources, discussing it here. But you both seem to want to delete it no matter what and explain yourselves after when pressed. I thank Jayjg for at least coming here to discuss and showing some desire to discuss it civily even if he is quick to revert. Walkerson 23:55, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Walkerson, it's not up to other editors to provide reliable sources, but rather for those who wish to include the information to do so. Please find some reliable source for all these claims, then we can examine what is actually relevant to this page. Oh, and even it something happens to be "factual info" (as it may or not be in this case), that doesn't mean it belongs in an encyclopedia article.

<p>The paragraph itself is false, since the paper never claims that the "Israel lobby" is "motivated primarily by AIPAC". Indeed, the actual article does not make that claim, stating instead it is motivated by a "loose coalition of individuals and organizations". Moreover, the paragraph does not state anything specific about AIPAC itself.

<dd>The "The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy" paper was originally pulled out of the AIPAC article into its own article to deal with it appropriately -- thus to pretend now that it isn't relevant to the AIPAC article at this point is strange and it falls into a classic strategy mentioned in Wikipedia's no censoring policy, pull out damaging information into its own separate article and then orphan it. I understand that I could be mistaken though. I didn't write the summary you are trying to remove and I can't at this moment remember editing it, although I might have. Anyways, the paper does clearly refer to "American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organzations" as "the key organizations in the Lobby". There are currently 171 news stories that mention AIPAC in connection with the Mearsheimer and Walt story in Google News too thus this connection isn't spurious: <a href="http://news.google.com/news?sourceid=ie7&amp;rls=com.microsoft%3Aen-US&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf8&amp;tab=wn&amp;q=Mearsheimer+Walt+AIPAC" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?sourceid=ie7&amp;rls=com.microsoft%3Aen-US&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf8&amp;tab=wn&amp;q=Mearsheimer+Walt+AIPAC" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuckyLittleGrasshopper_7ba2.html" title="User:LuckyLittleGrasshopper">LuckyLittleGrasshopper</a> 19:57, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The IP editor who originally inserted the information was simply propagandizing, and put in a whole bunch of barely relevant stuff. It eventually evolved into a good article about the paper itself, which is why it went into its own article. As for the "summary", my objections above are relevant; the paragraph was false boilerplate material. I suppose specific information from the report about AIPAC might be relevant, but this wasn't it. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 20:16, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As for the section heading, it should match the article, though one could optionally drop the word "AIPAC". Perhaps one could put in "espionage accusations" if one were concerned that the title implies that the espionage charge is definitively true. —<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Y_1ca2.html" title="User:Ashley Y">Ashley Y</a> 10:22, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that "AIPAC" is redundant in the title of the section. The problem with "espionage accusations" is that at least one of the accused has admitted guilt in transferring classified information to foreign officials, so it's not just accusations. Maybe "Espionage investigation" or "Espionage indictments"? Thanks. <a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EANecessaryWeevil_700c.html" title="User:ANecessaryWeevil">ANW</a> 12:23, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The New York Times described AIPAC on July 6, 1987 as "a major force in shaping United States policy in the Middle East." The article also stated that: "The organization has gained power to influence a presidential candidate's choice of staff, to block practically any arms sale to an Arab country, and to serve as a catalyst for intimate military relations between The Pentagon and the Israeli army. Its leading officials are consulted by State Department and White House policy makers, by senators and generals."[citation needed]</dd>

<p>So, somebody has re-added the fact-check template. Unfortunately, the article is under copyright to NYT, and they've decided not to make it publicly available. Instead, it is part of the premium "TimesSelect" service. I think we should either take the date and link to abstract as enough fact checking, or completely give up on the quote and delete it. I doubt we'll get better evidence until copyright expires. <a href="../../../e/a/l/User%7EEalex292_64dc.html" title="User:Ealex292">Ealex292</a> 02:33, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If the substance can be verified to be accurate from the NY Times source, that's sufficient evidence. Cite the link, or better still the date it was published in print. The TimeSelect thing is basically access to newspaper articles for those paying for an NY Times subscription, it's not that the paper's trying to keep documents out of public view. Right now pretty much all editorial writings require subscription to the paper for access as well. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShams2006_1880.html" title="User:Shams2006">Shams2006</a> 07:11, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The date has been there for a while. I saw the date, figured it couldn't be hard to verify, and did a little more research. Now to see if it will stick around a little longer with all the &lt;ref&gt; goodness... The quote itself is a two-part thing: the first is visible in the abstract, but the second requires access to the article itself. (I'm guessing viewing the article itself from the link is straightforward if you have TimesSelect.) <a href="../../../e/a/l/User%7EEalex292_64dc.html" title="User:Ealex292">Ealex292</a> 23:19, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In August 2004 during his presidential campaign, <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Nader_6df8.html" title="Ralph Nader">Ralph Nader</a> was criticized for expressing what many saw as antisemitic attitudes when he "suggested that President Bush and Congress were 'puppets' of the Israeli government" <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58007-2004Aug11.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58007-2004Aug11.html" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rD_rWcDRZQ" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rD_rWcDRZQ" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64028-2004Aug13.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64028-2004Aug13.html" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. Nader is quoted as saying that: "The days when the chief Israeli puppeteer comes to the United States and meets with the puppet in the White House and then proceeds to Capitol Hill, where he meets with hundreds of other puppets, should be replaced" <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58007-2004Aug11.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58007-2004Aug11.html" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>.

<dd>First off, I don't appreciate your smear tactics; I expect better from an admin. committed to the principle of NPOV -- and PLEASE explain yourself more fully; your ONE SENTENCE does not justify deleting valid, relevant, and well sourced information. Yes the info was inserted in to 5 different articles, but you fail to add that they were all RELEVANT articles and that identical information is copied/pasted and crosslited on Wikipedia routinely if it pertains to multiple articles. Also, anything reported in the <i>Washington Post</i> and investigated by the ADL (along with other reliable sources) that was said by a former presidential candidate (a multiple presidential canidate actually, and well-known national figure) is not mere "trivia." I simply cannot understand why you keep saying that this is "trivia" when that assertion is a blatant falsity; the <i>Washington Post</i> is (as you know) one of the top newspapers in the USA. I am not "obsessed with identifying the 'Jewish lobby' and all the rich Jews in the United States" as you write: they are simply articles that I am interested in and seek to expand/enrich with factual, well-sourced, and relevant information (how many times must I say this?) -- also, must I remind you that around 80% or more of your own edits deal with Jewish-themed articles, many of which you and other admins. fiercely protect and watch in shifts, preventing other good editors from even touching them. However, I would like to ask: isn't the job of admins. to watch/police <i>the entirety of Wikipedia</i> instead of having 80% or even more of your edits (and the edits of some other admins. are close to 100%) on Jewish themed-articles? (as I said, this is not just you: many other high-level admins. edit Jewish articles almost exclusively to the detriment of the rest of the project, which you all seem to conveniently ignore to spend the vast bulk of your time and energy on Jewish-themed articles).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again, please <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assume_good_faith.html" title="Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>, as you have noticed that ALL of my edits were not vandalism; they were all made in good faith in the interest of furthering the project of an OPEN and FREE encyclopedia that ANYONE can edit. I am very interested in Jewish businesspeople in the USA (and the other <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_Americans_450a.html" title="List of Jewish Americans">List of Jewish Americans</a>) and American-Israeli relations, and this is why I spent all of that time expanding that list only to have it unjustly deleted by you in the blink of an eye (and hence my high edit count in regards to these particular articles).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for your other smear: "...claiming David Irving is a "Scholar of the Holocaust"...that IS NOT what I said. If you had read it correctly, I wrote: "I see that we don't have a 'Category:Independent scholars' here on Wiki. Though I find Irving's views pertaining to Jews and the Holocaust absolutely despicable..." -- I simply proposed to create a 'Category:Independent scholars' (for not only Irving but <i>many others</i>) as pertaining to Irving's history books that were written independently of any university or organization. Such a category would also be relevant for any other scholar or researcher that has published outside of the academic system yet still have valuable and well-researched views on their primary subjects; this had nothing to do with his personal views on the Holocaust, which I immediately denounced (Irving has never written a book on the Holocaust exclusively as far as I can find, only on WWII history). So, if you would please stop misquoting me I would certainly appreciate that. Also, since you canvassed this over my own canvasses on the pages which I added the Nader info that you later removed, I'm going to go ahead and copy/paste this response to the other smears in order to offer a rebuttal to your smear tactics. --<a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWassermannNYC_d58e.html" title="User:WassermannNYC">WassermannNYC</a> 03:42, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Several editors have added rebuttals to the Economists claims that AIPAC and the religious right influence American foreign policy toward Israel. I wonder if this is appropriate. First, the rebuttals far outweigh the original claim in terms of content and, IMO, push the paragraph into the POV realm. Second, this is the "Critics" section: do rebuttals even belong here. Third, though many of the other criticisms are dubious claims or at the very least debatable, none of them include rebuttals. My first instinct is to remove the rebuttals entirely. If that is deemed too drastic a response, how about trimming the list to a summary of the original rebuttal, removing the latest additions. <a href="../../../m/r/t/User%7EMrtrumbe_1c18.html" title="User:Mrtrumbe">Taft</a> 17:16, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Another thought: since a decent portion of the article centers around the debate over scope of AIPAC's influence, does this topic warrant its own section? <a href="../../../m/r/t/User%7EMrtrumbe_1c18.html" title="User:Mrtrumbe">Taft</a> 17:20, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Taft, I think the rebuttals are NOT appropriate, and that they do not belong in this section. Mainly because it mixes rebuttal into a criticism section, thereby diluting the criticism. That portion of the paragraph was easily extracted and placed in the previous "Support" section. Since you have had no other response for the last few days, I have made this change for you since I was making other changes. Please move it back if you are not happy with what I did: I moved the text and made it the last paragraph of the "Support" section.</dd>

<dd>Taft, if you have access to the Economist article (it's a pay site) I would flesh this criticism out some and replace the last sentence, since it is rather thin with the rebuttal moved out and deserves a better statement of the argument in the Economist article.</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1982, AIPAC was allegedly able to convince the US Congress and President Reagan to veto a French-supported UN resolution condemning the Israeli Invasion of Lebanon, which called for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli soldiers from Lebanon to allow for the safe evacuation of Palestinians. This series of events caused some critics in the media to argue that the "Reagan administration could not commit itself to concrete action to stop the killing in Lebanon".[4] The United States defended its vote stating that the proposed resolution would allow the PLO to retain its weapons during the evacuation, thus allowing it to potentially carry out attacks throughout the evacuation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some users apparently do not know how serious this is, especially when written in such a manner it could be considered slander and/or libel. This is absolutely ridiculous, and the source is worse. It comes from the Institute for Palestine Studies and is written by excessively anti-Israel people like Cockburn. It provides absolutely no evidence for the claim. What you would need to include this paragraph would be something perhaps from the Washington Post that says "AIPAC has convinced several congressmen...", not this boloney. You would need a congressman from 1982 to make that claim. You would need something reputable. The idea that the entire US Congress and the President of the United States were all "convinced" is extremely serious, it cannot be accompanied by such a weak source. It reeks of POV and has no base to support it at all whatsoever. Nothing.

In order to add this section, it must have citations from Reliable Sources: e.g. newspaper or periodical articles, etc. For example, your first sentence is that AIPAC has lobbied the U.S. Congress against commemorating the Armenian Genocide - but your statement of this is not sufficient; you need to find a Reliable Source who makes this claim or at least show some evidence from a RS that this lobbying has taken place.</p>
<p>2. Text is not written to be NPOV - see WP:NPOV. For example the heading "GENOCIDE DENIAL &amp; SUPPORT FOR REVISIONISM" is taking the point of view that AIPAC is Denying the genocide and supporting revisionism - which I doubt they would agree to. Or the sentence "The Armenian community has attempted outreach to no avail" is argumentative - who is "the Armenian community", who have they reached out to, who has not responded?</p>
<p>3. This "controversy" must be Notable (WP:Notable) in order for it to be included. Finding a number of WP:RS who discuss this issue (needed for the first point) goes a long way towards showing notability. I also checked the WP page WP:Armenian Genocide page, and did not find any mention of this controversy there. If this is significant, wouldn't it be on that page?</p>
<p>4. WP format for header was not followed.</p>
<p>5. Finally, it is strongly advisable to leave a note on this Talk page when adding substantial amounts of text, so you can explain your reasons for adding, notability, etc. Please leave a note here before adding these paragraphs after reworking them.</p>
<p>6. The text I removed is the following. If an editor wants to insert this text, they should rework it, especially by finding citations and rewriting it to be NPOV:</p>
<dl>
<dd>GENOCIDE DENIAL &amp; SUPPORT FOR REVISIONISM</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>AIPAC, along with other major American Jewish lobbies such as ADL and B'nai B'rith have lobbied the U.S. Congress against commemorative resolutions affirming the World War I Armenian Genocide. The Armenian Genocide (1915-1923) resulted in the deaths of 1.5 million Armenians and the forced deportations of the rest. Along with Armenians, other Christian minorities in the Ottoman Turkish Empire perished (including Assyrians, Arabs and Greeks).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Turkish government has denied the facts behind the genocide; the death toll; and that the genocide was centrally planned. Israel and the major Jewish lobbies such as AIPAC have supported Turkey in this denial.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>AIPAC has used its considerable clout in helping to defeat the Armenian Genocide resolutions (either in committee or from keeping it from getting to a floor vote). The rationale used by AIPAC is that Turkey has a long standing history of having accepted Sephardic Jewish refugees from Spain and that Israel-Turkey relations are more important than recognizing the first genocide of the 20th century. Israel also seeks better treatment of its Jewish minority in Istanbul and Turkey's assistance in allowing more Turkish Jews to be allowed to emigrate to Israel and the occupied West Bank.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Armenian community has attempted outreach to no avail, as it appears that the "realpolitik" considerations (Israel-Turkey relations) trump the obvious irony and hypocrisy of Jewish organizations lobbying against recognizing someone else's tragedy. Many in the Armenian diasporan communities also believe that a motivation is for Israel and the Jewish diaspora to maintain the perceived uniqueness of the Jewish Holocaust experience as opposed to other genocides (before or after).</dd>

<p>An editor recently removed info from the Controversies related to the Steiner conversation, since he felt that the text was untrue and misleading. I rewrote using direct quotes from that conversation, instead of paraphrasing, which should be non-controversial since the statements are directly from the transcript.

<p>I reorganized the Critics section to improve organization. I put all the US House of Rep quotes at the top, and made flow into following paragraphs logical (instead of random). I added a large quote from the Mearsheimer and Walt paper, since it is a substantial and detailed criticism of AIPAC that deserves to be noted. I kept all citations and left most other text unmodified - just moved it. <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJgui_5a61.html" title="User:Jgui">Jgui</a> 07:19, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Shamir, you made some deletions and changes without explaining why. I left them all except for the following:</dd>
<dd>1. You removed citations explaining which Representatives were US Congress (calling them simply Representative). I added these back since this article also refers to a State Rep and it is better to explicitely state which is which to minimize ambiguity. I've left your abbreviation in the subsequent sentences since they have been properly introduced in the first sentence that I added back.</dd>
<dd>2. You removed a sentence with a properly-cited quote from Obey that I did not add - I only moved it in my reorg. You gave no explanation for removing this sentence so I added it back.</dd>
<dd>3. You changed the first sentence from "US Government" to "US Congress". AIPAC lobbies the executive branch as well as the congress, so it was correct before your change.</dd>
<dd>4. You removed properly-cited direct quotes of the Steiner conversation without any explanation. You previously removed text in this paragraph claiming it was untrue and misleading, so as I explained above I put in direct quotes which should be non-controversial. Removing properly-cited text without explanation can be considered vandalism - please be more careful.</dd>
<dd>5. You also removed a sentence and citation from the Forward; I assume because it was a dead link. Please follow the correct WP protocol, which is not to remove text and citation, but to add a CN to the sentence. I looked up the citation and added it back so it now links properly.</dd>
<dd>6. You also removed part of Stephen Walt's title. As you may not know, Harvard professors are assumed to be Faculty of Arts and Sciences if you do not specify which school they are faculty for. Stephen Walt is professor at the Kennedy School of Government so I added that back.</dd>

<dd>Sorry to get back at you later. I made the info more concise and removed what was not very controversial. While he sounds incredibly boastful, it is not scandalous that some AIPAC members were helping out or working for the Clinton campaign or that they would be promoted in some way. Yes it sounds boastful, but sometimes you have to read it again and think of it individually without the other more controversial points. With the issue of aid, it is partly not controversial. The $3 billion stats is known and can be found on the website of the U.S. embassy in Israel. The more controversial and "juicy" part is the lesser known other goodies. I also removed the "AIPAC-approved" thing because it sounded odd and wasnt very representative of the content, besides the fact its not needed in order to deliver the point.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I did not remove any titles before names. Prior, it said United States Representative for each one, so I removed the United States from it. I then abbreviated the states from which they represent as that is how it is usually written with their name/</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As for the "criticism" cited in the Forward, it was not that critical. He claimed that AIPAC's interests are right-wing, which he may consider a bad thing but that it because he personally does not adhere to right-wing politics, not because of the system of AIPAC.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I will re-add the title to Walt (I just found it long), and the Government part which is my mistake. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShamir1_b434.html" title="User:Shamir1">Shamir1</a> 20:31, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Shamir, thank you for explaining your edits.</dd>
<dd>1. I vehemently disagree with your edits to the Steiner quote that I researched and added with a citation, which you said you removed large portions of because it "was not very controversial". This is a short paragraph - there is no need to be more concise. Please bear in mind that I originally added this quote because you had removed text fairly similar to the text that you just put back in (which you claimed at the time was "untrue and misleading"). What is scandalous about this quote, and the reason I believe it caused him to resign and the reason it should stay in its entirety, is that Steiner is claiming to have power over the Clinton campaign's Secretary-level appointments, implicit power over the AIPAC workers who will be in Clinton's campaign, and power over the Bush administration's appropriations to Israel. And his stated reason for this power is that "they're looking for the Jewish votes". The trimmed version you put in its place does not convey this, so it is not a suitable replacement for the direct, properly-cited quote. Please do not remove this.</dd>
<dd>2. I agree that the "AIPAC-approved" statement was clumsy and not well written, so I left that out consistent with your change.</dd>
<dd>3. I put back the US Representative (and State Representative) titles where called for. I think you will have to agree that just stating "Representative" is ambiguous - I don't understand why you think it is better to be ambiguous? Please note that their titles are only stated in this long form once - the first time they are introduced - which I believe is the correct way to do it.</dd>
<dd>4. I don't think it was proper to delete the Obey sentence as you did, since he is listed above as one of the AIPAC critics in the first sentence - we need this sentence to know what he is criticizing. Since you thought the Obey sentence was weak, I used a direct Obey quote from the Washington Post article that more clearly states why Obey thinks that AIPAC is not representative of Israeli opinion as a whole, which is what his criticism is about.</dd>

<dd>3. They already have a title. The first one says United States Representative and the rest continue with Representative. That is not ambiguous at all, especially since some have the state abbreviation. It is not ambiguous.</dd>
<dd>4. I am not sure about the critique of Obey. He says he is left-wing and doesnt like AIPAC because he thinks its right-wing.... I donno how critical that is. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShamir1_b434.html" title="User:Shamir1">Shamir1</a> 16:43, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
