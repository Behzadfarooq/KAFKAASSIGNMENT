<p>This page is not only inadequate, but full of inaccuracies.</p>
<p>"Until the 1950s, the AFL allowed only skilled workers to enter." False: UMW, ILGWU, ACWA, Brewery Workers, Teamsters.</p>
<p>"The AFL prohibited all nonwhite workers from entering." Many affiliates did; the AFL did not.</p>
<p>"This philosophy of craft unionism, or the division of unions by specialty, contradicted earlier unions' support of industrial unionism, which advocated grouping all workers in a company under one union to increase bargaining power." Contradicted? Earlier unions? Both vague and sloppy. There is much to be said on this subject.

<p>I spent 33 years in an AFL(-CIO) union, the IBEW. I was an officer, steward, and a delegate to the AFL-CIO. I joined the IWW more than fifteen years ago. I've written and edited a book about labor history. I have some issues with this article. In my opinion, the following para needs revision, elaboration, or some specific references to justify the claims:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The AFL vigorously opposed dual unionism and the Industrial Workers of the World, which was created in 1905 as an alternative to the AFL. Rather than accommodating capitalism, it sought to overthrow it. The IWW was never a significant threat to the AFL. While the AFL vigorously supported the national war effort in World War I, the IWW tried to impede the war effort and was broken by criminal prosecution.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Point One: It is easy for someone here to suggest that the IWW "was never a serious threat" to the AFL when one considers the collusion of business, government, and the AFL in an attempt to destroy that organization. However, the U.S. government believed the IWW was a serious threat, else why did they launch such widespread, concerted actions against the union? Hundreds of IWW members and officers were rounded up, some simply for possessing a union card. IWW halls across the continent were ransacked or destroyed, and their membership lists confiscated or burned. Those arrested faced up to 38 years in prison. Many were deported, and a few fled the country. Nonetheless, the organization reached its peak membership in 1923, some five years after the repression started, with well over a hundred thousand members. Granted, that's not as big as the AFL. But "never a serious threat"&#160;??? How can this statement be substantiated, in light of what the IWW was becoming, and what it might have been absent the concerted attacks?</p>
<p>Point Two: My reading about the IWW's war years suggests that the word "impede" is inaccurate. The IWW did not take a formal position on the war. In fact, some key people in the organization, including Big Bill Haywood, believed that doing so would have brought down the wrath of the government (which happened anyway...)</p>
<p>The IWW certainly disliked the war, and editorialized against it. General Executive Board officer Frank Little was hanged from a railroad trestle, probably due in part to his outspoken criticism of the war. But (in a nation that should honor the first amendment) speaking out is not "impeding."</p>
<p>The IWW did decline to forego strikes while the war was on. If there was any impeding, it was the local government and mine operators who impeded the normal actions of the union (a strike for better wages) by kidnapping more than a thousand unionized workers and transporting them at gunpoint to the desert (Google for Bisbee Deportation.)</p>
<p>Granted, someone might believe that a major union organization declining to forego strikes during a war is an impediment of sorts. If that is the case, it deserves to be spelled out, rather than conjuring the false image of the IWW instructing its members to resist the war effort in any way possible.</p>
<p>Finally, the IWW was seriously injured by criminal prosecution. But i believe the phrase "was broken" is hyperbole. The IWW mounted very successful strikes as late as 1927-28, when 12,000 Colorado coal miners put down their tools under the banner of the IWW. The IWW underwent a split during the 1920s, and lost about half of its membership around 1925, years after the criminal prosecution had ended. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Myers_1e40.html" title="User:Richard Myers">Richard Myers</a> 06:31, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The IWW was not quite so quiet. Foner says: "The only position which the Board could agree on was that Ralph Chaplin should be given the authority to print a statement over his own signature. Appearing in the July 20, 1917 issue of Solidarity, Chaplin's statement said that members who joined military forces had always been expelled from the IWW and that "the principle of the International solidarity of labor to which we have always adhered makes it impossible for us to participate in any and all of the plunder-squabbles of the Parasite class." It urged that members register for the draft, but that they also claim exemption from military service by writing on the registration form, "IWW, opposed to war." Labor and World War I, 1914-1918.

<dd>Perhaps the most outspoken advocates of war resistance, the (communist) ICC, has written on this question:
<dl>
<dd>In an irony of history, it was the IWW, which consciously chose not to actively fight against the war once the US had entered the conflict, and not the socialist parties that opposed the war, that was targeted for repression. While individual socialists, like Eugene Debs who had spoken openly against conscription, were arrested and imprisoned, only the IWW, as an organization, faced indictment for conspiracy to sabotage the war effort. In this sense the war provided a pretext for the bourgeoisie to take revenge on the IWW for its past activities and for the fear it inspired. Indeed, we can perhaps say that the American bourgeoisie was more aware than the IWW’s leaders themselves of the danger that the organization represented. One hundred and sixty-five IWW leaders were indicted on September 28, 1917 on charges of obstructing the war effort and conscription, and conspiring to sabotage and interfere with the normal contractual economic functioning in society. The government was so intent on exploiting this opportunity to decapitate the IWW, that it even indicted people who were already dead or had left the organization long before the US entered the war. For example, among the indicted Wobblies were:</dd>

<dd>At the Great Trial, the Wobbly defendants argued that they had not tried to interfere with the war effort. They pointed out that of the 521 wartime labor strikes, only three were organized by the IWW, the rest by the AFL. In his testimony, Haywood disowned the views of Frank Little, and pointed out that anti-war literature such as Deadly Parallel and the Sabotage pamphlet had been withdrawn from circulation once the US entered the war.</dd>

<dd>I hope to see some changes in the paragraph relating to the IWW. If necessary, i will happily make the changes myself. However, i was hoping for some additional feedback and commentary on the concerns i've expressed, as preliminary guidance. Anyone?

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/Talk%7EAmerican_Federation_of_Labor_e639.html" title="Edit section: Some general cleanup">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Some general cleanup</span></h2>
<p>I did some general clean-up today. While the writing style was generally good, there were a large number of run-on sentences, some factual errors (ex., the AFL pulled the charters of the CIO unions in 1936, not 1937 or 1935), some unclear sentences, and so on. I also changed some of the hyperbolic language (such language makes for exciting historical writing, but not good Wiki articles generally).</p>
<p>As for the IWW references, I would support removing any refernces to the IWW "impeding" the war effort in WWI absent any support. The IWW clearly did not support, sanction or conduct strikes during the war. Opposing the war is not the same as "impeding", unless evidence can be offered otherwise. Such evidence might be: propagandizing workers to avoid war-plant work, supporting mass resignations in war-plants, picketing or demonstrating against the war or war production, etc. The word "impeding" should be avoided; specific acts the IWW undertook should be listed instead so that the reader may draw his or her own conclusions. If there are statements from politicians, labor leaders, civic leaders, etc., which characterize the IWW's actions during the war, by all means include them. (Even if the IWW did not "impede" the war effort, others may have perceived it to be doing so. In politics, perception—whether sincere or cynical—is 90 percent of the game.)</p>
<p>I would argue the same for the "IWW wasn't a threat" as well. Wikipedia writers cannot make arguments one way or the other. We can only find scholarly works or primary-source documents which make the statements, and then cite these sources. The IWW is well-studied. Certainly, some historian has made a statement about whether the IWW was perceived as a threat (or not) by labor, government, the public, etc. Find that statement. Insert it and a citation into the article. (Remember, Wikipedia encourages others to "mercilessly edit" the work of others, to "be bold".)</p>
<p>I also very strongly encourage everyone to use in-line references extensively in this article from here on out. <b>ANY</b> statement of fact or opinion which <b>might</b> be challenged should be supported with a general citation (Smith, "Unions Are Cool," <i>Journal of Truth,</i> Sept. 2007 or Jones, <i>Unions Are the best,</i> 2006) or a specific one (citing page number) when statistics or quotations are used.</p>
<p>Finally, if there is a question about a statement, use the {{fact}} tag. Insert it immediately after the questionable number, quote or statement if the number, quote or statement is one of several in a sentence. Insert it at the end of the sentence if the number, quote or statement is the only one in the sentence or stands alone (as a quote might). - <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim1965_7d40.html" title="User:Tim1965">Tim1965</a> 19:18, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
