<dl>
<dd>The point of this article is to define and explain the American dream. Since it is a concept, this article should not pose arguments on either side (claiming that the American Dream is successful or unsuccessful). This concept is abstract, so there is no specific dream. This article is an attempt to explain how the american dream of free economic choice led to large-scale immigration, and what caused the flourishing of the American Dream.</dd>
<dd>Let's inform readers what the AD is about, the history behind it, etc....they can form an opinion for themselves.</dd>

<p>This page is in need of some serious help.</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Everything from Immigration down needs to undergo serious revision. These sections seem to lose focus of defining and describing the American dream.</dd>
<dd>2. <s>Remove the paragraph about the cabbie success story. Keep the reference as an example, and link it to an article about him, possibly having one or two sentences that sum up his rags to riches transition. This article is not the place for a short biography.</s> Done.</dd>
<dd>3. I'm not so sure that the image of American income is exactly necessary. While the American Dream does have something to do with income, there is not exactly a set income at which you are now living the American dream</dd>
<dd>4. This page should include, since it is inextricably tied and mentioned in the opener, how the Bill of Rights, Capitalism, and Meritocracy have hampered, helped, whatever...the American Dream</dd>
<dd>5. <s>A lot of the last part is irrelevant. The Dot com boom, Computer crap...it needs to be weeded out and removed. This is where most of the problem lies.</s> I took care of a lot of this...however, the paragraph about hippie ideals, etc, needs some review.</dd>

<p>Under Criticisms, there is a whole point based on Higher Education, stating that Higher Education "can" be expensive. While this is true, this is no basis for an argument because higher education "can" be inexpensive. Heck, cars "can" be expensive, yet that hasn't stopped Americans from having a national average of about 1 car per person....</p>
<p>--- I really don't understand your point? A good education helps you to get a good job. If you can't afford the best education, you won't be able to get the best jobs. Most Americans might be able to afford a car, but how many can afford a porsche. Likewise, most Americans might find it easy to afford to go to college, but very few can afford the fees for an Ivy League college without a scholarship. Therefore the best educations, and by extension many of the best jobs, are reserved for the children of the rich.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>---While this is true, I think this person's argument is that you don't need an "expensive" education to live the American dream, so this can't exactly be a criticism of the American dream</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is possible to get a good college education on the cheap. I did my first two years at a community college then transferred to a relatively unknown 4-year school. What I didn't have I borrowed. I went toe to toe with ivy league graduates. Good schools don't make you smart it's just that smart people go there. Anyone that wants a college education can get one if they have the chops, and that is part of what the American dream is about.</p>

<dd><b>Wikifying the criticism.</b> I have since done some editing on the various criticisms, expanding some, adding one about social justice, refining some of the criticisms and some of the counter points. I'm concerned that not all of the criticisms or counter-arguments are attibutable, (although as I read them, various quotes come to mind) but I think that implementing linked headings like <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Justice_4c1f.html" title="Social Justice">Social Justice</a> or <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Control_1214.html" title="Social Control">Social Control</a> or <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Darwinism_4ef0.html" title="Social Darwinism">Social Darwinism</a> will allow others to read up on the expanded points if they so choose. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDocmgmt_46c5.html" title="User:Docmgmt">Docmgmt</a> 19:07, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Am I only one who find the following part quite offensive? Yes. I am rich. "...the American dream also ignores other factors of success such as...inheritable traits such as intelligence."</p>
<p>What? Am I reading this wrong or is it implying that people are poor because they are stupid? No they put it in a question format they did not want u to take it like that ---</p>
<p>I believe the implication is a different one: People who a poor and less intellectually gifted will find it difficult to escape poverty by means of work alone. However, it is possible to be poor for many other reasons as well.</p>
<p>Although somewhat controversial, you may find it interesting to read Wikipedia's article on <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligence_quotient.html" title="Intelligence quotient">intelligence quotient</a>, where the fraction of people living in poverty is compared to their score on a standardized IQ test. It drops from around 30% among those with the lowest scores to only 2% among those with the highest.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/Talk%7EAmerican_Dream_3d67.html" title="Edit section: &quot;Can&quot; is the key word here">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">"Can" is the key word here</span></h2>
<p>Some of you seem to miss the word "can" in the opening sentence. Contrary to what has been posted below, the dream does not involve *everyone* in the country getting rich. If that were true, it would suggest that people in America are entitled to wealth because they live here. That misses the point entirely. I deleted a paragraph in the criticism section that reflected this inaccurate viewpoint.</p>
<p>The gist of the American dream is that if you work sufficiently hard, you CAN be a success--not that you're guaranteed to do so. The point is that in other places (like, say, North Korea) you do not have that opportunity. You could work your butt off until the cows come home in Pyongyang and you still ain't getting rich. The American dream is related to the general idea of freedom--that you're free to make your own economic decisions, and that maybe, if you play your cards right, you'll make it big.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I may be wrong hear, but i don't think this is true. I have lived in US and have heard this dream a couple of times. And in all cases, the speaker was implying this applies to everyone. And if this doesn't apply to everyone, then its not unique to America at all. Luck my friend is universal. For example, i am Kenyan and can name a number of people born poor but ended up filthy rich. An example is <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josiah_Mwangi_Kariuki_da73.html" title="Josiah Mwangi Kariuki">Josiah Mwangi Kariuki</a>. One more thing, your chance for being rich depend with how ethical you are. The more ethical you are, the more remote your chance of getting rich. Probe a couple of the rich figures around. There is one common characteristic with all of them. They were all willing to do evil, ranging from simple back stabbing to embezzlement and murder.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, i even know of a primary school classmate who was really freaking rich. After leaving primary school for secondary school life, i never say him again. At that time, he was a dirt poor village boy. One day, i was reading news when i came across his name. Since i was at US then, i called home and to my surprise, my instinct was right. I was even told the guy had a huge house, numerous girlfriends and drove a Range Rover. Since he even never went to high school, i knew he must have been up to no good. He did eventually close the wrong person. I hear he had contact with one of the Rwanda's criminals. (That imply he was working with him, as i can see how else he came to know this criminal) He approached the USA embassy and offered to assist them catch him(the criminal) in return for money. Someone buggled it up and he ended up with a bullet in the head. This is the story i am refering to. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2680329.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2680329.stm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In short, as recently as two years ago, someone in Kenya had managed to go from rugs to riches. Granted, he didn't use means that anyone should be proud of. In fact, i have no sympathy for greedy people as i think they are the root cause of the world's evil.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Surely the American Dream as a concept, well known around the World exists whether or not poor people can get rich in other countries. I thought it also referred to the large number of immigrants believing that America was a land of new oppurtunity, not only poor people already resident there.

<p>Word to SD6. This is an important topic, but the entry itself is kind of dreamy, and does not attempt to define what, in fact, the American dream might be. There is value in this topic--many American studies majors have ponder the question of the American dream, but this entry needs a great deal of enrichment.</p>

<p>Nice dream, but here's our wake-up call:</p>
<ul>
<li>(and dealt with the native Americans)</li>
<li>(and shared anew by later generations of immigrants)</li>

<p>I inserted the above parenthetical remarks as ironic comments, the page started off in a very ironic fashion, and I was surprised to see that my ironic comments ('blazing trails', _dealing _ with 'Native Americans') were built upon in the eulogistic expansion of the page. Perhaps irony is wasted in the histrionic larger than life image of the american dream? If wastedm then these remarks are better left out, but where do you stand, Ed? <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyClarke_b748.html" title="User:TonyClarke">TonyClarke</a> 19:40, 21 Nov 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We should describe what the American Dream is, as well as mention problems attaining it, or objections to it.</dd>

<dd>My understanding is rather vague, but as an American I feel there is some sort of shared aspiration there -- not that it shouldn't be critiqued, don't get me wrong.

<p>The section "Critisism of the American dream" needs to be rewritten. As it stands, it is really not a critisism at all.</p>
<p>The real critisim is that the American dream is false and misguided. It is not possible for everyone to become prosperous through determination and hard work. This false belief is likely to have negative consequences, such as the poor feeling that it is their fault that they are not successful, and less effort being put into raising standards for the poor since they "are all lazy" (according to one survey I saw 60% of Americans believe that the poor are poor because they are lazy, while this was true for only around 25% of Europeans).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, your definition of the American dream is false and misguided. See above.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Just as important, or perhaps more important, than hard work is the family one is born into and inheritable traits such as intelligence. Although many people may think that George W. became the current US president because he worked so much harder than anyone else, a more plausible explanation is that he was born into a family of politicians. <a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilur_ec4f.html" title="User:Filur">Filur</a> 30 Jul 2004</p>
<p>The American dream is like a rainbow...a beautiful illusion. You think you see it; you believe that at the end of it there is your pot of gold, but if you look for it you are searching in vain. Why does America not stop searching for its 'dream' and actually do something constructive and usefel for the world? - Ruthie14 19 Nov 2004</p>
<hr />
<p>Filur, perhaps unwittingly, showed something important about the American Dream: that it <i>is</i> strictly American. Social attitudes in America are different from those of the rest of the world. Beliefs about life and about history in America are different fromt hose of the rest of the world. This particular fantasy of a prosperous, suburban existence is a uniquely American one. Here there is a blend of laissez-faire capitalism and nationalistic pride that doesn't exist wherever else one looks. For better or worse, this dream was bred in America and is maintained in America.</p>
<p>And Ruthie would do well to recognize that there are a number of selfless Americans who do concentrate on the needs of the world over their own.<a href="../../../l/e/b/User%7ELebob_0e74.html" title="User:Lebob">Lebob</a> 06:26, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I re-wrote the Criticism section to try to make it more NPOV. Regarding most of the material I removed, I did so because it seemed to be more of a criticism of American policy than of the American dream. It was valid criticism, but it didn't seem to belong in this particular encyclopedia entry. Please feel free to edit/re-add material. (I suggest just adding a wiki-link-- these topics must have been dealt with in other articles.) I removed the Israel/Palestine sentence because I just didn't see the connection or parallel to criticisms of the American dream.

<p>Ha, I hope I don't sound rude, but find your reasoning a little bit odd. You say the problem with American dream has more to do with government policy than the dream. You also insist that government policy should not be mentioned in this article. Its like saying someone shouldn't mention about gravity when discussing why water doesn't flow upstream. How else can one explain critism, other than mentioning factors that make the concept impracticle? <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/11/AR2005081102013.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/11/AR2005081102013.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p>The American Dream is something that only Americans can possess. I'm sorry to inform you of this fact.

<p>The American Dream is a dream of a better life, with more freedom and more OPPORTUNITY. For any American, there a potential for he or she to become rich. How? All anyone has to do is make the right choices. Choices that will bring him finacial success. For example, anyone in America has the opportunity to buy a McDonalds franchise. Everyone in America has access to the same oppertunities. That's the basis of equal freedoms. The difference is that most people who find out about the franchise would ignore it.</p>
<p>Here's an example. Two middle class people with equal incomes and $70,000 savings. The first person reads that the paper and thinks:</p>
<p>"Hmmm... Nah! I don't have enough money to buy that. I'd have to get into debt. And what if the franchise fails?!? Then I'd have a lot of debt and not enough income!! Better not take the risk and live my employee life. Besides, I want to buy that new car I was saving up for."</p>
<p>The second person, however, invests in the franchise with his $70,000. He gets a $600,000 morgage on the franchise. He manages the franchise, and at first the franchise isn't making enough profit cover the morgage. But the franchise makes a come around and starts making a profit. He hires a manager and the franchise is no longer consuming his time. Now he earns money, even though he isn't working. It's because he owns the franchise, and the franchise is making money on its own (thanks to the hard working employees who make him money every time they sell a burger) The value of the franchise goes up to 1.3 million dollars, and he decides to sell it. He now has $700,000 dollars in his pocket. He took the risk of investing and it paid off. Greedy people are NOT more likely to become rich. Being cheap is not the only way of becoming rich (there are much faster ways). They don't break the law or use corruption. Most poeple who try are caught right away, or relatively soon because people notice the rich. The rich are rich because they've made and continue to make good investments.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not getting how this example uniquely American. There are plenty of free/open/market/unplanned economies on the planet. A thousand years before Washington ever even thought of chopping down that cherry tree, a Mongolian goat-herd could make a pretty nice life for himself if he made and continued to make good choices about where to pasture, etc. Hard work and a little faith in the Ancient Mongolian Dream, my boy, and you could have a flock of hundreds! I wonder if there should be a note like 'although there are distinctive elements to the dream, such is the forcefulness of the national self-image that many proponents overstate its uniqueness, often attributing it with having invented basic human motivations (such as the desire for a better life)'. Ok, so a little sarcastic&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>In general, I think we have to remember to treat The Dream as national mythology or self image. There is such a thing as 'The American Dream' which is independent of whether it actually pans out. The main point of the article should be to describe what the concept means to the people that believe it (and to clearly express that these are beliefs, not facts), not how successfully realized it is. As for the criticisms, they are probably so numerous and complex as to warrant a separate entry.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Here are the things you need to become rich: Make more good investments than bad ones (we all make mistakes)</p>
<p>Have determination to grow assets (don't chicken out in the middle of creating a business)</p>
<p>Get involved in things that you can commit to (If biochemistry doesn't interest you, don't start a biochem business)</p>

<dd>Ha, I just came across another article that look at this issue. I initially thought of finding where this survey is hosted and start an "External links" section, but then realised someone will quickly pull it out. This is from observing the dynamics that wikipedians currenly exhibit. The pertinent paragraph follows below</dd>

<dd>"If you are born into poverty in the US," said one of its authors, "you are actually more likely to remain in poverty than in other countries in Europe, the Nordic countries, even Canada, which you would think would not be that different."</dd>

<p>It is ashame that many of the Europeans view this as rubbish and an insult to them. When the "Dream" was coined it was because many people were leaving bad situations with the hope that the "New World" also known as America would provide them a better life. Hence the term the American Dream. Now the premise is that the "Dream" is that if you work hard and are frugal you CAN not you will definitely become more prosperous. More prosperous meaning you will be better off then you are now, and this is true. The fact is in the United States you can compile wealth through hard work, is that true in other countries most likely yes, but when the term "the American Dream" was coined the place where the opportunity could be found was the United States. I have been witness to many immigrants coming to the US with nothing and through hard work and perserverance do very well for themselves. What you are missing is these immigrants do not come from Europe anymore they come from South East Asia and South America, the same as many African and Asians move to European countries for opportunity.</p>

<p>I have been studying the concept of the American Dream for years and the content in this section simply does not match what I have seen scholars across disciplines talk about when they discuss the American Dream. But I wouldn't even know where to start with rewriting this rather odd collection of half-developed ideas. The wording is strange (the American Dream as a "faith"?), the pictures inappropriate, and the examples, like the Dot.com one, put too much emphasis on making a lot of money fast. This idea, whether you like it or not, has a rich, deep history that has guided much of American culture for 2 centuries. Is it worth starting over with a less slanted and more informed essay?</p>

<p>I was just doing some research on the American Dream for school and it seems no good resources can be found. What I'd really like to know is when the idea was originally brought up, who coined the term, who first wrote about, especially defined it. I always thought the American Dream was that through hard work and determination you can gain wealth, be as money or something else and eventually end up in a higher social class to give back to your community. - JHY</p>

<p>Perhaps I misenerpreted the meaning of 'intelligence', but I question the validity of the following statement: "It also fails to take inheritable traits such as intelligence and physical attributes into account".</p>
<p>Has IQ been proven experimentally and rationally to correlate with genetics? Aside from memory retention and other proven phenotypical attributes, I am unaware of IQ being an inheritable trait.</p>
<p>I would also like to raise the question of legitimacy of IQ scores in accurate indication of one's intelligence (relevant to the ability to succeed socially, politically, and financially). If these things have indeed been logically substanciated please inform me. Flux 08:06, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't know if I.Q. is inherited, but certainly a poor person with a low I.Q. will have more difficulty in getting rich than a poor person with a high I.Q. Also, the quality of education tends to vary based on wealth, giving the rich an advantage in that respective.

<p>I think this article is a bit solipsistic and the criticisms paragraph is really lacking in any sort of coherence.</p>
<p>We need some sort of discussion of how the ability to make money, or rise out of poverty in America differs from other capitalist countries, if indeed it does?</p>
<p>Also, what about the role of education? Isn't that one of the main criticisms of the American Dream? In most European countries, higher education is free, whereas in the US, poorer students need to gain a scholarship to enter the best universities. And what about nepotism, don't family connections make a huge difference?</p>

<p>Hmmmmm - unlike much of the rest of the article which reads like corporate propoganda - to me the only POV content in this section is the inclusion of a misleading photo with the vague title â<i>Harvard University offers a free college education to all accepted students from low-income U.S. families</i>â How many students exactly?</p>
<p>Aside from that, the photo surely does not belong in this section which is after all entitled âCriticismâ.</p>

<p><br />
Isn't the whole point of the criticism section that it offers a counterbalance to the rest of the article which is very uncritical of the concept. And what is so controversial- higher education in the US is expensive and often involves prohibitive amounts of debt, even if some students get grants. America does have lower social mobility than some other countries with a similar level of development- this point is backed from evidence from a major international organization (the OECD). Where the hardline communist propaganda in that?</p>
<p>Partly why social mobility is lower is because Americans (or at least the classic Americans who believe in the American Dream) also believe that the government shouldn't help people achieve their goals, only provide the conditions wherein the goals are possible to obtain. 24.90.172.131 14:29, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think it is silly to add POV to a section called "Criticism!" It's a redundancy. Yeah, the criticism is a bit left because the American Dream is often pushed by the right as a way to keep the poor where they are. I also think the whole POV label is b.s. Unless you are talking about undisputed facts that everyone agrees on, it's a matter of POV. The fact that there are some entries and not others in Wikipedia is an unsaid bias. The fact that the American Dream is this entry, but "criticism" is relegated to a POV, is a bias. Criticism of the American Dream, the Myth of Meritocracy (which has no entry) could be an entry unto itself. greenwoodjr</p>

<p>I haven't thought of a better way to place it or remove it, but the first paragraph has the following: <i>"As of right now, the American dream is a dream of having 2 children and living in a perfect house with financial security."</i></p>
<p>I disagree with it and want to know who the hell came up with that. Two children, who decided that? What's "perfect" and what is "financial security?"</p>
<p>I was always under the impression that the American Dream was making yourself something big, becoming something great, making something out of your life. Not "boring life with 2 children and enough money."</p>
<p>I highly dispute this part of the article. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMystalic_53ef.html" title="User:Mystalic">Mystalic</a> 00:30, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Most of you are forgetting the work of a very important hero in the fight for the American Dream: Hunter S. Thompson. Many of popular society only viewed him in the light of Hollywood and in the character portrayed by Johnny Depp in the film "Fear and Loathin in Las Vegas." Though most of the film has been believed to be fact, the point still goes consistantly missed. Hunter S. Thompson's fight for the survival of the American Dream lied solely within truth and noncorruption. He was simply fighting to keep strong the foundation penned by our forfathers during this country's creation. His battle, which he believed finally to have been "fucked" upon his failure to enter the government body, was in disregard of any monetary desire. Yes, too often people believe that what they really want is two cars and a house, when in reality the American Dream lies in simply holding our country sacred and in the genuine pride in actually BEING an American.

<p>There are loads of books out there that revolve around the American Dream. Perhaps those should be mentioned, in order to make the meaning of the American Dream clearer. I suggest <i>The Great Gatsby</i> by F. Scott Fitzgerald. 01:49, 25 October 2006 (UTC)Snurtz</p>

<p>Kinda like North Korea and Cuba. This user didn't get the memo that communism died in the early 1990's. By that, I mean, history has played out to show that many of these criticisms are not valid, or at the very least, not problematic overall. If they were, the USSR or another command economy would have established itself as an economic superpower. -NATESOR</p>

<p>The criticism section needs a major overhaul. First of all it's trying to cover 2 things at once. One is a criticism of the actual dream and what it hopes to achieve, the other is showing that not all Americans live this way. I think they should be split accordingly around the 6th point which begins to talk about Higher Education. Here are a few points I want to change to make the whole thing less POV after the split is made. These edits will be made in a week or two if no one objects.</p>
<p>1. The title. "The American Dream Downfall" Isn't the title of the section enough? 2."Consumerism and Economic materialism: Its emphasis on material possessions as a way of finding happiness is seen by critics as being somewhat superficial or meaningless. Many literary works level exactly that criticism at the American Dream, such as Arthur Miller's play Death of a Salesman. The play, a classic American work of literature, finds the main character Willy Loman struggling to come to grips with the fact that his American Dream is unattainable."</p>
<dl>
<dd>The last sentence is unnecessary, just put an internal link to Death of a Salesman and the reader can find it's synopsis there. I think there should also be a "literary" section to the whole article added, which I'll do when I make these edits to include criticisms such as Death of a Salesman, A Raisin in the Sun and the Great Gatsby as well as things like Horatio Alger's books which lay the foundation for the "rags to riches" aspect.</dd>
</dl>
<p>3."The concept of the American Dream also ignores other factors of success such as luck, family, language, and wealth one is born into.[citation needed] Proponents of the dream argue that starting wealth is irrelevant because of the belief that there is no level of poverty from which one cannot rise with hard work and determination.[citation needed]"</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think the concept of the American Dream ignores the "wealth one is born into" at all, in fact that's what a lot of it is based on, as mentioned in the introduction. The American Dream, ideally, works <i>despite</i> socio-economic background -- <b>rags</b> to riches. Therefore I would simply put here: "The concept of the American Dream also ignores other factors of success such as luck, family and language.[citation needed]"</dd>
</dl>
<p>4. "Some consider the American dream to be having two children and living in a house with financial security. Currently this iconic middle class lifestyle is however not lived by the majority of the population but rather only by a sizable minority."</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure why this is a criticism of the Dream. No where in the article or in any research I've read on the dream has there been a claim that a majority of Americans ever achieve it, I think the point is that ideally anyone who works hard enough <b>should</b> be able to achieve it. To me it would be better here to challenge the ideal of the nuclear family which is intrinsically biased against things like a traditional Chinese family where 3 generations live in the household.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The points which I'm going to assume aim to show how not everyone is living the American Dream are also POV. I guess these are meant as a sort of reality check.</p>
<p>5. "Higher Education ... college degree."</p>
<dl>
<dd>There just needs to be a sentence in the beginning such as "The high paying jobs in the United States increasingly require some sort of college or university degree." and then jump into why this is hard to come by for lower income families. But really this whole section has to keep in mind that I'm not sure anyone ever said achieving the dream would be <i>easy</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>6."Economies of scale â It can be difficult to successfully start a business. One reason is because of the economies of scale necessary to survive in a commoditized market, although many markets today are not commoditized."</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why is this relevant?</dd>
</dl>
<p>7."Ethical differences â As in other countries, actions considered ethical vary between Americans. For example, a CEO who sees certain stock options as excessive monetary gain would find it harder to attain great wealth than one with a different viewpoint."</p>
<dl>
<dd>I would replace the comment in it's entirety with something closer to "The original American Dream</dd>
</dl>
<p>8."The American dream may have an overtone and influence in promoting materialism philosophy with herd instinct effects."</p>
<dl>
<dd>This needs to be cited to something and separated into different points and put in the first section. The materialism is already mentioned, I can't back up the herd mentality because I've never heard that criticism before but if someone can back it up that's fine.</dd>

<p>The opening paragraphs of this article twice mention "meritocracy" as an American (or capitalist) characteristic; this is debatable at best, "opportunity" might be a more accurate word here, but the playing field is too far from level to call our current economic system anything like truly merit-based.

<dl>
<dd>While this can sometimes be true, the fact is that the American Dream is inextricably linked with meritocracy. The American dream is that if you work hard, you will be rewarded by merit. Whether this truly happens in our current economic system is irrelevant. Besides, a lot of positions today are truly merit-based. Sure, there is corruption, but hey, people still view it as meritocracy, or else people would stop trying to gain promotions...--<a href="../../../5/p/t/User%7E5ptcalvinist.html" title="User:5ptcalvinist">FivePointCalvinist (My Friends Call me 'Cal')</a> 01:48, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
