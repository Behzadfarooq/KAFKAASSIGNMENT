<p>The original lineup of the The Plan was Trevor Moment, Lee Christ and Mike Bridavsky. The Plan released two <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demo_%28music%29.html" title="Demo (music)">demos</a> before their name change. The "Rock-A-Die Demo" was recorded in the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, and it featured five <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horror_fiction.html" title="Horror fiction">horror</a>-themed punk-<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_rock.html" title="Art rock">art rock</a> songs. Moment wrote the music and <a href="../../../l/y/r/Lyrics.html" title="Lyrics">lyrics</a> and the <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drums.html" title="Drums">drums</a>, <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar.html" title="Guitar">guitars</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_guitar.html" title="Bass guitar">bass</a> were done by <a href="../../../s/o/u/Sound_engineer.html" title="Sound engineer">sound engineer</a> Mike Bridavsky. Christ played drums on the <a href="../../../c/o/v/Cover_version.html" title="Cover version">cover</a> of Samhain's "Black Dream" which was originally intended to be included on a Samhain <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tribute_album.html" title="Tribute album">tribute album</a>. This demo laid the groundwork for the sound of The Plan/American Werewolves. The songs on the demo were later be re-worked/re-recorded with great attention paid to maintaining the purity of the original versions.</p>
<p>Moment decided that he needed to put together a live band. Bridavsky couldn't be anything more than a <a href="../../../s/e/s/Session_musician.html" title="Session musician">studio guitarist</a> because he was a <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recording.html" title="Recording">recording</a> <a href="../../../s/t/u/Student.html" title="Student">student</a> at the time and the short search for a replacement began. The search ended shortly after when Moment met Brendan Moore. <a name="Beginnings" id="Beginnings"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Werewolves_%28band%29_fc9a.html" title="Edit section: Beginnings">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Beginnings</span></h2>
<p>Brendan Moore was attending the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Institute_of_Art_696d.html" title="Cleveland Institute of Art">Cleveland Institute of Art</a> at the same time as Moment. Moore had been playing bass in a local band at the time and the two found they shared similar interests. The first rehearsal was in Moment's garage. Moment did <a href="../../../v/o/c/Vocals.html" title="Vocals">vocals</a>, Christ played <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drum_kit.html" title="Drum kit">drums</a> Moore handled guitar. The first rehearsal was shaky but promising. This lineup didn't last long because Christ left to attend college. Steve Callahan was recruited from Brendan's other band to play drums. After auditioning a number of bassists, the band decided to have Brendan, now known as Brendan Less, play bass and to find a new guitarist. Skinny, a motorcycle friend of Moment's, was an accomplished guitarist, and he soon joined the band. In the summer of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> the band played their first show at the Phantasy Nite Club with ex-<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Misfits_7283.html" title="The Misfits">Misfit</a> <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Steele_a06f.html" title="Bobby Steele">Bobby Steele</a>'s The Undead. The band played songs from the "Rock-A-Die Demo" as well as some Misfits covers.</p>
<p>After the Phantasy show, The Plan rehearsed sporadically and often unproductively. Less had another band that was talking to <a href="../../../r/e/c/Record_label.html" title="Record label">labels</a> and he left The Plan. Moment and Less remained good friends. A mutual friend of Moment and Skinny named Tony Scamboney became the new bassist for The Plan. The <a href="../../../g/o/t/Goth_music.html" title="Goth music">gothic</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minimalism.html" title="Minimalism">minimalist</a> feel of Less' playing was replaced by Scamboney's more violent punk vibe. The new lineup debuted on <a href="../../../h/a/l/Halloween.html" title="Halloween">Halloween</a> of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> to a crowd of fans who had heard on the "Rock-A-Die Demo". The band played three more shows before <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Year%27s_Day_a3c7.html" title="New Year's Day">New Year's Day</a>.</p>
<p>Moment and ex-member Brendan Less both felt that The Plan needed to be as violent on stage as their music was, and this led to the decision not to continue with Skinny. Skinny's <a href="../../../l/e/d/Led_Zeppelin_cf85.html" title="Led Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a>/<a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimi_Hendrix_a916.html" title="Jimi Hendrix">Hendrix</a> guitar hero persona did not fit with Moment's vision of what a <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garage_band.html" title="Garage band">garage band</a> should be. The Plan looked for a new guitarist and decided to record a new demo in the meantime. <a name="The_Atom_Age" id="The_Atom_Age"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Werewolves_%28band%29_fc9a.html" title="Edit section: The Atom Age">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Atom Age</span></h2>
<p>"The Atom Age Demo" was recorded in The Plan's rehearsal spot in one evening. Callahan played all of the instruments for the record and the vocal tracking was done at Bridavsky's studio in <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana.html" title="Indiana">Indiana</a>. Moment wanted to record the new songs the band had at the time. Once the demo was finished it saw a very small pressing that the band had put out themselves. Upon the release of the demo the band now was nearly defunct mainly because the newest band members couldn't translate the energy found on the demo into the live setting. The Plan hadn't played in months and Moment felt it was time to restart the band because of the growing popularity of the Atom Age Demo. This new lineup survived long enough to record a full length record at a studio in Mentor, Ohio. This album would never see daylight. Only a handful of people have even heard it. Moment, lacking any real punk rock credibility, was unable to keep up with the hardcore direction that the Plan was heading with the current lineup. Realizing that all odds were stacked against him, Moment began to flake on band practice while still making plans to have the album released. A legal threat towards Moment from his bandmates squashed its release.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Werewolves_%28band%29_fc9a.html" title="Edit section: We Won't Stay Dead">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">We Won't Stay Dead</span></h2>
<p>Though The Plan had dug its own grave, Trevor Moment still wanted to perform and write music. American Werewolves were born. Moment formed the American Werewolves with new drummer Nate 68, guitarist Ray Terry (Allergic to Whores/Nightbreed/Kill The Fall) and Tony Scamboney. The band played its first official show with Integrity at Peabody's in Cleveland, Ohio. The band did play a one-off show at the Grog Shop in (Cleveland Heights) a few weeks earlier but was never really considered to be the official show since some of the members had never met prior to taking the stage and the set was kind of thrown together. It was more like a practice show.</p>
<p>The band had made its mark in a big way with the Integrity show. The band still had the faithful from The Plan days and made plenty of new fans at that show. The band played a couple more shows until the amicable departure of Ray Terry. Ray had his own band to focus on and felt that AW was cutting into that. This left Moment with the familiar task of having to find a new guitarist.</p>
<p>In early June of 2003 Trevor contacted an old friend who was quite familiar with the American Werewolves/The Plan catalog to see if he'd be interested in filling the newly vacant guitar spot. This would mark the third time that Brendan Less would be a part of the organization. The band had made plans to record the first release under the name American Werewolves. After just four practices with the new lineup, the 'Wolves entered Russian Recording Studio in Nashville, Indiana to begin work on what would become "We Won't Stay Dead" with Mike Bridavsky at the helm. Thirteen tracks and five days later the album was done. The album contained some unreleased songs as well as re-recorded versions of older songs performed by The Plan.</p>
