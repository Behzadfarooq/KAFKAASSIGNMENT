<p>Karmann, I went ahead and reverted the edit because the reformatting needs to be done using the following "formula"</p>
<p>* {{cite book | author = Last Name, First name| title = The title of the book goes here | publisher = name of the publisher goes here | year = XXXX | id = ISBN X-XXXX-XXX-X}}</p>
<p>So for the Standard Catalog of American Cars, the entry would be:</p>

<li>If it reads like a research paper, then it is a good and verifiable description of the company. When I first saw this article about AMC, it was mostly a description of the cars made by the company. Information about their products should be in the many articles about those models. I am new to this Wikipedia stuff, but I think this page should be about the history of the company itself (just like the extensive coverage of other automakers on their pages). In other words, it should help the reader understand AMC's business, strategy, management, and competitive situation. Information on the firm's specific models, engines, production, etc. is then linked from here. And speaking of Point Of View, I have tried to use outside sources (could someone help out and fix the footnotes to a proper format?) to represent the facts about the company. These are real authorities - such as the quotes by Lutz - that add value to the article. However, what I found when I first read this, the article was a continuous perspective that the company was doing things wrong. The best example were the statements that AMC made just average conventional cars. The truth was that consumers were buying them in droves. Therefore, it is far more significant to state a verifiable fact that Rambler became the third best selling brand because of their "conventional" models. I know the point of view of auto enthusiasts. Nevertheless, as far as styling and engineering are concerned - even to this day - Chevy sells several hundred thousand very average and conventional vehicles, for every one Corvette. However, if you scan today's automobile magazines, their pages focus cars such as the Corvette. They hardly mention the cars that most people buy and they are the vehicles that keep the automakers in business! Well, that is my $0.02 for now! <a href="../../../c/z/m/User%7ECZmarlin_1d2e.html" title="User:CZmarlin">CZmarlin</a> 16:56, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The first paragraph of this article says that the Renault brand was discontinued after Chrysler bought AMC. I'm not entirely sure what this means. The way I've understood things were was that Renault owned AMC partly or completely and sold it to Chrysler. Certainly, the fact that AMC was passed under Chrysler's ownership had little effect with Renault's existence, either as a brand or as a company. If the article writer is trying to say that the Renault brand was removed from the US market, it certainly did not give that impression to me.</p>

<li>Good observation. Renault continued as a brand in other parts of the world and is of course a major automaker. The first section now should now be more clear - that Chrysler discontinued the use of AMC and Renault brand names in the USA.</li>

<p>It seems to me it would make sense to have some more templates that we can put in each article about AMC's cars, engines, etc.</p>
<p><br />
For instance, what about putting the AMC model timeline in a template that can be inserted into the Gremlin, Ambassador, Spirit (etc etc) articles? How do I establish one?</p>
<p><br />
Perhaps a few of us should agree on the common templates needed, and then add them to each model article. Ideas?</p>

<p>The 1958 Rambler American was not the only discontinued car body to be reintroduced. The 1980-81 Pontiac Bonneville body was brought back for the 1985-86 Parissienne. Approximately 85,000 were built for each year, not a bad showing.</p>

<dd>Marc -- Does the Mighty Mite belong in this timeline -- or on the Jeep side? This model was not available to the public market. Rather, it was built under a contract for the armed forces. I think it needs to be with the Jeep utility vehicles -- or a special article or section that would focus on specialized vehicles made by the AM General division under AMC. Moreover, the <a href="../../../m/i/g/Mighty_Mite_711e.html" title="Mighty Mite">Mighty Mite</a> does not yet have its own article! <a href="../../../c/z/m/User%7ECZmarlin_1d2e.html" title="User:CZmarlin">CZmarlin</a> 20:31, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's also worth noting that the 1940-41 Graham Hollywood and Huppmobile Skylark were updated reintroductions of the 1936-37 Cord 810/812 body. Rhettro76 19:01, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see no mention of AMC buying Kaiser-Jeep in February 1970. The article reads like they had Jeep all along. This needs to be changed.</p>
<p>Also, I'm not quite sure how the Eagle Summit was envisioned as a replacement for the Eagle wagon, especially since the Summit was much smaller and wasn't available in America in wagon form until 1992. The Summit was much more of an Alliance/Encore replacement.</p>
<p>The Vista, which was only available in Canada, was added in 1989 in AWD wagon form, but it was not a replacement for the Eagle wagon, either, as it was simply a rebadged Mitsubishi-built Dodge/Plymouth Colt Vista that had been in production since 1984. And due to its rather limited availability, it could hardly be considered a proper successor to the Eagle wagon. Rhettro76 18:59, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
