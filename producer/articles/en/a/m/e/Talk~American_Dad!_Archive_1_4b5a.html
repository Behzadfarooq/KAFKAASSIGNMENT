<dd>The only place FOX ever refers to it with the exclamation point is in the logo, where it's probably just used for emphasis. I would believe the intent of the creators was for the title to omit the exclamation mark. <a href="../../../r/a/l/User%7ERal315_8325.html" title="User:Ral315"><font color="red">ral</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/l/User_talk%7ERal315_a2a8.html" title="User talk:Ral315"><font color="green">315</font></a> 07:04, May 29, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If that were the case, why does the show use an exclamation mark? Family Guy doesn't have an exclamation mark in the title sequence, obviously the&#160;! was intentional.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill2k_85ea.html" title="User:Will2k">Will2k</a> 13:11, May 30, 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If there was a big face on the logo, would we put that in the title? The exclamation mark is illustrative; it's not part of the title of the show. The <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macy%27s.html" title="Macy's">Macy's</a> logo has a star, not an apostrophe. But everyone knows the name as Macy's, not macy*s, and the company uses that convention (except in the title part of their web site, but that's an anomaly). I salute Fox for refusing to bastardize the English language by writing the exclamation point in prose.</dd>
<dd>The TV Tome/IMDb argument is moot. In general, Wikipedia favors <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28identity%29_da8f.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (identity)">self-identification</a> (that link refers specifically to more sensitive issues, but the guideline has pervaded the site), whereas those sites go by what's on the title card of the show. For example, at IMDb, <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghostbusters.html" title="Ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a> is Ghost Busters because the title card for the movie was written as two lines: GHOST/BUSTERS. Fox calls the show <i>American Dad</i>, not <i>American Dad!</i>, so we should favor that rendering.</dd>

<dd>"I salute Fox for refusing to bastardize the English language by writing the exclamation point in prose." How exactly is the utilisation of a punctuation mark a "bastardisation" of the language? The <i>American Dad!</i> title is also not an example of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prose.html" title="Prose">prose</a>, but simply of televised marquee-style text. Your comment, in a sense, is a bastardisation of the language - using a word for something other than that which it is strictly defined. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJasonglchu_2790.html" title="User:Jasonglchu">jglc</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/s/User_talk%7EJasonglchu_8af4.html" title="User talk:Jasonglchu">t</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jasonglchu_1515.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jasonglchu">c</a> 18:46, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Using it as part of a name, and therefore in the middle of a sentence, is. The exclamation mark isn't supposed to go anywhere other than at the <i>end</i> of a sentence. <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENik42_afcf.html" title="User:Nik42">Nik42</a> 05:44, 24 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I disagree, the current format is in line with the Family Guy page. Perhaps when it gets a little bigger the article could be spilt with a new "Cast of American Dad" page. Currently however it doesnt hurt. Also can we clarify - is Deputy Director Bullock actually voiced by Patrick Stewart?</p>

<p>Hard to say. I think the person who wrote that drew the line between the two pets which were both infatuated with the mothers.</p>
<p>To me this list seems pretty useless. Sure there are similarities, but if someone reads this list without having seen an episode it sounds like a total (100%) rip off. You could make a list of characteristics similar to family guy, but this seems to be just a way of someone who dislikes this series to show how unoriginal it is. Otherwise why isn't there included for example that Peters a very unhealthy, lazy guy and Stan is rather a disciplined guy (tho stupid) -- 14:15, 27 April (GMT+01:00)</p>

<li>I agree. They're two half-hour animated sitcoms about families by the same creator. Of course there are going to be simularities.

<p>-- I agree Mutze, it seems that the table is a basic comparison, and beyond people's opinions, it is a somewhat pointless table. You can compare television shows that similar ideas until the cows come home, there are similarities in almost everything on television today. And most television is derived from basic formulas anyway. Besides, there are no citations to back that information up, it may as well be someone's opinion. You could argue the similarities and differences between the two for ages. And half the comparisons are not even accurate anyhow. For example, it cites both Roger and Brian as eating, drinking and smoking. This is right except that Rogers sugar addicition is more of a central point to the show and the only time Brian is seen eating, is at meals with the family. In addition, Brian prefers martinis and Roger drinks mostly wine. As well, both characters were only seen smoking in a few episodes at best and it has never been a big part of the show, outside of very specific jokes, and one ep of FG. And this is just one character comparison! I vote to scrap it, seems pointless and inaccurate. --<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChewbacca1010_0eaa.html" title="User:Chewbacca1010">chewbacca1010</a></p>

<dd>That table was completely useless, rather than pointing out comparisons of the two shows, it instead went out of it's way to show how they are similar. It looked forced and ugly. I changed them to more comparions so people can actually COMPARE the shows, instead of thread bare similarities over the bare arsed facts.

<p>Alright, I removed it. It seems idiotic, if you want to throw the blurb back in about the comparisons between shows, go for it, but the table is idiotic and useless, especially after the cleanup you did Jay. Once it was more detailed, they weren't all that similar. And the quote at the start of the blurb about how Seth said the shows were the same was taken from a Letterman interview. Doesn't anyone think he was probably joking? Hope I don't get railed for this...<a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChewbacca1010_0eaa.html" title="User:Chewbacca1010">Chewy</a></p>

<dd>I did my best with the clean up, but I wasn't exactly sure what the intentions were. It looked like someone was comparing the two shows based on, well I based on god knows what.

<p>I have the impression that Stan mispronounce certain words, says inexistent ones or uses words in sentences with incorrect sense. It could be possible that the producers established this in order to denote his low level of culture?</p>

<ul>
<li>That's not my impression, and I am a native speaker of American English. I happened to be watching an episode when I saw your question, and the only time Stan used an incorrect phrase during that episode was when he said his daughter's boyfriend looked like a "stone man"; she corrected him by saying that he meant "stoner." But "stoner" is a slang term for a drug user (particularly a marijuana user), not formal English, so Stan's use of the incorrect phrase indicates his lack of familiarity with drug culture, not that he is uneducated or has a low level of culture. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 06:48, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm a big Metal Gear fan but doesn't anyone think that the references to Naked and Solid Snake in the section on Stan's dad are stretching it a bit? The only similarity between Naked Snake and Jack Smith is the eyepatch. What about Charlton Heston's character from the film True Lies? There is much more of a similarity there. However, I don't think we should go looking for look-a-likes. I was tempted to delete the references to Metal Gear as I believe them to be irrelevant and it looks like some other Metal Gear fan has hijacked this article. 80.42.24.151</p>

<p>In the past I've gone through the character list and culled out useless trivia based on one-off gags.

<dd>Instead of deleting them, change them to reflect the sporadic nature of their occurence. "Stan has been known to use air horns to drown out his daughter's speech" and "Francine appears to be aroused during spring cleaning".

<p>There are references to "Season 1" and "Season 2" when the Fox.com site lists all episodes so far as being Season 1. I understand this is due to the episodes not being shown in a continuos run in the US, and don't get me started on the randomness of them being shown here in the UK. This could lead to confusion with the Fox website now stating Season 2 will begin in April.</p>

<dd>Correct, only one season has been aired so far. Season 2 starts airing on the 23rd April. Due to the haphazard airing, this confusin may arise (Futurama is only 4 seasons, for example, yet was aired as 5). --ƒtr</dd>

<p>Someone should edit in that the complete first season (not the first 13 eps) will be released in region 4 on 24 May 2006 according to [<a href="http://www.ezydvd.com.au/item.zml/785884" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ezydvd.com.au/item.zml/785884" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] --DK 04:45, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Can we PLEASE keep the episode list CORRECT? Fox has confirmed that Episode 20 "Roger 'n Me" April 23, 2006 is the start of Season 2, not the 4th last episode of Season 1. The clue is even in the production code... 80.192.14.224 23:29, 24 April 2006 (UTC)ftr The problem was caused because of the difference between a production seaason and a viewing season. One should be used consistantly.</p>

<p>This entry needs to have some critical analysis and comparisons between Family Guy. --68.103.154.140 03:38, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That once was here, but it was removed, for the reason that this exactly what a Wikipedia article does NOT need.

<p>There obviously shouldnt be vague unsourced statements about how lots of people (even diehard family guy fans) dont care for it. But I feel there is a definite consensus that the show missed the mark and there should be some kind of section on its reception with links to legitimite sources backing this up. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.7.188.153 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.7.188.153.html" title="User talk:71.7.188.153">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.7.188.153_bd9b.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.7.188.153">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>If you can find some, feel free to throw them in. Just be sure to cite the appropriate sources. What Mütze refers to is an old list comparing that characters between FG and AD, that was both factually wrong AND irrelevant, so we decided to scrap it, since it wasn't really worth having. After all, the <a href="../../../f/u/t/Futurama.html" title="Futurama">Futurama</a> article doesn’t have a list comparing the characters to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>.

<dd>On the subject of criticisms, I personally think we'll have to wait a bit longer to see any sort of reviews of the show.

<p>I've heard lots of criticisms of this show, its a punching bag for critics.

<dd>You've "heard lots of criticisms" where? Care to share the evidence? Otherwise, forget it, this isn't a soapbox.
