<p>One of the fundamental problems with so-called "wiki" is anyone with an opinion —&#160;no matter how uninformed it may be — can post an article and claim it to be definitive.</p>
<p>In line with this, a fundamental difference between this site and American Free Press is that we actually make an effort to communicate with people who are knowledgeable about the subject of our articles. In many cases, we seek out primary sources for our reports. No one has ever bothered to contact any of us about this so-called article and the category of "neo-nazism" that we purportedly fall under.</p>
<p>In fact, if readers will check the history here, they will see that we have attempted to delete this post and replace it with one that more accurately reflects reality.</p>
<p>Where the author of this post gets his information about who founded AFP and why remains a mystery to us. The fact is, many people were involved in the founding of AFP, including lawyers, consultants and other regular folks. To credit one person significantly downplays the roles many well-intentioned, intelligent people have played in keeping AFP alive over the years.</p>
<p>If there were any truth to the claims on this site, then it should be easily proven by simply quoting from AFP to demonstrate that we are, in fact, "neo-nazi," "racist" or "anti-Semitic." A discerning reader will notice there are no direct attributions, which should lead him to believe that this specific post is a bunch of hokum.</p>
<p>If anyone should know about this, it should me, the editor of AFP since its founding in August 2001.</p>
<p>C. Petherick Editor, AFP</p>

<dd>You can actually help this situation, by adding more and better material to the article that gives a better picture, like I just did.
<dl>
<dd>Don't lie. I just found a copy of AFP at my college and picked it up because the front headlines were anti-war and anti-globalization. I thought it might be an interesting read so I picked it up, and I'm glad I did. I plan on changing the title of this rag to "Nazi Propaganda" on every last one of these lame papers I come across when I go back to school tomorrow. I strongly suspect the person who put these out is the same person who has been drawing swastikas around campus with feel-good phrases like "Niggers Get Out". You have an article that talks about the injustice recieved by a holocaust denier. True, the government shouldn't censor peoples views, but the way you describe it, it's obvious you like this guy's reputation for "writing about little-known facts concerning WWII". Uh huh, yeah, facts. Your idea of "facts" is probably that Nazi Germany didn't actually kill 6 million Jews, (not to mention gypsies, political dissidents, gays, Jehovah's Witnesses, trade unionists, mentally disabled, physically disabled etc...) but actually gave them medals of honor for being great people. What a crock. Of course, you keep the most radical stuff in the classified area, but that is just because most people overlook that. The classifieds advertise for the National Alliance. Now you try and tell me you're not a recruiting tool for the nazis. Oh, and I can't forget the add for the "White Christian Heritage Festival". Oh, and the book <i>The War That Never Ended</i> about the war Hitler started and the "Hitler movement [being] very much alive". Oh, and the books <i>White Man's Bible</i> and <i>On the Brink of a Bloody Racial War</i>. Oh, and books by Christian Identity. Sure, you try to balance this out with one add for an event that includes one african-american speaker, but c'mon, that's just you're token black dude to help deflect the true nature of this garbage. You may be able to fool some of the people most of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time. A nazi by any other name would still smell as vile.</dd>

<dd>If the AFP has no affiliation with Neo-Nazis or any other White Nationalist Radicals, why does it share an address with The Barnes Review?

<p>It's always funny how people are forced to use the advertisements to assail American Free Press, claiming the publication is a recruiting tool for this group or that group. Worse, the focus generally is on the Classified advertising, buried in the back of the newspaper. In fact, we have taken advertising from people who claim that UFOs were seen in the United States and from others who believe the 14th Amendment was never ratified. We also have health ads and others from more mainstream organizations. Does that mean we are recruiting for these people, too. Of course not.</p>
<p>The point I am making is that none of these detractors have visited AFP's office or spoken directly to the people who work there. They are merely speculating on what employees may or may not believe. The fact is they do not have any direct insight into the publication, having read just one issue, or know anything about the dozen people who founded it in 2001 and have kept it alive for the past five years.</p>
<p>We cannot be responsible for readers who may get the wrong idea. Every individual is entitled to form his own views about media, and then make a choice as to whether or not he will read it. But do not overstate your own knee-jerk reaction to imply your opinion is anything but an opinion.</p>
<p>For those who are genuinely interested, visit the web site americanfreepress.net. There, you, too, will be able to form an educated opinion and decide for yourself whether American Free Press is a recruiting tool for ufologists, vegetarians, family farmers, anti-globalists, alt currency organizations, tax protesters or any group that chooses to place an advertisement in the publication.</p>

<dd>This paper is under no obligation to accept advertisments from nazis, and the fact that it does shows at least some sympathy for their cause, or else a serious thirst for cash. I don't care how much they offer and how much I need, I would never accept money from nazis--I would eat trash before I sold out that much. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 04:33, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm going to include a link to AFP in the article. Curious that there isn't one there already. Did a detractor of the newspaper remove it? Dr. Moreau 23:50, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How did this become an article on Willis Carto? Willis Carto has no official connection to AFP. All this stuff about Carto belongs in a seperate article. I would change it myself, but frankly, I have no inclination to invest any time in this project. Having worked on articles here in the past, I consider any effort expended here to be a waste of valuable time. Dr. Moreau 23:37, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've reverted the article to an earlier version which was much more balanced and NPOV (and which stuck to the subject at hand, rather than turning it into a biography of Willis Carto while removing the external link to the newspaper). Hopefully others will revert again if they notice this kind of vandalism in the future. I will keep this article on my watchlist, and advise my aquantainces here on Wikipedia to do the same.

<p>The article is clearly one-sided; apart from one brief mention that the newspaper rejects the criticism, the whole tenor of the piece is hostile and sneering. There must be something more to be said on the other side. At the moment, the text reads more like propaganda than an encyclopædia article. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 10:43, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
