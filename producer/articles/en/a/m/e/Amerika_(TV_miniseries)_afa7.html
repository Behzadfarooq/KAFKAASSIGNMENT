	    <p><i><b>Amerika</b></i> – suggesting a <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_language.html" title="Russian language">Russian</a> name for the United States – was an American <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/Miniseries.html" title="Miniseries">miniseries</a> that was <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987_in_television.html" title="1987 in television">broadcast in 1987</a>. It starred <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kris_Kristofferson_f0a5.html" title="Kris Kristofferson">Kris Kristofferson</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariel_Hemingway_2cda.html" title="Mariel Hemingway">Mariel Hemingway</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Neill_d805.html" title="Sam Neill">Sam Neill</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Urich_c145.html" title="Robert Urich">Robert Urich</a>, and a 17-year-old <a href="../../../l/a/r/Lara_Flynn_Boyle_e817.html" title="Lara Flynn Boyle">Lara Flynn Boyle</a> in her first major role. <i>Amerika</i> was about life in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> after a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat.html" title="Coup d'état">bloodless takeover</a> by the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Union_ad1f.html" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>. Not wanting to depict the actual coup, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> Entertainment president Brandon Stoddard instead chose to set the action of the miniseries ten years after the event, focusing on the demoralized American people a decade after the Soviet conquest. The intent, he later explained, was to explore the American spirit under such conditions, not to portray the conflict of the Soviet takeover.</p>
<p>Described in promotional materials as "the most ambitious American miniseries ever created," <i>Amerika</i> aired for 14½ hours (including commercials) over seven nights, and reportedly cost <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_dollar_db5c.html" title="United States dollar">US$</a>40 million to produce. The program was filmed in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario.html" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>, and at various locations in <a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebraska.html" title="Nebraska">Nebraska</a> – most notably the small town of <a href="../../../t/e/c/Tecumseh%2C_Nebraska_c969.html" title="Tecumseh, Nebraska">Tecumseh</a>, which stood in for <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milford%2C_Nebraska_d6ba.html" title="Milford, Nebraska">Milford</a>, the setting for most of the action of the series. Donald Wrye was the executive producer, director, and sole writer of <i>Amerika</i>, while composer <a href="../../../b/a/s/Basil_Poledouris_0c19.html" title="Basil Poledouris">Basil Poledouris</a> was hired to score the miniseries, ultimately recording (with the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Symphony_Orchestra_b2fe.html" title="Hollywood Symphony Orchestra">Hollywood Symphony Orchestra</a>) eight hours of music – the equivalent of four feature films.</p>

<p>Although claims have been made that <i>Amerika</i> was produced partly in response to the 1983 television film <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Day_After_e65b.html" title="The Day After">The Day After</a></i> (which some critics felt was too <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifism.html" title="Pacifism">pacifist</a> for portraying the doctrine of nuclear deterrence as pointless), Stoddard dismissed this view, pointing instead to a column in the now-defunct <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_Herald-Examiner_1738.html" title="Los Angeles Herald-Examiner">Los Angeles Herald-Examiner</a> by <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Nixon</a> speechwriter (and later, television personality) <a href="../../../b/e/n/Ben_Stein_c658.html" title="Ben Stein">Ben Stein</a>. Stein's column appeared a few weeks before <i>The Day After</i> aired. He wrote, in part:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>...since my dear friends at ABC-TV have made a TV movie very rightly describing the terror of an atomic attack on America, perhaps they might consider something else. Perhaps they might make a TV movie about why the people of the United States face such a dreadful risk. They might make a movie about what life in the United States would be like if we lived under Soviet domination.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Here is the idea: Let's have a movie called "In Red America." It would be about a few days or weeks in the life of several American families after the Soviet Union had taken over America.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Stoddard acknowledged that Stein's remarks provided the inspiration for the series, and Stein apparently wrote an outline or story treatment for <i>Amerika</i>, although he was otherwise not directly involved.</p>

<p><i>Amerika</i> arrived amid much controversy. Many critics and viewers felt it was too long and unrealistic, a number of people argued that it would be damaging to Soviet-American relations, and a spokesperson for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> objected to the U.N. being depicted as an occupying force under Soviet control. Some conservatives felt that Soviet brutality was greatly underplayed; conversely, a number of liberals dismissed the entire miniseries as right-wing paranoia. At various points, the program was scrapped, delayed, and rewritten.</p>
<p>For their part, the Soviet Union threatened to shut down the ABC News Moscow bureau, although this threat was not carried out and indeed seemed to strengthen ABC's resolve regarding the miniseries. "We’re going to run that program come rain, blood, or horse manure," said ABC president John B. Sias, after the still-to-be-aired <i>Amerika</i> had generated more controversy and viewer response than any other ABC program before or since, including <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Day_After_e65b.html" title="The Day After">The Day After</a></i>.</p>
<p><i>Amerika</i> was preceded by an ABC special addressing the considerable controversy prior to its airing (<i>The Storm Over Amerika</i>), and was followed by an "ABC News Viewpoint" panel discussion moderated by <a href="../../../t/e/d/Ted_Koppel_dc99.html" title="Ted Koppel">Ted Koppel</a>, with Brandon Stoddard, Donald Wrye and several others addressing the issues surrounding the miniseries, along with questions and comments from a live studio audience in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>In the USSR, much less publicized written works were mirroring such political pieces as <i>Amerika</i>. Similarly, they depicted the scary existence of Soviet people, being under control of USA, namely, blooming <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racism.html" title="Racism">racism</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/g/Segregation.html" title="Segregation">segregation</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/s/Reservation.html" title="Reservation">reservation</a> for national minorities, political and legal oppression of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialistic.html" title="Socialistic">socialistic</a> movements, ideas and philosophy, erosion of ethics under pressure of capitalism, stimulating for dishonesty and implementation of jungle principle 'eat, or be eaten', lack of social and medical protection, <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illiteracy.html" title="Illiteracy">illiteracy</a>, appearance of massive ghettos districts for the poor all over the country, and so on (whatever was seen in USSR as drawback of political, social, and ethical system of USA)<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/Amerika_%28TV_miniseries%29_afa7.html" title="Edit section: Social criticism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Social criticism</span></h2>
<p><i>Amerika</i> criticized American society in the 1980s, implying that apathy and an unwillingness to defend <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_%28political%29.html" title="Freedom (political)">freedom</a> on the part of many citizens made the Soviet takeover rather easy. At one point, a key Soviet official observes that their plans for conquering the United States succeeded far beyond their wildest dreams, because once the nation had been defeated, Americans turned inward, not caring about national issues, seeking only to retain a piece of the prosperity that had once been theirs. "It (the Soviet coup) worked because you lost your country before we ever got here," says the Soviet leader. "You had political freedom, but you lost your passion ... How could we not win?"</p>
<p>This theme is echoed by another character later in the film:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Nobody wanted to risk anything for anybody else. Everybody was afraid they were going to lose what they had. They knew it was bad. They were just afraid it'd get worse. That's all they lived for - for things not to get worse.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Another speech, by politician Peter Bradford (see below), lashes out at apathetic American attitudes:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Damn, I'm so tired of this "I'm an American" bull! Where was all that patriotism when it counted? Where was that willingness to sacrifice? Nobody wanted to join the damn army to defend the country unless they got paid well! Nobody wanted to give any time to public service unless they could make a career out of it! And I didn't notice a lot of us giving up our lives in the last 10 years!</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>An early scene shows schoolchildren in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> learning about <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Darwinism_4ef0.html" title="Social Darwinism">Social Darwinism</a>, which is characterized as the dominant philosophy in the old United States before the Soviet conquest and occupation, and a speech delivered by one child later in the series demonstrates the extent of Soviet indoctrination in the new America:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>We are the voice of the new generation. We are the voice of the new people. The destructive ways of the past are gone. We will replace them with our vision of the future. The Party will lead us to the new age. There have been those who have tried to stop the new age. They are the corrupt reminder of the past. They have tried to confuse us with the idea that the old America was a good country. We know that lie. History teaches us that lie. We are grateful to our Soviet brothers who saved the world from destruction, and we can now join them in a world of socialist brotherhood. Everyone will go to school, everyone will have a job, everyone will be equal. No one will exploit or be exploited, and all those who oppose this wonderful vision will be crushed.</i></dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/Amerika_%28TV_miniseries%29_afa7.html" title="Edit section: Major characters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Major characters</span></h2>
<p>The storyline of <i>Amerika</i> primarily follows three political leaders:</p>
<p><b>Peter Bradford</b> (played by <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Urich_c145.html" title="Robert Urich">Robert Urich</a>) is a well-meaning, honest, county administrator in <a href="../../../n/e/b/Nebraska.html" title="Nebraska">Nebraska</a> who cooperates with the Soviets to create a better life for his community. Bradford attracts the attention of the Soviet leadership because, although interested in cooperating, he is independent, and widely respected by his constituents. The Soviets choose him to run one of the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bantustan.html" title="Bantustan">Bantustan</a>-like states – "Heartland" – carved out of the former United States. Under the new regime, Bradford's title is "Governor-General."</p>
<p><b>Devin Milford</b> (played by <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kris_Kristofferson_f0a5.html" title="Kris Kristofferson">Kris Kristofferson</a>) was a maverick politician before the Soviet occupation, and ran for President in 1988 (in the novel, 1992), after the U.S. defeat. He was placed in a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison_camp.html" title="Prison camp">prison camp</a> for daring to speak the truth about the Soviet conquest during his presidential campaign. At the beginning of the miniseries Devin is declared "rehabilitated" and is released back into society, into the custody of his father, who lives in the county run by Peter Bradford. (Conservative critics of <i>Amerika</i> have claimed that in real life, the Russians would have been unlikely to release such a person back into society.)</p>
<p><b>Colonel Andrei Denisov</b> of the <a href="../../../k/g/b/KGB_8668.html" title="KGB">KGB</a> (played by <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Neill_d805.html" title="Sam Neill">Sam Neill</a>) is the Soviet administrator for the American Central Administrative Area. At times, Andrei seems disappointed by the ease with which America has been conquered. He is romantically involved with Kimberly Ballard (played by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mariel_Hemingway_2cda.html" title="Mariel Hemingway">Mariel Hemingway</a>), an actress who discovers her American patriotism during the miniseries. Andrei's immediate superior and mentor is General Petya Samanov (played by <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armin_Mueller-Stahl_786a.html" title="Armin Mueller-Stahl">Armin Mueller-Stahl</a>), the Soviet military leader in charge of the occupation.</p>
<p>Major female characters, in addition to Ballard, include Peter Bradford's wife, Amanda (played by <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cindy_Pickett_66ba.html" title="Cindy Pickett">Cindy Pickett</a>), Devin Milford's ex-wife, Marion (played by <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wendy_Hughes_e940.html" title="Wendy Hughes">Wendy Hughes</a>), and most notably, Devin's sister Alethea (played by <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christine_Lahti_bd32.html" title="Christine Lahti">Christine Lahti</a>), who at the outset is prostituting herself to the local occupation leader. In subsequent episodes, Alethea finds her bearings and self-respect. "Alethea is the center," noted Donald Wrye. "She is a metaphor for America – not just phonically – and it is she who discovers her moral core through(out) the course of the series." <a href="../../../l/a/r/Lara_Flynn_Boyle_e817.html" title="Lara Flynn Boyle">Lara Flynn Boyle</a> played Bradford's teenage daughter, Jackie.</p>
<p>The human drama of these characters intersects with the political intrigue of the Soviet plans for the breakup of America. Bradford, the pragmatist, clashes with Milford, the idealist; Bradford's wife is Milford's ex-girlfriend, who finds she still has feelings for Milford upon his release from the prison camp; Denisov appoints Milford's ex-wife, a powerful magistrate (and General Samanov's mistress), to serve as Bradford's deputy/assistant in Heartland; and Kimberly's renewed sense of American pride ultimately affects her relationship with Denisov.</p>

<p>In the late 1980s, as the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S.S.R._11e6.html" title="U.S.S.R.">U.S.S.R.</a>'s economic and political decline puts it in danger of losing the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>, the Soviet leadership makes a desperate gamble to rearrange the global <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balance_of_power.html" title="Balance of power">balance of power</a>. Four huge <a href="../../../t/h/e/Thermonuclear_weapons.html" title="Thermonuclear weapons">thermonuclear weapons</a> are exploded in the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratosphere.html" title="Stratosphere">stratosphere</a> over the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. The <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electromagnetic_pulse.html" title="Electromagnetic pulse">electromagnetic pulse</a> (or EMP) of these weapons destroys the nation's military and commercial communications and computer systems, electrical grid, and, indeed, any piece of equipment that relies on computer technology, such as most late-model automobiles. With America's <a href="../../../i/c/b/ICBM_4c9d.html" title="ICBM">ICBMs</a> inoperative, and the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Command_Authority_8de7.html" title="National Command Authority">National Command Authority</a> unable to contact U.S. military forces abroad to counterattack, America is forced to accept Soviet terms for <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrender_%28military%29.html" title="Surrender (military)">surrender</a>. The United States quickly falls under Soviet military occupation - and the <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress.html" title="Congress">Congress</a> become figureheads for their Soviet overseers.</p>
<p>The subsequent takeover of the U.S. is tamely dubbed "The Transition". The miniseries details the final phase of the transition – the breakup of the United States ten years after its defeat.</p>
<p>The above events are implied in the miniseries, although never directly explained. The description is taken from the novelization of the miniseries, <i>Amerika: The Triumph of the American Spirit</i> by Brauna E. Pouns and Donald Wrye (Pocket Books, 1987), based on Wrye's screenplay; Wrye is reputed to have written a 175-page treatment describing how the Soviets took over. An introduction to the miniseries explaining the downfall of America ended up on the cutting room floor prior to broadcast, and only a fleeting line by actor Sam Neill alludes to an America without communications, presumably due to the effects of the electromagnetic pulse. The loss of technology and communications, however, is effectively presented in the opening scenes: no radios are heard playing, television is shown only in the Soviet leaders' offices, one scene in a church is lit completely by candlelight, and a woman is seen using an old sewing machine operated by foot pedal.</p>

<p>A decade after its defeat, America is occupied by a <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_3208.html" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> peacekeeping force called the United Nations Special Service Unit (U.N.S.S.U.). The U.N.S.S.U. is comprised primarily of <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Bloc_65e3.html" title="Eastern Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a> forces, and is overseen by an <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_German_b56f.html" title="East German">East German</a>, Major Helmut Gurtman. U.N.S.S.U. troops periodically engage in "training exercises," which are destructive in nature, and highly intimidating to the local population.</p>
<p>Those Americans who engage in dissent, or who otherwise express their opposition to the Soviet occupation are stripped of their privileges and sent to exile camps, where they are anathema not only to the Soviets, but also to their fellow citizens. Association with (and assistance to) the exiles is generally prohibited, although a few brave souls risk the loss of their own remaining freedoms by offering humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>Production quotas have been imposed, and foodstuffs rationed, with the surplus presumably being shipped to the Soviet Union. Peter Bradford and other residents of the future Heartland must settle for soy cakes with molasses at the local diner. "That's what really makes you want to give up. You can't even get a good breakfast," says one character.</p>
<p>Against this background, Bradford ascends to the leadership of Heartland, hoping to reform the Soviet occupation from within; Milford is released from the prison camp, hoping to be reunited with his children and fight against the occupation; and Denisov hopes to "salvage as much as possible" of the old America, while realizing that the U.S. essentially must cease to exist as a nation in order to appease the "old men in the <a href="../../../k/r/e/Kremlin.html" title="Kremlin">Kremlin</a>."</p>

<p>The Soviet leaders of the occupation are faced with the dual problem of keeping America pacified and convincing the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politburo.html" title="Politburo">Politburo</a> that their fears of a revitalized America are unfounded because the country is under occupation and can no longer pose a threat. The Politburo is not convinced, and even considers exploding <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_weapons.html" title="Nuclear weapons">nuclear weapons</a> over several American cities, as a warning -- to the American people, and to the world. Samanov and Denisov, both of whom want the Soviet occupation of the United States to be a relatively humane one, are horrified by this idea.</p>
<p>At great political risk, Samanov finally convinces the Soviet leadership to accept a compromise plan: no nuclear weapons will be detonated, the United States will be divided into "<a href="../../../c/l/i/Client_state.html" title="Client state">client states</a>" such as Heartland, and the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Capitol_9d8c.html" title="U.S. Capitol">U.S. Capitol</a> building will be destroyed as a symbolic gesture of the destruction of America. At the same time, most of the members of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress.html" title="Congress">Congress</a> are to be killed in a "<a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorist</a> attack" after they refuse to disband their legislative body, which the movie depicts very graphically.</p>
<p>After the attack is carried out – arguably the climactic scene of the miniseries – Samanov surveys the damage, and realizes the enormity of the crime that he has allowed to happen. Sitting in the Speaker's chair in the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Representatives_5c56.html" title="House of Representatives">House of Representatives</a>, he commits <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">suicide</a>. Denisov, who knows nothing about the attack until he is rushed to the Capitol and finds Samanov dead, is devastated by this turn of events.</p>
<p>In the final episode of the miniseries, Heartland is about to secede from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, with other regions to follow. There are scenes of Americans digging up guns they have hidden for ten years. Heartland troops, along with local militia, attack the local U.N.S.S.U. compound, effectively declaring war on the Soviet occupation. One scene shows Americans raising the U.S. flag on top of a grain elevator, and there is even reference to a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_American_Revolution_0046.html" title="Second American Revolution">Second American Revolution</a>. The miniseries ends on a downbeat note, though, with General Sittman (the leader of the Heartland Defense Force and a former <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Marine_Corps_d398.html" title="US Marine Corps">Marine</a>) shooting Devin Milford just as he is about to make a nationwide broadcast calling on Americans to resist the breakup of the United States – doing so because this is an act of unlawful resistance against the newly-established Heartland, which Sittman believes to be the best hope against continued Soviet domination. Although there is hope that the spirit of America lives on, in the end it appears that the Soviet plan to dissolve the United States will come to fruition.</p>
<p>Some sources have claimed that the finale of the miniseries was deliberately left somewhat unresolved to allow for the possibility of a weekly television series <a href="../../../s/e/q/Sequel.html" title="Sequel">sequel</a>; but such plans, if they indeed existed, never materialized.</p>

<p>Both the novel and miniseries leave the impression that, with the death of freedom in America, there is nowhere else in the world where it may be found. In the novel, one character muses: "The truth is, we've reached the first time in history where there's no place left to escape to. America, <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, there was always a beacon of hope somewhere. Now there's just one world and it's all bad." This dialogue suggests that the Soviet Union or other <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarian.html" title="Totalitarian">totalitarian</a> forces conquered other free countries after the U.S. coup (it can be surmised that the EMP which disabled American technology probably would have also crippled Canada and <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>, for example, and Denisov even says at one point that "we control most of the world"). There is also a scene with two emigres from the <a href="../../../g/d/r/GDR_bf47.html" title="GDR">GDR</a> who came to the United States before the Soviet takeover and are now exiles in their new country: "It's one of life's little jokes. We escaped from East Germany to come to the promised land; now the promised land has become worse than what we left."</p>
<p>In this new world, <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fidel_Castro_ecc2.html" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> heads what is now called "Greater <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>", embracing most of the Caribbean and Latin America, and the <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">Chinese</a> region of <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchuria.html" title="Manchuria">Manchuria</a> evidently has been absorbed into the U.S.S.R., as General Samanov remarks at one point that a <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebellion.html" title="Rebellion">rebellion</a> has happened in "our own Manchuria." A person named "Mbele" heads the "Socialist Republic of Southern Africa," "Barghout" is the leader of "Iraqistan," and <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_Europe_ef2f.html" title="Eastern Europe">Eastern Europe</a> is described as being a "powderkeg." The Soviet/Communist occupation of the world depicted in <i>Amerika</i> is not a peaceful one, echoing the unrest in the occupied United States.</p>

<p>The flag of the occupation is the pale blue <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_flag_0366.html" title="UN flag">UN flag</a>, with crossed American and Soviet flags superimposed on the sides.

<p><a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> is included with <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> and <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Lenin_a39d.html" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> in propaganda.

<p>A new <a href="../../../p/l/e/Pledge_of_Allegiance_e133.html" title="Pledge of Allegiance">Pledge of Allegiance</a> is given by "rehabilitated" political prisoners upon release from the American <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulags.html" title="Gulags">gulags</a>.

<p>While the prisoners are told that they are free to refuse to make this pledge if they so desire, the circumstances under which the oath is administered would seem to indicate otherwise.</p>

<p>The first two nights of <i>Amerika</i> garnered huge ratings, but audience numbers dropped thereafter, and the overall miniseries averaged around 19 percent of American television households, compared to a 46 rating for <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Day_After_e65b.html" title="The Day After">The Day After</a></i>. "It wasn't as big a hit as its supporters had hoped," said Ted Koppel, "but it wasn't a disaster, either."</p>
<p>Although a 35 share reportedly had been promised to advertisers, Stoddard was happy with the performance of <i>Amerika</i>, claiming that all or part of the miniseries had been watched by 100 million people - a ratings bonanza for ABC, then in third place among the three major networks.</p>

<p>While <i>The Day After</i> may have changed the opinions of some people about <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_war.html" title="Nuclear war">nuclear war</a>, <i>Amerika</i> did not appear to have affected public opinion either of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">Communism</a> or of the former Soviet Union.

<p><i>Amerika</i> has remained unseen on American television since its original telecast on ABC, possibly because its politics quickly became dated over the next few years with the breakup of the Soviet Union, the fall of the <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berlin_Wall_24be.html" title="Berlin Wall">Berlin Wall</a>, and the reunification of <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>; perhaps also because it was not as popular as other miniseries.

<ul>
<li><i>When you lose and fail, it is understandable. When you win and fail, that brings madness.</i> – General Petya Samanov</li>
<li><i>Totalitarianism doesn't need armies. It only needs to control a couple of things – the media, and the ability to dispense privilege to some, and to withhold it from others. Of course, a weak and divided people helps.</i> – The last, unnamed, President of the United States</li>
<li><i>All the kids growing up now don't have any idea of the difference between the symbol of Abraham Lincoln and what he actually stood for. You can't look at those eyes and not think of what being an American has meant. Now there's an end to it. Soon, there will be no America. We'll be history, quickly lost and distorted, like Mr. Lincoln himself ... I suppose there will have to be new revolutions, with new generations who will have to discover the values which our forefathers handed down to us. If those truths stop being real, maybe it's better to let them go, to let some new generation discover, as though for the first time. Maybe freedom is just one of those things you can't inherit.</i> – Peter Bradford, at the Lincoln Memorial</li>
<li><i>Look at us. Here we are, who we are because our forefathers struggled through their lives – building a dream, sacrificing for it when that was what was called for, dying for it. We're the result. The dream didn't die with them. It lives in us. I can't, I won't abandon that legacy. America's not a flag, or a piece of territory – it's each one of us, in here, around the country. That's what America is. How can we give it up?</i> – Devin Milford</li>
<li><i>I'm not going to accept the breakup of America. I'll resist with my spirit, I'll resist with my life. I can resist because I've found the love of my children – the possibilities of their lives are more important than my own. I'll live through my children - through whatever good and true things I might have taught them, or the legacy of fear I might have left them. Each of us will find our best selves, or our worst selves – and in finding that, immortality.</i> – Devin Milford, in the closing scenes</li>

Made on a low budget, this series enjoyed a huge following among viewers and was even used as an educational reference on what the nation and Filipino lives might be like under Communist rule. Right-wingers and human rights activists in the Philippines objected to the mini-series, however, as they believed that <i>K</i> would spread Communism among the people and even spark revolts between the government and rebel forces. Politics aside, <i>K</i> is widely believed to be influenced by the <i>Amerika</i> mini-series, as it was released in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> (a year after <i>Amerika'</i>s release), and shared many of its themes.</li>
