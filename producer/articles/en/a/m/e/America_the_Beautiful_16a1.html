<p>The words are by <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katharine_Lee_Bates_b4fa.html" title="Katharine Lee Bates">Katharine Lee Bates</a>, an English professor at <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellesley_College_7f40.html" title="Wellesley College">Wellesley College</a>. In 1893, Bates had taken a train trip to <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado_Springs%2C_Colorado_d0e9.html" title="Colorado Springs, Colorado">Colorado Springs, Colorado</a>, to teach a short summer school session at <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado_College_3120.html" title="Colorado College">Colorado College</a>, and several of the sights on her trip found their way into her poem:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../w/o/r/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition_074c.html" title="World's Columbian Exposition">World's Columbian Exposition</a> in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, the "White City" with its promise of the future contained within its alabaster buildings.</li>
<li>The wheat fields of <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas.html" title="Kansas">Kansas</a>, through which her train was riding on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_4.html" title="July 4">July 4</a>.</li>
<li>The majestic view of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Plains_5aee.html" title="Great Plains">Great Plains</a> from atop <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikes_Peak_9e47.html" title="Pikes Peak">Pikes Peak</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>On that mountain, the words of the poem started to come to her, and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original Antlers Hotel. The poem was initially published two years later in <i>The Congregationalist,</i> to commemorate the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independence_Day_%28US%29_d27b.html" title="Independence Day (US)">Fourth of July</a>. It quickly caught the public's fancy. Amended versions were published in 1904 and 1913.</p>
<p>Several existing pieces of music were adapted to the poem. The <a href="../../../h/y/m/Hymn_tune.html" title="Hymn tune">Hymn tune</a> MATERNA composed in 1882 by <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_A._Ward_250e.html" title="Samuel A. Ward">Samuel A. Ward</a>, was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today. Ward had been similarly inspired. The tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Coney_Island_ee30.html" title="Coney Island">Coney Island</a> back to his home in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> after a leisurely summer day, and he immediately wrote it down. Ward died in 1903, not knowing the national stature his music would attain. Miss Bates was more fortunate, as the song's popularity was well-established by her death in 1929.</p>
<p>At various times in the more than 100 years that have elapsed since the song as we know it was born, particularly during the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> administration, there have been efforts to give "America the Beautiful" legal status either as a national hymn, or as a national anthem equal to, or in place of, "The Star-Spangled Banner", but so far this has not succeeded. Proponents prefer "America the Beautiful" for various reasons, saying it is easier to sing, more melodic, and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as "The Star-Spangled Banner." Some prefer "America the Beautiful" over "The Star-Spangled Banner" due to the latter's war-oriented imagery. (Others prefer "The Star-Spangled Banner" for the same reason.) While that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem, "America the Beautiful" continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of Americans.</p>
<p>Popularity of the song increased greatly following the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>; at some sporting events it was sung in addition to the traditional singing of the national anthem. During the first taping of the <a href="../../../l/a/t/Late_Show_with_David_Letterman_2c09.html" title="Late Show with David Letterman">Late Show with David Letterman</a> following the attacks, CBS newsman <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Rather_4eca.html" title="Dan Rather">Dan Rather</a> cried briefly as he quoted the fourth verse. <a href="http://archive.salon.com/ent/tv/feature/2001/09/18/rather/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://archive.salon.com/ent/tv/feature/2001/09/18/rather/index.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p><a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Charles_5e75.html" title="Ray Charles">Ray Charles</a> is credited with the song's most well known rendition in current times (although <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> had a good success with it in the 1970s). His recording is very commonly played at major sporting events, such as the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_21ed.html" title="Super Bowl">Super Bowl</a>. His unique take on it places the third verse first, after which he sings the usual first verse. In the third verse (see below), the author scolds the <a href="../../../m/a/t/Materialistic.html" title="Materialistic">materialistic</a> and self-serving <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robber_baron_%28industrialist%29.html" title="Robber baron (industrialist)">robber barons</a> of her day, and urges America to live up to its noble ideals and to honor, with both word and deed, the memory of those who died for their country.</p>
<p>It is often included in songbooks in a wide variety of <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religious</a> congregations in the United States.</p>
<p>It has also become a tradition for the song to be performed at the start of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wrestling_Entertainment_4940.html" title="World Wrestling Entertainment">WWE</a> event <a href="../../../w/r/e/Wrestlemania.html" title="Wrestlemania">Wrestlemania</a>.

<p>A song as popular and familiar as "America the Beautiful" inevitably gets used out of its proper context or time frame, for humorous effect. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1971, the song inspired the cross-country <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannonball_Baker_Sea-To-Shining-Sea_Memorial_Trophy_Dash_b7e8.html" title="Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash">Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash</a> race from New York to Los Angeles that later was the topic of several movies with <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burt_Reynolds_1d5d.html" title="Burt Reynolds">Burt Reynolds</a></li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>In one of his comedy club routines in the early 1960s, <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flip_Wilson_44e2.html" title="Flip Wilson">Flip Wilson</a> did a Columbus story with an African-American twist... ironically, the catchphrase repeated by Queen Isabel (an early "Geraldine") is "Chris gon' find Ray Charles!"

I'll bet there's fruit out there on the plain!"</li>
