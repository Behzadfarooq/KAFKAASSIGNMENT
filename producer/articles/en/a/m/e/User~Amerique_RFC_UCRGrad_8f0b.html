This assumption of "ownership" mainly consists of adamant if not absolute resistance to any changes to controversial content, but also has been extended by accusations of plagarism to include "his own" comments on the UCR talk page.

These two users share identical opinions, post at approximately the same times, and are both primarily concerned with editing the UCR article. They also, notably, tend to be only editors to that article who not only share, but resolutely defend the other's extreme opinions against all others regarding POV issues. Though it is strongly suspected by editors with significant experience interacting with those two that these accounts are meatpuppet accounts, per Wikipedia RFC guidelines two RFCs have been filed with itemized evidence of independent conduct violations for each.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_RFC_UCRGrad_8f0b.html" title="Edit section: Response">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Response</span></h2>
<p>In summary, there is very little basis for Amerique's allegations above. I have been a dedicated editor of the UC Riverside article for over 5 months with almost 1,000 edits in my log. You would think that by now, if Amerique's accusations were true, I would have been kicked off or sanctioned a long time ago. In fact, just the opposite happened. On June 22, 2006, Amerique filed an RFA (Request for Arbitration) against me, with the EXACT SAME allegations: violation of WP:own/civil/NPA/NLT/AGF. However, her RFA was summarily denied and dismissed when four admins/arbitrators reviewed her case and made several important findings:</p>
<ol>
<li>"The contention around the UC Riverside article seems to have produced a pretty decent college article, devoid of a lot of the fluff such articles tend to attract"</li>
<li>"I don't think think any contention between the editors has damaged the encyclopedia"</li>
<li>"A number of editors on all sides have been stubborn, hard to work with and contentious"</li>
<li>"I don't see that this is completely a 'one impossible editor' situation." [explicitly rejecting Amerique's WP:OWN claim]</li>
<li>"UCRGrad presents a signifcant point of view"</li>
</ol>
<p>Please take a look at what the article looked like before I started editing: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_California%2C_Riverside&amp;oldid=40245848" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_California%2C_Riverside&amp;oldid=40245848" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=University_of_California%2C_Riverside&amp;oldid=40245848</a></p>
<p>As you can see, there have been profound improvements since that time. The article is now well-referenced, there are far more statistics and useful comparisons, several new sections have been added, existing areas expanded, more pictures, etc. Clearly, my contributions along with those of other dedicated editors have produced a "pretty decent college article." I will admit that sometimes I am a bit stubborn, and sometimes I don't say the nicest things, but even the admins agree that a number of opposing editors have been "hard to work with and contentious." I don't think it's quite fair that I get singled out.</p>
<p>Consider this: I've made ~1,000 edits over the course of 5 months. Wouldn't you think that if I am truly as terrible as Amerique claims, he would have been able to dig up far more evidence of my alleged misconduct than the above? Keep in mind that Amerique also solicited the help of many other users to come up with more "dirt." Not surprisingly, they only produced the above. Furthermore, I estimate that 2/3 (maybe 3/4) of the alleged "violations" actually occured when I was a BRAND-NEW editor (5 months ago), at which time I was just learning the ropes and figuring out how to deal with abusive editors. In fact, at least 2/3 to 3/4 of the comments I made weren't even directed towards Amerique or ANYONE currently endorsing her side. Please also keep in mind that this article has seen at least 5 vandals and multiple invidiuals who have written far more offensive and accusatory remarks than I could ever come up with. If you considered the above vs. all of the WP violations (especially WP:AGF and WP:NPA), including several in the past month, I would be considered more civil than the average editor of this article.</p>
<p>But don't just take my word for it. <b>For an example of how I sincerely try to discuss issues and I just get attacked left and right, please refer to this most recent example: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:University_of_California%2C_Riverside#Abomination_Quote_Revisited" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:University_of_California%2C_Riverside#Abomination_Quote_Revisited" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:University_of_California%2C_Riverside#Abomination_Quote_Revisited</a></b> Notice how I try to discuss a particular line of the article, I present my arguments and immediately: nobody responds to my arguments, old arguments that have already been addresses by me are rehashed, I am immediately attacked by Danny, WHS refuses to discuss despite a polite inviation, Amerique refuses to discuss despite a polite invitation, and what follows is a slew of personal attacks and arguments that don't even pertain to the sentence I was trying to discuss in the first place! Please read the dialogue. It's what I've been dealing with for 5 months. <a href="../../../u/c/r/User%7EUCRGrad_9144.html" title="User:UCRGrad">UCRGrad</a> 03:44, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>To give examples of the WP:NPA, WP:civil, and WP:AGF attacks people have been using, I quickly went through the edit logs for the past 3 weeks (that's it), and looked for the snide remarks made by the very same people who are accusing me of these violations.</b> Please keep in mind that this was just for the past 21 days only! In comparison, Amerique has dug up things I've said over FIVE MONTHS (imagine what these people have said over that same time period). I hope this helps put things into perspective.</p>

<dd>- I am convinced that "UCRGrad" is a very bitter alumni who had some bad experiences and is taking his/her revenge on a random internet encyclopedia. I'm amazed at how much time they've wasted from their own life, hunting down every negative article they could find about the school, instead of looking for the major articles from more credible sources that the general public actually pays attention to. I hope you didn't just graduate in June, because if you did, there's a good chance you could have done better on your finals, instead... now leading to another reason you have a personal beef with UCR 05:27, 3 July 2006 (UTC</dd>

<dd>UCRGRAD RESPONSE: Just as a note, I have never ever claimed ownership of this article, nor do I believe that I have such ownership. Of course, none of the links above actually quote me claiming such ownership either. The very issue of a WP:own violation was one of the things considered by the Request for Arbitration, which was filed by Amerique (also filing this RfC against me). All FOUR administrators sided with me and in rejecting Amerique's arguments, stated they they "don't see that this is completely a 'one impossible editor' situation." I'm not sure why Amerique is trying to bring this up again, especially since RfC findings wouldn't override an RfA finding anyway. Finally, I have personally only contributed (or been a significant editor of) about 6 paragraphs to the article: admissions, rankings, recruitment, Thomas Haider, air pollution, and 909. Amerique, on the other hand, has contributed an EQUAL number of paragraphs (the entire history section), which in fact, take up more lines than mine. How can Amerique claim that I "own" the article, when he/she has contributed more than I have? There is clearly no merit to this allegation. <a href="../../../u/c/r/User%7EUCRGrad_9144.html" title="User:UCRGrad">UCRGrad</a> 14:49, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>UCRGrad Response: Amerique never asked for an apology, so how could I "refuse to apologize?" If he had requested an apology, of course I would have offered one. In fact, Amerique specifically wrote on his user page: "While Amerique is male, he is not at all offended by references to him using the feminine pronoun ["she"]". I had been using "she" for pages and pages before Amerique even brought this up. If Amerique isn't even offended by a mistaken gender reference, why would he expect an apology over something so trivial? ...and why should he use this an example of a WP:civil violation, when there MUST be so many more "bad things" I must have said to be accused of being so "uncivil"...or perhaps not. <a href="../../../u/c/r/User%7EUCRGrad_9144.html" title="User:UCRGrad">UCRGrad</a> 16:22, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>UCRGrad Response: On re-reading what what I wrote, I was unable to find anything that was written "about new editors" (Amerique alleges condescending remarks "about new editors" aboe). My response, however, was directed to an individual who wrote that "This article is completely biased" and based this opinion solely on his anecdotal experience at UCR. I tried to explain that the article contained verifiable facts that were more appropriate than his own anecdotal experience. At a later point, the user began vandalizing the article, made massive deletions, and was blocked at least twice by admins. Given the circumstances, my response could hardly be considered "condescending," and certainly did not qualify as "uncivil." Again, if I have been so uncivil, as Amerique alleges, there must be better examples than this first two so far. <a href="../../../u/c/r/User%7EUCRGrad_9144.html" title="User:UCRGrad">UCRGrad</a> 16:51, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>UCRGrad Response: On re-reading what I wrote, this was in response to an anonymous user who essentially made tons of suggestions, but based them on his personal opinion that the article was biased or accused me of trying to make UCR look bad (which was never my intention). Thus, his suggestions lacked justification or support (beyond his strenuous opinion), and therefore did not have merit. It was also clear that this user hadn't put much thought or reasoning into his suggestions, which explains my second comment. Again, if I am as uncivil as Amerique alleges, there must be better examples than these.</dd>

<dd>UCRGrad Response: On re-reading what I wrote, I really do think the user was being somewhat ridiculous. Essentially, he disputed usage of the term "decreasing trend" (referring to a decrease in UCR's enrollment for 3 consecutive years) because "it's a subjective term ...and there is no citation of someone categorizing the decline as a trend," somehow not understanding numbers decreasing each year for 3 years in a row was a "decreasing trend," and that I didn't need to cite a statistician to prove this. SoCalAlum, a neutral third party (who rarely posts on this article) even had to jump in and quote the dictionary to this user. Given the circumstances, I believe that my response was warranted...but again, where are the truly uncivil remarks I supposedly made? <a href="../../../u/c/r/User%7EUCRGrad_9144.html" title="User:UCRGrad">UCRGrad</a> 17:47, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Edit summaries are brief, 1-2 sentence explanations of what changes were made. Since I started editing this article many months ago, we've had at least 5 vandals and countless users attempting to revert/change content that was inconsistent with TALK discussions. In almost all cases, an impolite edit summary left by me was in direct response to a "hostile edit" made by another user, usually with his/her own impolite edit summary. Given that I have made roughly 1,000 edits on Wikipedia, I don't see what the fuss is about if there are 6 (0.6%) that aren't very nice...this hardly establishes a pattern of uncivil behavior by any measure. <a href="../../../u/c/r/User%7EUCRGrad_9144.html" title="User:UCRGrad">UCRGrad</a> 18:58, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>UCRGrad's Response: The list is actually longer than the above. Unfortunately for Amerique et al, Insert-Belltower and I are completely different individuals. An RFCU has already confirmed this, and usually there is no dispute once this verification occurs. I'm having a difficult time understanding why Amerique continues to insist that we are sockpuppets, especially in an RfC, since an RfC does not override an RFCU on this matter. If everyone stipulates that they will cease to accuse me of being the same person as Insert-Belltower, I would be happy to insist on another RFCU to verify this - otherwise, there really is no point. I have the right to agree with Insert-Belltower's positions, and vice-versa, as long as valid arguments are provided. If I don't agree with him, or I don't have a good argument in support, you'll find that I just don't respond to his particular thread in the article TALK page. Clearly, agreeing alone, does not make you a meatpuppet - because if it did, everybody in Amerique's camp (including WHS, ElKevbo, szyslak, etc.) would be his meatpuppets for sure! In fact, a quick click on their talk pages will reveal that Amerique has "coached" all of them on when to appear, on which discussion, and everything short of telling them WHAT to write. There really is no merit to this accusation. <a href="../../../u/c/r/User%7EUCRGrad_9144.html" title="User:UCRGrad">UCRGrad</a> 18:32, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since I've had no previous involvement with either the article, or the editor, I have carefully reviewed this RfC, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Riverside_00b7.html" title="University of California, Riverside">UCR</a> article, its <a href="../../../u/n/i/Talk%7EUniversity_of_California%2C_Riverside_c479.html" title="Talk:University of California, Riverside">Talkpage</a>, and the Talkpages of several (but not all) of the editors involved. In my comments I will attempt to seperate "Statements of Fact" from "Statements of Opinion (mine)".</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Statements of Fact</b></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> - While <a href="../../../u/c/r/User%7EUCRGrad_9144.html" title="User:UCRGrad">UCRGrad</a> has never "claimed" ownership in a public statement the history of reverts as well as comments and edit summaries clearly indicate an attempt at ownership, as does the fact that <a href="../../../u/c/r/User%7EUCRGrad_9144.html" title="User:UCRGrad">UCRGrad</a> is a <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose account</a>. A careful review of his contributions history indicates that the account has never made an edit which was not related to <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Riverside_00b7.html" title="University of California, Riverside">UCR</a>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> - Some of these comments were so minor that they would normally be overlooked in the course of a dispute where tempers get frayed.

</ol>
<p>Taken individually, none of these items (except the <a href="../../../n/l/t/WP%7ENLT_0807.html" title="WP:NLT">WP:NLT</a>) would normally rate more than a warning and (possibly) a brief block to let the situation cool down. Again though, the extensive history of contentious editing, and an unwillingness to work with other editors in a constructive manner is quite troubling, as is the editor's refusal to participate in Mediation. This RfC should probably be viewed as a final attempt to correct unacceptable behaviour before more extreme actions are taken. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 20:22, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> Although the sockpuppet allegations were proven some time ago, I still think UCRGrad and Insert-Belltower's sustained pattern of partisan support for the other's controversial editing practices, both before and after the user check established they were posting from seperate IP addresses, shows that this "sockpuppetry" dynamic is still an ongoing problem under the more qualified term "meatpuppetry." I respectfully request further comments as to the appropriateness or inappropriateness of any activities on Insert-Belltower or UCRGrad's part that would seem to qualify as "meatpuppetry."--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 15:07, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Statement of Opinion</b></li>
</ul>
<p>At some point it becomes foolish for the <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP_84ae.html" title="WP">WP</a> community to continue <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a>, especially in the face of ongoing tenditious editing and multiple refusals to follow policies, guidelines, and indeed, to cooperate or act constructively in any significant way. While <a href="../../../u/c/r/User%7EUCRGrad_9144.html" title="User:UCRGrad">UCRGrad</a> clearly has the intelligence and education to be a very valuable contributor, I find no evidence that he actually intends to do so. His ongoing attempts to maintain the supremacy of his POV, wikilawyering, bad faith edits and total refusal to work with a valid consensus are simply not acceptable to the community at large. At this point, a failure to reform and act in compliance with our standards will almost certainly result in sanctions against this editor. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_Tropics_7009.html" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc Tropics</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_Tropics_88a3.html" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Message in a bottle</a></sup> 20:22, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="../../../u/c/r/User%7EUCRGrad_9144.html" title="User:UCRGrad">UCRGrad</a> has clearly demonstrated the <i>potential</i> to become a respected member of the community and a valuable contributor to <a href="../../../w/p/_/WP_84ae.html" title="WP">WP</a>.
