<p>What the heck is "beaverboard"? --<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 22:17, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think some explanation of why it's called "American Gothic" is due. Perhaps people did not like the wording of my explanation. Okay, that is one thing. But the ideas should remain, I feel.</p>
<p>The text I wrote, which was removed, said: "Why is it called "<a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic.html" title="Gothic">Gothic</a>?" Look at the windows in the background; They have the distinct look of <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_architecture.html" title="Gothic architecture">gothic architecture</a>. There are also hints in the clothing and perhaps facial expressions as well."</p>
<p>Isn't this something called "Carpenter Gothic?"</p>

<dl>
<dd>The house is most definitely carpenter gothic and I think the title is explained sufficiently by the statement <i>"house of Carpenter Gothic style"</i>. I also think the old line felt out of place with its abrupt change in tone to a question-answer dialogue. The focus on the windows overlooks the other equally important gothic features like board and bat siding, and I think seeing a gothic theme in the clothes and expressions is an opinion that may not be widely held. &#160;&#160;â€”<a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeknic_08a9.html" title="User:Teknic"><span style="color:green">Teknic</span></a><sup><a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeknic_5e83.html" title="User talk:Teknic">T</a>-<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Teknic_013e.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Teknic">M</a>-<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Teknic_ebe3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Teknic">C</a></sup> July 7, 2005 00:34 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This line just doesn't sit well: "The house, in Eldon, Iowa, is said to be the second most recognizable house in the United States, following the White House."

<p>It sounds fine, as long as people have significant valid content to contribute under each of the section headings (which is the real question). <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 04:46, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why is Conan's parody any more notable than a zillion other parodies? <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 01:32, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see no reason why it's more notable than being on the cover of Mad Magazine, in a Gary Larson cartoon, nor others of the huge number of cultural references to this famous work. I'm therefore moving the Conan O'Brian reference here to the talk page pending any explanation and consensus agrement of why this is of particular historic importance. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 04:12, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So let me get this straight: because it's been parodied a lot is sufficient rationale for excluding parodies? And last I knew, neither "notability" nor "historical importance" are found on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> in any shape or form.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I could go for a list of parodies with images.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And by all means you two are more than welcome to add any and all parodies (that are notably and of appropriate historical importance if you so choose). But considering AnonMoos has never touched this article and Information has only done minor wikification over 17 months ago....I won't hold my breath.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So really all you two are doing here is stunting an articles growth. Am I the only one whom finds it pathetic that "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Gothic&amp;diff=7705006&amp;oldid=7704925" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Gothic&amp;diff=7705006&amp;oldid=7704925" rel="nofollow">one of the (most) parodied images ever</a>" has no list of parodies; no samples of parodies; and no descriptions and contexts of other parodies? You know, perhaps the existance of this conversation and, twice now, removal of the Conan section is all the explanation that is necessary to answer that. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 05:42, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>While I'm on the quasi tirade soap box here, I might as well throw this one out too. If this article <i>had</i> a list of parodies then us non-American-Gothic experts would know what is "notable" and of "historical importance." But since there's <i><b>nothing</b></i> here then I implore ye American Gothic experts to educate the masses as to exactly what are notable and historically important parodies! Until you do (I'm looking at you Infromation since you apparently know of enough references to make said judgment of its notability and historical import) you are only stunting the article's growth. Occasionally I could agree that something is worse than nothing, but I definitely don't see this as one of those cases. I anticipate your responses and discussion eagerly. Really. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 06:02, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You ask "<i>So let me get this straight: because it's been parodied a lot is sufficient rationale for excluding parodies?</i>" I propose nothing of the kind, and if anyone else makes that argument, I don't see it. Quite the contrary, the fact that it's been parodied was even mentioned in the article before the addition of the Conan reference. To me, the question is: Why should the Conan reference be presented as more important than all the other references of the last 70 years put together?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I like Conan's show, but I don't catch every episode. I admit ignorance about this one. From the below, it seems like "American Gothic" was only refered to on a single episode. If this was just a passing stock pop-culture reference, I doesn't seem particularly notable to me. But if there was something important about this reference or if has become one of Conan's most famous bits, go ahead and explain.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't have a list of pop culture references, but off the top of my head I recall postcards with Ron &amp; Nancy Reagan, Bill &amp; Hillary Clinton, and a pair of dogs posed as the couple. Paris Hilton posed that way in "The Simple Life", and the sitcom "Green Acres" had a bit with the lead actors posed as the couple in the opening credits of every episode. It's appeared in classic Warner Brothers cartoons, though I dont' recall a title off hand (likely more than one), as well as Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle... At the grocery store you can see Paul Newman posed that way on labels of his food product line... I'm sure some folks could make a much longer list. I havn't read Steven Biel's book on the painting; perhaps some are mentioned there? As I see it, the point isn't so much the individual references as the fact that it's a very famous image that is refered to frequently. If the Conon show reference somehow stands out so much from other references that it deserves its own header and paragraph, please explain why.

<dd>Thanks for completely ignoring and missing my point on the grounds of a technicality that you didn't propose it. Indeed you did not propose it in words, but by action. By removing the <i>only</i> example you have proposed such an example.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Look, I don't much care to argue about the argument so I'll put it much more succinctly for you. As one of the most parodied images, I see it perfectly fit for examples. You haven't added any. Youh haven't proposed any. You haven't done anything <i>except</i> to delete.</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Is the conan example "notable" and "historically important"? I don't see that it matters. It's <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and it's an example of a parody. If you can put anything up that satisfies your criteria, then so be it. <i><b>BUT YOU HAVEN'T</b></i> I'm putting the image back because you haven't added any examples in almost 2 weeks, which says to me that you're here to hinder not help. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 03:50, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There was a classic Time Magazine cover a few years back (with a caption something like "Now everybody's hip, and that ain't cool", I'm sure you could find it with an online search) which was funnier than the Conan thing, and I bet it was seen by a lot more people, too... <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonMoos_66b1.html" title="User:AnonMoos">AnonMoos</a> 18:43, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fine, get it and put it up. Like I said above, I'm restoring the image until one of you steps up to the plate and adds examples. <a href="../../../c/b/u/User%7ECburnett_adfd.html" title="User:Cburnett">Cburnett</a> 03:50, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I consolodated your information into the image caption. You still havn't given any reason why the mention on "Conan" deserves a special seperate section apart from other pop culture references. Examples? You can find over half a dozen references to specific tv shows, magazines, etc on this talk page that you are free to add to the article and wikilink. You can find more by looking at the external llinks in the article or a quick images.google search. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 14:58, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Welcome to Wikipedia. If you think more reference should be added, you have a pile of 'em on the talk page.

<p>Hi, I just sailed on in, and I usally don't get involved with art-related WP articles, as that's not really my area of interest. However, I noticed that for this rather famous work, there seems to be very little on the artistic significance, and why it's so famous. Is there a reason for this? Was such commentary removed before? I'd be glad to research it myself, but I get the feeling that if it hasn't been elaborated now, there's something I know before such an undertaking. <a href="../../../m/r/v/User%7EMrVoluntarist_23fd.html" title="User:MrVoluntarist">MrVoluntarist</a> 02:50, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'd love to know more myself. The painting is obviously striking because of the direct gaze of the characters, the severity of their expression, their elongated faces, and the hint of aggression (and satan) implicit in that wickedly-pointy pitchfork. But all that's just my personal opinion and I think this article deserves some authoritative content from someone who knows what they're talking about. Csrster 10:50, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
