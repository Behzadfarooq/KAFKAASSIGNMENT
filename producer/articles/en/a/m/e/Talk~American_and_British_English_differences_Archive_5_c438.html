<h2><span class="mw-headline">Letter writing</span></h2>
<p>I am from Hong Kong and noticed that in the article some Americans use "Dear Sir:" at the start of the letter. From what I was taught in Hong Kong (and it was a bilingual education), the colon is considered very wrong and should not be used. It was emphisised because in Chinese letter writings it should always be using colons instead of comma and was a common mistake for Hong Kong students to mix up. I wonder if this is the same in the UK as well (I am currently studying in the UK, but I never have asked anyone regarding this matter as nobody uses colon anyway)?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Terminating letter salutations with a colon is the common usage in American letters among all educated writers. As a student of history, I have seen letters in archives from over a century ago (and even older) that conform to this style.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>American English differs from British English in many ways because of (1) the Atlantic Ocean and (2) the American Revolution. After the Revolution, the two nations' languages, accents, laws, and cultures began to gradually evolve in different directions. The colon/comma issue is just one of them. --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 00:21, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, British people do not use the colon; i was always taught to use a comma and ive never had them mixed up as ive never seen a colon used in that way over here. -- <span style="border:1px solid #ccc;background:#eee; padding:1px"><a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffthejiff_537e.html" title="User:Jeffthejiff"><span style="color:#333;font-weight:bold">jeffthejiff</span></a></span> <span style="font-size:80%;color:#999">(<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffthejiff_60df.html" title="User talk:Jeffthejiff"><span style="color:#999;">talk</span></a>)</span> 11:25, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, please understand that there are differenences as well when one is writing a personal letter versus the times when one is writing a business or professional letter. A colon may be used now at the end of the Salutation; however, I have seen this rule change according to the region of this nation several times even in my short life-- a mere 33 years old. Our languages, both American and the Queen's English, are alive and thriving. What one person learned and accepted five years ago could easily and likely become outdated within a year. Things change and grow that quickly. Amazing, isn't it? --Nicholas Outland 18:10, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Personal Pronouns in British and American English</span></h2>
<p>What about the tendency in colloquial American English to use object pronouns as subjects, e.g. "Me and my girl went to the movies" instead of "My girl and I went to the movies."&#160;? Shouldn't that be mentioned in the grammar section&#160;? I understand that British speakers also sometimes do the same (e.g. in expressions like "Me too!"), but the change seems to more advanced in the US where, in certain uneducated dialects (e.g. certain varieties of African-American English), evem "him" or "her" may be used as subjects.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it is a difference. In the UK "Me and my girl went to the movies" ""My girl and me went to the movies" would be more common than "My girl and I went to the movies", except maybe by BBC newsreaders! -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Q_1529.html" title="User:Chris Q">Chris Q</a> 08:00, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Time</span></h2>
<p>Is it worth mentioning that while both Americans and British say the time is "five fifteen", the British will more commonly say it's "a quarter past five", while Americans if they don't say "five fifteen" may sometimes say "a quarter after five"? <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteinsky_9c79.html" title="User:Steinsky">Joe D</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteinsky_e9a2.html" title="User talk:Steinsky">(t)</a> 22:29, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Is there any variation in how English speakers of varying dialects would interpret an indication of time such as "half three". In Australia, this would normally be considered "3:30" (with an implied "past"). I know that in German, the equivalent "halb drei" would be interpreted as "2:30" (with an implied "nach" ["until"]).--<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffro77_a4f8.html" title="User:Jeffro77">Jeffro77</a> 09:46, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As an American living in The Netherlands, I have, for the first time, had to familiarise myself with "2:30" (or as it is written here: "14.30") being spoken as "half drie". For Americans, "half three" could only mean "one and a half", just as "half eight" would mean "four". We run into even more confusion here when the Dutch refer to "half november" to mean 15 November, rather than 15 October, which would be consistent with their use of the form as applied to the time of day.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Durova's edits recently</span></h2>
<p>Durova's edits just raised an interesting issue. In the United States, most postsecondary schools (with the exception of trade or vocational schools) have general education or breadth requirements so that students are forced to take a minimum number of courses outside of their major or concentration. Usually these are set up so that the student must take one course from several different areas; for example, the College of Letters and Science at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Berkeley_70e2.html" title="University of California, Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> has a seven-course breadth requirement<a href="http://learning.berkeley.edu/breadth/" class="external autonumber" title="http://learning.berkeley.edu/breadth/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<p>I moved this to the end of the paragraph, and expanded it:</p>
<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, in British usage one might describe a house as being "on" a very long, main road, especially one leading to a particular place, e.g. "on (the) London Road".</dd>
</dl>
<p>In my experience (I am English) "on" is only used of major roads, so I felt this needed further explaining. It also needed reordering to make sense. I also clarified "actually <b>in</b> the street" to "in the middle of the <i>road</i>" as I felt the previous wording was US-biased and rather awkward. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHairy_Dude_fc1c.html" title="User:Hairy Dude">Hairy Dude</a> 05:59, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Erroneous American, and British, verb morphology</span></h2>
<p>Thrive-throve-thriven is definitely not standard American English. In fact, having never heard those conjugations in my life, I would have guessed they were Britishisms. Neither are the previously given examples of mixing of the preterite and past participle forms good ones. It may be true that Americans do such a thing, but not with those verbs. Spring-sprang-sprung and shrink-shrank-shrunk are the only common usages by people that aren't young children making mistakes or people speaking Ebonics. Shrunken is used exclusively as an adjective.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No sirree. It's a regional thing. Just because those conjugations are not used in your region, or by most so-called educated speakers, or in common/official writing, or in belles lettres, doesn't mean they are not used at all. The article was actually clear. Do yourself a favor and go grab a dictionary. See you around.</dd>

<dd>Just dropped in here to see what's up. At first I thought JackLumber (the writer of the above paragraph) was wrong. So I looked at my dictionary to look up the word thrive. It turns out that throve and thriven are valid forms of thrive, according to the Random House Webster's College Dictionary.

<dd>Wait-wait-wait- I was aware of both the regular and irregular forms of thrive, but I took the word of the guys who wrote down that section asserting that thrive-throve-thriven is strictly American and thrive-thrived-thrived is the only form used in BrE. But, surprise, it turns out that is not like this, any. The Oxford English Dictionary: quote thrive - Pa. tense throve; pa. pple. thriven. Also pa. tense and pple. thrived unquote. "The spirit of resistance throve the more." --- Charlotte Mary Yonge. I'm coming clean---I thought I sounded kinda Mr. Know-It-All, and I've got to admit that no one among us knows diddlysquat about this. Americans, Britons, whatever. Thanks be to the guy who aroused the question. And, Coolcasear, your not the only one who learns something new every day. In sum, the section needs rewritten (sic). So bad. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber">JackLumber</a> 11:39, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Guys, you reading this yet? I got news. Further research shows that, in spite of Oxford's claims, the thrive scenario is exactly the same on either side of the pond---the regular forms are everywhere preferred and "throve-thriven" are obsolescent.

<p>One difference between American and British English I have often encountered (working in a US-based company) is that when Americans say something is "quite interesting" a Brit would normally take that to be damning with faint praise, whereas the American actually means it is "very interesting".</p>

<dd>In Britain I'd say that periods (we call them full stops, by the way) are tending to disappear. U.S.A. and U.K. look a bit odd, or certainly old-fashioned. H.I.V. would be very odd indeed, and A.I.D.S. is inconceivable. Similarly, in abbreviations like Mr and Dr, the norm here is NOT to put a full stop after. Purists would say that a contraction (with the last letter of the full word still present) does not take a full stop, while an abbreviation (where the end of the word is chopped off) does — so Mr, Dr, St, but vol., p., etc. But I reckon that distinction is disappearing, and the trend here is very much towards omitting all such full stops (sorry, periods). I certainly generally write "etc" with no dot. [sorry - gone a bit off-topic, perhaps. Back to the original question: AIDS, USA, UK, Mr, Dr, St are certainly "correct". U.S.A. is correct but old-fashioned. etc is probably incorrect, but I predict it will be correct within a few years. ] <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 09:42, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While St ('Saint') is correct, it generally includes a full stop/period, especially when using the unstressed pronunciation, 's<sup>ə</sup>nt' in combining form, e.g., "St. Patrick". 'Etc.' should always have a dot.</dd>

<dd>"eg" is always correctly written "e.g.", and the same goes for "i.e.". "Dr" is never "D'r". Periods can be included in initials, though it is more common now to exclude them.

<dd>Thanks for the link, Jack. Like punctuation in general, there are no standard rules for this, but in general common abbreviations can do without the periods, which otherwise help as a pronunciation guide; a similar usage occasionally seen in Britain is to write out as words those abbreviations that are to be read as them (Nato, Aids) and capitalizing those that are not (UNHCR). IMHO, US (I.M.H.O., U.S.) news stylebooks tend to err too heavily on the side of punctuation. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a> 12:30, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>60.240.88.48 - Would you please tell me why you've added stops to "US" in my recent addition? I notice that throughout the article usage seems to be "U.S." (with stops) but "UK" (without stops). Why? US = United States, UK = United Kingdom - why should one have stops and not the other? I agree that both forms (with &amp; without stops) are acceptable, but I would have expected consistency with <u>both</u> abbreviations in the same format within a single article. It seems to me odd to use one form for one abbreviation and a different form for another very similar abbreviation in the same article. This seems to be borne out by Jack Lumber's citation from <i>Pam Peter's Cambridge English Usage Guide</i> above. <a href="../../../t/d/w/User%7ETdw_dd74.html" title="User:Tdw">TrevorD</a> 16:21, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Also, American lawyers (that would include me) tend to err heavily on the side of punctuation, especially at the federal level. Although some states like New York use relatively few periods, most state courts and the federal judiciary follow Bluebook style, which generally prescribes a lot of periods. For example, the <i>United States Reports</i> is abbreviated as U.S. and the United States Code is U.S.C. I think American journalists like to use a lot of periods because that's the way us lawyers do it---and a lot of our journalists are either lawyer wannabes who couldn't get into law school, or former lawyers who burned out. And American lawyers, as a group, are quite conservative like the American population in general.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Besides tradition, I suspect that the general American sentiment in favor of punctuation is also motivated by the desire to avoid ambiguity and maintain readability. Of course, there has been a trend to drop periods in acronyms of four letters and longer. For example, the letters for the University of California, Los Angeles were consistently spelled as U.C.L.A. in all early signage and documentation. But it is now universally known as UCLA. --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 21:03, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So presumably you would also tend to write <i>U.K.</i> (not <i>UK</i>)? So why isn't the article consistent for the two abbreviations?

Let's not take this too far, but I think there are probably all sorts of biases in that Google poll (such as, for a start, the influence of the combined phrase). Bottom line is, I think you have no justification for the statement that MC is "far more common" than HC.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">an before H-?</span></h2>
<p>The article says: <i>Largely related to differences in pronunciation, there are differences surrounding whether to use "a" or "an" before words beginning in h-. For example, the British would say "an hallucination", whereas Americans would say "a hallucination". This follows the British rule that "an" should be used if the first syllable of an h- word is unstressed.</i> As far as I am concerned, this is simply untrue. I'd say "an hotel" is in fact more AmEng than BrEng; and BrEng dictionaries (e.g. Collins) say that "an" before H is obsolete.

<dd>As a British person I can say that the most common occurance of this rule seems to be before the word history.

<dd>I think this is just a general trend for the silent "h" on borrowed French words to evolve into an anglicized version over time. I've been struck in the past by the fact that older Americans generally don't sound the "h" in "herb" - a pronunciation I've never heard from British/Australian speakers. Conversely, another example of this evolution that I rather regret is the pronunciation of the "h" in the word which is the letter's name - aitch; or increasingly in Britain since around 1990, "haitch". Previously, the standard would have been to say, "You spell it with an aitch," whereas increasingly people in Britain would say, "You spell it with a haitch."</dd>

<dd>Not just older Americans---most all Americans (including myself, OK I'm not that young anymore, but I'm still in my prime) don't voice the "h" in "herb," and therefore write "an herb." <i>Hassle</i> probably comes from <i>harass</i> + <i>hustle</i>; first recorded as a noun (meaning "argument") in 1945.

<dd><i>haitch</i> may be "standard pronuciation" among people with a certain accent but it is just as wrong as far as "correct" English is concerned as those accents which drop aitches (e.g. "<a href="../../../h/e/n/Heny_Higgins_e574.html" title="Heny Higgins">'enry 'iggins</a>") is for some other accents. There's no friggin H at the begining of "aitch" and "haitch" does not appear in the dictionary. Some people of Afro-Caribbean ancestry pronounce the word <i>ask</i> as <i>aks</i>. That's also wrong. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 10:20, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Oxfordshire accent used to pronounce <i>ask</i> as <i>aks</i>, too, (and perhaps still does.) <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flora_Thompson_2006.html" title="Flora Thompson">Flora Thompson</a> in her depiction of late nineteenth and early twentieth century life in rural Oxfordshire records this pronunciation. For example, in "Still Glides The Stream" she writes: "The man smiled good-naturedly. 'Ah! now you're axing me summat,' he said... 'He'd got a better and bigger place at t'other end o' th' village and had put some of his workfolks into th' old un.'"</p>
<p>From the spelling, it's clear that she's trying to represent the pronunciation of the accent and "axing" shows that the "s" and "k" of "ask were reversed. It would be interesting to know whether the accent was taken to the Caribbean from England or whether it evolved there separately. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_Robson_f616.html" title="User:Adrian Robson">Adrian Robson</a> 08:54, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The correct spelling (and pronunciation) of the letter is indeed 'aitch'. If an H at the beginning of a word is not voiced, then 'an' is fine (hence 'an hour'), but otherwise, it should be prefaced with 'a'.

<dd>The word <i>hotel</i> is of French origin and in French is pronounced "'otél".

This applies to most words beginning with H that are of French origin, but it does not apply to words that are not of French origin like "Horse". "an 'orse" and <s>"A horse"</s> ("an horse") are both wrong; "a horse" is correct. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 12:20, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is flawed reasoning to state that 'h' should be silent in 'horse' or 'historic' simply because it is silent in the original French words... unless you also pronounce 'chance' as 'shon(t)s', and 'biscuit' as 'bis-kwee'. In most dialects of English, it is simply lazy speech to say 'orse', and the pronunciation key in English dictionaries indicates that the 'h' is not silent; therefore 'a horse' is correct, and 'an horse' is not.--<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffro77_a4f8.html" title="User:Jeffro77">Jeffro77</a> 07:42, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Who said that pronouncing "wheel" as "hweel" sounds stupid? That just ain't true. Once upon a time, all words beginning with <i>wh</i> were actually spelled <i>hw</i> because they were <i>always</i> pronounced as such. Then came about the <i>whine-wine</i> merger, but a not negligible number of U.S. customers (including me, sometimes...) still voice h's in that position—although this is obsolescing, as much as the distinction between <i>for</i> and <i>four</i>. And the word "hotel" has become completely anglicized, as it's been around for kind of 230 years, so there's no need to drop the h. "Herb" is not really of French origin, but rather Anglo-French. Factoring in etymology every time you have to pronounce a word is pointlessly shooting yourself in the foot... --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber">JackLumber</a> 19:19, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps I could have qualified the sentence a bit better. In most English dialects, the usage is completely obsolete. In some English dialects, it is not obsolete.--<a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffro77_a4f8.html" title="User:Jeffro77">Jeffro77</a> 08:29, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a speaker of Somerset-Yorkshire-Scotto-Hiberno-English (maybe we should have a Wikipedia article on that one) I can assure you that there is no question of <i>wine</i> and <i>whine</i> sounding the same (or tasting the same)! Likewise <i>poor</i> and <i>paw</i>, which sound much the same in that weird version of English known as <a href="../../../r/e/c/Received_Pronunciation_c480.html" title="Received Pronunciation">Received Pronunciation</a> (but let's not go there...) And (Jooler and Jeffro77) - you want to be careful about high-handedly dismissing haitch as "wrong". It's standard (and correct) Hiberno-English! And, furthermore, it is "in the dictionary". Check it out in Dolan's <i>Dictionary of Hiberno-English</i> (Gill &amp; Macmillan, 1998). <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 21:17, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>poor</i> vs. <i>paw</i> is the funnest. While the Received Standard merges "poor" and "paw," in many varieties of American English these two words are WAY far apart. In such dialects, <i>poor</i> has the vowel of <i>foot</i> (as for most speakers; the <i>r</i> is—needless to say—voiced) and <i>paw</i> rhymes with <i>la</i> (the musical tone in solmization). <i>Ah</i>some, huh? --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber">JackLumber</a> 21:52, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And just FYI, for many Americans <i>watt</i> &amp; <i>what</i> wouldn't be the same anyway, regardless of the "h"—many (if not most) U.S. utterances of the word "what" rhyme with "butt" rather than "watt"...--<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber">JackLumber</a> 14:05, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interestingly, the poor/paw merger is not found in many other accents than RP (or RS). Most other places either have "poo-r" and "por" (poor/paw) or "po-er" and "por" (poor/paw), and any of the poors could have voiced Rs. I imagine some places they both could sound like "po" and others both like "por". Add to this the word "pour" and it could get really complicated&#160;;) -- <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothman_030b.html" title="User:Boothman">Boothman</a> 16:28, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
