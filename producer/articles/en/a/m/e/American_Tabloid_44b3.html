<p><i>American Tabloid</i> has a very stylised and deliberate structure. It is exactly one hundred chapters long (many are less than a page in length) and the story covers exactly five years. The book is also divided into five sections, but these do not correspond exactly to years. There is no introduction or epilogue.</p>
<p>All chapters begin with:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of the chapter.</li>
<li>The location of the action's beginning, usually the name of the city.</li>
<li>The date of the action's beginning, as expressed in the American style: MM/DD/YYYY.</li>
</ul>
<p>The action of the book is completely sequential, as the dates indicate. Flashbacks occur, but only in the present tense memory of the protagonists.</p>
<p>The five sections, or "books" are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Part I, SHAKEDOWNS, November-December 1958</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The title of this "book" most directly refers to the attempt taken by the protagonists to entrap <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senator.html" title="Senator">Senator</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kennedy_472b.html" title="John Kennedy">John Kennedy</a> with a <a href="../../../c/a/l/Call-girl.html" title="Call-girl">call-girl</a>. It also refers to the current career path of Pete Bondurant, who entraps married men with prostitutes for purposes of <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extortion.html" title="Extortion">extortion</a>. Like all the titles, it can also have deeper, more implacatory meanings that come with a more thorough reading of the text</p>
<p>This "book" acts as an introductory passage; it covers only a short period of time (just 26 days), the characters are introduced, and their relationships and future career trajectories are established.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Part II, COLLUSION, January 1959-January 1961</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The title most directly refers to the collaboration between the <a href="../../../c/i/a/CIA_a22a.html" title="CIA">CIA</a> and the <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosa_Nostra_033a.html" title="Cosa Nostra">Cosa Nostra</a> in the struggle to free <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>. There are, however, many other instances of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collusion.html" title="Collusion">collusion</a>, both legal and personal, throughout.</p>
<p>At more than twice the length of any other "book", COLLUSION, is by far the longest passage in the novel. It begins on the date that <a href="../../../f/i/d/Fidel_Castro_ecc2.html" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> becomes President of Cuba, and it ends on the date that John Kennedy is inaugurated as <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Part III, PIGS, February-November 1961</b></li>
</ul>
<p>"<a href="../../../p/i/g/Pigs.html" title="Pigs">Pigs</a>", of course is the nickname given to the landing site of the CIA sponsored exile "liberation" invasion of Cuba, which came to the world's attention as "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion_d78e.html" title="The Bay of Pigs Invasion">The Bay of Pigs Invasion</a>". Also, the word is a common pejorative for <a href="../../../p/o/l/Policemen.html" title="Policemen">policemen</a>. Also, pigs are the symbol for imperialism and oppression in <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a>'s <i><a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_Farm_e7d2.html" title="Animal Farm">Animal Farm</a></i>.</p>
<p>The failed "Bay of Pigs" invasion is a central event of the novel, one in which major protagonists sow the seeds of their own downfall.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Part IV, HEROIN, December 1961-September 1963</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Through the novel, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">heroin</a> has been used as a form of currency. By dealing and selling the drug, major protagonists are able to raise money to fund various causes, most specifically, the organising of the exile army for the invasion of Cuba. After the invasion's failure, which has cost the protagonists dearly, they decide to recoup their losses by stealing a quantity of heroin that is being sold from inside Cuba to sources in <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami.html" title="Miami">Miami</a>. They do this but are eventually caught, incurring the wrath of their superiors, who are then able to co-erce the protagonist's participation in the book's denoument.</p>
<p>This "book", while short, covers a period of two years. Many intervals of time, sometimes months, are skipped over in the space of a page with no details of ensuing events. These gaps are later filled in by the present-tense memories of the protagonists.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Part V, CONTRACT, September-November 1963</b></li>
</ul>
<p>A <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contract.html" title="Contract">contract</a> can be simply defined as an agreement reached by two or more parties. In this instance, however, it most directly refers to its more sinister, colloquial definition: an agreement to commit murder for compensation.</p>
<p>The protagonists are involved in such a contract. The book's final page sees its fulfilment.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Tabloid_44b3.html" title="Edit section: Characters in &quot;American Tabloid&quot;">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Characters in "American Tabloid"</span></h2>
<p><b>Pete Bondurant</b>. AKA Frenchman Pete, AKA The Shakedown King. One of the book's three major <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protagonists.html" title="Protagonists">protagonists</a>. A French-Canadian, ex-law enforcement, <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood.html" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> insider, organised-crime associate and bodyguard for <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Hughes_c1be.html" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a>.</p>
<p><i>Resemblances</i>: Bondurant bears superficial resemblances to historical figures Fred Otash, (so-called "private-eye to the stars",) and Robert Maheu, (who worked for both Hughes and <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Hoffa_c99c.html" title="Jimmy Hoffa">Jimmy Hoffa</a> during the time frame depicted in the book). He also bears resemblances to earlier Ellroy creation, Buzz Meeks, another Hughes bodyguard, who appeared in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Big_Nowhere_872f.html" title="The Big Nowhere">The Big Nowhere</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../l/2E/a/L.A._Confidential_7066.html" title="L.A. Confidential">L.A. Confidential</a></i> and the short-story <a href="../../../s/i/n/Since_I_Don%27t_Have_You_d920.html" title="Since I Don't Have You">Since I Don't Have You</a>, (<i><a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Nocturnes_f27e.html" title="Hollywood Nocturnes">Hollywood Nocturnes</a></i>).</p>
<p><i>Other Appearances</i>: Bondurant first appears in <i><a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Jazz_5e1c.html" title="White Jazz">White Jazz</a></i> as a secondary character who only superficially resembles the character who appears in <i>American Tabloid</i>. There is a time-frame overlap between the two books which leads to some inconsistencies, such as that regarding the deteriorating mental state of his employer, Howard Hughes. Bondurant's reappearance as a main protagonist of <i>American Tabloid</i> is consistent with Ellroy's practice of reviving characters from previous books. He also is a main character of <i>The Cold Six Thousand</i>.</p>
<p><i>Story Arc</i>: Like the other protagonists, Bondurant experiences <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/apostasy" class="extiw" title="wikt:apostasy">apostasy</a> during the Bay of Pigs invasion, the book's approximate mid-point. At the beginning of the novel he is a ruthless killer but he is bored with his life. He relocates from Los Angeles to Miami to become involved in the Cuban "Cause". His chief motive in this is money and, although his political views are dismissed by hardline anti-communists as "unenlightened", he is committed and loyal to the cause. When the invasion has failed, his commitment begins to take the form of obsession and he begins to exercise dangerously poor judgement. He undertakes rogue actions that earn the extreme displeasure of his equally ruthless employers, but his life is spared as he remains a useful resource to them. His chief characteristic in the second half of the novel is a deep gnawing fear.</p>
<p><b>Kemper Boyd</b> is an FBI agent who, in 1958, is recruited by J. Edgar Hoover to infiltrate the Kennedy organisation. This assignment leads to his also gaining CIA contract employment to influence the future President Kennedy to take an anti-Castro stance in his Cuban policy. This further leads to him organising the collaboration between the "Cosa Nostra" and the CIA in the Cuban cause.</p>
<p><i>Resemblances</i>: Although Boyd may not be modelled on any specific historical figure, he bears an historical resemblance to <i><a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Sinatra_d0f7.html" title="Frank Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a></i>, who was known as a Kennedy insider prior to the Kennedy Presidency. He procures women for JFK during the 1960 election campaign and is instrumental in convincing Cosa Nostra figures to give their support to the Kennedys. He also bears resemblance to <i>David Klein</i>, the protagonist of <i>White Jazz</i>, in that he is a dashing and charming rogue cop who is brutally humbled by the consequences of his actions.</p>
<p><i>Other appearances</i>: Boyd is a distinctive creation in that he appears only in one novel. He is mentioned in <i>The Cold Six Thousand</i> by name only. In this he also resembles David Klein, who appears only in <i>White Jazz</i> but is mentioned by name in <i>Tabloid</i>.</p>
<p><i>Story Arc</i>: In the first half of the novel, Boyd can be fairly described as charming but shallow. He is motivated mostly by money and his own sense of bravado. He takes heedless risks and conducts himself with such flair that he captivates those around him, allowing him to generate an extremely complex system of alliances and loyalties. This leads him to "overextend" his capacities. During the Bay of Pigs time-frame, he receives a gunshot wound in the shoulder, and this, coupled with the drugs he is administered during convalescence, seems to be the underlying cause of his apostasy. In the second half of the novel, he is no longer primarily concerned with appearances and his own sense of invincibility, and he purses his objectives with a doggedness that borders on zeal. Most tellingly, he begins to show an egalitarian streak, prompting him to protect, defend and avenge those who are traditionally oppressed. This change, however, is not enough to prevent him being destroyed by the actions he took in the first half of the novel.</p>
<p><b>Ward Littell</b> is an FBI agent clandestinely investigating organised crime activity in direct defiance of his employer. He is punished for his treachery and dismissed from the FBI but secures employment as a "Mob" Lawyer and wins his way back into his employer's good graces.</p>
<p><i>Other appearances</i>: Littell appears as a protagonist in <i>The Cold Six Thousand</i>.</p>
<p><i>Story Arc</i>: At the outset, Littell is the classic underdog: victimised, unappreciated and lonely. Although he is perceived as "weak" and "cowardly" by many, those who know him best consider him courageous and bold, but untested. He has a weakness for alcohol that inhibits his abilities. When he investigates organised crime activity he frequently witnesses extreme acts of brutality, and this enables him to find inner strength and a taste for danger. At the mid-point of the book, when things seem most hopeless for him, he acquires a means to hurt his enemies that indicates a turnaround in his fortunes. During the Bay of Pigs, he experiences an apostasy that causes him to reverse his former loyalties, working close with his former enemies and against his former friends. His fortunes increase throughout the second half of the novel until he has reached a considerable position of influence and power, although he remains compromised by his beliefs.</p>
