<p>The article here somehow needs some tinkering, like most material that refers to the series. I guess this has something to do with the status of the target audience. Maybe this will expand as time goes by.</p>
<p>As for the series, I was personally hooked because of how it is visually ([cough] the red dragon [cough]). Still, this is a lot like every other Disney Channel program.</p>

<p>I've changed the Chinese character for dragon from 竜 to 龍. Altohugh 竜 is does mean Dragon and is pronounced Long, 龍 is the more common character, and is a valid Chinese surname.</p>
<p>Unless somebody can find a picture of the character for Long in the show itself (or background material) saying otherwise, 龍 is more likely to be the correct character.</p>

<dd>The Chinese character for dragon (龍) is seen at end of the opening credits (it's in the background behind the show's logo). Until the character 竜 is found, your edit is valid. TrackFan 14:08, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Today I reverted the following changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>A general description of a centaur. I think that the article should only describe how centaurs in this series differ from classical centaurs.</li>
<li>Deletion of the details about the Huntsclan and the Huntsman. These are fundamental to the series.</li>
<li>A statement that seers are also called "oricalls". I imagine that this is a mis-spelling of "oracles" and even so, I fail to see the relevance of this general point.

<dl>
<dd>The changes I made I thought were somewhat reasonable. Here's my opinion:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>You're right on this one. I've never seen a centaur on the show and assumed that the definition was identical to that of a "classic" centaur.</li>
<li>The deletion of the Huntsclan was nessisiary. You listed them as magical creatures, but they are not, they are normal (yet incredably trained) people with extreme gadgets. If you wanted to mention th Huntsclan, do it someplace else ni this artical.</li>
<li>Sorry for the misspelling of "oracles," but they are nto refered to as seers on the show, so mentioning that they are also called seers is the piontless thing. --<a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWack%27d_About_Wiki_b3f0.html" title="User:Wack'd About Wiki">Wack'd About Wiki</a> 17:30, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I do not think it appropriate to compare the Prof. with Mr. Crocker. Although they are both teachers in animated series this does not make the comparison informative. I suggest that this comparison be removed. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 17:19, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is, actually, quite appropreate. The Professor is overly obsessed with descovering that Jake is a dragon, and Mr. Crocker is overly obsessed with descovering Timmy has fairies. Seriously, how much do you actually watch the show, or even bother to see if what you post is true? I'm a Disney Channel/Cartoon Network/Nickelodeon '<i><b>expert'</b></i>. Leave the editing of this page to me, because I know lots about this show.</dd>

<p><br />
But, the only thing they have in common is the longing to catch a magical creature. Other than that they act differently. Rotwood is a hack, while Crocker knows a lot about fairies. Rotwood doesn't freak out the same way Croker does. Rotwood gives out fair grades, while Crocker enjoys giving out Fs. Besides with your logic, the two could be compared to Mr. Craft from <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabrina%2C_the_Teenage_Witch_d1c9.html" title="Sabrina, the Teenage Witch">Sabrina, the Teenage Witch</a>. He wanted to prove that there was something magical about Sabrina too.</p>

<p>Rose's other name is Thorn, but the Huntsmaster always calls her Huntsgirl. And the Huntsgirl was never called Thorn by anyone except by Jake in the episode The hunted. Khang 15:44, 23 March 2006</p>

<p><i>Many audiences had mixed opinions about Jake's personality: an Asian-american who 'excessively' speaks in street slang. Most liked it or were indifferent, while others despised it for being 'too irritating'. There is no doubt that Jake's personality is a homage to the second and third-generation immigrants who willingly embraced American culture (and adapted to its varying accents). This may also explain why Jake transforms into a western-style dragon instead of an eastern-style Lung like Lao Shi.</i></p>
<p>Actually I think maybe Grandpa moved to NY at one point and the rest of the family desended from China but were born in the US.

<p>I added the cleanup tag for three basic reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The section structure doesn't seem to be very organized. Season, character, and other information are somewhat mixed together. It's a bit hard to read for a someone not familar with the show.</li>
<li>The season information specifically is confusing, as there appear to be 2-1/2 seasons, with no explanation of why, and a single link for Season 2 that goes nowhere.</li>
<li>The source text looks like a C program. It really needs some spacing to make it easier to edit.</li>

<p>I as well as others have the edited the page to the point where the cleanup tag is no longer needed. ~TrackFan</p>
<p>I have seen that there are problems with the information being presented in this article. More specifically the section discussing the various different types of creatures that are presented in the show. For example I try to edit that section a little, I try to put Trolls before Ogres because the part about the Ogres makes a reference to Trolls and the reader should know what a troll is before reading about Ogres. ~Unknown Dragon</p>

<p>A Season 2 commercial just aired on Disney Channel...I am sad to say there appears to be new animators who have completely butchered the established designs of all the characters.

<dd>Yeah, and from what I saw on the commercials for the 2nd season of the show, the backgrounds changed to look <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proud_Family_6ab6.html" title="Proud Family">Proud Family</a>-esque. The backgrounds of the first season were PERFECTLY fine, and the animation looks cruder for the 2nd season. Of course to verify this I actually need to watch an episode, and hey, maybe I'll like it.

<dd>In Chinese Lao (老) is also an honoriy title meaning 'old' or 'experienced'. It's common to put it in front of a persons name to show them respect. This would mean that Laoshi, would actually mean Old/honored Shi. With Shi being grandfather long's name.</dd>

<p>I can't seam to think of anything he's done that qualifies as "evil". I think that part of his description should be changed.</p>
<p>Yes, that bit of information should definetely be changed, Rotwood is not an evil character, although he can be technically be called an antagonist since he sometimes creates problems (although not always intentionally) for Jake, the protagonist. <a href="../../../u/n/k/User%7EUnknown_Dragon_ef15.html" title="User:Unknown Dragon">Unknown Dragon</a> 20:59, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think Rotwood is evil. Admittedly, he is not the most sinister of Jake's foes, but we cannot simply deem him a mere psychotic. Remember, Rotwood went as far once to try to steal a talent show trophy and unleash an evil genie, just to gain power and glory. Also, being a man paying for captures of Jake in another episode proves he is more then crazy. I think Rotwood is evil, and we may not be surprised if he becomes a villain in the movie, if they broadcast one. 70.58.211.220</p>
<dl>
<dd>In <b>Magic Enemy #1</b>, it's been said that Jake makes it appear like Rotwood is magical world's #1 enemy, but I don't think he's villainous. He's almost close to being non-threatening with his crackpot theories and such. TrackFan 22:03, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, just to be honest, I think we should keep the "villainous" labeling. It might be useful someday. 70.58.211.220</p>

<p><i>An early draft of Homecoming originally planned the episode to be a dark and dramatic two-parter, and there were even plans of killing off a main character. The Disney Channel considered the episode "too dark" and "too Jetix", and the episode was revised into a single, 22-minute episode.</i></p>
<p>"Too dark"? "Too Jetix"? C'mon, a two-parter for American Dragon: Jake Long would be great for the reputation of the show. Okay, so I know that the show's targeted for 6-11 year olds, which is really confusing to me, since there's been kissing on it, which I don't consider appropriate for anyone under ten. I don't know, the show's matured well from season one, but a dark, serious episode would complete the maturity. "Too dark"?

<p>I know I'm new to this in all, but there's two things that I noticed that should be considered. 1) It wasn't spud's uncle that thought him the magic word, but his great-grandfather (or as he called him "super gramps"). And 2) The nurse in Rose's dream didn't say that they were two twin girls, but just twins. The fact is that most twin look alike when they're babies, but that doesn't mean that they're both girls.

<p>I think things are starting to get to the point where we can't keep the summaries of the main characters in the show limited to little summaries on the main show page. I mean, looking at Rose's entry is the most obvious proof, as it seems to go off into major territory that involves the Jake and Rose plotline and less about her actual character. The step with moving secondary characters and magical creatures onto seperate pages was a good start, but I think we might have to take another step with the main characters.

<p>Can it be agreed that Rose is an anti-hero? I believe she is, as she appears reluctant to be part of an evil group such as the Huntsclan, and that she actively tries to sabotage their efforts during the second season, but only after discovering that Jake was the American Dragon.</p>
<p>Other attributes to her being an anti-hero is her past history of being abducted from her mother; her activities with the Huntsclan during the first season, where she redeemed of her crimes during the episode 'The Hunted' by sparing Jake's life; the fact she lives two lives: One as herself, and the other as the Huntsgirl, and that both these personas often conflict with each other.</p>

<p>I think there should be a correction about the topic about the real true American Dragon, Bryan Danielson, as the page suggests Bryan Danielson has been calling himself since the American Dragon show has started, which is not true as Bryan Danielson has been calling himself American Dragon and AmDrag for a very long time, way before the TV series was even created and I've been trying to edit that but its been deleted so I think that it should be corrected and stay on the site.</p>

<dd>In the article, it does not state he has been using this name since the show premiered.
