<p><b>American humor</b> is the conventions and common threads that tie together <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humor.html" title="Humor">humor</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_humour.html" title="British humour">British humour</a>, American humor has historically tended a little more towards <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slapstick.html" title="Slapstick">slapstick</a>. There is less emphasis on <a href="../../../u/n/d/Understatement.html" title="Understatement">understatement</a>, and so the humor tends to be a little more open; rather than satirizing the social system through exaggeration, American humor prefers more <a href="../../../o/b/s/Observational_comedy.html" title="Observational comedy">observational</a> techniques. Further the United States, unlike Britain or most of Europe or even Japan, does not have any history of a nobility. This is actually of some significance due to British or European humor involving inherited class systems. Humor involving class systems in America does not focus on the monarchy or nobility but making fun of stereotypes based on race and social standing are common in American humor as well.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the United States has many diverse groups from which to draw on for humorous material. The strongest of these influences, during the 20th century at least, has been the influx of <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jewish</a> comedians and their corresponding <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_humor.html" title="Jewish humor">Jewish humor</a>, including some of the most influential: <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Three_Stooges_3dda.html" title="The Three Stooges">The Three Stooges</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Marx_Brothers_2f7e.html" title="The Marx Brothers">The Marx Brothers</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodney_Dangerfield_f74b.html" title="Rodney Dangerfield">Rodney Dangerfield</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woody_Allen_6fd3.html" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Seinfeld_0ee4.html" title="Jerry Seinfeld">Jerry Seinfeld</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Stewart_101d.html" title="Jon Stewart">Jon Stewart</a>, and <a href="../../../l/e/w/Lewis_Black_3f08.html" title="Lewis Black">Lewis Black</a>, just to name a few. Also significant is <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> humor as it has some differences from <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_British_b172.html" title="Black British">Black British</a> humor and a higher percentage of people in the United States are of African descent, not to mention the radically different profile of the two African-rooted communities: the American is predominantly descended from slaves who generally arrived two hundred years or more ago and is also less-educated; the British predominantly descended from willing immigrants who arrived in the past century and more highly educated.</p>

<p>American <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humor.html" title="Humor">humor</a> is a description of humor from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> that usually concerns aspects of American <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">culture</a>. The extent to which an individual will personally find something humorous obviously depends on a host of absolute and relative <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variables.html" title="Variables">variables</a>, including, but not limited to <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geographical_location.html" title="Geographical location">geographical location</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">culture</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/t/Maturity.html" title="Maturity">maturity</a>, level of <a href="../../../e/d/u/Education.html" title="Education">education</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Context.html" title="Context">context</a>. People of different countries will therefore find different situations funny. Just as American culture has many aspects which differ from other nations <a href="http://pewglobal.org/americaagainsttheworld/" class="external autonumber" title="http://pewglobal.org/americaagainsttheworld/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, these cultural differences may be a barrier to how humor translates to other countries. That being said there is evidence that American comedies actually perform better in other English speaking, and also German speaking, nations than American action or science fiction films do.<a href="http://www.stern.nyu.edu/Sternbusiness/fall_2005/foundInTranslation.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stern.nyu.edu/Sternbusiness/fall_2005/foundInTranslation.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Although the study linked to also shows American comedies did noticeably worse in Spanish speaking nations. Furthermore films such as <i><a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrek_2.html" title="Shrek 2">Shrek 2</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../m/e/n/Men_in_Black_57f5.html" title="Men in Black">Men in Black</a></i> are among the top-grossing comedies outside the US.<a href="http://www.imdb.com/boxoffice/alltimegross?region=non-us" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/boxoffice/alltimegross?region=non-us" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p>This article is not strictly chronological in nature, but the mediums are arranged by the date. Each one began to grow in importance as time went on. Literature appears before cartoons although newspaper cartoons in the modern sense began in the 1840s. Radio and film came out roughly at the same time. Film is covered after radio because it led more directly to the television section. Stand-up comedy began to receive renewed attention in the 1970s which is the reason why it was placed directly after television.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_humor.html" title="Edit section: Literature">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Literature</span></h2>
<p>A candidate for the 'founding father' of American humor is <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Twain_2795.html" title="Mark Twain">Mark Twain</a>, the man <a href="../../../e/r/n/Ernest_Hemingway_f01d.html" title="Ernest Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a> credits with the invention of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Literature_9213.html" title="American Literature">American Literature</a>. It should be stated that humorists existed in the United States before Twain, for example <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustus_Baldwin_Longstreet_4aa2.html" title="Augustus Baldwin Longstreet">Augustus Baldwin Longstreet</a> collection of Southern humor came out when Twain was 5 years old, but Twain is seen as a founding figure in creating an "American voice" to humor. That stated, Twain remained conscious of his humor's relationship with European counterparts, commenting in <a href="http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/mtwain/bl-mtwain-howto.htm" class="external text" title="http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/mtwain/bl-mtwain-howto.htm" rel="nofollow">"How to Tell a Story"</a> that, "The humorous story is American, the comic story is English, the witty story is French. The humorous story depends for its effect upon the manner of the telling; the comic story and the witty story upon the matter."</p>
<p>This early definition puts emphasis on the performance oriention of American humor, and thereby necessarily the performer her/himself. Indeed, in his time on the lecture circuit Twain essentially 'performed' many of his works, most notably "The American Vandal Abroad" lecture he gave via the <a href="../../../l/y/c/Lyceum_Movement_f294.html" title="Lyceum Movement">Lyceum Movement</a> before the publication of his breakthrough work <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Innocents_Abroad_7b32.html" title="The Innocents Abroad">The Innocents Abroad</a>. Thus, at the root of American humor is the very concept of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stand-up_comedy.html" title="Stand-up comedy">stand-up comedy</a> itself, and the shift from textual means of conveying humor to that of performance and performer.</p>
<p>His value notwithstanding, Twain represents only one strain of humor in the United States. Another famous American humorist of the nineteenth century was <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambrose_Bierce_0720.html" title="Ambrose Bierce">Ambrose Bierce</a>, whose most famous work is the cynical <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devil%27s_Dictionary_5316.html" title="Devil's Dictionary">Devil's Dictionary</a>. Early twentieth-century American humorists included members of the <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algonquin_Round_Table_2e31.html" title="Algonquin Round Table">Algonquin Round Table</a> (named for the <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algonquin_Hotel_c314.html" title="Algonquin Hotel">Algonquin Hotel</a>), such as <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorothy_Parker_f8a9.html" title="Dorothy Parker">Dorothy Parker</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Benchley_8f1f.html" title="Robert Benchley">Robert Benchley</a>. In more recent times popular writers of American humor include <a href="../../../p/2E/_/P._J._O%27Rourke_0c62.html" title="P. J. O'Rourke">P. J. O'Rourke</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/m/Erma_Bombeck_f778.html" title="Erma Bombeck">Erma Bombeck</a>, and <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Barry_4734.html" title="Dave Barry">Dave Barry</a>.</p>

<p><i><a href="../../../m/a/d/Mad.html" title="Mad">Mad</a></i> is an American <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humor_magazine.html" title="Humor magazine">humor magazine</a> founded in 1952 which offered <a href="../../../s/a/t/Satire.html" title="Satire">satire</a> on all aspects of American life and <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_culture.html" title="Pop culture">pop culture</a>. With its first issue (October-November, 1952), <i>Mad</i> was a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_book.html" title="Comic book">comic book</a>, and part of the line of <a href="../../../e/c/_/EC_Comics_0443.html" title="EC Comics">EC Comics</a>. It became a slick magazine in 1954. Throughout the 1950s and continuing until today <i>Mad</i> featured parodies focusing on the familiar staples of American culture, exposing the fakery behind the image. The magazine has leant its name to the current television program <a href="../../../m/a/d/MADtv_e552.html" title="MADtv">MadTV</a>.</p>
<p>Other U.S. humor magazines of note include <i><a href="../../../h/u/m/Humbug.html" title="Humbug">Humbug</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/r/u/Trump.html" title="Trump">Trump</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../h/e/l/Help%21.html" title="Help!">Help!</a></i>, as well as the <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Lampoon_2239.html" title="National Lampoon">National Lampoon</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../s/p/y/Spy_Magazine_82bc.html" title="Spy Magazine">Spy Magazine</a></i>.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Lampoon_2239.html" title="National Lampoon">National Lampoon</a></i> began in 1970 as an offshoot of the <i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Lampoon_36b9.html" title="Harvard Lampoon">Harvard Lampoon</a></i>. The magazine regularly skewered <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_culture.html" title="Pop culture">pop culture</a>, the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterculture.html" title="Counterculture">counterculture</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">politics</a>. The magazine was at its height in the 1970s, and its influence spread to films and comedy programs. In the mid 1970s, some of the magazine's contributors left to join the NBC comedy show <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Night_Live_e56a.html" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a> (SNL). The magazine stopped publication in 1998, but films and other programs attributed to "National Lampoon" continue.</p>
<p>In the twentieth-century film allowed for animated cartoons of a humorous nature. The most notable of these perhaps being <i><a href="../../../l/o/o/Looney_Tunes_dcd6.html" title="Looney Tunes">Looney Tunes</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_and_Jerry_%28MGM%29_d722.html" title="Tom and Jerry (MGM)">Tom and Jerry</a></i>. <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuck_Jones_f96e.html" title="Chuck Jones">Chuck Jones</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/x/Tex_Avery_46f7.html" title="Tex Avery">Tex Avery</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/l/Mel_Blanc_2b48.html" title="Mel Blanc">Mel Blanc</a> (as a voice) and <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friz_Freleng_45b9.html" title="Friz Freleng">Friz Freleng</a> playing critical roles in this. Humorous animated shorts like <i><a href="../../../w/h/a/What%27s_Opera%2C_Doc__3f43.html" title="What's Opera, Doc?">What's Opera, Doc?</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../d/u/c/Duck_Amuck_fcc2.html" title="Duck Amuck">Duck Amuck</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Froggy_Evening_1a36.html" title="One Froggy Evening">One Froggy Evening</a></i> garnered critical enough appeal to be inducted into the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Film_Registry_0c8c.html" title="National Film Registry">National Film Registry</a>. The Warner Brothers cartoons often dealt with themes beyond US culture or society, but did involve a great deal of commentary on American life. Although many of the American winners of the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_Award_for_Animated_Short_Film_53e9.html" title="Academy Award for Animated Short Film">Academy Award for Animated Short Film</a> are not examples of American humor a significant percentage would qualify as such.

<p>A popular form of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theater.html" title="Theater">theater</a> during the 19th century was the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minstrel.html" title="Minstrel">minstrelsy</a> show, arguably the first uniquely American style of performance.

<p><a href="../../../b/u/r/Burlesque.html" title="Burlesque">Burlesque</a> became a popular form of entertainment in the middle of the 19th century. Originally a form of <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farce.html" title="Farce">farce</a> in which females in male roles mocked the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics.html" title="Politics">politics</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture.html" title="Culture">culture</a> of the day, burlesque was condemned by opinion makers for its sexuality and outspokenness. The form was hounded off the "legitimate stage" and found itself relegated to saloons and barrooms, and its content mostly raunchy jokes.</p>
<p><a href="../../../v/a/u/Vaudeville.html" title="Vaudeville">Vaudeville</a> is a style of variety entertainment predominant in America in the late 19th Century and early 20th Century.

Part of this entertainment was usually one or more comedians. Vaudeville provided generations of American entertainers including <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_M._Cohan_1ed6.html" title="George M.

<p>Early radio shows include what is labeled as the first situation comedy, <i><a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_and_Henry_d11f.html" title="Sam and Henry">Sam and Henry</a></i>, which debuted on <a href="../../../w/g/n/WGN_ab42.html" title="WGN">WGN</a> radio in 1926. It was partially inspired by Sidney Smith's popular comic strip <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gumps_2714.html" title="The Gumps">The Gumps</a></i>. <i><a href="../../../a/m/o/Amos_%26_Andy_a7e4.html" title="Amos &amp; Andy">Amos &amp; Andy</a></i> began as one of the first radio comedy serials which debuted on CBS in 1928. This was a show written and performed by white actors about black farmhands moving to the big city. The show was successful enough that in 1930 a film was made with the characters and in 1951 it became a television sitcom. The film starred the white actors in blackface. The television show starred African American actors.</p>
<p>Radio in its early years was a showcase for comedy stars from the <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vaudeville.html" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</a> circuit. <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Benny_3ec2.html" title="Jack Benny">Jack Benny</a> being among the early comedy stars in this medium. When Jack moved to television in the 1950s, his time slot was filled by <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_Freberg_1276.html" title="Stan Freberg">Stan Freberg</a> a <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voice_actor.html" title="Voice actor">voice actor</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedian.html" title="Comedian">comedian</a>. Stan began in 1950 to produce records of his comedy routines which involved parodies of popular tunes and spoofs of modern entertainment personalities and on political topics. He was also on radio from 1954-1957.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Elliott_%28comedian%29_f6d0.html" title="Bob Elliott (comedian)">Bob Elliott</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Goulding_77a5.html" title="Ray Goulding">Ray Goulding</a> were an American comedy team who began in radio in 1946 with a daily 15-minute show titled <i>Matinee With <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_and_Ray_e12b.html" title="Bob and Ray">Bob and Ray</a></i>. Their format was typically to satirize the medium in which they were performing, such as conducting interviews, with off-the-wall dialogue presented in a generally deadpan style as though it were a serious interview. They continued on the air for over four decades on radio and television, ending in 1987.</p>
<p>In more recent times the medium fell out of favor as a source of humor with <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garrison_Keilor_423c.html" title="Garrison Keilor">Garrison Keilor</a> being perhaps a rare modern example.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_humor.html" title="Edit section: Sitcoms">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Sitcoms</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../s/i/t/Situation_comedy.html" title="Situation comedy">situation comedy</a> (sitcom) is a format that first developed in radio and later became the primary form of comedy on television. The first sitcom to be number one in US ratings overall was <i><a href="../../../i/_/l/I_Love_Lucy_f6db.html" title="I Love Lucy">I Love Lucy</a></i>. A typical <i>I Love Lucy</i> episode involved one of Lucy's ambitious but hare-brained schemes, whether it be sneaking into Ricky's nightclub act, finding a way to hobnob with celebrities, showing up her fellow women's club members, or simply trying to improve the quality of her life. Usually she ends up in some comedic mess, a form of slapstick comedy. The I Love Lucy show grew out of a radio program in which Lucille Ball was featured. Another popular sitcom of the 50s to cross over from radio was <i><a href="../../../a/m/o/Amos_%26_Andy_a7e4.html" title="Amos &amp; Andy">Amos &amp; Andy</a></i>.</p>
<p>In the decades since, several sitcoms have been tops in the ratings. In the 1960s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beverly_Hillbillies_8b9b.html" title="The Beverly Hillbillies">The Beverly Hillbillies</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Andy_Griffith_Show_b993.html" title="The Andy Griffith Show">The Andy Griffith Show</a></i> show held that distinction. Both of these programs were based on the country bumpkin - the Clampetts bringing their hillbilly ways to Beverly Hills, and the slow talking sheriff in the small rural town. In the 1970s <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All_in_the_Family_80eb.html" title="All in the Family">All in the Family</a></i> was the top rated show while dealing with serious issues it was based on the loudmouth bigot usually getting his come-uppance.</p>
<p>The most successful sitcoms of the 1980s were <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cosby_Show_5174.html" title="The Cosby Show">The Cosby Show</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../r/o/s/Roseanne_%28TV_series%29_e63f.html" title="Roseanne (TV series)">Roseanne</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheers.html" title="Cheers">Cheers</a></i>. <i>The Cosby Show</i> is noteworth because is was a family comedy about an African American family based on the gentle comedy of <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Cosby_9aa1.html" title="Bill Cosby">Bill Cosby</a>. <i>Roseanne</i> was also a family sitcom, but based on loud and large <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue-collar.html" title="Blue-collar">blue-collar</a> parents. <i>Cheers</i> on the otherhand was about a neighborhood bar frequented by a mix of <a href="../../../w/o/r/Working-class.html" title="Working-class">working-class</a> and professional drinkers.</p>
<p>In the 1990s the increasing popularity of cable changed the popularity of the sitcom. Cable provided more viewing options and made it more difficult for any one show to dominate in the manner that The <i>Cosby Show</i> or <i>Cheers</i> did in their eras. That said <i><a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../f/r/i/Friends.html" title="Friends">Friends</a></i> managed to be among the most watched shows of the decade. The 2000s has seen a further erosion in the sitcom with <i><a href="../../../f/r/i/Friends.html" title="Friends">Friends</a></i> being the only one to be the top watched show in any year of this decade, thus far, and the cancellation of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Comedy_Series_87de.html" title="Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series">Emmy winning</a> <i><a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrested_Development_%28TV_series%29_237c.html" title="Arrested Development (TV series)">Arrested Development</a></i>. <i>Arrested Development</i> had been one of the few critically successful comedies to have started in the 2000s, but recent comedies like <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Office_%28US_TV_series%29_e2dc.html" title="The Office (US TV series)">The Office</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Name_Is_Earl_7575.html" title="My Name Is Earl">My Name Is Earl</a></i> have garnered some praise.</p>
<p>While many sitcoms were based on families or family situations, another common thread in sitcoms is "workplace comedies." <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Andy_Griffith_Show_b993.html" title="The Andy Griffith Show">The Andy Griffith Show</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../a/r/r/Arrested_Development_%28TV_series%29_237c.html" title="Arrested Development (TV series)">Arrested Development</a></i> had elements of both workplace and family comedy. For more on this see <a href="../../../s/i/t/Situation_comedy.html#United_States" title="Situation comedy">US sitcom</a>.</p>
<p>Although often derided by the critics, a few sitcoms have managed to be successful with both critics and audiences alike. Amongst these are <i><a href="../../../f/r/a/Frasier.html" title="Frasier">Frasier</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All_in_the_Family_80eb.html" title="All in the Family">All in the Family</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mary_Tyler_Moore_Show_478f.html" title="The Mary Tyler Moore Show">The Mary Tyler Moore Show</a></i>.</p>
<p>The television sitcom provides an opportunity to compare British and American humor. Many British sitcoms have been re-made for American audiences. For example, <i><a href="../../../t/i/l/Till_Death_Us_Do_Part_121f.html" title="Till Death Us Do Part">Till Death Us Do Part</a></i> became <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All_in_the_Family_80eb.html" title="All in the Family">All in the Family</a></i>; <i><a href="../../../m/a/n/Man_About_the_House_5372.html" title="Man About the House">Man About the House</a></i> became <i><a href="../../../t/h/r/Three%27s_Company_7568.html" title="Three's Company">Three's Company</a></i>; and, the immensely popular <i><a href="../../../s/t/e/Steptoe_and_Son_cbf4.html" title="Steptoe and Son">Steptoe and Son</a></i> became <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanford_and_Son_8d35.html" title="Sanford and Son">Sanford and Son</a></i>. <i>The Office</i> was originally a British sitcom that has been successfully remade remade for an American audience using the same title (and often the same scripts). However, most British sitcoms usually fare better in their original forms. Re-makes of other British comedies have failed.</p>

<p><i><a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Night_Live_e56a.html" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a></i> (SNL) first aired on October 11, 1975, with <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Carlin_f409.html" title="George Carlin">George Carlin</a> as its host. It was created by Canadian <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorne_Michaels_6ed8.html" title="Lorne Michaels">Lorne Michaels</a>. The original concept was for a comedy-variety show featuring young comedians, live musical performances, and short films.

The cast has periodically changed over the years, serving as a springboard for many of its performers to success in other television programs or films. SNL continues to air weekly.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s there started to be more sketch comedy shows that concerned racial issues or intentionally had a diverse cast.

<p>American stand-up comedians deal with a variety of forms and issues.

The 1950s saw the rise of this troupe's significance in modern improvisational comedy.</p>
<p>That decade also witnessed a rise in stand-up comedy dealing with more provocative or politically charged subject matter. Among the best known comedians from the 1950s to the 1980s to work in this fashion are <a href="../../../l/e/n/Lenny_Bruce_8f14.html" title="Lenny Bruce">Lenny Bruce</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Pryor_942f.html" title="Richard Pryor">Richard Pryor</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Carlin_f409.html" title="George Carlin">George Carlin</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Hicks_4b45.html" title="Bill Hicks">Bill Hicks</a>, and <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Kinnison_d5b4.html" title="Sam Kinnison">Sam Kinnison</a>. They dealt with subject manner like race, religion, and sex in a manner that was generally not allowed on television or film. Hence <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Richard_Pryor_Show_c1b7.html" title="The Richard Pryor Show">The Richard Pryor Show</a> ended after four episodes due in part to controversy, although poor ratings was a strong factoe. In other cases the reactions were more severe as both Lenny Bruce and George Carlin were both arrested on obscenity charges.</p>
<p>That said other stand-ups in the US chose an opposite approach that involves avoiding angering or offending elements of the audience. They may also try to work "clean" either because they prefer doing so or because they wish to reach audiences that disdain raunchy material. Amongst those who do so as a preference are <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Regan_bd88.html" title="Brian Regan">Brian Regan</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Newhart_467b.html" title="Bob Newhart">Bob Newhart</a>, and <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Cosby_9aa1.html" title="Bill Cosby">Bill Cosby</a>. <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Romano_a5d5.html" title="Ray Romano">Ray Romano</a> is capable or even willing to work "blue", see <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Katz%2C_Professional_Therapist_b1d1.html" title="Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist">Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist</a> and commentary tracks on the DVD, but has tended to avoid doing so out of deference to his current audience.</p>
