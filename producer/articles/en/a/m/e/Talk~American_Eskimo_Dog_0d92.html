<p>This was a very informative article, but I have good news for those of you with "separation anxiety" i.e., tearing up the house. After coming home to what appeared to be a crime scene for 2 years, a friend suggested Clomicalm(clomipramine hydrochloride). My vet gave us the medication ASAP and in one day, Diamond stopped eating the dining room carpet. He has had no long term side effects from this drug given once a day for life(usually). At first his appetite lagged a bit. If you value your dog and your possessions, then there is a "cure". Diamond is now 8 years old. We were waiting to get more Clomicalm and he went w/o it for a few days. Now we see that he does not need it anymore. Even if we had to give it to him for life, it would have been well worth it. So many people get rid of their pets because of their destructive behavior when they are not home. If you are thinking of getting rid of your eskie becuse of this, please check with your vet about Clomicalm. It's a small price to pay for a happy, well trained dog. He never chewed up the furniture, clothes or trash can contents again. I understand that it may take a little longer to see the effects of this medication, but give it a try.</p>
<p>This is a great article. I have an Eskie and he is 11 years old. Be aware, if you plan on owning one they are very high maintainance. The vet called it "separation anxiety." He is just now NOT tearing up the house when I leave. I now have hardwood floors because he "ate" all the carpet in my house. He is a very gentle and loving dog but be aware not to spoil them as I did. Great and very informative article.</p>

<dd>Extremely late to give advice, but I do have advice on separation anxiety. Macheath (the dog with the "stained eyes" in the article) has no separation anxiety because my previous dog did. I learned from that. When I got Macheath, I made sure that, every time I leave (<b>every time</b>) I say one of two things: "I'm going to the store" or "I'm going to work." I use the first when I plan to be gone a short time, the other when I plan to be gone a long time. However, and here's the trick, when I leave for a long time, I make sure that I give her a treat as I head to the door, and I give her lavish, lavish praise as I go. She has a mouth full of dog biscuit and ears full of praise as I go out the door. She promptly lays down and goes to sleep, I'm told. Make sure your dog sees your departure as a good thing, as a time of happiness, when she's hearing what a wonderful creature she is. Oh, and distract her. Also, be consistent. Be very, very, very consistent. Never alter your phrase, and never forget. If a dog knows that you're coming back, she won't freak out as badly. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:59, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The American Eskimo dog that was in the bottom photo <a href="../../../m/a/c/Image%7EMacheath-dog.jpg_c122.html" title="Image:Macheath-dog.jpg">Image:Macheath-dog.jpg</a> , does it need to have it eye area cleaned? The photo doesn't appear to be representative of the AKA preferred appearance for the breed. I've replaced the photo, but am starting this discussion here in case someone disagrees with my assessment! I don't mean to seem callous in removing a photograph. Any comments would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<dd>It probably does need to be cleaned. In fact, that's a very good point for this breed so I readded the photo with an appropriate caption. I don't know whether we really need 2 photos of Eskies in the snow, though, especially uncropped like these are. Hmm, could we crop them both down closer to the dog? The white-white one camo'd for the snow is kind of cool and the other one is just a nice photo of an Amer Eskimo, so maybe they could both stay. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/f/User_talk%7EElf_54a3.html" title="User talk:Elf">Talk</a> 00:09, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks Elf... with your commentary I think it is definitely appropriate for the page. I agree with both of your thoughts about the snow and the cropping, so have cropped one of the two eskie-in-snow photos. The snow camouflaged pic is still available on the pics of dogs page. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUris_074e.html" title="User:Uris">Uris</a> 00:35, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For what it's worth, Macheath does fit breed standard, although she's not a show dog. However, with that particular shot, we have lens distortion and her holding her ears back. When I put it on the article, it was the <i>only</i> picture we had. I'm delighted with the replacements, but I have to defend her honor a <i>little</i> to tell you that she is a breed standard animal, albeit one who needs her eyes cleaned. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:05, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It has been my understanding that American Eskimo Dog is a new American name for the same breed that is also called <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spitz.html" title="Spitz">German Spitz</a> elsewhere. I read that Americans changed the name during World War I because people didn't want 'German' dogs. It's also my understanding that they are related to the <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samoyed.html" title="Samoyed">Samoyed</a> breed. Can anyone confirm my recollections? --<a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerekian_b017.html" title="User:Derekian">Derekian</a> 19:40, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>American Eskimo Dogs are NOT related to Samoyeds. Eskies were bred in Germany as companion dogs. They did used to be called the German Spitz. Many people mistake them for miniature Samoyeds, but they are a completely different breed. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaraRune_f339.html" title="User:StaraRune">StaraRune</a> 27 September 2005</p>
<p>The other thing is that the breed has had a number of informal names. They are now separate from the German Spitz, but, because the AKC was so horribly late in recognizing the breed, everything about it has been varied. The breed has been recognizably a single breed since the 1910s, and it hasn't been shrunk nor enlarged, but I've heard them called "Spitz dogs," "German spitzes," "Feist dogs," "Fiesties," "Eskimo dogs," and, of course, the now accepted American Eskimo Dog. The other interesting thing is that they spread out across the US relatively quickly (compare fragile puppies like Pomeranians and Malteses), then waned in the 1970's. I'm hoping they continue to make a comeback, as they're just a great companion and a perfect apartment dog. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:05, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
