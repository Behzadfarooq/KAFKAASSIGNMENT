<p>In the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_pilot.html" title="Television pilot">pilot</a> episode (set in November 1963), Meg and Roxanne win the opportunity to join the dancers on the TV show <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Bandstand_91e6.html" title="American Bandstand">American Bandstand</a></i>, filmed in Philadelphia. <i>Bandstand</i> immediately becomes the principal creative pillar of <i>American Dreams</i>, with each episode featuring recreated versions of several musical acts that originally appeared on the real <i>Bandstand</i>, often rendered by modern singers.</p>
<p>JJ Pryor, a running back for the East Catholic Fighting Crusaders football team, tries to earn a full athletic scholarship to play at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Notre_Dame_aca9.html" title="University of Notre Dame">University of Notre Dame</a>, but can only earn a partial scholarship. He later applies for and is accepted to <a href="../../../l/e/h/Lehigh_University_1c63.html" title="Lehigh University">Lehigh University</a>, but a nagging ankle injury curtails his football career - and thus he enlists in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Marine_Corps_e7db.html" title="United States Marine Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> to pay for school. Meanwhile, JJ's on-again, off-again girlfriend Beth chooses to attend the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Pennsylvania_1f66.html" title="University of Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> in order to be near JJ.</p>
<p>In the early part of the season, Meg develops a crush on Bandstand dancer Jimmy Riley, and they go on a couple of public appearance dates. While never becoming romantic, they remained good friends until Riley shipped off to <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Marine_Corps_e7db.html" title="United States Marine Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boot_camp.html" title="Boot camp">boot camp</a>. Meg later developed a romance with Luke Foley, the bespectacled record store clerk and fellow East Catholic student.</p>
<p>Sam Walker wins a track <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholarship.html" title="Scholarship">scholarship</a> to East Catholic. Some in the majority-white student body resent Sam's presence, especially Tommy DeFelice, who is later expelled after a football betting scandal. Sam and Meg develop a friendship, even creating a record-swapping club while meeting at the Vinyl Crocodile record store.</p>
<p>In the final episode (<a href="../../../m/a/y/May_18.html" title="May 18">18 May</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>), JJ departs for <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boot_camp.html" title="Boot camp">boot camp</a> at <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Lejeune_c6b4.html" title="Camp Lejeune">Camp Lejeune</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_5c52.html" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>, while Meg and Sam are caught in the <a href="../../../r/i/o/Riot.html" title="Riot">riots</a> that shook Philadelphia in the summer of 1964.</p>

<p>Meg and Sam survive the riots unharmed, but the branch of Jack's store under Henry's management is destroyed. Gwen dies from <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a>. JJ excels at boot camp and arrives in <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. While on leave, he and Beth are reunited in <a href="../../../h/a/w/Hawaii.html" title="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>; they break up, but Beth soon learns she is pregnant with JJ's child, and she moves in with the Pryors.</p>
<p>Helen discovers that there might be a possible surgical treatment for Will's paralysis, and the early part of the season deals with Will's medical treatment. By the end of the season, Will's leg braces have been removed and he is able to walk normally.</p>
<p>Sam wins a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania. Jack decides to run for the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_City_Council_96f4.html" title="Philadelphia City Council">City Council</a>. In the final episode, (<a href="../../../a/p/r/April_4.html" title="April 4">4 April</a> 2004), Sam's cousin Nathan is drafted and opts to go to jail rather than serve in Vietnam. Also in that episode, JJ is caught in a fierce <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle.html" title="Battle">firefight</a>, while Meg and Sam are arrested at a campus rally protesting the Vietnam war.</p>

<p>The arrests widen the communications gap between parents and children, and inspire Meg to lead additional protests. A strict new headmaster also fires Meg up. An injured JJ wakes up in an American military hospital, and learns of his forthcoming child; Beth refuses to accept JJ's offer of marriage. Roxanne, estranged from her mother, moves in with the Pryors. JJ gets recruited for special, somewhat mysterious duty for the US government. Jack wins an upset victory for the City Council.</p>
<p>As Thanksgiving nears closer, JJ is captured by the Viet Cong. He and his sergeant escape, but are presumed missing in action (the sergeant is later found buried in a shallow grave). The Pryors learn of JJ's "Missing In Action" status just before Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Luke Foley returns to Philadelphia, and Roxanne, who moves out on her remarrying mother, moves in with him in a loft above the Vinyl Crocodile record store.</p>
<p>On a commercial-free special episode (sponsored by Ford) that aired November 21, 2004, JJ returns home. At episode's end JJ glares harshly at his mother. It could be a sign of things to come. In the next original episode (aired January 2, 2005), JJ becomes a Marine recruiter and suffers from post-traumatic flashbacks. He proposes to Beth. Beth and JJ are married on the January 23, 2005 episode. Helen becomes involved with a Catholic peace group.</p>
<p>As the show enters 1966, JJ marries Beth at a church ceremony. Jack Pryor, newly elected to the Philadelphia City Council, is forced to take a bribe, with the money going to help JJ repay some gambling debts. Eventually Jack votes to elect a local activist in his district. Reverend Davis, to the Police Review Board; essentially voting against the Council. For this act of disloyalty, several members of the police force beat up JJ after a traffic stop. Pete soon finds the culprits who attacked JJ and roughs them up, but Jack decides to resign from the Council.</p>
<p>Chris and Meg's relationship becomes more intimate, but Meg is troubled by reports that Chris helped set fire to a recruitment center. Despite this, Meg and Chris eventually have sex - with Chris revealing afterward that he did indeed lie to Meg about the recruitment center. Meg and Chris eventually break up, and Chris leaves Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Meg and Sam consider the possibility of a romantic relationship, but JJ and Nathan discourage the idea. Meanwhile, Jack and Pete's older brother Ted gets into a serious car accident, putting him on a respirator. After much soul searching, the Pryors decide to disconnect the machine. After returning home from a Rolling Stones concert, Meg finds her ex-boyfriend Chris standing in front of her home. He's just been drafted.</p>
<p>In the final episode of the season, Meg and Chris both leave Philadelphia on Chris' motorcycle, with plans for them to live in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkeley%2C_California_6eb4.html" title="Berkeley, California">Berkeley, California</a> and campaign against the war. JJ Pryor applies for and receives a job in aeronautics, assisting in space suit design for future <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a> missions to the moon.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_16.html" title="May 16">May 16</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, NBC announced their fall schedule for the 2005-06 season. Confirming months of speculation (and an unofficial confirmation article on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_1.html" title="May 1">May 1</a> by Reuters), <i>American Dreams</i> was formally cancelled, a victim of low ratings.</p>
<p>Never a strong performer in its Sunday 8:00 p.m. timeslot, the show's third-season ratings dropped 33% from its first season and 13% from its second season. In the third season, the show was regularly beaten in the Sunday night ratings by <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a>'s <i><a href="../../../h/o/m/Extreme_Makeover%7E_Home_Edition_cc95.html" title="Extreme Makeover: Home Edition">Extreme Makeover: Home Edition</a></i> and <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a>'s <i><a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_Case_cf31.html" title="Cold Case">Cold Case</a></i>. On <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_2.html" title="February 2">February 2</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> NBC reduced the number of third season episodes of <i>American Dreams</i> from 19 to 17. The network also moved the program away from its original Sunday night timeslot to Wednesday nights, airing before <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_West_Wing_%28television%29_00e0.html" title="The West Wing (television)">The West Wing</a></i>. This put the show up against <a href="../../../c/b/s/CBS_250c.html" title="CBS">CBS</a>'s <i><a href="../../../p/a/l/Survivor%7E_Palau_1e68.html" title="Survivor: Palau">Survivor: Palau</a></i> and <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Broadcasting_Company_349c.html" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a>'s <i><a href="../../../l/o/s/Lost_%28TV_series%29_c407.html" title="Lost (TV series)">Lost</a></i>, and <i>American Dreams</i> could not compete against these popular programs.</p>
<p>As the third season wound down, actors on the show apparently saw the writing on the wall and filmed pilots for new shows to possibly air in the 2005-06 television season. Fans of <i>American Dreams</i> organized a postcard writing campaign to save the show. Fans sent over 5000 supportive e-mails to NBC after the season finale and sent several thousand postcards to the network as well. On May 4, 2005, fans flew an aerial banner over NBC's Burbank studios in support of the show, even as the show's sets were being dismantled at Sunset-Gower Studios, where the show was filmed.</p>
<p>It had been reported that <i>American Dreams</i> may have been cancelled as early as December 2004 primarily because of the interracial dating issue between Meg and Sam; Jonathan Prince mentioned in a Miami Herald article that he was able to get four additional episodes made by having companies such as Kraft and Nabisco pay for additional episodes in exchange for product placement (Campbell's Soups and Ford also participated in product placement episodes).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Dreams_8683.html" title="Edit section: Accuracy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Accuracy</span></h2>
<p>Despite its popularity as a family drama, <i>American Dreams</i> was heavily criticized for its various levels of historical inaccuracy. Several historic events were restaged earlier or later in the show's timeline to fit a plotline, and some of the music and pop culture references do not match up with either historic fact or the show's current timeline. Several arguments between the show's loyal fanbase can be traced to whether the show should be viewed as a chronologically accurate representation of life in 1960s Philadelphia, or is instead an idealized combination of mnemonic images and pop culture references from points throughout the 1960s, much as the film <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wedding_Singer_5a90.html" title="The Wedding Singer">The Wedding Singer</a></i> was for the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>.</p>
<p>Some examples of these disputes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>On American Dreams, a running plotline is the appearance of Meg and Roxanne as dancers on <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Bandstand_91e6.html" title="American Bandstand">American Bandstand</a>, which still tapes a daily after-school show in Philadelphia; where in real life the show moved to Los Angeles in February, 1964 and was only broadcast once a week, on Saturday afternoons (in real life, the studio used for Bandstand was later appropriated by Philadelphia public radio station <a href="../../../w/h/y/WHYY-FM_63dc.html" title="WHYY-FM">WHYY</a>).</li>
<li>In the first year JJ Pryor Jr supposedly attended <a href="../../../l/e/h/Lehigh_University_1c63.html" title="Lehigh University">Lehigh University</a> on a football scholarship in 1963 but joined the Marines when injured to pay for college. As is common at elite academic institutions, Lehigh doesn't have athletic scholarships but gives financial grants in aid instead. Thus he would have still had financial aid even if injured.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_1964_race_riot.html" title="Philadelphia 1964 race riot">Philadelphia 1964 race riot</a> depicted in the first season finale started at night, not in the daytime, as depicted in the show. Television footage of the riots shown on the episode actually came from the <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watts_riots.html" title="Watts riots">Watts riots</a> of 1965 <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>.</li>
<li>During the show's first season, the music of several artists, such as the Kinks, Dusty Springfield and Manfred Mann, are heard and referenced in 1963, months before the Beatles' appearance on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i> (February 1964) that triggered the musical British Invasion.</li>
<li>When the Beatles appear on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i>, the scene is set up so that the first song the Beatles play is "<a href="../../../i/_/w/I_Want_to_Hold_Your_Hand_130a.html" title="I Want to Hold Your Hand">I Want to Hold Your Hand</a>", which although it was the Beatles' first American hit, it was not the first song played on <i>Ed Sullivan</i> (that honor goes to "<a href="../../../a/l/l/All_My_Loving_7a51.html" title="All My Loving">All My Loving</a>").</li>
<li>In one episode in the show's third season, set in late November 1965, the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northeast_Blackout_of_1965_71fd.html" title="Northeast Blackout of 1965">East Coast Blackout</a> and the <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonid_meteor_shower.html" title="Leonid meteor shower">Leonid meteor shower</a> were both "rescheduled" so that they would fall on the same day that Beth Mason gave birth to JJ Pryor's son.</li>
<li>JJ and Beth have sex in January 1965 and July 1965, yet Beth gives birth in November 1965, making her pregnancy either 11 months long or 5 months long.</li>
<li>In a first-season episode, Meg and Roxanne gush over meeting the group <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_%26_the_Americans_3e0b.html" title="Jay &amp; the Americans">Jay &amp; the Americans</a>, and Roxanne is especially enamored with "Carl, the drummer" (the group neither had a member named Carl, nor a drummer, in real life). Also in real life, there were two lead singers known as "Jay" - Jay Traynor, who sang on their hit "She Cried", and Jay Black, who replaced Traynor for the group's other hits - yet on the episode, it is assumed that there was only one "Jay" who sang all the hits without interruption.</li>
<li>In the show's first season, set in November 1963, Meg Pryor and Luke Foley argue over the merits of <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, and Luke hands Meg a 45 of Dylan singing "<a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Tambourine_Man_d344.html" title="Mr. Tambourine Man">Mr. Tambourine Man</a>." In fact, Dylan did not write or perform the song until 1964, and he never released it on a commercial 45 (it appeared on his "Bringing It All Back Home" album released in early 1965), although the Byrds' rendition of it was a hit single.</li>
<li>References are made in the show's second season to <a href="../../../i/_/d/I_Dream_of_Jeannie_05f5.html" title="I Dream of Jeannie">I Dream of Jeannie</a>, which was still a year away from premiering.</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Monkees_8ee9.html" title="The Monkees">The Monkees</a> perform on the <i>Bandstand</i> stage in January 1966, despite their television series not even premiering until September 1966, or the four actors playing the Monkees even performing a live concert until a year later.</li>
<li>While working at the space suit company, JJ Pryor meets <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gus_Grissom_f9b5.html" title="Gus Grissom">Gus Grissom</a>, and they discuss the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_1.html" title="Apollo 1">Apollo 1</a> mission. Grissom later says, "Get me back to Cape Canaveral." In reality, the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo_1.html" title="Apollo 1">Apollo 1</a> mission was not designated by that number or name until after the accident that claimed the lives of Grissom and two other astronauts (at the time the mission was known as Apollo/Saturn 204), and the reference to <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Canaveral_6e9e.html" title="Cape Canaveral">Cape Canaveral</a> would have been wrong, as the area where the space center was located had been renamed "Cape Kennedy" during the 1960s. While the town was officially renamed back to <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_Canaveral_6e9e.html" title="Cape Canaveral">Cape Canaveral</a> in 1973, the space center was (and still is) known as the Kennedy Space Center, and at least three years had passed since the town was renamed from Cape Canaveral to Cape Kennedy; so although it is not impossible that in a casual conversation Grissom would have used the traditional name, it is still unlikely that this would happen.</li>
<li>Artists such as <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blake_Shelton_4d23.html" title="Blake Shelton">Blake Shelton</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Ondrasik_4fed.html" title="John Ondrasik">John Ondrasik</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joss_Stone_60e2.html" title="Joss Stone">Joss Stone</a> are allowed to perform their current pop hits, which in real time would have been 40 years away from ever existing.</li>
<li>Neither The Who nor Ricky Nelson ever performed on the <i>Bandstand</i> stage in real life (Nelson's father Ozzie refused to allow his performing son to appear on anybody else's TV series, even if such appearance might help increase record sales); but that didn't stop the producers from staging performances by those artists in this series.</li>
<li>In an episode that is supposedly taking place in the spring of 1965; Two customers at the TV store, played by <a href="../../../d/a/y/Days_Of_Our_Lives_8499.html" title="Days Of Our Lives">Days Of Our Lives</a> actors <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Aniston_21a1.html" title="John Aniston">John Aniston</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frances_Reid_9996.html" title="Frances Reid">Frances Reid</a>, were watching an episode of <a href="../../../d/a/y/Days_Of_Our_Lives_8499.html" title="Days Of Our Lives">Days Of Our Lives</a> on a TV (Frances was watching herself on an early episode). <a href="../../../d/a/y/Days_Of_Our_Lives_8499.html" title="Days Of Our Lives">Days Of Our Lives</a> did not premiere until <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_8.html" title="November 8">November 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965.html" title="1965">1965</a>.</li>
<li>In an episode purporting to take place in the summer of 1966, a character on "American Bandstand" is asked to rate the Rolling Stones' song "I Can't Get No Satisfaction", despite the song being over a year old.</li>
<li>In a late third-season episode, Meg, Roxanne and Luke sit outside Connie Mack Stadium with lawn chairs, listening for free to the <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stones_55ad.html" title="Rolling Stones">Rolling Stones</a>, who are playing a live concert at the stadium. Luke makes a reference that he heard a Bob Dylan concert at Connie Mack Stadium for free this way. Bob Dylan did not play Connie Mack Stadium as an outdoor venue in 1966 or earlier.</li>
<li>In another third season episode that takes place in June 1966, the Mamas and Papas appear on American Bandstand to perform "California Dreamin'". However, the Mamas and Papas actual appearance on the show was in February 1966, they did not appear again in June of that year.</li>

<p>During the show's run, several contemporary artists recreated performances of artists from the 1960s. These recreations were often performed on the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Bandstand_91e6.html" title="American Bandstand">American Bandstand</a> stage; although several performances took place at a performing area adjacent to the Vinyl Crocodile record store. In the second and third seasons, several of the recreations took place at The Lair, a coffee house/student union facility on the University of Pennsylvania campus.</p>
<p>The following contemporary artists, along with the songs they performed and the artist they "interpreted", are listed below.</p>
