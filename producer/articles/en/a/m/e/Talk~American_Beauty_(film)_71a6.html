<p>On the main page, the writer states matter-of-factly that the Colonel is a repressed gay and evidence of this is in the kiss with Spacey's character. However, in my many times watching this movie (I'm saying this not as a point of authority, but rather as a sign of my never-ending confusion), I've always been left wondering (1) is he gay, (2) or is he simply so desperate to understand his son that he takes that particular course of action? It was never spelled out, so..</p>
<p>Not saying I'm right. Just would like to see another possibily mentioned.</p>

<dd>I think it's pretty clear that the Colonel was gay. His anti-gay slurs were just his way of repressing his own secret homosexuality. He hated himself for being gay so much to the point that he hated others who were gay. At the end of the movie, he was so distraught about his son leaving that his defenses were down and he let go of his homophobia. He killed the main character (I don't remember the name) because it was his way of smothering out his homosexuality again. I'm trying to figure out how his homosexuality contributed to his wife having what looked like a breakdown. J.J. Bustamante 14:15, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>See, you say that it's pretty clear--but, at the same time, after reading the entry here, I went out and talked to random coworkers about this, and all but one of them felt the same way I did. Granted, I only asked six, as I was busy that day--but, still, for something you feel is pretty clear, it's something that a number of people feel divided about. As for his wife, while it's never spelled out (nothing in this movie is, including his possibile homosexuality, which is why we're talking about it), I always assumed that she had some disconnect from reality (read: she has mental issues) because of abuse. Colonel obviously has no problem hitting people when they steer wrong. Mom never seems to know exactly what is happening, and her contributions (as far as dialogue are concerned) are always.. weird. --Studio Ghibli 17:34, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As an addition, I also don't think Spacey's character declined having sex with the cheerleader because she was a virgin. Maybe this had something to do with it--but I think his -real- reason was because he realized that this seeming slut of a girl was, in fact, no different from his own daughter; immature, low self-esteem, and looking for something or someone to make her feel better about herself.

<p>How can this entire page not contain one mention of Sigmund Freud? This film is a (quite overt) warmed-over 60's counter-cultural interpretation of Freud's theory of repression (society's and the individual's repression of aggressive and homosexual tendencies). Has this been removed from the page, or was it never added (sorry, I'm really new to wikipedia)?</p>

<p>I found this line in the second paragraph of the summary. Where does this even come from? His life is clean and orderly to the point of being sterile... that is his character's very simplistic problem, to which he has a very simplistic reaction.</p>

<p><i>There is a puzzling subplot in which Thora Birch's character is shown researching breast surgery. As a key point in her relationship with Wes Bentley's character, she shows him her large, rounded breasts through her bedroom window, presumably to signify her trust in him. It is unclear why she feels she needs surgery. It has been claimed that her breasts are visibly asymmetrical but it is hard to know if this is the point of the scene. If so, does anyone know if this is an effect or represents the actress's real breasts? Science needs to know!</i></p>

<dd>I think it's just part of the film's criticism of various aspects of modern american life and culture. Whether she wants them augmented or just evened out (hehe) I don't know, but either way, the fact that she at 16 (? I dunno, she's young, anyway) is seriously contemplating using her life's saving for plastic surgery remains as a point strongly critical of attitudes towards appearance among certain groups of people. --<a href="../../../t/e/e/User%7ETeeks_36ac.html" title="User:Teeks">Teeks</a> 19:18, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The idea was that Jane Burnham felt she was ugly at the beginning of the movie, from some combination of low self-esteem and hanging out with Angela. When she met Ricky Fitts and saw the Most Beautiful Thing, Jane realized that having larger breast would not make her any more beautiful. When she shows her breasts to Ricky, it was because she trusts him, and because she is no longer ashamed of body. <a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendan62442_3496.html" title="User:Brendan62442">Brendan62442</a> 01:03, 16 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What this fellow said. She was insecure. She hated herself. When she reveals herself to Fitts, I see it as her not only testing the waters of her own possible beauty, but also putting her trust in him. You know, sort of how every shallow teenage girl you see does, except with more emotional gravitas. --Studio Ghibli 03:58, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The text says that Col. Fitts killed Lester, but I thought Carolyn (his wife) did it to avoid being "a victim" (of divorce, I suppose). I only saw the movie once, but I was sure the wife did it. Did I miss something? —<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot">Frecklefoot</a> 20:45, 30 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's what I thought too, when I first saw the movie. But on watching it again, you can clearly see blood on Col. Fitts when he walks out of the door. Also, Carolyn is standing on the lawn, crying, when the shot goes off. Then again, I think this bit is left intentionally confusing by the director. <a href="../../../g/a/u/User%7EGaurav_e64d.html" title="User:Gaurav">Gaurav</a> 10:42, 31 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The screenwriter tries to produce a moment of suspense where you're not quite sure what happened, but once we see Fitts wandering about covered in blood, I found it pretty darn clear. I know a lot of people didn't catch it, but this seems to be a problem in the execution (no pun intended) rather than intent. It's been a while since I saw the film, but I've got a draft script and I think it drops some heavier hints than made it into the final cut. (But it also throws much more misdirection at you from the beginning.) --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 11:19, 31 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is mentioned in the audio commentary, if I am not mistaken, that the opening sequence (where Jane asks Ricky to kill her father) was filmed when they were actually planning to have <i>them</i> kill Lester, but they later changed their minds. This (of course, along with Carol's actions prior to Lester's death) made for some fitting ambiguity, but I think consensus clearly is still that Fitts killed him. In my view, Carol was never planning to actually kill him, but rather to threaten/scare (although I'm not entirely sure), and was horrified by his bloody death when she returns, partly because it seems there is some connection between her thoughts and intents with regards to Lester: she intends to go home and teach him a lesson, and he ends up dead in the kitchen. --<a href="../../../t/e/e/User%7ETeeks_36ac.html" title="User:Teeks">Teeks</a> 19:05, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Colonel Fitt kills Lester because he cannot accept the fact that he is gay. He goes to Lester and kissed him right after his son (Ricky) is forced out of the house. He does that out of shame. The irony is that he is always the one who publicly denounces homosexuality.</dd>

<dd>I saw the movie just once, which was sufficient, and it was clear that the repressed neighbor did it. The wife may have had it on her mind, but didn't or couldn't do it. The only ambiguity was whether she had actually found his corpse yet, or was just shedding her narcissistic tears over her inability to shoot him. The neighbor may have been repressed, but being an old military guy, he was at least able to see a mission to its end. The best line in the movie was when the neighbor kissed Lester, and Lester said, "I'm sorry, you have the wrong impression." That line could have been a subtle shot at certain members of the media who were trying to label Spacey himself as gay. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 18:48, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"The social satire depicts a not-so-typical family with a sarcastic wife, an angry, rebellious husband, a teenage daughter, along with a number of other strange characters."</p>
<p>I feel part of the point of the film is that the family indeed <i>is</i> rather typical. On the exterior, they are a teenage daughter who responds sourly to her parents' attempts and communication (entirely symptomatic of young-to-middle teenagers), a career woman in real estate and a father working for a magazine, leaving the family in the upper middle class (I dunno, I'm not good with american "class" terms). Can the outward normality of the family, the facade be what is referred to in the title, American Beauty?</p>
<p>Anyway, I feel the fact that the family is "not so typical" is something only revealed when we go deeper (or "Look closer", which is the subtitle of the film), and that one theme of the film is that lives and situations such as those shown in the film are actually quite typical once one peels away the "American Beauty" by "Looking Closer"? I realize that this is a rather specified interpretation, perhaps even esoteric, I just felt the opening statement so bluntly concludes something I don't think is obvious. --<a href="../../../t/e/e/User%7ETeeks_36ac.html" title="User:Teeks">Teeks</a> 19:50, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I rewrote the entire first paragraph: I simply found it difficult to make some of the points made above come through without changing the nature of said paragraph entirely. Also, I don't agree the movie is ultimately about "finding your place". I mean, the film is very much about turbulence and revolution in people's lives, and harmony isn't at all achieved, it's simply Lester who emancipates himself, to the frustration of his family, who take refuge elsewhere. I'm thinking, if people can be arsed, we can work on a "Themes" subsection, since they are, when I consider it, rather diverse and complex (I don't want to go at it alone, since I feel it might be rather one-sided)? If anyone wants to start it off, I could comment on that. Anyway, comments on my edit will be most welcome. I also apologise for the horrible title of this talk section, I just couldn't think of anything. --<a href="../../../t/e/e/User%7ETeeks_36ac.html" title="User:Teeks">Teeks</a> 23:59, 12 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have added a few sections. Most importantly, I added a section on theme. The theme was breifly discussed in the introduction and there is a section on films of similar themes, but there is no actual section on the themes. I think the page needed a better examination of the themes, since they are powerful and complex. I also seperated the section called "films on similar themes" into two sections. I did this because in this section there was only one movie mentioned, but two literary influences. I think this makes the section more clear. Also, the literary similarities were based on the way the works influenced the movie, not how they shared similar themes. I also added, quotes, trivia, and audience reaction. I think this is important because I think it is important for the audience to know how popular the movie was both in America and internationally. I only added two quotes, but I think they are the two most powerful quotes from the movie that sum up the themes of the movie very well. There is a lot of trivia that can be found from American Beauty. I think it is very interesting and that readers will enjoy reading this section. Finally, I added a link the amazon.com page for American Beauty, because it has interesting trivia and reviews.</p>

<p>The themes section reads like a gushing review rather than an explanation of the themes. The tone is decidedly unencyclopedic. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>One can say that Carolyn took Kissinger's saying "Power is a great aphrodisiac" too far!</i></li>
<li><i>The movie is marked by splendid performances from Annette Bening, Kevin Spacey, Chris Cooper, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley and Mena Suvari.</i></li>

<dd>I have to disagree with some of the {{fact}} tags. For example, it is pretty obvious that Lester's request for a job with low responsibility is part of his desire to escape the shackles of his daily life. A similar "it's obvious" claim could be made about Carolyn's warning on spilling items on teh sofa, or the presence of roses throughout the film. The causes for Carolyn's affair are made evident in teh film, although I will agree to the other tag in the Adultery section. The other tags in the Themes section probably require quotes from the film, I assume, to give examples? <a href="../../../m/n/b/User%7EMnbf9rca_0e3a.html" title="User:Mnbf9rca">Mnbf9rca</a> 23:58, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Although I do agree that if citations can't be found, these bits of interpretation don't belong here, this should be easy to get around by citing examples of critics who have pretty much all interpreted the more obvious elements, like the roses and the almost-spilled beer, in the same way.

<p>Hi. Just popped in because I noticed the cleanup tag, and am fond of this film. I've added a "reception" section, which I should be able to expand upon eventually, for critical and box office performance. I've got a few unsourced statements in there, but should be about to add citations by later tonight. Right now I'm not in love with the wording of the section prose-wise, so feel free to improve. This is an important film -- I'd love to see it up to featured eventually. -- <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Bailey_63ba.html" title="User:Lee Bailey">Lee Bailey</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELee_Bailey_a8f7.html" title="User talk:Lee Bailey"><font color="black"><i>(talk)</i></font></a></sup> 17:04, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, I realise it's important to include balanced reactions to the film (poor reviews as well as good ones), but for the former, can we do no better than the Village Voice piece? Quite frankly it's a poor piece of criticism, which shows no understanding of the movie or it's stylistic quirks (describing Les Bentley as "wooden", for example), and leaves me with the feeling that the reviewer was hoping for a piece of arty soft porn and was disappointed when the movie turned out to be nothing of the kind.</p>

<dd>I'm surprised the article didn't have anything about the recurring theme of people not being their true selves. It seems to come over and over again. Take that scene where Lester and Carolyn are on the sofa. They nearly become intimate, but it's thrown off by Carolyn's pretensions of materialism as she wanted to keep the couch clean. Also that blonde girl tried over and over again to mask her true self by acting like something she's not. The neighbour masked his sexuality, screwing up everything in his life and his family. Apparently only Lester's daughter and the neighbour's son are the only ones who didn't live masked lives. Lester had a life like that before until he rejected it. His lifestyle of sincerity didn't conform to the standards of pretense that are around him, so since he was incompatible with it, he was killed. J.J. Bustamante 02:02, 20 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>On IMDb, there is a 1927 film called American Beauty, as well. I don't think that one is popular enough to warrant changing the title of this article, though.--<a href="../../../c/2E/l/User%7EC.Logan_5bcc.html" title="User:C.Logan">C.Logan</a> 12:13, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Having seen this on the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Wikipedia%7EThird_Opinion_fd68.html" title="Wikipedia:Third Opinion">Wikipedia:Third Opinion</a> page, and read through the article, this article as it stands gives an <b>extremely</b> detailed, I would venture so far as to say <b>unusually</b> and perhaps even <b>unnecesarily</b> detailed, summation of the plot, almost going scene by scene to do so! I don't think that the only spoilers are at the end of the summary, and while I havn't read the entire <a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia_talk%7ESpoiler_warning_RfC_da82.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Spoiler warning/RfC">Wikipedia talk:Spoiler warning/RfC</a>, I have scanned through it and don't see how the placement of the tag at the beginning of the section violates the "emerging concensus" there. The spoilers definately begin at the beginning of the section.</p>
<p>I would go so far as to say that the section should be dramatically shortened, as such a detailed plot synopsis is not really necessary in an encyclopedia. Reading that I felt like I was watching the movie all over again. <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> 14:47, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think that the themes section needs mention how Lester develops from living an average (and slightly boring) typical american live</p>
<p>"might as well be dead"</p>
<p>to being a happy chappy and living life how he wanted to; like the bit where angela explains that his daughter thinks shes in love and he says "good for her"</p>
<p>and when his wife shags "his majesty" and when he gets tired of doing what people say and when he buys the car hes always wanted to and when he starts smoking pot and stuff</p>
<p>... the phrase "whats the point in living if you dont feel alive" explains it to a tee.</p>
<p>i dont like the fact the way this article is written to make Lester a bad guy; he only wants to be happy and i think this is whats the film is about.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I don't like the fact that the themes part doesn't mention that</p>

<p>The Production and Themes sections need to be converted from lists to prose.

<p>Does anyone besides me think this article needs a "criticism" section. The film has not aged well. Making the marine character a Nazi and a closet homosexual was unfair to that character. And the floating bag schtick, at least in my opinion, was ridiculous. Other films that came out that year, especially "Being John Malokovich," remain very popular, but hardly anyone discusses this film anymore and it isn't rented often.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.139.33.169 (<a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.139.33.169.html" title="User talk:71.139.33.169">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.139.33.169_fbdb.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.139.33.169">contribs</a>).</small></p>
