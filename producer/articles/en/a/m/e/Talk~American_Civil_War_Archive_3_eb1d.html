<p>What a great subject box. Why isnt this on all the CW pages?&#160;:) --<a href="../../../c/u/o/User%7ECuomo111_a3cf.html" title="User:Cuomo111">Cuomo111</a> 10:15, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think of it as a very useful draft, since Hal didn't post it to many pages, and hasn't modified it since posting. When I archived old chat, I just couldn't bear to put it away. I think the text should be smaller, and more items added; the completed box should hold about 50% more items IMHO. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 11:59, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didn't promulgate it too far because I didn't want the inevitable arguments that will result. I am amazed that you think the 113 entries, which include categories of links as well as individual ones, need to be expanded by about 56 more.

<dd>IMHO, the best tack is to bulk up the ACW topics article to an almost unwieldly long list, then use that organic list to define fuller categories and build a more complex box (or perhaps a series of similar, subject-delimited boxes). Many thousands (and perhaps tens of thousands) of articles link to this main page; 113 to 200 links in some sort of box or other template doesn't seem like that many in comparison. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 17:49, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Firsts? Almosts?</span></h2>
<p>I think the two sections Firsts and Almost Firsts are poorly written, but rather than trying to improve them, I'd like to see them deleted. There are probably hundreds of things that happened for the first time during 1861-65, such as Land Grant, Taps, and railroad gauges, so why attempt to do a laundry list in this main article? Why not "First invasion of Pennsylvania town?" "First inauguration of second governor in a state." "First draft riots." "First bearded president." The list goes on and on. The Almost Firsts section is, with all due respect, a joke. Would anyone object to removing these? I'd consider moving them to a new article, but I think it would be just as specious. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 18:07, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My view of the Analysis section is that it contains a blurry graphic, several incomplete sentences, and lots of unsourced personal opinion. The section does contain some significant nuggests, but they're buried under the chaff. It's like a "pin the tail on the donkey" except with user opinions instead of a paper donkey tail. It practically begs a user to stick their own opinion in. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 12:43, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The criticism seems pretty blurry too. It's easy enough to fix "incomplete" sentences once they are pointed out. The goal is to give a consensus of what historians have agreed on (as per McPherson, Berringer, Nevins, Weigley, etc). Is there any statement that does not represent a consensus? If so please identify the exact problem. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 13:10, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since we've entered this arena, almost none of the points are cited. If this is analyis garnered from consensus, then citations should quite easy to come by. The bullet points are not grouped by type (i.e. military, economic, social), so several make virtually identical points. The section is enormously long (IMHO, about twice as long as it needs be.) There is some very asute writing there, I'll admit. I'd just like to see some of that made clear by weeding out some of the growing mischief. I've avoided dealing with this directly, trying to avoid an edit war with strongly opinionated users like yourself. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 13:27, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A process for cleaning each section</span></h2>
<p>Not wanting to use specific circumstances of this morning's (heretofore unprecedented and interim) cooperation between Dr. Jensen and myself, we do seemed to have stumbled onto a process that does make sense and can be endlessly repeated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Step one: Demand citations. If a user feels so strongly they'll go to edit war on a subject, then they should feel at least as strongly about proving assertion with citation.</li>
<li>Step two: Repair basic construction. Fix grammar, spelling, inversion, poor use of negatives, fragments.</li>
<li>Step three: Group like elements. If bullet points, create some overt (or otherwise) structure, then group by that structure. If text, group like statements into rough paragraphs without too much editing. Structure might be by subject, chronological, whatever as long as the grouping makes sense. No matter what, talk about the intended structure in comments so others can follow. Sort of like soccer, where the players are constantly communicating to enable all to see what to do and where to go. We play a lot of herd ball here. All of us.</li>
<li>Step four: Trim, mesh, and blend. Identify duplicate statements, created compound sentences, create coherence. Make sure each paragraph has strong representative statement.</li>
<li>Step five: Wikify and repeat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Does this work? Could we try, maybe breaking down the work by sections? <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 15:11, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow. What a weekend. I can now say I've seen almost everything. Me trying to be less sarcastic, and Dr. Jensen ceding a point on the ACW talk page, all within 24 hours. Good for us. Really, a few of us regulars ought to work up some consensus on the Intro. Our disagreement can be a great strength. I think the intro is about the right physical length now, though I'd like to see 3 or 4 paragraphs built out of that. I think the intro now has TOO much emphasis on narrative. IMHO, I think the first paragraph should be a textbook definition of the conflict, the second and/or third should contain this narrative (and I think link to many major daughter articles), and the final paragraph should say something about legacy. Without getting directly back to wordsmithing, that's what I believe. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 20:12, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Um, the <b>opening paragraph</b> emphasizes/summarizes that the ACW was about <i><b>slavery</b></i>??? Hasn't this been <i>widely</i> debunked by now? It had everything to do with <b>regulation of trade</b>, both interstate (<a href="../../../c/o/m/Commerce_clause.html" title="Commerce clause">commerce clause</a>) and international (<a href="../../../t/a/r/Tariff.html" title="Tariff">tariffs</a>). The anti-slavery angle is severely revisionist history written by the victors. (Obviously slavery was/is a terrible institution, but it was a minor focus, at best, for causes of and conduct in the ACW.) The war was fought largely over <b>states rights</b> versus Federal hegemony. <a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.162.255.58.html" title="User:71.162.255.58">71.162.255.58</a> 02:13, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Upon further inspection, the entire article is heavily slanted towards slavery as the central issue in causing and conducting the war between the states. Please read, <i>Tariffs, Blockades, and Inflation: The Economics of the Civil War</i>, by Mark Thornton and Robert B. Ekelund.

<dd>There are multiple flaws with the above intro: 1) How can a specific number of states be mentioned when that was a changing number (not all joined the CSA at the same time). 2) Their "independence" was not recognized by the USA or most foreign govts, a unqualified inclusion here is deceptive and POV. This issue of the legitimacy of the claim of independence should be addressed in the body of the article, not in the introduction. 3) the GOP was not monolithicly anti-slavery, such a term does not distinguish between anti-slavery expansion (free soil) and abolishing slavery. The intro should be limited to facts not in dispute or requiring further explanation. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature11_bf0f.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature11"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 20:18, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To respond to NoSeptember. A summary has to be very broad and give the main points. The nuances are in the article itself. 1) the details of when each of the 11 joined is fully covered in the article. Fact is there were 11 during for 99% of the war. 2) intro clearly says Lincoln and GOP rejected Confederate independence. That's why the Union fought. 3) yes the GOP was at all times antislavery in terms of its leaders, policies platforms and actions. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 20:27, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lincoln himself called it an invasion. "The words "coercion" and "invasion" are much used in these days, and often with some temper and hot blood. Let us make sure, if we can, that we do not misunderstand the meaning of those who use them. Let us get exact definitions of these words, not from dictionaries, but from the men themselves, who certainly deprecate the things they would represent by the use of words. What, then, is "coercion"? What is "invasion"? Would the marching of an army into South Carolina without the consent of her people, and with hostile intent toward them, be "invasion"? I certainly think it would; and it would be "coercion" also if the South Carolinians were forced to submit. But if the United States should merely hold and retake its own forts and other property, and collect the duties on foreign importations, or even withhold the mails from places where they were habitually violated, would any or all of these things Be "invasion" or "coercion"?

<li>The federal gov't would not ordinarily be said to ever be <i>invading</i> its own country. When the national guard went to Alabama in 1960s, was that an <i>invasion</i>? Was putting down the Whiskey Rebellion an <i>invasion</i>? Do police <i>invade</i> private property when they carry out a raid? For it to clearly be an invasion, it would have to be one country illegally entering another country - but Lincoln never acknowledged any right of secession, nor "the Confederacy" as another country. Likewise, I have avoided calling it a "police action" or "putting down an insurrection". The article should be written in such a way that the reader cannot determine on which side the editors' sympathies might be. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 02:53, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Aside from that, <i>They seceded because they would not join an invasion</i> is pithy prose, which gives editorial commentary and attempts to read the "souls of the South". I am disappointed that you have chosen twice in one day already to revert me without allowing an opportunity to discuss it first.

<dd>"They seceded because they could not join an invasion" is what they said at the time, and what historians have said since. There is no POV on the part of a Wiki editor. (There was plenty of POV in 1861 of course.) The question is asked what is an invasion: the Lincoln quote does in fact define "invasion" in highly authoritative fashion. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 03:38, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lincoln define invasion in Feb and said he did not plan to do that. In April he did exactly that. So if Lincoln calls it an invasion who is Wiki to quibble? The article makes the point that Virginia etc seceded because THEY considered it an invasion. The best history is <i>Reluctant Confederates: Upper South Unionists in the Secession Crisis</i> by Daniel W. Crofts; 1989. He says on April 13-15: (p 334) "Unionists of all descriptions, both those who became Confederates and those who did not, considered the proclamation calling for seventy-five thousand troops "disastrous." Having consulted personally with Lincoln in March, Congressman Horace Maynard, the unconditional Unionist and future Republican from East Tennessee, felt assured that the administration would pursue a peaceful policy.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Soon after April 15, a dismayed Maynard reported that "the President's extraordinary proclamation" had unleashed "a tornado of excitement that seems likely to sweep us all away." Men who had "heretofore been cool, firm and Union loving" had become "perfectly wild" and were "aroused to a phrenzy of passion." For what purpose, they asked, could such an army be wanted "but to invade, overrun and subjugate the Southern states." The growing war spirit in the North further convinced southerners that they would have to "fight for our hearthstones and the security of home." Sounds like fear of invasion to me. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 03:50, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First, <b>please stop</b> the <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_war_dd06.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit war">edit war</a>. Take a day or so break.

I find it fascinating that such an important concept as "coercion" is important enough to discuss here, but not essential to the article (see Kenneth Stamp, <i>And Then The War Came</i> Chapters 2 and 3, and dozens of others which which Dr. Jensen is familiar). Once again, when looking at this article, what we see is a section of onsourced assertions which we're expected to accept because one of us knows the scholarship cold. That's just not good enough for wikipedia, and it's not acceptable here. The section should have at least a dozen citations--the initial section assertions about what historians say is just horse manure without serious sourcing (and I mean <b>recent</b> and I mean a <b>serious</b> figure). Any one user's expertise/authority is meaningless here unless they demonstrate that on the page in question (and by demonstrate I mean prove, not assert). I demand citation; then we can work out petty detail like exact construction. Removing the POV tags will occur when the whole section is cited and consensus is reached. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 14:17, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suggest NPOVing the whole article is just wrong. If someone has a problem with sources for a sentence or paragraph, then say so, Otherwise it's just a generic disgust that is inarticulate and unhelpful. in this case one user was upset about the "invasion" of the South in 1861. He did original research or a sort to show the term is useless, but missed Lincoln's very apt definition. When that deifinition was provided he slapped NPOV on the whole article, as a sign of frustration. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 14:21, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The temporary application of a temporary NPOV tag to an article does the content zero harm, and attracts the attention of others who may wish to assist in solving the problem (like myself and others). The NPOV tag carries no negative connotation unless one wishes to grant it such weight. Work the problem, not the transaction. This is like the Peer review argument; just because one user doesn't agree with the process doesn't (and shouldn't) negate the effectiveness of such a process. Just because one user thinks a section "is just fine" is no serious argument to justify removal of an attention flag. I don't actually care who's correct here gentlemen; but I do insist that each step is a step <b>forward</b>. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 14:30, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't agree that this is my problem, I'm merely reponding to a community need (as are you and others). I've demanded citations for all those unsourced assertions. You've responded by throwing sand in the bull's eyes, by (and just like a professor too) throwing a massive bulk of reading with which you apparently expect each reader of the page to be familiar. If you can prove your assertions, cite them for the community, on the page, and not to me. As I've already stated, I don't care about the particulars here, but might be greatly concerned that asking for citations on a controversial section constituted a personal problem between me and another user. Truth is: there are few personal problems between any user and Dr. Jensen he doesn't bring on by his frequent impetuous, reckless, and presumptuous action.

<dd>There are no controversial points that are being asserted--all of them are covered in every major college history textbook. If people don't want to read the books, then 1) at least read McPherson or 2) any recent general American history textbook. No one who refuses to do that can be a serious editor of a serious history article. Much fuller detail on all points appears in McPherson, <i>Battle Cry</i> (1988) and Donald's Civil War and Reconstruction. (2001) Use the index. The slavery issue appears on several hundred different pages in the McPherson book-- even a narrow topic like Fugutve Slave appears on over 30 pages: 40 61 65 71 72 75 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 103 117 119 120 121 129 201 203 204 224 227 228 237 251 256 262 355 497 498 852 861 870 etc I think we can assume our users can use the index and do not need all these page numbers. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 15:16, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"...don't quibble so much..."</span></h2>
<p>Now we've really stepped over a line. Demanding specific citation for controversial assertion is the heart of Wikipedia and one reason many people grow to trust it as a source. Demanding citation is by no means "quibbling." One reason many still fail to trust this pedia is that some readers recognize that often wiki editors are more interested in expressing their own point of view than conveying objective truth, and might even fail to properly cite assertions they make. What you propose is that every reader of this page must either have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Already read a college-level textbook on this subject</li>
<li>Trust that contributors like you and I have done so</li>
</ul>
<p>That's just not acceptable, Richard, and as an academic I'm surprised at your resentful attitude over being forced to write citation for articles when you've spent a career demanding just those citations from students and collegues. We demand citation here at Wikipedia, and if you can help bring that to the table, more power to you. Just stop trying to change the subject by suggesting every reader must have <i>prerequisite</i> knowledge; that's the opposite of what this knowledge platform is designed to do. <a href="../../../b/u/s/User%7EBusterD_6ff3.html" title="User:BusterD">BusterD</a> 15:37, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

The best is some half-remembered high school lesson or maybe a TV show. There are lots of people like that, but should they be editing an encyclopedia???

<dd>You continue to steer the conversation away from your failure to provide exact citation, and toward the implied failings of imaginary others. I got involved because I believe this is an important page to present correctly. I didn't get involved because I disagree with any of the subject matter you and others were discussing, and while I have a certain general competence on the subject matter, none of that is at issue. What is at issue is your tendency to insert (often poorly worded) general assertion without specific reference links for verification. When pressed, your answer is a non-specific "none of you is as expert as I." That's not a wikipedian answer, it's the answer of someone who would do better on their own private page. Here you must defend your positions or watch them fail to stand public peer review.

<p>The article contains the following - Cotton diplomacy proved a failure. The British had ample stocks of cotton but they depended on Union grain shipments for their daily food supply.</p>
<p>I'm not sure that this statement is very well supported. The British at the time had Australia and Canada as large grain producing colonies as well as it's traditionaly large native production, so it seems unlikely that the British food supply depended on Northen US production.

<dd>The Pressly book shows the ups and downs of the argument, paying attention to the region. The topic was approached very differently in the South, in New England, in the Midwest, andin African-American schools, for example. The mainline textbooks by 1940 had pretty well dropped slavery (or referenced it in terms of the abolitionists starting the war). At the high schools and college I attended in the 1950s slavery was barely mentioned. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 17:19, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>To discuss it at length, indicating what positions are held and by whom. I don't think this will fit here.</li>
<li>To indicate that it is controversial, and elide it, as the paragraph on slavery as a cause now does, as discussed in the previous section.</li>
<li>To leave it entirely for a different article, since it is not part of the history of the war.</li>

<dd>I fixed up the grammar a bit. The abolitionists hit a "hot button" in the 1840s that really got people riled up. Wiki should explain the hot button was making the issue not a debate between better or worse, but one between heaven and hell (to use the language of that era). The goal of course is to state this in NPOV fashion. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 09:16, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>NPOV means letting Garrison speak for himself. Yes, abolitionists were militant. But you can't ask people to trust a statement that sounds like a point of view. And Garrison stated his point of view forcefully enough. And quoting it with a reference lets people know that this is a fact that can be looked up and verified, not just an opinion.</p>

<p>Does someone have a problem with covering the abolitionists in depth? The key factor was their use of religion/sin as the charge against the South, which made the Southerners very angry indeed.

<li>They also said it was morally wrong &amp; that also offended the South. And in those days few distinguished sin from immorality. Was the South more upset that the abolitionists thought slave-owners would be eternally damned, or that they thought they were immoral? I ask, not because I suppose an answer could be given, but to point out just how difficult it is to present this to a modern reader (for whom the meaning of "sin" has changed somewhat since then). Although at the time there would have been few on either side who would have drawn much distinction between the terms, focussing on "sinfulness" does not really address many modern readers. It seems more like a belittling of the abolitionists - as though they should not have made the accusation, because it hurt the feelings of slave-owners. --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 03:27, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>You added some interesting facts at the top, and facts are good. But do people keep telling you to avoid POV issues? Also, southerners who thought slavery was wrong were not the leaders of secession, the editors of the Charleston Mercury or Debow's Review and so on. That point needs to be made clear if you're going to raise the issue at all. And I've read many, many books on the Civil War and haven't found one that says that abolitionists were THE cause of the civil war. Also, who was more at fault for raising the issue of sin, abolitionists or slave owners? Assuming the former is problematic.<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmuldrow_922e.html" title="User:Jimmuldrow">Jimmuldrow</a> 03:39, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wiki should not call slavery a sin. (I think in the 1850s "immoral" and "sin" meant the same). Wiki should say that abolitionists kept the issue alive and made the Southerners angry by calling slavery a sin. A lot of historians have argued this prevented any compromises and helped start the war (Pressly covers them in detail). The Southerners kept saying solething like: <i>Lincoln is almost = John Brown and we can't be in the same country as those abolitionist-republicans. So we have to leave.</i> Was this the main cause of secession? well I think it was fairy important. Secondly the abolitionist value system deeply affected a lot of religious northerners, who increasingly agreed that slavery was a sin. That kept the pot boiling in the North, pressuring Republicans not to compromise on issues like Kansas. (The Protestant religious types were heavily GOP) So yes it is important (and other factor are important too--Wiki should not try to say that factor A was 25%, factor B was 20%, etc.) As for modern readers: whether a 2006 reader believes in sin is irrelevant. The war was caused back in 1860 and most folks at that time certainly talked like they believed in sin.<a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 04:39, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Any statement on the Civil War saying that "most historians agree" is likely to be wrong; this one is more likely than most. Some Northerners were saying that slavery was a sin since the Quakers in the 1760's; the difference with the abolitionists is that they might actually have ended the sin, and the slave-holders' capital assets with it. As for Rjensen's sources: You should read them; I have just finished analysing his sources on <a href="../../../a/b/o/Talk%7EAbolitionism_c443.html" title="Talk:Abolitionism">Talk:Abolitionism</a> and finding that they do not sy what he says they do. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 21:45, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>JimWae is unable to cite a single source--we don't allow his original research in Wiki. My sources? I keep giving them. here's yet another. McPherson says: <i>a wave of Protestant revivals known as the Second Great Awakening swept the country during the first third of the nineteenth century. In New England, upstate New York, and those portions of the Old Northwest above the 41st parallel populated by the descendants of New England Yankees, this evangelical enthusiasm generated a host of moral and cultural reforms. The most dynamic and divisive of them was abolitionism. Heirs of the Puritan notion of collective accountability that made every man his brother's keeper, these Yankee reformers repudiated Calvinist predestination, preached the availability of redemption to anyone who truly sought it, urged converts to abjure sin, and worked for the elimination of sins from society. The most heinous social sin was slavery. All people were equal in God's sight; the souls of black folks were as valuable as those of whites; for one of God's children to enslave another was a violation of the Higher Law, even if it was sanctioned by the Constitution.</i> (Battle Cry p 8)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I am a believer in that portion of the Declaration of American Independence in which it is set forth, as among self-evident truths, "that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Hence, I am an abolitionist. Hence, I cannot but regard oppression in every form – and most of all, that which turns a man into a thing – with indignation and abhorrence. Not to cherish these feelings would be recreancy to principle. They who desire me to be dumb on the subject of slavery, unless I will open my mouth in its defense, ask me to give the lie to my professions, to degrade my manhood, and to stain my soul. I will not be a liar, a poltroon, or a hypocrite, to accommodate any party, to gratify any sect, to escape any odium or peril, to save any interest, to preserve any institution, or to promote any object. Convince me that one man may rightfully make another man his slave, and I will no longer subscribe to the Declaration of Independence. Convince me that liberty is not the inalienable birthright of every human being, of whatever complexion or clime, and I will give that instrument to the consuming fire. I do not know how to espouse freedom and slavery together.</dd>

<p>RJ, Slave owners used to believe that slavery was ordained by God and would last forever. Jefferson Davis thought he was religious and said his prayers. Both factions thought that God was on their side. The prayers of both could not be answered.</p>
<p>The point isn't which side accused the other of sin. They both accused each other of sin. The point is that you're taking sides. You want us to believe that the morality of slave owners was right and that the morality of abolitionists was wrong.</p>
<p>I think the entire abolition article would have been ok if all the points of view were left out. Your opinions were your own and belong in a blog, not Wikopedia.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blatant Bias in this Article</span></h2>
<p>This article shows much bias, starting with the title. There are three different names for this war, and only one of them is mentioned. Of the three titles, the least biased is "The War Between the States" and as such, that is what should be used despite "The American Civil War" being in more common usage. Calling the war "The American Civil War" inherently takes the position that seccession was illegal and that the war was not the invasion of one country by another. By contrast, calling the war "The War of Northern Aggression" inherently takes the position that seccession was legal and that the war was the invasion of one country by another. Calling it "The War Between the States" takes neither position and is the most neutral of the three posibilities. Worst of all is that the article fails to even mention the other two commonly used names for the war. This is just the first example of many, but the article shows a distinct pro-union, anti-confederacy bias throughout. As such, I am adding a non-NPOV tag. - AlexMc 05:51, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Welcome to Wikipedia AlecMc! You have some excellent points, but if you'd take the time to look at talk archive pages, you'lll see this has been a subject of much previous discussion. The <a href="../../../n/a/m/Naming_the_American_Civil_War_8102.html" title="Naming the American Civil War">naming of the war</a> has become the subject of its own article (<a href="../../../n/a/m/Naming_the_American_Civil_War_8102.html" title="Naming the American Civil War">qv</a>).

<dd>That separate article doesn't change a thing. Sure it's wonderful that if someone really looks through the Civil War information on this site, they'll find it, but it doesn't change the fact that this article is flat out biased and that by not mentioning the bias anywhere within THIS article, Wikipedia is effectively endorsing this bias as fact. Whether issues are addressed on other pages or not is entirely irrelevant to the bias of this specific page, and the average person that does a search for the American Civil War is going to find this page, read it and leave having only read biased information without being informed that it is so. This is completely and totally unacceptable. The goal should be to eliminate or make bias clear, not mention it in a single quote on a different page. If no one wants to go through and fix the bias, that's fine, but until the time that someone does, bias tags absolutely must be present. AlexMc 06:21, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The quote <i>is</i> from Nevins; but it is a discussion of the <i>Fugitive Slave Act</i>, and is a discussion of the fact that the Northern press condemned it almost unanimously. They did not unanimously support abolition; the converse would be nearer to the truth. Its present location is therefore a <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">novel synthesis</a>.</li>
<li>Rjensen has now sourced much of the rest of his opinions to the controversial scholars Genovese and Fox-Genovese.

<ul>
<li>But Rjensen has managed to exaggerate even their views; what the Genoveses say is that the first generation of abolitionists "did not demonize" slaveholders because they knew some; but that ""later generations tended to see <i>all</i> slaveholders as infamous". This is still disputable, but it is not what the text says. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 18:27, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What Pressly actually says</span></h2>
<p>The following sentence (sourced to Pressly, 289-329) is a misrepresentation of its source.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Many historians have argued that the intense moralism of the abolitionists, coupled with the intransigent reaction of the slaveowners, made disunion more likely and compromise much more difficult to attain</i></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The pages discuss Stampp and Nevins, at some length.
<ul>
<li>The discussion of Stampp says that he is an exception, a revisionist mature after 1914; Pressly conjectures there may be others, but sees none.</li>
<li>Pressly also denied that Stampp thought compromise worth attaining.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The whole seciton on Nevin and the reaction to him is entitled "A Confusion of Voices", which describes Pressly's view of his present. Summarizing this as <i>Many historians think X</i> without even <i>Many also think Y</i> is not serious scholarship.</li>
<li>Pressly ends his summary of Nevins' view with;
<dl>
<dd><i>enduring peace between North and South depended on some step which would have marked the beginning of the end of the institution of slavery</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Pressly never describes Nevins as deprecating "moralism" ("emotionalism", yes)
<ul>
<li>Instead he quotes Nevins as unsympathetic to Stephen Douglas as of "dim moral perception"</li>
<li>and as saying that "All hope of bringing Southern majority sentiment to a better attitude would have been lost if Lincoln and his party had flinched on the basic issue of the restriction of slavery."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think removing this sentence may improve the section to the point where the tags can be reconsidered; but JimWae should make that decision. This overall article should not endorse any judgment, however credentialled, whether Stampp's Nevins' or McPherson's; it should have a separate section, or article, on "Historical opinions".

<p>If abolitionists were content to have the slave states leave the US, this indicates they were more concerned with their own involvement in the sin (via the fugitive slave laws), rather than the condemnation/salvation of slave-owners. Surely somebody who reads a lot of history books could find a source that "points this out". Btw, there is no citation for the 2nd Great Awakening being responsible for abolitionism - was that awakening about the sins of others or about one's own? --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimWae_0457.html" title="User:JimWae">JimWae</a> 04:26, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was Nevins that did the original research, not a Wiki editor. He was talking about the abolitionist issues (esp treatment of slaves and fugitive slaves). JimWae is speculating about the motives of the aboltiionists--no need for that as we have several long quotes from top historians like McPherson and Stampp. The 2nd great awakening cite is from McPherson Battle Cry p. 8 (which is included already: McPherson says regarding the causes of the war
<dl>
<dd>"Meanwhile, a wave of Protestant revivals known as the Second Great Awakening swept the country during the first third of the nineteenth century. In New England, upstate New York, and those portions of the Old Northwest above the 41st parallel populated by the descendants of New England Yankees, this evangelical enthusiasm generated a host of moral and cultural reforms. The most dynamic and divisive of them was abolitionism. Heirs of the Puritan notion of collective ccountability that made every man his brother's keeper, these Yankee reformers repudiated Calvinist predestination, preached the availability of redemption to anyone who truly sought it, urged converts to abjure sin, and worked for the elimination of sins from society. The most heinous social sin was slavery. All people were equal in God's sight; the souls of black folks were as valuable as those of whites; for one of God's children to enslave another was a violation of the Higher Law, even if it was sanctioned by the institution. By midcentury this antislavery movement had gone into politics and had begun to polarize the country."

<p>For the record, Pressly (so spelt; p. 290) describes Stampp as a "revisionist" historian whose view was that the logical and reasonable policy was for the North to acquiesce in "peaceful separation" in 1861; Rjensen's quotations from McPherson are in the same vein, although this is partly selective quotation again. These views are not consensus; although they are a rather larger and more respectable PoV than the Genoveses (who are, of course, too late for a book published in 1962.) <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 17:17, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The answer to JimWae's question is clear from the citation from Irving Bartlett; "Wendell Phillips: Brahmin Radical" p.56, which quotes three abolitionists ( Francis Jackson, Theodore Parker, Angelica Grimke) as</p>
<ul>
<li>wishing to perish in the cause and be persecuted for righteousness' sake</li>
<li>to make "atonement for his own sins, and his father's sins, against the Negro".</li>
</ul>
<p>Citing Bartlett as the text does ( <i>Historian Irving Bartlett remarks that it was an intense awareness of the sin of slavery that set abolitionists apart from others and made them appear fanatical</i>) is misleading to an extent difficult to reconcile with the assumption of good faith. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 18:43, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><s>Bartlett does not (here at least) use the word <i>fanatical</i>;</s> he uses "enthusiasm", but I see no reason to assume he shares Gibbon's PoV.</li>

Jensen paraprased it: "Historian Irving Bartlett remarks that <b>it was an intense awareness of the sin of slavery that set abolitionists apart from others and made them appear fanatical.</b>" I think that paraphrase is pretty close to Bartlett's intention--and a good summary of what helped cause the Civil War (which is what we are concerned with). <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 00:38, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The sins here are those of Jackson and his father, not of the slaveholders of the South. English could scarcely be plainer, but Bartlett continues (after discussing Henry Wright, who thought the air of <i>Boston Harbor</i> tainted with slavery):</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Thus "the epithets and stone and rotten eggs, the near lynchings and the broken bones that antislavery lecture[r]s encountered in their ministry were not only welcomed but invited. It was blessed to be persecuted for righteousness' sake and the abolitionists constantly saw themselves in the martyr's role. 'Blessed are they who die in the harness' wrote the crusading Theodore Dwight Weld 'and are buried in the field of bleach there'. And the woman he married, Angelica Grimké, once said, 'A <i>hope</i> gleams across my mind, that our blood will be spilled, instead of those of the slaveholders; <i>our</i> lives will be taken, and theirs spared.'"</dd>

<p>The best chance for Confederate victory was entry into the war by Britain and France.

<p><a name="Revisionism" id="Revisionism"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Revisionism</span></h2>
<p>Thomas Pressly divides historians of the causes and character of the Civil War into several classifications; one of these is the "revisionists". Their characteristic positions are</p>
<ul>
<li>That the war was not inevitable, but was the result of emotionalism.</li>
<li>That the positions of the South were basically reasonable.</li>
<li>Slavery was not an important issue; it would have died out anyway.</li>
<li>That, therefore, what should have happened was either (depending on the historian) either compromise on Southern terms before the war, or the North's acknowledgement of peaceful separation.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a defensible point of view; clearly some of our present editors agree with it. But it is not consensus; there is no consensus.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this article quotes Randall, Stampp, and the Genoveses for matters of judgment (as opposed to matters of fact: there was a Kansas-Nebraska Act, an incident at Fort Sumter, a battle at Gettysburg, and such-and-such things happened there).</p>
<p>It also quotes Nevins and McPherson. Nevins agrees that the war was not inevitable; he thinks, however, that the South should have compromised, and made arrangements for gradual emancipation. McPherson supports a more complicated synthesis. <i>This article only cites them for points on which they agree with the revisionists</i>. This will not do.</p>
<p>I see two basic solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trim back the discussion of causes of the war to those things on which all schools agree, and put the judgments on the war (all the judgments) into <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origins_of_the_American_Civil_War_71dc.html" title="Origins of the American Civil War">Origins of the American Civil War</a>.
<ul>
<li>This won't leave much, but this <i>is</i> an overview.
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../o/r/i/Origins_of_the_American_Civil_War_71dc.html" title="Origins of the American Civil War">Origins of the American Civil War</a> is worse than this article; it still contains the one-sided quote from McPherson endorsing the Southern right to secede. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 13:14, 21 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps a "one-sided quote" from someone else endoring the Southern right to secede would be better: "Any people anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the right to rise up and shake off the existing government, and form a new one that suits them better. This is a most valuable, a most sacred right - a right which we hope and believe is to liberate the world. Nor is this right confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing government, may choose to exercise it. Any portion of such people that can, may revolutionize, and make their own, of so much territory as they inhabit." - Abraham Lincoln AlexMc 22:59, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<dd>Another solution is for interested people to read the historiography, and not rely on half-century old Pressly. (He is superb to 1950...but times do change). There is no reason for Wiki to take sides for or against secession; our job is to lay out the major factors that historians in the last 50 years have dealt with. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 02:46, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>When Pressly can be cited to Rjensen's purpose, he is "unusually good" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:American_Civil_War&amp;diff=62226373&amp;oldid=62225199" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:American_Civil_War&amp;diff=62226373&amp;oldid=62225199" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></li>
<li>When one quotes what he actually says, he becomes 50-year old Pressly, who can be ignored.</li>
<li>I have no doubts, from Jensen's performance, that if I had quoted Randall, Stampp, and Nevins on my own authority, it would be dismissed as OR. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 12:43, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I like it; it's certainly better than adopting the positions of one school of historians.

<p>Answers.com has an older version of the American Civil War Wikipedia page with Jensen's "militant" abolitionists. Very similar. It starts with</p>
<p>"By the 1830s, a small but outspoken abolitionist movement arose, led by New Englanders and free blacks, including William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, and Lucretia Mott. Many people North and South considered slavery an undesirable institution, but by the 1840s the militant abolitionists went much further and declared that owning a slave was a terrible sin, and that the institution should be immediately abolished. Southerners bitterly resented this moralistic attack."</p>

<p>The basic problem with Revisionists is that while they present very good arguments for why slavery wasn't a major cause of the war actually starting, they fail to point out that it was most certainly the cause of the war continuing and the South's eventual loss. Had the South abolished slavery on their own, they would have likely received military support from England and it would have eviscerated the popularity of the North.

<p>I think you'll all agree that this subject material is important enough not to be coloured by this behind-the-scenes conflict. My $0.02. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_Gadarn_2814.html" title="User:Hu Gadarn">Hu Gadarn</a> 18:39, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, it is important enough not to present a factional interpretation; but I see a way of resolving this. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 14:20, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Core Abolitionist policy was "immediate emancipation" -- but what did that mean?</span></h2>
<p>Russel Nye explains: "The beginnings of "immediate" emancipation, more popularly referred to simply as abolition, may be approximately dated from the appearance of William Lloyd Garrison Liberator in 1831. "I stand," said Garrison in his first number, "for the immediate enfranchisement of our slave population." ... As interpreted by him, immediatism involved no real practical plan; it consisted of freeing Negro slaves, and that only. The various economic, social, and political problems incidental to their emancipation never caught his interest. ... The New York Anti Slavery Society, organized in 1833, officially adopted a modified version, "immediate emancipation, gradually accomplished," a compromise difficult to understand and equally difficult to publicize. The American Anti-Slavery Society, organized later in the same year, adopted the New York doctrine....In the West, the Lane Seminary group, led by Theodore Weld, redefined the term as "gradual emancipation, immediately begun," a refini tion eventually accepted by the national society as meaning that "the slaves be at once delivered from the control of arbitrary and irresponsible power, and, like other men, put under the control of equitable laws, equitably administered." from <i>Fettered Freedom: Civil Liberties and the Slavery Controversy, 1830-1860</i> by Russel B. Nye - 1949. pp 4-5. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 18:48, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Rjensen could have been clearer. What his source actually says is that the estreme "immediate emancipation" was Garrison's doctrine <i>alone</i>. Other anti-slavery groups saw the problems and adopted various modified slogans, which he explains as meaning (I quote almost exactly)
<ul>
<li>the legal control of the owner should cease;</li>
<li>the slave should be able to sell his labor in the open market</li>
<li>and he should be under a "benevolent and disinterested supervision" until he was ready for equality. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 22:22, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The latest edit</span></h2>
<p>Rjensen has several new sources <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Civil_War&amp;diff=65107974&amp;oldid=65060970" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Civil_War&amp;diff=65107974&amp;oldid=65060970" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>&#160;; none of them support his perennial claim that <i>On the whole they did not have a religious base for their position and did not morally blame individual slaveowners;</i> no one does. The only source cited which even approaches this is the Genoveses; and they don't say it, any more than they did yesterday. (And the citation from McPherson is clearly wrong: p.3 is about Chapultepec; I presume he means p. 31, which does discuss abolitionists, but still doesn't support the contested sentence.)</p>
<p>I also note that two of the books he cites are from 1949 and 1951 (actually 1943). Perhaps we will hear no more comments dismissing 50-year old sources. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 00:11, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
