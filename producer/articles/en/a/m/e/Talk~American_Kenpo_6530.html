<p>American Kenpo is a system of Martial Arts.</p>
<p>The founder of the American Kenpo system is Edmund K. Parker. He is also credited for the founding of the EPAK system which are the first letters of his name and American Kenpo. He learned his Martial Arts from an Instructor in the Hawaiian Islands. His name was William Chow. Professor Chow was the main force regarding the the Kenpo that was to be known as American Kenpo.</p>
<p>Professor Chow never called his art "American Kenpo", his art later came to be known as Kara-Ho Kempo<a href="http://www.karaho.com/history.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.karaho.com/history.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. (with an 'M') The current Grandmaster of Karaho is Sam Alama Kuoha. Kara-Ho Kempo is markedly different from Ed Parker's American Kenpo Karate (also known as EPAK). EPAK is largely the brainchild of Ed Parker and resembles little of what Profesor Chow taught.</p>

<p>"some Chinese instructors were “secretive” about their methodologies, and rarely taught non-Chinese. As a native Polynesian, however, Parker was embraced by many of the available Chinese Masters" This bit doesn't really make much sense. Polynesians aren't Chinese. Maybe we should say that they rarely taught non-Asians?</p>

<p>Needs some work to be NPOV. The "motion" references are all straight from SL4 terminology, and could be considered to be somewhat biased, however true they may be. The excessive use of quote marks (common to much Kenpo writing) need toning down, and the prose needs loosening up a little and making accessible to non-Kenpo people.</p>

<p>I've done a little to make it less biased. Still needs extensive cites, particularly for the criticism of "motion kenpo".</p>

<dd>Perhaps we should adopt the approach Kevin Kuliga used in his <a href="http://www.chinesekaratefederation.com/articles.html" class="external text" title="http://www.chinesekaratefederation.com/articles.html" rel="nofollow">article</a> on this subject for the <a href="http://www.chinesekaratefederation.com" class="external text" title="http://www.chinesekaratefederation.com" rel="nofollow">Chinese Karate Federation</a>. He described the system Grandmaster Parker used, and then mentioned briefly the reasons why some schools use different belt colors for the degrees of brown belt. We could accomplish this with the addition of a single sentence or two to the existing description. We owe it to Wikipedia readers to be more complete on this subject, in my opinion. - <a href="../../../s/y/b/User%7ESyberghost_ec6f.html" title="User:Syberghost">Syberghost</a> 13:43, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>While I understand that Ed Parker Sr. is the Senior Grand Master of American Kenpo, I think his background information should be limited to the Wikipedia entry about him. It's OK to include a little, but let's try to keep the American Kenpo page a description of the art and not of Mr. Parker.</p>

<p>I can understand why some of these people (e.g. Elvis Presley, Jeff Speakman) are listed as notable students of Mr. Parker, but why are the others there?</p>

<p><br />
I'm taking out most of the "notable students." Please discuss here before adding more. It looks like people are just adding their own instructors to the list (and advertising some web sites). Just because they are an instructor and trained under Mr. Parker doesn't make them notable.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharleca_b71e.html" title="User:Charleca">Charleca</a> 14:00, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think practitioners like Trejo, Planas, Kelley, La Tourrette, etc. should have remained. They're not movie stars, but in the American Kenpo community, they're notable. JN322 07:31, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I concur...but then the list grows as every passerby adds his or her instructor (out of alphabetical error and redlinked). Linking to a list of Kenpo instructors might be preferable. By the way, the stuff about Speakman and Presley is well-known and well-attested...does it really need an inline reference here? <a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJL_7200.html" title="User:JJL">JJL</a> 12:43, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Should we add <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blake_Edwards_35fd.html" title="Blake Edwards">Blake Edwards</a> as a "well-known" student? Mr. Parker mentions him in Infinite Insights into Kenpo: Mental Stimulation. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharleca_b71e.html" title="User:Charleca">Charleca</a> 18:05, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't believe <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blake_Edwards_35fd.html" title="Blake Edwards">Blake Edwards</a> continues to practice American Kenpo (I could be wrong), whereas Jeff Speakman does and Elvis trained until his death. Trejo, Planas, Kelley, La Tourrette, and Tatum are big names in the Kenpo community and should have remained. I added inline references for Jeff Speakman and Elvis, although I agree that they aren't really needed. However, a style is a style and should be adhered to. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhillipHaddox_5bfd.html" title="User:PhillipHaddox">PhillipAlexHaddox</a> 19:21, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>In a Black Belt Magazine article, July 1979, page 27, Sr. Grand Master Parker listed the following people as his protégés. He called them "insiders with whom he has shared the full scope of his knowledge." Those people were <b>Larry Tatum</b> (selected as "key protégé"), <b>Tom Kelly</b> and <b>Joe Palanzo</b>. These gentlemen should definitely be placed back on the list. -- <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhillipHaddox_5bfd.html" title="User:PhillipHaddox">PhillipAlexHaddox</a> 16:39, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hmm, what about a separate article "Notable American Kenpoists" (which we could link to at the bottom of this article), where we can give descriptions about these people. That way we don't have to make the AK article too long. And just some periodic checking to keep "Bob that green belt I know" off the list.&#160;:) JN322 17:05, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'll go along with that, it provides a place for info on individuals not notable enough for their own article but of some interest, and saves arguments as a brief description of why they are notable in kenpo cycles --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENate1481_d292.html" title="User:Nate1481">Nate1481</a> 15:24, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm also fine with this. But then we would still have the same problem of some joe coming by and adding his own instructor. I would much rather see a list of notable students of Kenpo (not just Mr. Parker's direct students) with a short description of WHY they are notable in this article. I also think that just because they are an 8th degree black belt doesn't make them notable either. So far it looks like Larry Tatum may be "qualified" to be on this list.--<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharleca_b71e.html" title="User:Charleca">Charleca</a> 15:26, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>NOTICE THAT THE LIST NOW SAYS OTHER STUDENT OF ED PARKER, NOT NOTABLE STUDENTS. THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE TRAINED BY ED PARKER AND CARED GREATLY FOR HIM AND HIS TEACHING. PEOPLE WHO STILL FOLLOW HIS TEACHINGS AND PASS THEM ON TO OTHERS WHO WISH TO BE TOUGHT HIS BELOVED ART OF SELF-DEFENCE, AND FOR THAT ALONE THE SHOULD REMAIN ON THE LIST.

<dd>jedidave42, I don't think anyone here is opposed to adding these individuals as long as we can provide a reason WHY they are on the list. Things will go a lot more smoothly if we discuss those reason here before adding them. We just want to make sure people aren't just adding some Mr. Joe Instructor (or even themselves) just because they have a black belt or they take a class with them. I do not want to see an edit war going on here. Please cooperate with us and discuss here before adding any more and please stop with the personal attacks (assuming that you are 71.133.30.222 - if you are not, I apologize). -- <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharleca_b71e.html" title="User:Charleca">Charleca</a> 21:48, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looking at how <i>style</i> is used at, e.g., <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karate.html" title="Karate">Karate</a> and <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kung_Fu_921b.html" title="Kung Fu">Kung Fu</a> (which have lists of <i>styles</i> that are named arts like <a href="../../../g/o/j/Goju_Ryu_014e.html" title="Goju Ryu">Goju Ryu</a>, not personal expressions), it looks like people are taking this line from the Martial Arts Project to heart: "These are <i>only</i> suggestions, things to give you focus and to get you going, and you <i>shouldn't</i> feel obligated in the least to follow them." I think it's best to revert it back so it's consistent with actual practice and common use of language, not the idiosyncratic use of the terms within Kenpo. <a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJL_7200.html" title="User:JJL">JJL</a> 13:44, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just my POV but the Goju Ryu article seems to back this up, it's a specific way of doing Karate, i.e. a style of the system of karate. (Art &amp; System seem to be synonyms in this case) But the debate is; Is this a specific way of doing <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenpo.html" title="Kenpo">Kenpo</a>, or is it a separate system which just shares a name. I have never trained in <i>any</i> Kenpo so don't know which but I'm assuming the latter from what I've read, he says it's taken stuff from other arts, so it it would be a hybrid art but using an old name. --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENate1481_d292.html" title="User:Nate1481">Nate</a> 13:54, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, there are certainly variants of it like Tracy's Kenpo for example. I'm looking at entries like <a href="../../../s/t/y/Styles_of_Chinese_martial_arts_8b25.html" title="Styles of Chinese martial arts">Styles of Chinese martial arts</a> that use <i>style</i> in the usual manner--a specific martial art, not an individual human's interpretation of it. Two people who both practice Okinawan Goju-Ryu Karate-Do Shobukan both practice the same <i>style</i> of martial art, even if they do so with characteristic flair. I think this is the everyday usage of the term. <a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJL_7200.html" title="User:JJL">JJL</a> 17:40, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it was decided on as a convention for wiki, (Then the world! ) so unless there is an active objection, i.e. the practitioner or someone else involved directly then we might as well stick to that, won't change again but it was worth discussing. --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENate1481_d292.html" title="User:Nate1481">Nate</a> 09:43, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a practitioner, I really prefer the term "system" - but I know this isn't MY article. If you want to be super-correct, we would say that it is the American <i>style</i> of the Kenpo <i>system</i>. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharleca_b71e.html" title="User:Charleca">Charleca</a> 12:39, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fixed, as I said, not up on the differences, I understand there difference and origin are a matter of debate, <a href="../../../k/e/m/Kempo.html" title="Kempo">Kempo</a> redirects to <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenpo.html" title="Kenpo">Kenpo</a> so didn't differentiate, but what your saying supports the fact that it is a system not a style, regardless of merits --<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENate1481_d292.html" title="User:Nate1481">Nate</a> 15:54, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
