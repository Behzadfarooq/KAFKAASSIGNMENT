	    <p>The <b>American Task Force on Palestine</b> (ATFP) was founded in 2003 in order to provide an independent Palestinian-American voice in the United States and its capital, Washington, DC. The founding aim of ATFP is to advocate an end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict through the creation of a Palestinian state that will live alongside Israeli in peace. ATFP categorically and unequivocally condemns all violence directed against civilians no matter who the victims or perpetrators may be. ATFP’s founder and President is Dr. Ziad J. Asali and its Executive Director is Rafi Dajani.</p>

<p>In late 2003, ATFP began its work on advocacy in behalf of peace. In early 2004, the Task Force helped promote and publicize the <a href="http://www.geneva-accord.org" class="external text" title="http://www.geneva-accord.org" rel="nofollow">“Geneva Accords“</a> in the United States. In November, 2004, AFTP President Ziad Asali served as a member of the United States official delegation to the funeral of Chairman Yasser Arafat. He subsequently served as a member of the United States official delegation to observe the Palestinian Presidential elections in January 2005. On February 10, 2005, <a href="http://www.americantaskforce.org/testimony.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.americantaskforce.org/testimony.pdf" rel="nofollow">Asali testified</a> before a full committee hearing of the House International Relations Committee on “the way forward in the Middle East peace process.” (Asali was also a delegate with the National Democratic Institute (NDI) to monitor the Palestinian Legislative election in January 2006. In February 2006 ATFP issued its <a href="http://www.americantaskforce.org/vision.php" class="external text" title="http://www.americantaskforce.org/vision.php" rel="nofollow">vision for a Palestinian state</a>, first published in the New York Times.</p>
<p>On October 11, 2006, ATFP held its first annual <a href="http://www.americantaskforce.org/gala/" class="external text" title="http://www.americantaskforce.org/gala/" rel="nofollow">gala</a> in Washington, DC, featuring keynote speaker Dr. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condoleezza_Rice_57ca.html" title="Condoleezza Rice">Condoleezza Rice</a>, also addressed by <a href="http://www.americantaskforce.org/gala/sensununu.php" class="external text" title="http://www.americantaskforce.org/gala/sensununu.php" rel="nofollow">Sen. John E. Sununu (R-NH)</a> and <a href="http://www.americantaskforce.org/gala/senlevin.php" class="external text" title="http://www.americantaskforce.org/gala/senlevin.php" rel="nofollow">Sen.

I promise you my personal commitment to that goal.“ In December, 2006, a 10-member delegation from ATFP’s leadership traveled to the region and held substantive meetings with top political leaders including Jordan’s King Abdullah II, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and acting Israeli Prime Minister Tzipi Livni.</p>

<p>ATFP advocates the following six principles towards a fair and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two sovereign states—Israel and Palestine—living side by side in peace and security based on the borders of June 4, 1967 with mutually agreed upon territorial adjustments.</li>
<li>An end to the Israeli occupation and the evacuation of all Israeli settlements, save for equitable arrangements mutually agreed upon by the negotiating parties.</li>
<li>A just solution for the Palestinian refugee problem, in accordance with international legality and the relevant UN resolutions.</li>
<li>A shared Jerusalem open to all faiths, serving as the capital of two states, providing for the fulfillment of the political aspirations of both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples.</li>
<li>Full acceptance of Israel by all Arab states, and normalized diplomatic and economic relations throughout the region.</li>
<li>A "Marshall Plan" style package of aid and investment for Palestine and the new Middle East.</li>

<p><a href="http://www.americantaskforce.org/pdfs/advocacy_strategy.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.americantaskforce.org/pdfs/advocacy_strategy.pdf" rel="nofollow">ATFP’s advocacy</a> emphasizes the positive aspects of Palestinian statehood, and especially why the creation of a Palestinian state is good for the United States. ATFP stresses five key benefits of the creation of a Palestinian state to the American national interest:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Promote U.S. Interests in the Middle East generally:</b> “Peace based on the creation of a Palestinian state will remove the greatest single obstacle to achieving U.S. policy objectives in the Middle East. More specifically, the emerging Palestinian state will be a new democracy, a new ally of the United States, and a peace partner to Israel.“</li>
<li><b>Remove one of the major rallying calls of terrorists:</b> “Many people, including former senior government officials, CIA officers, political scientists and commentators and other persons closely associated with the American establishment and having impeccable reputations have made the point forcefully that a resolution of the conflict and the creation of a Palestinian state would be a major blow to anti-American extremism in the region.“</li>
<li><b>Strongly Enhance the US Role as World Leader:</b> “Americans believe that they should be trusted to run a monopolar world system in the general interest of all. They also understand that the world expects a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, especially close allies such as the UK.”</li>
<li><b>The Opening of Major Middle Eastern Economic Markets:</b> “Resolving the conflict would mean the removal of major barriers to trade and other relations between the United States and 23 Arab states, and 1.2 billion Muslims around the world, to the tremendous mutual benefit of both Americans and Arabs.“</li>
<li><b>A Major Step in Promoting American Values Worldwide:</b> “The creation of a Palestinian state means the birth of a new democracy, and the emergence of millions of new citizens of a new democracy, and the ending of a period in which millions of people lived without benefit of those basic political freedoms which constitute the founding ethos of the United States.“</li>

<p>On February 3, 2006, ATFP published in the New York Times its <a href="http://www.americantaskforce.org/vision.php" class="external text" title="http://www.americantaskforce.org/vision.php" rel="nofollow">vision</a> for the character of the Palestinian state it advocates. The vision advocates that the state of Palestine be:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Pluralistic:</b> “It must be a genuinely pluralistic state for all its citizens, which recognizes and celebrates their diversity while it treats them equally and with neutrality.”</li>
<li><b>Democratic:</b> “Palestine, for reasons of its own internal stability and for the regional role it needs to play, should be a democratic state built on the foundations of pluralism. Its political structures will be based on a multiparty system without ideological disqualifiers, that regular elections ensure the consent of the governed, that there be an independent judiciary that applies the rule of law in an equitable and impartial manner, and that fundamental individual political rights such as freedom of expression and assembly are guaranteed”</li>
<li><b>Non-militarized:</b> “The immediate order of business in the independent state of Palestine must be social and economic development. Non-militarization would realize very substantial economic benefits and free resources for investment in education and other tools for the development of human capital, which should be the foremost priority.”</li>
<li><b>A Positive, Stabilizing Regional Player:</b> “A Palestinian state committed to peaceful coexistence, non-belligerence and military neutrality would have a powerful moral voice in promoting international legality and regional stability”</li>

<p>ATFP launched the Palestinian Humanitarian Fund appeal in May 2006 to collect donations for humanitarian assistance for the Palestinian people. ATFP donates all funds raised from the Palestinian Humanitarian Fund to medical facilities in the West Bank and Gaza. In total, ATFP has donated $55,000 to medical facilities in the West Bank and Gaza for Palestinian humanitarian relief. In August 2006, ATFP donated $45,000, with grants going to Al-Makassed Hospital in Jerusalem, St. Luke’s Hospital in Nablus, and the Washington, D.C.-based United Palestinian Appeal (UPA). On January 23, 2007, ATFP launched a humanitarian medical program to help alleviate the Palestinian medical situation in the West Bank. The program, 'Healing Palestinians,' will consist of one-week rotations to several West Bank hospitals beginning in Summer 2007.</p>

<p>In 2006, ATFP published a volume summarizing its efforts and positions to date. <a href="http://www.americantaskforce.org/store/book.php" class="external text" title="http://www.americantaskforce.org/store/book.php" rel="nofollow">“Principles and Pragmatism: Key Documents from the American Task Force on Palestine”</a> was edited by Board Member Saliba Sarsar, Associate Vice President of Monmouth University, and Hussein Ibish, a senior fellow at the Task Force. (book page) The Task Force had previously issued its <a href="http://www.americantaskforce.org/101.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.americantaskforce.org/101.htm" rel="nofollow">“Palestine - Israel 101”</a> power-point slideshow on the history of the conflict and prospects for peace in the region.

<p>“I applaud the American Task Force on Palestine for highlighting the success of Palestinian-Americans, and for your continued support of all who work for peace in the Middle East.” — Secretary of State Dr. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condoleezza_Rice_57ca.html" title="Condoleezza Rice">Condoleezza Rice</a></p>
<p>“Allow me to begin by extending my thanks to your organization, the American Task Force on Palestine, and to my dear friend Dr. Ziad Asali, for all of your efforts and activities to help our Palestinian people” — <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahmoud_Abbas_02c5.html" title="Mahmoud Abbas">Mahmoud Abbas</a>, President, Palestinian Authority</p>
<p>“The ATFP is filling a much-needed role in Washington by promoting awareness of the importance of Palestinian statehood to American security. It is keeping the hope for two states, Israel and Palestine, living next to each other in peace and security vibrantly before us and for not allowing us as Americans to give up hope and to be in a state of despair because we are not yet there in the Middle East. We will get there and this organization will help us to get there.“ — Senator <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Levin_5255.html" title="Carl Levin">Carl Levin</a> (D-MI)</p>
<p>"In a few short years, ATFP has emerged as a unique voice in Washington. The organization convincingly argues not only that one can be pro-Palestinian and pro-peace, but that to be pro-Palestinian, one should be pro-peace. With that idea at the forefront, ATFP is making remarkable inroads to the administration, to the diplomatic corps, and among all who care deeply about the Middle East." — Jon B. Alterman, Ph.D. Director, Middle East Program Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)</p>
<p>“Stimulating and maintaining the U.S. Government's and policy makers' attention on the need for a resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, with a focus on a two state solution with security and peace for both sides, is exceedingly important. ATFP pursues this end with energy, rationality and diplomacy which all of us admire. Equally important, ATFP reaches out to all U.S. communities -- Arab, Jewish, Christian, Muslim -- to help all of us participate in realizing the desired end: peace between Israel and Palestine, between Palestinians and Israelis, in a two state context.” — Peter Gubser President, American Near East Refugee Aid (ANERA)</p>
<p>“Never has there been a more poignant moment in the long and enduring struggle of the Palestinian people for justice, independence and freedom than the one bestowed upon us at this time. To speak of how compelling the Palestinian case for self-determination has become is no more than stating the obvious. Your work towards accomplishing this goal is no less compelling, and will no doubt yield undeniable results. We laud your efforts and assure you of our continued and lasting commitment to the justice of the Palestinian cause.” — Dr. Hussein Hassouna Ambassador, <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Arab_States_a350.html" title="League of Arab States">League of Arab States</a></p>
<p>"The American Task Force on Palestine represents an important voice of reason and moderation on the American scene. The articles and opinion pieces of its respected founder and President, Dr. Ziad Asali, along with its daily 'Mideast News: World Press Roundup' are essential reading for all who are interested in understanding Palestinian developments and who support a just and lasting peace in the region." — Ambassador Robert Pelletreau Co-Director, Search for Common Ground in the Middle East Former Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs</p>
<p>"The American Task Force on Palestine is a unique Palestinian American organization that offers a reasonable and credible voice calling for the establishing of a state of Palestine. It makes a significant contribution to the cause of peace.” — Dr. Hasan Abdul Rahman Ambassador, <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestinian_Authority_16df.html" title="Palestinian Authority">Palestinian Authority</a></p>
<p>“The American Task Force on Palestine is fulfilling an important service for Palestinians. Composed of Palestinian-Americans, it is dedicated to the Palestinian cause and to the cause of peace and coexistence between Palestinians and Israelis. I applaud its efforts to promote Palestinian responsibility and reform, and believe it is guided by a spirit most likely to lead to the fulfillment of Palestinian national aspirations.” — Ambassador <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Ross_694c.html" title="Dennis Ross">Dennis Ross</a> Former Special Mideast Coordinator under Presidents Bush and Clinton Counselor and Ziegler distinguished fellow, Washington Institute for Near East Policy</p>
<p>“ATFP's focus on demanding a fair solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict is a critical and most welcome addition to our national dialog. ATFP has established itself in a short period of time as a superb, articulate advocate for the creation of a Palestinian State by communicating effectively with the decision makers in Washington. It fills a void in the international debate that can only be filled by Palestinian Americans. This is a rare opportunity to build an institution dedicated to the Palestinian cause with a genuine feeling of pride and respect, as well as a sense of contributing to eventual success.” — The Honorable Dr. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_H._Sununu_1e6d.html" title="John H. Sununu">John H. Sununu</a> Former White House Chief of Staff under President George H.W. Bush and Governor of New Hampshire</p>
<p>“The American Task Force on Palestine speaks with clarity and humanity about the need for peace between Palestinians and Israelis based on two states that meets the fundamental needs of both societies and protects American interests. It is a valuable and trusted partner of those in all communities who seek peace.” — Ambassador Philip C. Wilcox, Jr. President, Foundation for Middle East Peace</p>
