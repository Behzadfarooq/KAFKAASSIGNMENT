<p>The American University of Rome is the oldest degree-granting American university in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>. The school was founded in 1969, and has an undergraduate enrollment of 450.</p>
<p><b>The University</b></p>
<p>The American University of Rome (AUR) is a private, independent American institution of higher education in Rome, Italy, offering liberal studies and professional courses in an international environment that promotes cross cultural understanding. The University offers American degree programs primarily to undergraduate students. It also serves study abroad students, graduate students pursuing their degrees at other universities, and people interested in ongoing professional development and liberal studies.</p>
<p>Founded in 1969, The American University of Rome is the oldest degree-granting American university in Rome. AUR is a coeducational university offering undergraduate degrees in six disciplines with student body of 515 students per semester (Spring ‘05). AUR is dedicated to encouraging academic achievement in its students and offers a curriculum designed to complement our high academic standards as well as to ensure an active-learning environment with a small student/faculty ratio.</p>
<p>AUR is accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS) in the United States and is licensed by the Education Licensure Commission of the District of Columbia (Washington, DC, USA). AUR is incorporated in the District of Columbia as a nonprofit corporation.</p>
<p><b>Location</b></p>
<p>The University is located in a prestigious area of Rome on the Janiculum, Rome's highest hill, just a few minutes walk from the historical Trastevere district. The neighborhood surrounding AUR offers a full range of amenities, including restaurants, shops, cafés and outdoor markets. Several bus lines connect it to the center of Rome. Located near the ancient Roman road Via Aurelia Antica and Porta San Pancrazio, AUR is just a few minutes from the heart of Rome. Majors and Degrees</p>
<p>The American University of Rome offers a strong undergraduate curriculum with an international perspective. The Associate of Arts degree is offered in Liberal Arts and International Business. The Bachelor of Arts degree is awarded in Art History, Communication, Interdisciplinary Studies, International Relations, and Italian Studies. A Bachelor of Science degree is awarded in Business Administration. The University also offers a study abroad program for students studying at other universities.</p>
<p><b>Academic Program</b></p>
<p>All students must satisfy a general education requirement, of 42 credits, of which six may be also used towards a minor. Consistent with the mission of the University, the program aims to develop important skills, address social issues of diversity, multiculturalism and ethics, as well as to draw on the rich resources of the city of Rome as a learning tool. All students, regardless of major, should share a common dialogue. The objectives of The American University of Rome's general education program are: to develop and strengthen basic skills that will prepare students upon graduation for a modern working environment and that will be adaptable to a rapidly evolving economy; to cultivate an awareness of, and sensitivity to, cultural, ethnic and social diversity and its importance in personal and professional decision making; to expand the intellectual, cultural, societal, aesthetic and scientific horizons of students and enable them to discover not only the connections between academic disciplines but also the real life application of their knowledge; and, finally, to encourage active and responsible citizenship through knowledge of the forces shaping the actions of individuals and societies and through the development of critical thinking.</p>
<p>A student normally takes five courses (15 semester hours) each semester. A student is considered a sophomore after having completed 30 hours of credit, a junior once he or she has completed 60 hours of credit and officially declares a major field of study or enrolls in a degree program, and a senior after having completed 90 hours of course work.</p>
<p>One semester credit hour equals, at a minimum, 15 classroom contact hours of lectures, 30 hours of laboratory, and 45 hours of practicum. Internships also carry three semester credits and require 135 hours of practicum, as well as an on-site supervisor and a faculty member as project sponsor. An internship requires a daily log of activities. It also requires a final paper/presentation summarizing how goals were achieved and demonstrating the relationship of academic material to the work performed during the internship. Academic Facilities</p>
<p>The American University of Rome possesses a specialized library of course-related books and periodicals. The American University of Rome also provides electronic library services to its students and faculty. These holdings are supplemented by a number of sizable libraries in the city which are available to all students, including the Library of the British Council, the Library of the Church of Santa Susanna, and The Centro Studi Americani. The University library can access a central catalog of the Italian National Library System and also participates in inter-library loan programs.</p>
<p>There are two computer laboratories on campus available to students. All computers are IBM compatible and have access to email, the Internet, and network printers. One laboratory is located in the library and is devoted principally to student research and term paper requirements. The other computer laboratory is open for general student use.</p>
<p>A multimedia projector and laptop computer are available for classroom presentations using computer images and the Internet. Wireless services are available to students and faculty from locations on and around campus such as the garden and terraces of the university buildings, as well as a café and park near campus.</p>
<p>In addition to overhead and slide projectors, an extensive slide collection, and various audio systems, The American University of Rome possesses tri-system videotape televisions for projecting films for cinema classes and other purposes. The videotape and DVD collection includes films that are essential to courses in Italian cinema and Italian opera, as well as general cultural programs.</p>
<p><b>Costs</b></p>
<p>The comprehensive tuition fee at The American University of Rome for the current academic year for full-time undergraduates is 10,740 Euros. A non-refundable tuition deposit of 500 US Dollar/Euro is required from all new students, payable by the deadline indicated on the acceptance letter. The tuition deposit is deducted from the final tuition payment, prior to the commencement of the semester. Some courses require travel or attendance at cultural events as required by the course instructor. The cost of these events and travel are not included in tuition and must be borne by the student.</p>
<p><b>Financial Aid</b></p>
<p>The American University of Rome is authorized by the U.S. Department of Education to participate in Title IV student financial assistance programs. Eligible students may apply to participate in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program. The American University of Rome is considered a foreign school and therefore it is not authorized to award federal grants. Federal financial aid available for United States citizens or eligible non-citizens through the FFEL Program consists of Federal Stafford Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized) and Parent PLUS Loans.</p>
<p><b>Scholarships</b></p>
<p>The American University of Rome is committed to assisting students whose financial need and academic merit warrant support. The University aims to give every student the opportunity to take advantage of a high quality AUR education and, therefore, offers scholarships.</p>
<p>Funds awarded must be applied to tuition expenses. Assistance is awarded for no less than one semester. The value of a single scholarship will not exceed the cost of one year's tuition.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Faculty</b></p>
<p>The American University of Rome has an international, culturally diverse faculty. Thirteen countries are represented by our full time faculty. Nearly 75 percent of the full-time faculty members have received doctoral degrees and all professors either work professionally in their field or are active in scholarly research. The majority is bilingual and all faculty members act as teachers as well as advisers. The University also invites visiting professors from other universities for short-term residencies. Student Government</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to take an active role in the student government as a way of contributing to the continued growth and development of the University. Elected officers of the student government meet regularly with the University administration to discuss matters of administrative and academic relevance. They also take responsibility for directing a variety of student social activities, athletic tournaments, club activities, and cultural events. The student government maintains funds for these activities, and the student officers enjoy a wide degree of autonomy in managing these financial resources. Admission Requirements</p>
<p>Admission to The American University of Rome is highly selective. Candidates for admission to the University are reviewed by the Admissions Committee. Students are selected without regard to age, race, sex, creed, national or ethnic origin, or handicap. Requests for financial aid do not affect decisions on admission.</p>
<p>Candidates for admission must show evidence they have completed or anticipate completing a level of education equivalent to four years of high school. Applicants for admission from high school or a secondary school are required to submit: a completed application form accompanied by a non-refundable application fee; an official transcript of high school work; official university transcripts (for transfer students) from all institutions attended; one academic recommendation from the principal, a guidance counselor, teacher or professor; results of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) or American College Test (ACT), which are only required for high school students graduating from a U.S. High School system, whether in the U.S. or abroad; and a 200-500 word personal statement where the candidate indicates how a study experience in Rome will help further his or her career and life aims.</p>
<p>Each applicant is reviewed individually. Leadership, motivation, academic improvement, the level of the high school program's difficulty, involvement in activities, and potential for growth are important considerations in the application review process. Applicants whose native language is not English are required to submit scores from TOEFL or another English language proficiency exam. The English language proficiency exam requirement may be waived for applicants who complete high school at English-speaking institutions. The American University of Rome TOEFL institutional code for reporting purposes is 0579. Information concerning the TOEFL may be obtained by going to www.toefl.org. Advanced Standing</p>
<p>Advanced standing may be granted for academic credits earned at institutions outside the university system of the United States. Candidates in possession of credentials from European lyceums, such as the Italian maturita’, the International Baccalaureate, the British GCSE A levels and other equivalent programs will be evaluated and advanced credits granted on the basis of evaluation. In most instances, the first year of college (equivalent to 30 semester credits) may be granted. Students applying for advanced standing must submit official records of the last year of lyceum and a copy of the diploma if granted. If the records are not written in either English or Italian, the admissions office requires a certified translation into English.</p>
<p><b>Transfer Students</b></p>
<p>The American University of Rome welcomes transfer students. Upon submission of complete transcripts of all college and university courses previously taken, the university shall evaluate the credits earned and determine the number of credits to be accepted. Credit is granted only for courses completed with a grade of C or above. Transfer credits may be applied to no more than 50% of a student's major degree requirements. Students must complete at least 30 semester hours at The American University of Rome for an associate degree and at least 45 semester hours at The American University of Rome for a bachelor's degree. Transfer students with an equivalent of 60 semester credit hours of university study may seek a waiver for SAT and high school transcript requirements.</p>
<p><b>Application and Information</b></p>
<p>Applicants are notified of the admission decision two to four weeks after the application, supporting credentials, recommendation letter and the application fee are received.</p>
<p>Prospective students are encouraged to visit the campus. An application for admission and further information may be obtained by contacting The American University of Rome at either its U.S. address or its Rome address.</p>
