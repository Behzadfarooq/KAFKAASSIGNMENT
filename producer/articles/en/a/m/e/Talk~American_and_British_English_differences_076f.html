<p>A recent embedded comment from JackLumber reads <i>Does BrE use "weekends" as an adverb, like "evenings," "Mondays," etc.?</i> There was a brief discussion about this (or something like it) a month or so ago, <a href="../../../a/m/e/Talk%7EAmerican_and_British_English_differences_Archive_6_3101.html#Weekends" title="Talk:American and British English differences/Archive 6">here</a>. In the light of this I have deleted the embedded comment and amended the text - I hope reasonably accurately. OK, Jack? (though it occurs to me that maybe the AmE use of "weekends", "evenings" etc with no preposition might belong more appropriately in the section headed "Presence or absence of syntactic elements"). FWIW, this speaker of BrEng would say "at the weekend", "at weekends", but never "on weekends" or just "weekends". And I may do something "on Mondays" or "every Monday", but never just "Mondays" - and I do things "in the evening" (in this case always in the singular), but never do things "evenings". <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 22:32, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>English (the American variety, at least...) has a series of adverbs---<i>Mondays</i> through <i>Sundays</i>, <i>weekends</i>, <i>nights</i>, <i>evenings</i>, <i>mornings</i>, <i>afternoons</i> (I have measured out my life with coffee spoons)---which mean "during every {weekend, morning, etc.}" (or at least "most weekends," etc.) and suggest repeated action---that is, it's not just "dropping the preposition"; they carry a subtly different shade of meaning. Some of these are pretty old (<i>nights</i> dates to C12); <i>weekends</i> is way more recent. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber"><font face="bookman old style"><i>JackLumber.</i></font></a> 23:38, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The phrase "I work nights and weekends" is usual BrE. "The library is closed Saturdays" is not. I think the examples used in the article should be changed because they strike me as ambiguous and incorrect. For example "I work nights" is pretty much the only way it could be said, because "nights" are what the shifts are known as, and therefore they are out of context. It's hard to pin down exactly what is standard in BrE and what isn't. "I work Mondays" is standard, but "I go to work Mondays" is not. Needs a bit more research and clarification before it should be included. -- <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothman_030b.html" title="User:Boothman"><font color="#0F6E0A"><b>Boothman</b></font></a> <sub><a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothman_acb3.html" title="User talk:Boothman"><b><font color="#5C9337">/tɔːk/</font></b></a></sub> 20:22, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Booth! It's ben awhile. Now I understand why <i>I like to go out nights and sleep during the day</i> is "US" and <i>Because she's a nurse she often has to work nights</i> is not. You know, usage rules. ("Rules" is a verb here.) Usage is what makes words sound wrong, right, quaint, odd, ambiguous. And books are often clueless about it. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber"><font face="bookman old style"><i>JackLumber.</i></font></a> 21:53, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting, Boothman... My take on this is that <i>nights</i> in "I work nights" is the object of the verb, not an adverb. I work Mondays, but I'd never travel Mondays (though I might travel <i>on</i> Mondays). I think this supports my contention that the adverbial use of unadorned <i>Mondays</i>, <i>nights</i>, <i>weekends</i> etc is a marker of AmE as distinct from BrE. It also strikes me that this discussion could go on for ever. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 09:26, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Interesting observation, Snalwibma, and I would add to it that whether it's the object of the verb in any given instance is easy to test for. If you substitute "them" for "Mondays" or "nights" (or whatever it is) and it still works, then it's the object of the verb (i.e., it's functioning as a noun and can thus be replaced by a pronoun), whereas if it sounds goofy then it's probably an adverb.McTavidge 11:55, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the article on <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Stone_5228.html" title="Oliver Stone">Oliver Stone</a> there's the phrase "Stone's father brought him to a prostitute to lose his virginity, in his midteens."

<dd>As an American, I suspect you're just not noticing the distinction careful speakers (English and American) make between "bring" and "take" and the similar pair "come" and "go."

<dd>I suspect it's just bad wording. If Oliver <i>brought</i> him to a prostitute, it implies he was already in the vicinity of the prostitute, and went to get his son there too. And by the way, both "You and I", "You and Me" <i>and</i> "Me and You" are correct, although it is common for schools to teach that "Me" is wrong, regardless of any evidence of that. -- <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoothman_030b.html" title="User:Boothman"><font color="#0F6E0A"><b>Boothman</b></font></a> <sub><a href="../../../b/o/o/User_talk%7EBoothman_acb3.html" title="User talk:Boothman"><b><font color="#5C9337">/tɔːk/</font></b></a></sub> 14:18, 8 February 2007 (UTC).</dd>

That article ends with the assertion that:
<dl>
<dd>"If you are speaking to someone outside your office community, who will not be accompanying you tomorrow, you would be more likely to say I'll take the sausage to work tomorrow; but you could still say I'll bring it to work, because, after all, you'll be there, and it'll count as moving towards you, the speaker."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>To my British ear, I find the second version quite jarring; dare I say it - I think this would be "wrong" in British English. It's certainly something that I've been more aware of in American English, and not a formation that I've been aware of in British English. If this is the case, "take" is acceptable in both, and "bring" is sometimes used in American English. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamse_7b30.html" title="User:Jamse">Jamse</a> 09:34, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see only three references—<i>Mighty Fine Words and Smashing Expressions,</i> <i>The Oxford Guide to World English,</i> and <i>The Cambridge Guide to English Usage.</i> (All British, I note...) They are listed at the bottom of the article. There are no inline source citations. Presumably then, the entire contents of this article is to be understood to be a compilation from and a distillation of these three books.</p>
<p>But it certainly isn't obvious which of these books is the authority for, e.g the statement that "American legislators and lawyers always use the preposition of between the name of a legislative act and the year it was passed, while their British equivalents do not."</p>
<p>This is a very actively edited page with many changes being made to individual items on the page. The edit comments, e.g. "(Undid revision 104137957 by Moncrief -- no sir, it's BritiCism, not BritiSHism)" don't hint at published sources, either. Presumably both editors would have found the same information if they had consulted the same published source.</p>
<p>This article certainly gives me the impression of largely being original research, based on the personal authority of the contributing editors.

<dd>The article has "those Americans" only once, and in the instance, "this is generally regarded as sloppy usage by those Americans who consider themselves careful users of the language." It is using "those" to refer to the subset of Americans who consider themselves careful users of the language, rather than indicating that Americans are "other" to the speaker. Since this is the only criticism of the article on NPOV grounds, I am removing the tag, and replacing it by an {{unreferenced}} tag.<a href="../../../a/t/e/User%7EAtemperman_2e3f.html" title="User:Atemperman">Atemperman</a></dd>

<dd>I do have a small question, regarding a distinction under <i>Use of Tenses/Subjunctive Mood,</i> between 'they suggested that he <i>apply</i> for the job' vs. '... that he <i>should apply</i> for the job'. "However, the British usage ("should apply") is also heard in the United States, but is often regarded as erroneous in writing."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I believe that in AmE the added 'should' is often not heard as subjunctive at all, so much as mildly hortatory, as in "ought to", raising a slight doubt of 'his' doing so, and giving slightly more emphasis to the 'suggesting' than to the simple getting of the job. Doubts about using <i>should</i> would probably stem from a sense that, unless some such overtone were intended, the word would be redundant. Perhaps this is related to the similar differences in "shall"? <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFutharkRed_c2c2.html" title="User:FutharkRed">FutharkRed</a> 09:06, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't regard "should apply" as erroneous. FutharkRed is spot on (if I'm borrowing that phrase correctly) in believing that my AmE ears heard the "should" as hortatory. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetershank_bb1a.html" title="User:Petershank">Petershank</a> 00:01, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the part about dates formats (the reason why I read this article in the first place), the example of "25 December 2000" is given for the BrE format in some places. Should it not read "25 Decembre 2000"?</p>
<p>And something may be missing in the sentence "It is very common [...] to add a (sometimes superscripted) ordinal ('st, nd, rd' or 'th') to the day number in informal writing (thus "25 December 2000" or "December 25, 2000")." It should read 25th near the end.</p>

<dd>As far as I can tell Brits spell December the same way as Americans. As for the line, yes it should have been written as December 25<sup>th</sup>, 2000; however since it is incorrect (Americans use the same format) I've just removed it. <a href="../../../k/o/w/User%7EKoweja_a591.html" title="User:Koweja">Koweja</a> 17:41, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I found that there is a significant difference in how people ask someone to tell them what time it is. Being from a commonwealth country, my initial reaction to the American question "Do you have the time?" was to wonder what activity the inquiring person wanted to engage in. I cannot comment expertly on how people ask for time in BrE, but an addition about this would be useful<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 128.165.27.182 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_128.165.27.182_c07a.html" title="Special:Contributions/128.165.27.182">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>I am sorry but the British do not know how to spell. When it comes to the English language Americans are usually not only more logical and more phonetic, they are usually more correct. The Webster's dictionary used in the U.S., however, is not that different from the Oxford English Dictionary. In fact in many cases the publishers of the Oxford English Dictionary admit that where there is a difference between normal English and American spelling, the American version is usually preferable or more correct.</p>
<p>Take the ‘–or/-our ‘endings of words like ‘color/colour', ‘favor/favour', ‘endeavor/endeavour' for instance. Fowler's Modern English Usage, published by the Oxford University Press, makes it quite clear that the British ‘–our' endings have no validity; it is simply national prejudice and arrogance which prevents the British from approaching the subject with an open mind. Fowler's then goes on to point out that the ‘–or' endings are much more common than the ‘–our' ones even in U.K., and that the differently spelled suffixes do not ‘serve any useful purpose'. Words like ‘horror', ‘pallor', ‘governor' and even ‘pavior' are given, some of which were once spelt with ‘–our' endings. Fowler's speculates that in any future spelling reform ‘reduction of ‘–our' to ‘–or' will be one of the least disputed items, or that, failing general reform we shall see word after word in ‘–our' go the way of ‘governour.'</p>
<p>Fowler's then refers the reader to the Oxford English Dictionary ‘–or' entry ‘to satisfy themselves that it is right to deny any value to the ‘-our' spelling'. There you have it: the Oxford English Dictionary itself admits Americans are being quite correct to favor ‘-or' in place of ‘-our'. The fact that even in quaint British spelling derivatives of ‘-our' words are, as Fowler's points out, usually spelt with ‘-or' just shows what nonsense the British spelling is</p>
<p>In actual fact most of these words come from the Latin, which was always spelt ‘-or'. The ‘-our' corruption is due to French influence, and has no phonetic value whatsoever. The actual vowel sound is neutral, so ‘endeavor', ‘endever' or even ‘endevr' would represent the phonetics much better than the British ‘endeavour' spelling which is unnecessarily cumbersome. The Australians have progressed a little way towards the more correct American spelling, and at least the Australian Labor Party has adopted the shorter ‘-or' spelling. Increasingly use of the internet has spread the more correct and phonetic American spelling, and indeed more correct American English like the grammatically correct ‘gotten', throughout the English-speaking world.</p>
<p>Some other quotes from Fowler's: ‘cheque' – ‘mereley a variant of check'. The ‘-ise/-ize' choice of endings in words like ‘organize': ‘the Oxford University Press, the Cambridge University Press, The Times and American usage, in all of which ‘–ize' is the accepted form, carry authority'. Fowler's points our that ‘-ise' is a French corruption, as is ‘-re' in words like ‘centre' and ‘metre' (the Americans, of course, sensibly spell these endings 'er' - 'center', 'meter', etc..)</p>
<p>In words which take a double ‘L' in U.K. and one in the U.S., such as ‘traveller/traveler', it is quite obvious the U.S. version is more correct. The British spelling implies the stress is on the second syllable, i.e. ‘traVELLer', as the double consonant tends to come after the syllable which is stressed. Americans, however, reverse the double ‘L' rule when it comes to words like ‘enrol' and ‘instalment'. The preceding are the British spellings, the USA use ‘enroll' and ‘installment, which is far more proper. Amnesty International has adopted ‘program' instead of the very eccentric and weird British ‘programme'. Incidentally, in computer language ‘program' is already used in British spelling, but why not abandon the ridiculous ‘mme' ending completely? The Oxford English Dictionary says: ‘the earlier program… is preferable as conforming to the usual English representation of Greek gramma, in anagram, cryptogram, diagram, telegram, etc.' Once again the OED says Americans are right and it is the British who have corrupted the English laguage with the newer, inconsistent and incorrect ‘mme' endings. People should never use the equally ridiculous ‘–gue' endings the British use, but always ‘catolog', ‘analog', etc. which is used in American english. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Chiswick_d256.html" title="User:Daniel Chiswick">User:Daniel_Chiswick</a> 29 March, 2007</p>

<dd>A spelling is "correct" as long as it's accepted. So <i>-l-</i> and <i>-ll-</i> are both correct---in the US and UK, respectively. Long story short, most commentators agree that American spelling is more regular than British spelling. But the substitution of <i>-er</i> for <i>-re</i> in <i>center</i> etc. was a screw-up. —<font face="Bookman old style"><small><a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber"><font color="blue"><sup>Jack</sup><sub>Lumber</sub></font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJackLumber_e286.html" title="User talk:JackLumber">/tɔk/</a></sup></small></font> 22:51, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well I think, along with many others, that American english is more proper because we have eliminated all of the corruptions left over from French. The best example are words that end with "Tre" instead of "Ter", nobody says Thea-treh the way the French pronounce the word, but instead it is pronounced the way it is spelt in American english. The English language is just a mash up of German, Frisian, and French and with British spelling you can really tell that it is made up of borrowed words which seems rather barbaric if you think about it, whereas in American english you cannot tell that the words were borrowed because we droped the French spelling. I have no idea why the British just do not adopt American spelling since it is more correct, perhaps it is just national prejudice? The InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF), World Bank Group, Organization of American States (OAS), North American Free TradeAgreement (NAFTA) Secretariat, Modern Language Association (MLA), World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistrymany other international organizations all use American english because it is more proper and even a few former British colonies like Canada and Australia are starting to use American spelling for that same reason. When people from non-english speaking countries want to learn english abroad they usually choose the U.S. over most other english speaking countries because we spell better and we have the world's largest english speaking population. I would say that American english is international english because it is spoken by far more people and it is used by many international organizations. I do not wish to offend and Britons because I am a huge anglophile but I just want to let people know that British english incorrect and spoken by far less people than American english and that American english should take precedence over British spelling for that reason. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Chiswick_d256.html" title="User:Daniel Chiswick">User:Daniel_Chiswick</a> 29 March, 2007.</p>

<dd>English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a five year phase-in plan that would be known as "Euro-English". In the first year, "s" will replace the soft "c". Sertainly, this will make the sivil servants jump with joy. The hard "c" will be dropped in favour of the "k". This should klear up konfusion and keyboards kan have 1 less letter. There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year, when the troublesome "ph" will be replaced with "f". This will make words like "fotograf" 20% shorter. In the third year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be ekspekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. Governments will enkorage the removal of double letters, which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horible mes of the silent "e"s in the language is disgraseful, and they should go away. By the fourth year, peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing "th" with "z" and "w" with "v". During ze fifz year, ze unesesary "o" kan be dropd from vords kontaining "ou" and similar changes vud of kors be aplid to ozer kombinations of leters. After zis fifz yer, ve vil hav a reli sensibl riten styl. Zer vil be no mor trubl or difikultis and evrivun vil find it ezi to understand ech ozer. Ze drem of a united urop vil finali kum tru!

<dd>English will never be phonetic, and it's daft to try to make it so. You only have to look at honour-&gt;honor (not 'onor', duh!). English is one of (if not) the most mongrel language on the planet, with lexical borrowings from most other languages. And each of these will likely bring a new disconnect between spelling and pronunciation. Much better to revel in what makes English rich and bizarre than get wound up in pedantry.</dd>
<dd>And if by some chance you succeed on your quest, you're only likely to end up red-faced in one hundred years.
