<p><b>American Tea Culture</b> refers to the methods of preparation and means of consumption of <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tea.html" title="Tea">tea</a> in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>.</p>
<p>Afternoon tea, as a meal, is rarely served in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> except in ritualized special occasions such as the <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tea_party.html" title="Tea party">tea party</a> or an afternoon out at a high-end hotel or restaurant, which may also have cream teas on the menu. Tea, the drink, is commonly served at all meals especially in the US South and throughout the day as an alternate to other beverages. In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, about 80% of the tea consumed is served cold, or <i>iced</i>. Iced tea is more frequently consumed during periods of hot weather or in lower latitudes, and hot tea is likewise more common in colder weather. Any confusion when one is visiting different parts of the country can easily be solved by explicitly asking for either "hot tea" or "iced tea."</p>

To this day, coffee remains more popular than tea in the United States; however the average US citizen consumes roughly 7.8 gallons of tea a year as of 2000 <a href="http://www.luzianne.com/more_icedtea_facts_II.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.luzianne.com/more_icedtea_facts_II.cfm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_tea_culture.html" title="Edit section: Iced tea">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Iced tea</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../i/c/e/Iced_tea.html" title="Iced tea">Iced tea</a> is usually prepared from <a href="../../../t/e/a/Tea_bag.html" title="Tea bag">bagged tea</a>. In addition to tea bags and loose tea, powdered "instant iced tea mix" is available in stores. This is made by preparing tea and then dehydrating it, similar to instant coffee. Iced tea can be purchased, like soda, in canned or bottled form at vending machines and convenience stores; usually, this pre-made tea is sweetened with <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corn_syrup.html" title="Corn syrup">corn syrup</a>, and sometimes some other flavoring, such as lemon or raspberry, is added. Also, like other <a href="../../../s/o/f/Soft_drink.html" title="Soft drink">soft drinks</a>, it can be purchased as a <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fountain_drink.html" title="Fountain drink">fountain drink</a>, though in some establishments it is pumped from a <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bag-In-Box_e021.html" title="Bag-In-Box">Bag-In-Box</a>, and in others, from a separate container near the <a href="../../../s/o/d/Soda_fountain.html" title="Soda fountain">fountain</a> that contains freshly brewed tea.</p>
<p>In restaurants, iced tea is usually served unsweetened except in the <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_United_States_764b.html" title="Southern United States">Southern United States</a> where iced tea is much more common and is available both sweet and unsweetened and "iced tea" is often considered to be "sweet tea" unless otherwise specified. The reason for the presweetening is that it may be difficult to dissolve sugar in iced tea, even with constant stirring. The result can be insufficiently sweetened tea and/or gritty, undissolved sugar crystals in the tea. Some restaurants in <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> have begun serving iced tea that has been pre-flavored with fruit essences, particularly <a href="../../../p/a/s/Passion_fruit.html" title="Passion fruit">passion fruit</a>, often as the only iced tea made available.</p>
<p>Iced tea's popularity in the United States has led to an addition to standard <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flatware.html" title="Flatware">flatware</a> sets; the <a href="../../../i/c/e/Iced_tea_spoon.html" title="Iced tea spoon">iced tea spoon</a> is a standard flatware <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teaspoon.html" title="Teaspoon">teaspoon</a>, but with a long handle, suitable for stirring sugar into the taller glasses commonly used for iced tea.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_tea_culture.html" title="Edit section: Tea bags">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Tea bags</span></h2>
<p>Thomas Sullivan is credited with inventing tea bags in 1908. Sullivan, a New York tea importer, inadvertently invented tea bags when he sent tea samples to clients in small silk bags to cut costs, and they mistakenly steeped the bags whole.</p>
<p>The customers were interested in the silk bags instead of the tea. Sullivan did not realise this until they all started to complain that the orders they received were not in the bags the samples had been in. Silk was too expensive for bagging; therefore, he invented tea bags made of gauze.</p>
<p>Most tea sold in the United States is sold in bags.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_tea_culture.html" title="Edit section: Instant tea">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Instant tea</span></h2>
<p>In 1946, Nestle USA introduced the first instant tea, Nestea. Instant teas are produced from black tea by extracting the liquor from processed portion of tea typically from tea wastes or undried fermented leaves. The extract is concentrated under low pressure, and drying the concentrate to a powder by freeze-drying, spray-drying, or vacuum-drying. Low temperatures tend to be used to minimise loss of flavour.</p>
<p>Instant teas are typically purchased because of their costs and convenience, and are typically of poor flavour and quality.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_tea_culture.html" title="Edit section: Revival of fine teas">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Revival of fine teas</span></h2>
<p>In the 1980's a revival of fine hot teas occurred in the United States. Prior to this time most tea available in the US was blended specifically for iced tea with the quality of not discolouring when iced and cost as the primary desired qualities, even over taste. Most ice tea blends are derived from Argentinean tea plantations, which has a discernibly different taste than black teas blended from Indian and Chinese stocks. This blend is often referred to as American blend by tea companies to differentiate it from other blends sometimes referred to as fine teas. Ironically, iced tea is an extremely unpopular drink in <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argentina.html" title="Argentina">Argentina</a> and can usually be found neither in cans nor in powder nor in restaurants.</p>
<p>Recently, many <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffee.html" title="Coffee">coffee</a> houses have begun to serve a <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milk.html" title="Milk">milky</a>, sweet, <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spice.html" title="Spice">spiced</a> tea called "<a href="../../../c/h/a/Chai.html" title="Chai">chai</a>", based on <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> "masala chai". <a href="../../../b/u/b/Bubble_tea.html" title="Bubble tea">Bubble tea</a> from <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taiwan.html" title="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> has also become popular in the United States in recent years.</p>

It is served over a glass full of ice cubes and is often garnished with a slice of lemon.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_United_States_b538.html" title="Northern United States">Northern United States</a>, "tea" generally means the hot beverage.</p>

<p><i>Sun tea</i> is frequently brewed in temperate areas by placing tea and water together in a glass jar left outdoors in direct sunlight. Steeping times are necessarily long. Tea may also be brewed with no heat at all by simply immersing the tea bags or infuser in room-temperature water and allowing a period of several hours (typically overnight) for steeping. Since sun brewing occurs in a temperature range that promotes the development of bacteria, particularly <i>Alcaligenes viscolactis</i>, the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Centers_for_Disease_Control_73db.html" title="Centers for Disease Control">Centers for Disease Control</a> and the National Tea Association suggest brewing sun tea in the refrigerator, and discarding it after 24 hours.</p>

<p>A lesser known (at least in the United States) alcoholic tea called "Green Dragon Tea" is the result of steeping marijuana in alcohol for a period time. A adequately high proof alcohol (at least 80 proof) is required to sufficiently leech the THC from the marijuana leaves, buds, and stems. The tea is very intoxicating resulting from both the high THC content and the high proof alcohol.</p>
