<p>This article is called "Americas (terminology)" but I find nothing in it that I consider to be terminology as such.

<dd>The name was patterned after the article <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28terminology%29_c1f3.html" title="British Isles (terminology)">British Isles (terminology)</a>, though there are significant differences between the two. This article was created so that Wikipedia would have a central place for information about how the Western Hemisphere is divided up (since not all English users do it the same way), but have that information away from the disambiguation pages and the articles proper. The main issues were the number of continents and that not only Mexico but also Central America are part of North America (if you recognize North America). I'd like to see this article continue to be separate from <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">Americas</a>. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 05:50, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If it does remain separate, how about giving it an accurate title like Divisions of the Americas? And I've just discovered <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subregions_of_the_Americas_d9bf.html" title="Subregions of the Americas">Subregions of the Americas</a> which could be merged in here too. <a href="../../../n/u/r/User%7ENurg_7392.html" title="User:Nurg">Nurg</a> 10:58, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My problem with divisions vs. terminology is the problem of differing schemes. The goal of the article is to point out that different people will use different terms to describe the various parts of the Western Hemisphere. As for <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subregions_of_the_Americas_d9bf.html" title="Subregions of the Americas">Subregions of the Americas</a>, that article gives only the UN view of things and probably needs a POV tag. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 14:36, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/Talk%7EAmericas_%28terminology%29_28ff.html" title="Edit section: Geopolitical divisions">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Geopolitical divisions</span></h2>
<p>A geopolitical division is a geographic region comprising a group of countries with political, economical and other common shared interests and that may or may not share an agenda. It is also important to note that geopolitical regions are defined by the countries themselves and their willingness to actively cooperate with each other, not by any other entity or institution. This is not the case of "Middle America" or "Central America" (as defined by the UN geoscheme including Mex). So I deleted the term MA from the geopolitical division and also erased the reference to Mexico in CA. All this in the geopolitical divisions only. I also added North America (Can, US, Mex) because they make up a geopolitical region.</p>
<p>Here are some definition of what geopolitics are (just in case some of you don't know):</p>
<ul>
<li>A term that has been used to refer to many things, including a tradition of representing space, states and the relations between them; also emphasizing the strategic importance of particular places. <a href="http://media.pearsoncmg.com/intl/ema/uk/0131217666/student/0131217666_glo.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://media.pearsoncmg.com/intl/ema/uk/0131217666/student/0131217666_glo.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
<li>The study of the relationships between a nation and the rest of the world - each nation has a sphere of influence it exerts over surrounding nations in areas such as trade, economic aid, military intervention etc. <a href="http://home.ica.net/~drw/glosse-g.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.ica.net/~drw/glosse-g.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>
<li>The study of the effects of economic geography on the powers of the state <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=geopolitics" class="external autonumber" title="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=geopolitics" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
<li><i>Geopolitics is studying geopolitical systems. The geopolitical system is, in my opinion, the ensemble of relations between the interests of international political actors, interests focused to an area, space, geographical element or ways.</i> - Vladimir Toncea, Geopolitical evolution of borders in Danube Basin, PhD 2006.</li>
<li><i>In the abstract, geopolitics traditionally indicates the links and causal relationships between political power and geographic space; in concrete terms it is often seen as a body of thought assaying specific strategic prescriptions based on the relative importance of land power and sea power in world history... The geopolitical tradition had some consistent concerns, like the geopolitical correlates of power in world politics, the identification of international core areas, and the relationships between naval and terrestrial capabilities.â€”</i> Oyvind Osterud, The Uses and Abuses of Geopolitics, <a href="../../../j/o/u/Journal_of_Peace_Research_277a.html" title="Journal of Peace Research">Journal of Peace Research</a>, no. 2, 1988, p. 191</li>
</ul>
<p>The geopolitical division of the Americas are easy to identify: North America (here it can be Can and the US, and also Can, the US and Mexico), Central America (Belize, Honduras, El Salvador, Panama, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Nicaragua), the Caribbean, and South America.</p>

<p><b>ABOUT THE UN GEOSCHEME</b></p>
<p>According to the article <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_geoscheme_583a.html" title="United Nations geoscheme">United Nations geoscheme</a>:</p>
<p><i>The scheme was devised <b>purely for statistical purposes</b> and is used only for carrying out statistical analysis. According to the UN, it: ...does not imply any assumption <b>regarding political or other affiliation</b> of countries or territories by the United Nations.</i></p>
<p>I knew this and I even read it somewhere in the UN website, but right now I cannot find it anymore. However when I consulted the article here in Wikipedia, it already says that. This proves my point that the UN Geoscheme is not a geopolitical instrument. As I said above, I already added the geopolitical areas of the Americas and created a separate subarticle for the UN Geoscheme. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#CE1126">Alex</font></a><i><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#006847">Covarrubias</font></a></i> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Flag_of_Mexico.png/15px-Flag_of_Mexico.png" alt="" width="15" height="9" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" /></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexCovarrubias_5239.html" title="User talk:AlexCovarrubias"><font size="1" color="green">( Let's talk! )</font></a></sup> 15:46, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the edits. However, you cannot merely remove information which <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">you are not in agreement</a> with -- I have restored notations of Middle America. It may need to be moved up or down (which Dow, actually, specifically indicates is a culture region) but, seeing as how it is usually defined in relation to constituent states, is (thus) an element of political geography/geopolitics and appropriately placed. That also denies that there are any political relationships among Mexico, the countries of Central America, and the Caribbean -- which is patently false (e.g., <a href="../../../c/a/r/CARICOM_f28b.html" title="CARICOM">CARICOM</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plan_Puebla_Panama_53c6.html" title="Plan Puebla Panama">Plan Puebla Panama</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/-/DR-CAFTA_1dcb.html" title="DR-CAFTA">DR-CAFTA</a>). <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography.html" title="Geography">Geography</a> (geographical) is comprised of two main subsets: <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_geography.html" title="Physical geography">physical geography</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_geography.html" title="Human geography">human geography</a>. (If there's confusion regarding terminology, which should not be used as the basis for excluding terms/removing information, then the section headings should be changed -- e.g., Human/political geography -- and or article tweaked.)</dd>
<dd>As well, I remind you of the Fowler's and Oxford references which clearly considers North America as Canada and the U.S. together, while F including Mexico in Central America -- <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">cognizant of this and other regional reckonings</a>, I have made appropriate edits.

<dd>You may not be familiar with geopolitics, because CARICOM and DR-CAFTA are only Free Trade Agreements (Mexico is not an active part in any of that, just observer in CARICOM). Geopolitically the countries of Central America have developed a whole cooperational political system as well as an economic integration (that they seek to make it stronger), not to mention the cultural ties between them. The Caribbean presents another well defined geopolitical entity with a stronger pattern of political integration than CA (they even have a political agreement to vote in block in the <a href="../../../o/a/s/OAS_ed16.html" title="OAS">OAS</a> and in the <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_0433.html" title="UN">UN</a>).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The integration between the Caribbean and Central America is not that strong. It is obvious that both regions have relations between them, just as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> has relations with the <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a>, however, that does not imply that geopolitically Canada is part of the EU region.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean may be included in the <i>geographic</i> region of Middle America, however, between them (and specially between Mexico-CA, Mexico-Caribbean) there is no political/economical or even militar integration (presented in CA and in the Caribbean), they simply do not make up a geopolitical region. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#CE1126">Alex</font></a><i><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#006847">Covarrubias</font></a></i> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Flag_of_Mexico.png/15px-Flag_of_Mexico.png" alt="" width="15" height="9" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" /></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexCovarrubias_5239.html" title="User talk:AlexCovarrubias"><font size="1" color="green">( Let's talk! )</font></a></sup> 05:23, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh and I forgot to mention the well-intentioned, but never seriously taken and sadly never enforced/implemented "Plan Puebla-PanamÃ¡" (and as its name clearly indicates, it was just a plan). It was a political maneouver from Mexican Ex-President Vicente Fox to send friendly signals to the Central American countries. It has basicly limited to investment each country have to make (and they acquire <i>separately</i> external debt) in order to improve the transportation conditions of the Mexican southeast and Central America, to attract more foreing investment. Ever since it was "launched", it was rapidly forgotten, so fast that it had to be "relaunched" in 2004.<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#CE1126">Alex</font></a><i><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#006847">Covarrubias</font></a></i> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Flag_of_Mexico.png/15px-Flag_of_Mexico.png" alt="" width="15" height="9" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" /></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexCovarrubias_5239.html" title="User talk:AlexCovarrubias"><font size="1" color="green">( Let's talk! )</font></a></sup> 05:29, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>"Not that strong" (among other comments)? Sounds like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research (if not supposition) to me</a>. As before: the Dow reference specifically indicates Middle America may also be a "cultural region". Feel free to move it elsewhere in the article and to reframe/tweak its contents, but removing applicable information about this region in the Americas from this article regarding terminology as it pertains to the Americas is <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVAND_6593.html" title="WP:VAND">vandalism</a> and will be dealt with swiftly.</dd>
<dd>In addition, since you <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">continue to push a point of view to the exclusion of others</a> regarding the nebulous region of North America and its contents (and I still see NO citation that refers to it specifically as that), I am adding the Fowler's and Oxford references about reckonings/inclusions of America/North America. As for other points, you are entitled to your <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">opinion</a> -- but removing information <i>AGAIN</i> (and after apparently being in place for quite awhile) does not <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">prove your point</a>. I will wait for others to weigh in. (A segue: I have studied Political Science, including international relations, at the university level, so perhaps it is you who is unfamiliar with the concepts and terminology therein.)

<dd>According to you, that particular reference (Dow) indicated Middle America <i>may also</i> be a <i>cultural region</i>. That's different, the subdivision you added Middle America to is geopolitics. It does not belong there.</dd>

<dd>About Mexico being included in Central America. I'm surprised that you add Mexico here, because you know (from the articles <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography_of_Mexico_bedf.html" title="Geography of Mexico">Geography of Mexico</a> in which you have actively participated) that it geopolitically does not belong there. I don't think Fowler's dictionary is a good source for understanding geopolitical regions (since it is a dictionary about "usage of English" particularly British, as you have said in other talks), but for now I accept it as a reference for "North America" meaning the US and Canada, not because it says so, but because it is world-wide knowledge. Just remember the subarticle is not about "usage" of the terms presented, but about real geopolitical areas. I'll try to look for a better reliable source.</dd>

<dd>And however, and most importantly, geopolitical regions are not defined by a third party entity (particularly not a dictionary), but by the countries and their interactions politically, economically. Mexico has no political committment with the region of CA, and CA Governments do not consider Mexico a CA nation. An easy example that proves my point is that Mexico was never invited/planned to be part of the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_American_Parliament_07ba.html" title="Central American Parliament">Central American Parliament</a> (a supranational political body) <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#CE1126">Alex</font></a><i><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#006847">Covarrubias</font></a></i> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Flag_of_Mexico.png/15px-Flag_of_Mexico.png" alt="" width="15" height="9" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" /></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexCovarrubias_5239.html" title="User talk:AlexCovarrubias"><font size="1" color="green">( Let's talk! )</font></a></sup> 13:17, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Why are you surprised? Actually, <i>all</i> of the relevant articles indicate that Mexico is uncommonly or occasionally -- not never -- included in Central America geopolitically (an element of human geography), and a number of sources indicate that. If it so happens that the US and Canada only are reckoned in North America, then it follows that Mexico (in that instance) must be elsewhere. The citations clearly support the edits, so stop saying they do not. And, fundamentally, the only geopolitical divisions of the Americas are the states themselves.</dd>
<dd>As well, Middle America may be a variety of regions -- it comprises the mid-latitudes of the Americas (geophysical, if that) AND comprises Mexico, CA, WI (geopolitical, political geography) AND is essentially the northern region of Latin America in North America (cultural). I will also seek added sources; until then, I'm standing pat. Corticopia 16:53, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Geopolitically, Mexico is not part of CA, as per the above talk. And again, Fowler is not a reliable source for geopolitics, since it is just a dictionary of english usage. Denying the existence of geopolitc areas (by saying the states are the only geopolitical divisions) is just pushing a POV. Again, geopolitics areas are not created based in what a dictionary says, or a third party says, but in the political, economic, militar relations between the states. Middle America is NOT a geopolitical area/region, but just a merely geographic region when a specific geographic model is applied to the Americas.

<dd>Also, if you want to include the geographic (not geopolitcal) region of Middle America, then North America (Americas) should be included also (per NPOV it was included, and you deleted it, and you just left Middle America).

<dd>I have to say that I agree with Alex. Fowler is indeed a reputable source but it is reporting English usage (or colloquial usage) not geopolitical terms. In geopolitics Mexico is included in North America, as it was agreed to report in <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html#Geography" title="Mexico">Mexico#Geography</a>. --<a href="../../../d/%C3%BA/n/User%7ED%C3%BAnadan_4a59.html" title="User:DÃºnadan"><font color="blue">the</font><font color="#339900">D</font><font color="blue">Ãºnadan</font></a> 19:00, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, you previously indicated that the countries of Middle America are "culturally, linguistically and historical(ly) related". How can they not be politically related ... even though the pre-Columbian cultures long since unified Mexico and its Central American neighbours in an ethnohistorical/cultural context and, as a result of the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_conquest.html" title="Spanish conquest">Spanish conquest</a>, the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish language</a> (per <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>) later did so in a linguistic/historical context? Also note the former <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Republic_of_Central_America_b176.html" title="Federal Republic of Central America">Federal Republic of Central America</a>, which cut across the current state borders. Do these not point to a geopolitical relationship, even if moribund -- geopolitics is not limited to "right now." And do we assume that there are no unifying political relationships among these countries despite their shared history? Anyhow, I will research the underpinnings of Middle America and report back shortly. Corticopia 00:03, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I still can't understand what you are trying to say. Please elaborate. But, from what I understand you're saying, note that pre-Columbian civilizations in <i>Mesoamerica</i> were far from unified (and at the end only weakly unified under a tributary system), but culturally <i>and</i> linguistically diverse, that is why to this date more than 60 languages have survived, and it was that diversity which brought the collapse of all, not the mere 300 Spaniards alone. Now, the Spanish conquest created a cultural and linguistic relationship, but I cannot extrapolate that to <i>current</i> geopolitics. The Federal Republics of Central America did not include Mexico; <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiapas.html" title="Chiapas">Chiapas</a> had seceded before its formation. I do see a strong geopoltical [and cultural, and economical and linguistic] union of all Central American countries, but I fail to see Mexico's relationship to it. But I am not be getting your point. --<a href="../../../d/%C3%BA/n/User%7ED%C3%BAnadan_4a59.html" title="User:DÃºnadan"><font color="blue">the</font><font color="#339900">D</font><font color="blue">Ãºnadan</font></a> 01:59, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>While grouping the three NA countries together, the article also clearly indicates that Middle America is a region of some geopolitical import, a historic (touched on above) and contemporary 'shatterbelt' in history and in world affairs (e.g., a buffer where "local states' rivalries in the Caribbean basin became linked to Cold War strategic rivalries that brought the world to its closest potential for nuclear war in the Cuban missile crisis of 1962"; involvement in the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monroe_Doctrine_0067.html" title="Monroe Doctrine">Monroe Doctrine</a>, etc. That's basically what I'm trying to demonstrate; I will expand when I can research and source further.

<dd>And most importantly, Middle America means Mex, CA and <i>the Caribbean</i>. There is no such a geopolitical region, because if Mexico and CA have very weak political/economical links, those links are almost non existent between Mexico and the Caribbean. If Middle America were a geopolitical region, Mexico and the other 2 areas should be actively cooperating politically/economically and even military, and that's not happening and it is not seeked by any of the three components. Instead, the political/economical ties between the three countries of the North American region (Can, US, Mex) is not only strong, but is increasing and a deeper unity is seeked by the three countries. The European Intelligence agency in their report about the world in 2025 didn't even mention Mexico in Latin America (I'm trying to find the damn link). <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias">AlexCovarrubias</a><a href="../../../b/l/a/Image%7EBlack_ribbon.png_3e6f.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/3/3e/Black_ribbon.png/12px-Black_ribbon.png" alt="" width="12" height="18" longdesc="../../../b/l/a/Image%7EBlack_ribbon.png_3e6f.html" /></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexCovarrubias_5239.html" title="User talk:AlexCovarrubias"><font size="1" color="black">( Let's talk! )</font></a></sup> 11:07, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As well, before any of you get too carried away with original (and perhaps subjective) assumptions about this and that, particularly about what geopolitics is and what comprise geopolitical regions in this venue, please consult at least some materials that further demonstrate the point that Middle America (at least as its taught in a number of institutions) is a germane geopolitical region and topic of analysis:

<dd>I believe in most (I will check), references specifically corroborate the reckonings in Fowler's Fowler's. Anyhow, I don't have time to respond at length now (and won't to AlexCovarrubias lengthy plea elsewhere), but I will in the next day or so with detailed references (e.g., consulting volumes noted above). Otherwise, I defer to prior comments. Suffice to say that geopolitics is not as rigidly framed as some would have us believe and the article <i>must</i> be refactored to be both accurate and impartial, which this article now isn't.

<dd>Those references don't prove anything. One thing is a geopolitical study/analysis of a particular set of countries (e.g. US-Mexico, European Union-Middle East, Canada-Latin America) and another thing is the existing geopolitical regions in the continent, that are based in political cooperation, economic ties and even militar or security policies. It would be foolish to say, for example, that Canada and Mexico make up a geopolitical region on their own, because they are in the same geographical region (North America) and because they have a FTA, the NAFTA. Instead, there could be a particular study about geopolitics between the two countries, after all geopolitics are defined as the "study of states and the relations between them".</dd>

<dd>Geopolitical regions/areas are diferent, as I already said in multiple times, they are defined by the political, economical ties between countries. There are no economical/political ties or interests between Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean (Middle America) to call it a geopolitical region. Instead, the ties within the CA countries; and the ties within the Caribbean nations, clearly establish them as separate geopolitical regions. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#CE1126">Alex</font></a><i><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#006847">Covarrubias</font></a></i> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Flag_of_Mexico.png/15px-Flag_of_Mexico.png" alt="" width="15" height="9" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" /></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexCovarrubias_5239.html" title="User talk:AlexCovarrubias"><font size="1" color="green">( Let's talk! )</font></a></sup> 21:29, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Corticopia, I think I provided a lengthy list of references concerning Mexico's locations geopolitical or otherwise in <a href="../../../m/e/x/Talk%7EMexico_baf0.html" title="Talk:Mexico">Talk:Mexico</a>. I am not denying the fact that "Middle America" is also used, but my "opinion" is based on that lenghty list of references, many if not most of which either do not even mention Middle America and do not (except one) consider Mexico to be a Central American country geopolitically. Having a source that backs a point of view while a lengthy list has already been provided seems unnecessary. That's why I am surprised this discussion is still going on in here. --<a href="../../../d/%C3%BA/n/User%7ED%C3%BAnadan_4a59.html" title="User:DÃºnadan"><font color="blue">the</font><font color="#339900">D</font><font color="blue">Ãºnadan</font></a> 05:57, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes: <i>you</i> provided a list of references (which I do not challenge per se), and others also exist. I am not arguing that Central America does not <i>usually</i> include Mexico: it is the assertions that it <i>never</i> does (in any sense, geopolitically/historically) that is irksome and false. As well, just because a term is not noted in the references cited, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">that doesn't exclude</a> <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">other reputable ones that do</a>. Further to that and the above, I am researching Middle America and will report back shortly.</dd>
<dd>And, yes: it still is necessary. If you wonder why this discussion is still going on: part of the reason -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_%28Americas%29_40fd.html" title="North America (Americas)">North America (Americas)</a>. This is, IMO, effectively a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">point-of-view fork</a> of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>: <i>none</i> of the sources listed there indicate it is a region -- they do say other things -- and there's absolutely no reason why this information cannot be incorporated into <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> (if not already). As well, the instigating editor -- who is continuing to ram a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">point-of-view</a> down our collective throats -- adds notations of this nebulous region in a variety of spots while <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">minimising (read: undue weight)</a> sourced information about Middle America (the Dow references indicates its a cultural region (which contains Mesoamerica).

<dl>
<dd>That is a lie. I never deleted "Middle America" as you accused me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Americas_%28terminology%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=112074085" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Americas_%28terminology%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=112074085" rel="nofollow">here</a> (because now you have deleted your accusation), I changed its position in the article (from geopolitic region to geographic regions). And I think the Dow reference is about the term "Middle America" as a translation for "Mesoamerica" (not the current Middle America) as you indicated in the talk page Mesoamerica. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#CE1126">Alex</font></a><i><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#006847">Covarrubias</font></a></i> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Flag_of_Mexico.png/15px-Flag_of_Mexico.png" alt="" width="15" height="9" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" /></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexCovarrubias_5239.html" title="User talk:AlexCovarrubias"><font size="1" color="green">( Let's talk! )</font></a></sup> 14:17, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I should qualify this: you placed Middle America upfront, yes, but did not place it where it arguably belongs as well -- in the Cultural section. As for Dow, now who's confusing the issue? The Dow reference -- regardless of what you "think" it says -- <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">specifically indicates upfront</a> that "Middle America is the culture area that includes all the cultures south of the United States to the borders of Colombia" (sic) (essentially the North American portion of <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>) and that "Mesoamerica is a sub-area of Middle America." Generally, they are two different concepts which coincide with similar names. Corticopia 14:21, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm glad that you clarify that in fact I didn't erase the term from the article as you accused me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Americas_%28terminology%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=112074085" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Americas_%28terminology%29&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=112074085" rel="nofollow">here</a> (now you edited your comment and deleted the acussation). However, you can't blame me for "not placing it ALSO in the cultural section", because the term was never included there since I started editing this article. Also, I did not have any reference saying Middle America was a "cultural region". I'll check your source, I need to read it well to see if he's refering to nowadays Middle America or to Mesoamerica. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#CE1126">Alex</font></a><i><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#006847">Covarrubias</font></a></i> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Flag_of_Mexico.png/15px-Flag_of_Mexico.png" alt="" width="15" height="9" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" /></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexCovarrubias_5239.html" title="User talk:AlexCovarrubias"><font size="1" color="green">( Let's talk! )</font></a></sup> 14:39, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes: sorry about that -- the article has undergone significant revisions recently and since it was created. Anyhow, the Dow reference is <i><a href="http://personalwebs.oakland.edu/~dow/personal/papers/meso/ca_of_ma.html" class="external text" title="http://personalwebs.oakland.edu/~dow/personal/papers/meso/ca_of_ma.html" rel="nofollow">here</a></i>. He does clearly differentiates between the two, including one (Mesoamerica) within the larger region (Middle America). Corticopia 14:50, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So, if this is true and author Dow defines Middle America as a cultural area, that's only one reference. Perhaps that is his opinion based in his research. I think you should bring more sources (one opinion is not enough), because I have never heard Middle America being defined as a cultural area (e.g. Mexico and the Caribbean have very little in common), just as a geographic region, the most extended and easily verifiable knowledge. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#CE1126">Alex</font></a><i><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#006847">Covarrubias</font></a></i> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Flag_of_Mexico.png/15px-Flag_of_Mexico.png" alt="" width="15" height="9" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" /></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexCovarrubias_5239.html" title="User talk:AlexCovarrubias"><font size="1" color="green">( Let's talk! )</font></a></sup> 15:23, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You cannot discount <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable information</a> and dismiss such 'opinions' -- again -- so easily. If I had to choose between the opinion of a published prof and a <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">number of publications</a> and (effectively) an anonymous Wikipedian in Monterrey, you shouldn't have to ask where the preference is. Out of Oakland University (I think), he has published numerous papers on the subject. Actually, most definitions define Middle America merely as a region without qualifying it; thus, one can argue that it merits inclusion in a number of areas. More sources to follow ...

<dd>I haven't followed the debate that closely, so I need some clarification. Corticopia, I see that in the article you are using Fowler and Oxford Dict. as sources to provide an alternative <i>geopolitical</i> definition of North America. I have read both, and as far as I can tell, they present "North America=US+Can" not as a geopolitical term but as common usage. I am not saying that they think geopolitically North America is US+Can+Mex. I really can't assume anything. They only present the geographical definition of the whole continent (all the way to Panama), plus the common [colloquial] usage of North America to refer to Anglo America. I wouldn't use them as a source for a "geopolitical" term. I think we can't assume anything from those two sources when it comes to geopolitics (neither US+Can nor US+Can+Mex). --<a href="../../../d/%C3%BA/n/User%7ED%C3%BAnadan_4a59.html" title="User:DÃºnadan"><font color="blue">the</font><font color="#339900">D</font><font color="blue">Ãºnadan</font></a> 16:07, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sure -- I understand. OK: this is within the lens that <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geography.html" title="Geography">geography</a> is comprised of two basic disciplines: <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_geography.html" title="Physical geography">physical geography</a> (essentially, landforms and water) and <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_geography.html" title="Human geography">human geography</a> (as a result of anthropogenic influence and interaction). All others stem from those. A function of the latter is <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_geography.html" title="Political geography">political geography</a> (which, according to my <i>Penguin Dictionary of International Relations</i>, is effectively the same as <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geopolitics.html" title="Geopolitics">geopolitics</a>). When using <a href="../../../s/t/a/States.html" title="States">states</a> to describe or delineate regions (in this case geopolitical ones), we are doing so based on human geography and, yes, political geography. It stems from that since North America is frequently reckoned as just the US and Canada (and both Fowler's and Oxford indicate that), it is a geopolitical region of the Americas -- it may be other things too. Similarly, this may be why <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-America_aae9.html" title="Anglo-America">Anglo-America</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_America_144f.html" title="Northern America">Northern America</a> are sometimes used to pair just the two countries. This doesn't deny the integration of the two countries in a truly political sense, nor does it deny the integration of the US, Canada, and Mexico -- it merely means that different terms are used to group different entities. Actually, if anything, the <i>geopolitical</i> definition of North American continent extends all the way to the southern border of Panama (as any number of maps/atlases will attest to when consulting a political map), and there shouldn't be an issue with that. Regarding <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_%28Americas%29_40fd.html" title="North America (Americas)">North America (Americas)</a>, consult my comments there.</dd>
<dd>At its base, Middle America -- because it is generally defined in terms of the states that comprise it (perhaps because of a lack of other frames of reference that people generally comprehend) -- is a notion of political geography (and, per Dow, cultural geography, given the inclusion of prior Mesoamerican cultures and the linguistic unity of <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish.html" title="Spanish">Spanish</a> speaking lands in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>). It may also be one of physical geography -- the mid-latitudes of the Americas, which includes Mexico in the greater land bridge adjoining North and South. This also explains why Colombia and Venezuela are sometimes included. Corticopia 16:26, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I also need more sources to substantiate the assertion that Middle America is a geopolitical region (though the above links I added allude to that). I'll be back later. Corticopia 16:26, 2 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't get exactly what you are trying to say. Would you please explain it to me? Are you now saying that the ONLY geopolitical definition for North America should be from Canada to Panama? God... and you are ignoring the definitions of geopolitics I pasted here. Just because the mention of the states that a geographic region comprises, that doesn't mean they make up a geopolitical region. Geopolitics are much deep than that, again, you need to read the definitions. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#CE1126">Alex</font></a><i><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#006847">Covarrubias</font></a></i> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Flag_of_Mexico.png/15px-Flag_of_Mexico.png" alt="" width="15" height="9" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" /></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexCovarrubias_5239.html" title="User talk:AlexCovarrubias"><font size="1" color="green">( Let's talk! )</font></a></sup> 16:42, 2 March 2007 (UTC) <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#CE1126">Alex</font></a><i><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#006847">Covarrubias</font></a></i> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Flag_of_Mexico.png/15px-Flag_of_Mexico.png" alt="" width="15" height="9" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" /></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexCovarrubias_5239.html" title="User talk:AlexCovarrubias"><font size="1" color="green">( Let's talk! )</font></a></sup> 16:39, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Not exactly -- it is <i>the</i> prevailing definition of North America. I'm willing to accept that there may be other definitions and it may be something else (e.g., region), but they should be dealt with in the <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> article, not in a fork whose sources don't support the content. Whether NA is considered a continent or <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subcontinent.html" title="Subcontinent">subcontinent</a> is a matter of debate, but I have not seen a source indicating that <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_America_93d9.html" title="Central America">Central America</a> is a continent or subcontinent but a region of either. Ditto for Middle America, and I make no assertion that it is anything <i>but</i> a region ... of some sort.</dd>
<dd>And nothing has been ignored: according to the <i>Penguin Dictionary of International Relations</i> (in my possession), geopolitics (pp. 197-8) is:
<ul>
<li>A method of foreign policy analysis which seeks to understand, explain and predict international political behaviour primarily in terms of geographical variables, such as location, size, climate, topography, demography, natural resources, and technological development and potential. Political identity and action is thus seen to be (more or less) determined by geography...</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>It later goes on to say that:
<ul>
<li>[because of misuse of the term 'geopolitics' before WWII], in UK and US academic circles where the term 'political geography' was preferred to the more value-laden 'geopolitics.'</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Arguably, the cultures of <i>Mesoamerica</i> long since unified Mexico and its Central American neighbours in an ethnohistorical/cultural context and, as a result of the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_conquest.html" title="Spanish conquest">Spanish conquest</a>, the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_language.html" title="Spanish language">Spanish language</a> (per <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>) later did so in a linguistic/historical context, thereby making it a geopolitical region. <i>That's</i> macroanalysis (and touched on in Dow); anyhow, I've gotta go but I'll source later.</dd>
<dd>As well, there's no doubt that <a href="../../../n/a/f/NAFTA_941e.html" title="NAFTA">NAFTA</a> has facilitated integration (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Continentalism.html" title="Continentalism">continentalism</a>), but that merely means that the trade pact has three members in North America currently. Shall we exclude <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> from North America/Americas because it wasn't a member of the <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organization_of_American_States_a97a.html" title="Organization of American States">OAS</a> from 1948 to 1990?

<dd>I think that if we want to solve this, we should be more clear and direct. What I am saying is that I don't see where all this debate is going to. Can, Mex and US are seeking better integration, what strenghten the sourced information that they make up a geopolitical region. On the other hand, there are no equivalent efforts between CA and Mexico, or between CA, Mex and the Caribbean. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#CE1126">Alex</font></a><i><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#006847">Covarrubias</font></a></i> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Flag_of_Mexico.png/15px-Flag_of_Mexico.png" alt="" width="15" height="9" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" /></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexCovarrubias_5239.html" title="User talk:AlexCovarrubias"><font size="1" color="green">( Let's talk! )</font></a></sup> 17:46, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with you about movement, but content editions are not made in a vacuum. And we should be more clear and direct, and I may also be guilty of not being clear. Anyhow, on Dunadan's talk page, you indicated increased integration between Canada and Mexico while indicating you thought that I didn't know what I was talking about regarding geopolitics, while, here and elsewhere, minimising -- again -- current organisational and other relationships in the Americas (e.g., within 'Middle America') like CARICOM and the ethnocultural/linguistic unity of <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> which counters that, so you seem to be <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">cherry-picking</a> items to suit your purpose. Corticopia 17:51, 2 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>False. Read above, don't be hasty. I clearly indicated above that CA and the Caribbean (both inside Middle America) have more integration inside their regions: the Caribbean has the CARICOM, the Central American countries have the CA Parliament and other CA institutions. Also the CA countries negociated in group (again, because they are integrated in geopolitical sense) the CAFTA with the US. Also I mentioned that the CARICOM countries have a political agreement to vote in group in the <a href="../../../o/a/s/OAS_ed16.html" title="OAS">OAS</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/_/UN_0433.html" title="UN">UN</a>. That's geopolitics, the political/economical relations between countries. Such integration is not present between Mex, CA and the Caribbean nor seeked. They simply don't make up a geopolitical region. Just geopolitically! I'm not denying the fact that a part of Mexico is included in CA geophysically or that Mexico is not inside the geographical region of Middle America. If you remember, I conceded you with that and stopped editing the article Middle America. So, let's be direct. Exaclty what you want to change in the article? And please, be direct. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#CE1126">Alex</font></a><i><a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexCovarrubias_bc0e.html" title="User:AlexCovarrubias"><font color="#006847">Covarrubias</font></a></i> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/1/17/Flag_of_Mexico.png/15px-Flag_of_Mexico.png" alt="" width="15" height="9" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Mexico.png_27c5.html" /></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/l/e/User_talk%7EAlexCovarrubias_5239.html" title="User talk:AlexCovarrubias"><font size="1" color="green">( Let's talk! )</font></a></sup> 18:03, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just want to add that <b>geopolitically</b> North America comprises Canada, US and Mexico, or Canada and the US, but it never includes Greenland, St. Pierre or Bermuda. These dependencies do not politically play a role in the region. The three of them are traditionally linked to European politics more than N.
