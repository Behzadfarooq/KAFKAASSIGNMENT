<p>The "Once in Hollywood" section describes the procedure introduced this season as if it were present in all seasons. This needs to be noted as the procedure for season 4, with a description of the previous semifinal sequence (which was drastically different) mentioned. Also, if I understand correctly, these aren't the finals per se, as that is reserved for when the performers start playing on the big stage, instead of the small studio. Should the table be modified to only include the final 12, since that's the cutoff point used for the other seasons? <a href="../../../m/o/0/User%7EMo0_25cf.html" title="User:Mo0">Mo0</a>[<a href="../../../m/o/0/User_talk%7EMo0_eb76.html" title="User talk:Mo0">talk</a>] 03:42, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Disqualified Contestants</span></h2>
<p>Shouldn't something here be added about the habit of the producers for eliminating/disqualifying contestants for various reasons? EX: the first season a young man was elminated due to an outstanding warrant for his arrest, and I believe it was the second season when fan-favourite Frenchie Davis was diqualified for performing on pornographic websites. Ironically she has gone on to greater success than MANY of the other contestants. <a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacian_4ea0.html" title="User:Pacian">Pacian</a> 09:28, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Table</span></h2>
<p>Is it just me, or does the "American Idol Finalists (with dates of elimination)" table bother anyone else? I think the information in it is great, but it's placement leaves a lot to be desired. To find the contestents for the current season, one must scroll way up. This is unnecessary—the lists should be adjacent to the seasons they pertain to. Unless anyone objects, I'm going to split up the table and make them part of the seasons they pertain to. Any comments? <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot"></a>— <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot">Frecklefoot</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFrecklefoot_f6c2.html" title="User talk:Frecklefoot">Talk</a> 19:21, Apr 14, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I'm concerned, that makes far more sense than the current layout. What about including song lists? Is that simply redundant information, since it's available on <a href="http://www.idolonfox.com" class="external text" title="http://www.idolonfox.com" rel="nofollow">Idolonfox</a>? I think it would be nice to have that information collected in this article. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHermione1980_7d5f.html" title="User:Hermione1980">Hermione1980</a> 00:49, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>As long as they can be added without making the article look cluttered, I'd say go for it. It'd be good to have the information here since we don't know how long Fox will keep that info up. I'll go ahead with the table splits soon. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot"></a>— <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot">Frecklefoot</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFrecklefoot_f6c2.html" title="User talk:Frecklefoot">Talk</a> 14:30, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here is what I've come up with for the song list, for season four. Any comments? <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHermione1980_7d5f.html" title="User:Hermione1980">Hermione1980</a> 22:06, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now that I see them, I can't see how they can be added to the main article without cluttering it. I think it'd be great as a seperate linked article (e.g. <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Idol_Season_Four_songs_6f18.html" title="American Idol Season Four songs">American Idol Season Four songs</a> or some such thing). How are you organizing the singers? By their first names? I think it'd be even more useful if you organized them by the order they performed, though this isn't a huge deal. Nice job, they look good! <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot"></a>— <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot">Frecklefoot</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFrecklefoot_f6c2.html" title="User talk:Frecklefoot">Talk</a> 18:11, Apr 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have the order they sang in for the finals, I think, so I can modify the table to reflect that. I don't have the performance order for the other seasons, though, so someone would have to leave that information on my <a href="../../../h/e/r/User_talk%7EHermione1980_21b0.html" title="User talk:Hermione1980">talk page</a>. I would be happy to do something similar for the other seasons, if I can get the information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One thought: instead of just putting the song list in a separate article, should each season get its own page? That would maybe avoid the problem of taking the song list "out of context". I don't know if that's a problem in this case or not. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHermione1980_7d5f.html" title="User:Hermione1980">Hermione1980</a> 21:42, 21 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Making articles for each season might make sense. I don't know, this article is getting pretty long. I say "yes," but let's wait for others to chime in. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot"></a>— <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot">Frecklefoot</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFrecklefoot_f6c2.html" title="User talk:Frecklefoot">Talk</a> 14:13, Apr 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>...but wasn't the 13,000 vote difference between Clay and Ruben a mistake by the person who wrote the card for Ryan Seacrest? As I remember the events, he later stated that there was a mistake and that the difference between them was a mere 1300 votes. This is part of the reason for the heavy controversy of the issue, as it falls well within the margin for error.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Individual season articles?</span></h2>
<p>The recent vfd discussions have gotten me thinking. Perhaps we should take a cue from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Apprentice_e490.html" title="The Apprentice">The Apprentice</a> articles and have breakout articles for each season. The articles for the lesser known contestants could be folded into the individual seasons with articles for those having genuine success in the industry remaining as they are. We could also clear the main article of some of the long charts and lists and get into the week to week dynamics of each season without crowding out the important info in the main article.

<dd>Not that I've heard of. People have been referring to people they admire/aspire to as their "idols" for at least 20 years or so (from my memory), but probably longer.

<p>I replaced the "controversy" section. If someone wants to rename or edit it, I won't complain. But I think that at the very least this article should include at least <i>some</i> reference to the criticism that American Idol has received. I don't think these pages are intended primarily as a place for fan gushing. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 17:34, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Controversy" section:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the beginning of the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> season, <i>American Idol</i> garnered some controversy with regard to alleged homophobic comments made by talent judges. <a href="../../../g/l/a/GLAAD_9625.html" title="GLAAD">GLAAD</a> has posted a statement on their website complaining about said statements. <a href="http://www.glaad.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.glaad.org/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>American Idol</i> has also been criticized for its judgment processes. It has been alleged that <i>American Idol</i> willingly builds up the expectations of many singers who they know would not truly have a chance at winning the competition. Prior to meeting with the three main judges of the show, Paula, Randy, and Simon, singers must undergo auditions with other judges who act as prescreeners for the three main judges. It is alleged that these prescreening judges allow many untalented singers to pass through to the main three judges merely in an attempt to exploit them for entertainment purposes. By passing them through an initial prescreening audition process, the prescreening judges often give untalented singers the impression that they have talent. These singers then assume they are in fact talented singers who may have a chance at winning the competition. When Randy, Paula, and Simon, then tell these untalented singers that they are in fact untalented, the singers are shocked and the stage is set for the emotional breakdowns that are sometimes aired on the show. Some critics have questioned the ethics of this practice.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>American Idol</i> has also come under fire for maintaining what some claim to be total control of the careers of the winners of the contest. Former cohost Brian Dunkleman referred to the show as "owning" the winning contestants, noting that winners sign contracts to only record with companies owned by the show's producers and to allow related agencies to manage their careers.</li>
</ul>

With relation to controversy, I vaguely recall reading somewhere some grumbling over the fact that only vocal talents qualify, leaving musicians (particularly instrumentalists) out in the cold. I can't for the life of me remember where I saw this so I can't add it. Does anyone else recall seeing something like this? Didn't one of the shows (American or Canadian Idol) actually address this by allowing its contestants to play instruments during a round? <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 17:51, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We have a set of <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">guidelines</a> on external links. Have a look at those for a better understanding. Based on those guidelines, in an article like this one, the preferred links are to the official site and "a link to one major fansite". There may be scope for other links but they would need to fit within the guidelines. -- <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrylb_eb29.html" title="User:Barrylb">Barrylb</a> 00:54, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's interesting to read that page of guidelines. It seems quite open to the subjective views of those that moderate page edits. Given that other pages on Wikipedia have more than 1 link to a "one major fan site" and that the fan site on this page is not one (it's actually a discussion forum only with no original articles or other original content) it seems that the guidelines need to be strengthened. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 58.84.73.80 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_58.84.73.80_c615.html" title="Special:Contributions/58.84.73.80">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>If you have a problem with the guidelines, please feel free to bring it up on that particular discussion page. However, I would like to remidn you that <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Spam</a> advises you to "review your intentions. Wikipedia is not a space for the promotion of products, Web sites, fandoms, ideologies, or other memes." The whole of sites such as <a href="http://american.idolblog.com/" class="external free" title="http://american.idolblog.com/" rel="nofollow">http://american.idolblog.com/</a> (which is currently being added to many pages and needs to be removed..) is original research and unchecked claims made by individuals with no interest in NPOV. Therefore, it is completely unencyclopedic to include such referances on a commercial site (see ad content). If any editor disagrees that this site is being spammed and is inappropriate for American Idol entries, then I encourage you to take that discussion up.

<p>It's really no big problem but the topic was mentioned in case others find it difficult to add external links in future and hopefully they'll check here first. The Wikipedia:External_links guidelines state that fan listings, for example, should not be generally be included yet look at any page on Wikipedia devoted to a TV show like Desperate Housewives for example and there they are. You'll see fanlistings and other inappropriate links regularly. Strange how they all made it past moderators but the point about NPOV answers the question so this discussion was useful and much appreciated. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 58.84.75.228 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_58.84.75.228_0ab2.html" title="Special:Contributions/58.84.75.228">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Well that's what was meant about the subjective nature of the guidelines. As previously stated you'll find inappropriate links in many places on Wikipedia from the Big Brother USA page to The Young and The Restless page to whichever page you like. They're all there so it is to be hoped that by raising the point (and receiving the reply about NPOV) that others will see this and learn why it's difficult to get linked here or anywhere else. This just happens to be a popular topic currently and a good place to mention it. It's a most insightful discussion topic indeed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 58.84.71.132 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_58.84.71.132_fb2a.html" title="Special:Contributions/58.84.71.132">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Time Zone Questions</span></h2>
<p>I have a question about time zones, I don't understand why they have the show in Hollywood but they don't use the Western Time Zone. Is there so much East coast bias that the show can only be live on the East Coast when it is filmed on the West Coast? Why don't they just show the show at 6:00 on the west coast, and 9:00 on the east coast and have it really be live everywhere insead of tape-delayed where it is filmed?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Barely anyone is home to watch anything at 6:00pm. And if the show aired live at 9:00pm west coast time, east coast viewers would have to wait until midnight. Idol isn't the only show that does that, Academy Awards and most other shows do it too. It's a fact of life, want to watch it live ... move. lol. <a href="../../../h/e/y/User%7EHeyNow10029_96cc.html" title="User:HeyNow10029">HeyNow10029</a> 20:55, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
