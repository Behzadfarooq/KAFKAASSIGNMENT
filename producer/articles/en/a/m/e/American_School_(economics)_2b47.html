One looks to underworking the Hindoo, and sinking the rest of the world to his level; the other to raising the standard of man throughout the world to our level. One looks to pauperism, ignorance, depopulation, and barbarism; the other to increasing wealth, comfort, intelligence, combination of action, and civilization. One looks towards universal war; the other towards universal peace. One is the English system; the other we may be proud to call the American system, for it is the only one ever devised the tendency of which was that of <em>elevating</em> while <em>equalizing</em> the condition of man throughout the world."<sup id="_ref-Carey_Harmony_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Carey_Harmony" title="">[21]</a></sup></p>

<p>"Clay first used the term “American System” in 1824, although he had been working for its specifics for many years previously. Portions of the American System were enacted by Congress. The Second Bank of the United States was rechartered in 1816 for 20 years. High tariffs were maintained from the days of Hamilton until 1832. However, the national system of internal improvements was never adequately funded; the failure to do so was due in part to sectional jealousies and constitutional scruples about such expenditures."<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[24]</a></sup></p>

<p>The American System was supported by New England and the Mid-Atlantic, which had a large manufacturing base. It protected their new factories from foreign competition.</p>
<p>The South opposed the American System because its <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantation.html" title="Plantation">plantation</a> owners were heavily reliant on production of cotton for export, and the American System produced lower demand for their cotton and created higher costs for manufactured goods.

The biography continues: "Mr. Clay's American system, to which Mr. Calhoun referred, was in full success. The bank, the protective policy, the internal improvement system, and the "general welfare" rule for constitutional construction, composed this celebrated policy. […] An extra session of congress was called in the summer of 1841 [for] the restoration of his American system […] When the tariff question came up again in 1842, the compromise of 1833 was rudely overthrown, and the protective system placed in the ascendent.

<p>In power and without southern opposition, the Republican Party was able to move quickly upon its promised platform planks, rooted in the American School policies of national banking, tariff protection, and internal improvements.

<p>The United States continued these policies throughout the later half of the 19th century. President William McKinley (1896–1901) stated at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[They say] if you had not had the Protective Tariff things would be a little cheaper. Well, whether a thing is cheap or dear depends upon what we can earn by our daily labor. Free trade cheapens the product by cheapening the producer. Protection cheapens the product by elevating the producer. Under free trade the trader is the master and the producer the slave. Protection is but the law of nature, the law of self-preservation, of self-development, of securing the highest and best destiny of the race of man.</p>
<p>"[It is said] that protection is immoral…. Why, if protection builds up and elevates 63,000,000 [the U.S. population] of people, the influence of those 63,000,000 of people elevates the rest of the world. We cannot take a step in the pathway of progress without benefitting mankind everywhere. Well, they say, ‘Buy where you can buy the cheapest'…. Of course, that applies to labor as to everything else. Let me give you a maxim that is a thousand times better than that, and it is the protection maxim: ‘Buy where you can pay the easiest.' And that spot of earth is where labor wins its highest rewards."<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[25]</a></sup></p>

<p>The "American System" was a term coined by Henry Clay to describe an economic plan, rooted in American School principles, that he proposed in 1824 in speech before Congress. The term became synomonous with other phrases such as "National System" and "Protective System" as it was used over the course of time. As a political expression, this term, although used by the Republican Party in 1932 to describe their economic policies (especially the protective tariff), fell out of disfavor at somepoint in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>The term "American System" has been a political campaign slogan used by politicians from Clay's day to today; it is the less common name together with "National System" for the "American School" of the national economic policy of the United States from the American Civil War until sometime in the twentieth century; and it is by definition an economic school of thought with ideas related to other economic schools of thought.</p>

<p><i>An example of political rhetoric for the "American System" during Clay's time:</i></p>
<p>"While in Congress, it will be seen that Mr. Stewart served on several of the most important committees, among them as Chairman of the Committee on the Tariff, and the Committee of Internal Improvements, constituting together, what was well called by Mr. Clay, "The American System "-in the advocacy of which, Mr. Stewart commenced and ended his political life. This system, he always contended, lay at the foundation of the national prosperity-the one protecting the national industry, and the other developing the national resources. He called it the "political thermometer," which always had and always would indicate the rise and fall of the national prosperity. In concluding one of his speeches, he put this whole matter in a nutshell when he said: The true American policy is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>1st. Protect and cherish your national industry by a wise system of finance, selecting in the first place those articles which you can and ought to supply to the extent of your own wants-food, clothing, habitation, and defence-and to these give ample and adequate piotection, so as to secure at all times an abundant supply at home. Next select the <em>luxuries</em> consumed by the rich, and impose on them such duties as the wants of the Government may require for revenue; and then take the necessaries of life consumed by the poor, and articles which we cannot supply, used in our manufactories, and make them free, or subject to the lowest rates of duty.</li>
<li>2d. Adopt a system of national improvements, embracing the great rivers, lakes, and main arteries of communication, leaving those of a <em>local</em> character to the care of the States; and on these expend the surplus revenue only; thus uniting and binding together the distant parts of our common country, and at the same time securing the most efficient system of defence in war, and the cheapest and best system of commercial and social intercourse in peace.</li>
<li>3d. Introduce enlightened economy in every branch of the public expenditures. Lighten the burdens, diversify the employments, and secure and increase the rewards of labor in all its departments. And,</li>
<li>4th. In your foreign relations follow the advice of the father of his country-" observe good faith and justice towards all nations-cultivate peace and harmony with all." Thereby illustrating the beauty and perfection of our Republican institutions, holding up a great example of "liberty and independence," for the nations of the earth to admire and imitate. This was the great and true American system which he hoped yet to see adopted and carried out. We owe a great example to the world-let it be given; this was the duty, as he trusted it would be the destiny of this, our great and glorious Republic."<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[47]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-U_Mich_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-U_Mich" title="">[48]</a></sup></li>

<p>According to historian Michael Lind</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Many things that educated people in the English-speaking world think that they know about economic history are, in fact, false. It is not true that there was a golden age of free trade ended by America's adoption of the much-reviled Smoot-Hawley tariff in 1930; a tariff which is unfairly blamed for the rise of fascism and the second world war-phenomena which originated, respectively, in the cultural trauma of the first world war and the geopolitical ambitions of Germany, Japan and Italy, rather than the depression. The school of thought in economic policy with the greatest global influence between the 1800s and the mid-20th century was not the laissez-faire "English School" of Adam Smith and David Ricardo but the rival school of economic nationalism, which is more accurately labelled as "strategic economics" because its prescriptions have been followed successfully by empires, trading blocs and city-states as well as nation states. In the US in the 1790s, the brilliant first secretary of the treasury, Alexander Hamilton, laid out a programme for the industrialisation of the country by means of infant-industry protection and other policies. Hamilton's programme was developed in the next generation by Henry Clay, under the name of "the American System," and implemented under Clay's disciple and admirer Abraham Lincoln and his successors during the period between the 1860s and the 1940s, when the US became the planet's leading manufacturing economy behind a high wall of tariffs. The lessons of the "American school" of "national economy," transmitted to Germany by <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_List_d948.html" title="Friedrich List">Friedrich List</a>, formed the basis of state-sponsored industrialisation in Wilhelmine Germany. Moreover, during a visit to Germany in the 1870s, Toshimichi Okubo, one of the leaders of the Meiji Restoration, became acquainted with the <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Hamilton_3fe5.html" title="Alexander Hamilton">Hamilton</a>-<a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_List_d948.html" title="Friedrich List">List</a> tradition. Returning to Japan, Okubo founded the ministry of home affairs, which promoted Japanese industry, and in 1874 issued an equivalent of Hamilton's 1791 Report on Manufactures, in the form of his influential Proposal for Industrial Promotion. By the early 20th century, then, the US, Germany and Japan had successfully used strategic economics to catch up with Britain and (in the case of the first two nations) to surpass it. Even Britain's dominions of Australia and Canada, emulating American and German practice rather than British theory, insisted on the right to use tariffs to keep out goods from Britain and establish their own industrial base. Not that Britain had any right to complain. From the Tudors until the early 19th century, Britain used various protectionist devices to promote its own industries. The 18th-century prime minister Robert Walpole, remembered chiefly today as a corrupt politician pilloried by Alexander Pope, turns out, according to Chang, to have been an industrial-policy mastermind who inspired Alexander Hamilton. Only when Britain's industrial supremacy was secure did the British begin to promote free trade, in the hope of wiping out competitive industries in the US, continental Europe and elsewhere. Following the Napoleonic wars, which stimulated the growth of American manufacturing by suspending transatlantic trade, Lord Henry Brougham in 1816 told parliament: "It is well worthwhile to incur a loss upon the first exportation, in order by the glut, to stifle in the cradle, those rising manufactures, in the US, which the war had forced into existence, contrary to the natural course of things." The "natural course of things," according to British politicians and British theorists of free trade, required the US to supply Britain with agricultural goods and raw materials and to import, rather than make, all of its machinery and manufactured goods. John Adams wrote in 1819: "I am old enough to remember the war of 1745, and its end; the war of 1755, and its close; the war of 1775, and its termination; the war of 1812, and its pacification… The British manufacturers, immediately after the peace, disgorged upon us all their stores of merchandise and manufactures, not only without profit, but at certain loss for a time, with the express purpose of annihilating all our manufacturers, and ruining all our manufactories." In India and Ireland, the British imperial authorities actually outlawed the native textile industries. Like Britain, the US protected and subsidised its industries while it was a developing country, switching to free trade only in 1945, when most of its industrial competitors had been wiped out by the second world war and the US enjoyed a virtual monopoly in many manufacturing sectors. The revival of Europe and Japan by the 1970s eliminated these monopoly profits, and the support for free trade of industrial-state voters in the American midwest and northeast declined. Today, support for free-trade globalism in the US comes chiefly from the commodity-exporting south and west and from US multinationals which have moved their factories to low-wage countries like Mexico and China. Like 19th-century Britain, 21st-century America tells countries that are trying to catch up: do what we say, not what we did."<sup id="_ref-New_America_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-New_America" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

Mercantilism suggests that the ruling <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government.html" title="Government">government</a> should advance these goals by playing a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protectionism.html" title="Protectionism">protectionist</a> role in the economy, by encouraging <a href="../../../e/x/p/Exports.html" title="Exports">exports</a> and discouraging <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_trade.html" title="International trade">imports</a>, especially through the use of <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tariffs.html" title="Tariffs">tariffs</a>. The economic policy based upon these ideas is often called the mercantile system. This system and school of thought existed prior to the American School and Classical economics.</p>

It is seen by many as the first modern school of economic thought. Some authors, such as <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Maynard_Keynes_664d.html" title="John Maynard Keynes">John Maynard Keynes</a> expand the definition of classical economics to include <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>. Classical economists attempted to explain growth and development. They produced their "magnificent dynamics" during a period in which <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> was emerging from a past <a href="../../../f/e/u/Feudal.html" title="Feudal">feudal</a> society and in which the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_revolution.html" title="Industrial revolution">industrial revolution</a> was leading to vast changes in society. These changes also raised the question of how a society could be organized around a system in which every individual sought his or her own (monetary) gain. Why would such a society not collapse in chaos? Classical economists reoriented economics away from an analysis of the ruler's personal interests to a class-based interest. <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physiocrat.html" title="Physiocrat">Physiocrat</a> <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francois_Quesnay_bda9.html" title="Francois Quesnay">Francois Quesnay</a> and <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Smith_aff1.html" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>, for example, identified the wealth of a nation with the yearly national income, instead of the king's treasury. Smith saw this income as produced by labor applied to land and capital equipment. Once land and capital equipment are appropriated by individuals, the national income is divided up between laborers, landlords, and capitalists in the form of wages, rent, and profits. The American School can be seen as a modified type of classical economics; specifically modified to serve the specific political needs and desires of an industrially backward America.</p>

Keynesian <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics.html" title="Economics">economics</a> promotes a <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixed_economy.html" title="Mixed economy">mixed economy</a>, where both the state and the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Private_sector.html" title="Private sector">private sector</a> play an important role. The rise of Keynesianism marked the end of <a href="../../../l/a/i/Laissez-faire.html" title="Laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a> economics (economic theory based on the belief that markets and the private sector could operate well on their own, without state intervention). In Keynes's theory, general (<i><a href="../../../m/a/c/Macroeconomics.html" title="Macroeconomics">macro-level</a></i>) trends can overwhelm the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microeconomics.html" title="Microeconomics">micro-level</a> behavior of individuals. Instead of the economic process being based on continuous improvements in <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potential_output.html" title="Potential output">potential output</a>, as most <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_economics.html" title="Classical economics">classical economists</a> had believed from the late <a href="../../../1/7/0/1700s.html" title="1700s">1700s</a> on, Keynes asserted the importance of <a href="../../../a/g/g/Aggregate_demand.html" title="Aggregate demand">aggregate demand</a> for <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_%28economics%29.html" title="Good (economics)">goods</a> as the driving factor of the <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy.html" title="Economy">economy</a>, especially in periods of downturn. From this he argued that government policies could be used to promote demand at a <i>macro</i> level, to fight high <a href="../../../u/n/e/Unemployment.html" title="Unemployment">unemployment</a> and <a href="../../../d/e/f/Deflation_%28economics%29.html" title="Deflation (economics)">deflation</a> of the sort seen during the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a>. A central conclusion of Keynesian economics is that there is no strong automatic tendency for output and employment to move toward <a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_employment.html" title="Full employment">full employment</a> levels. This, Keynes thought, conflicts with the tenets of classical economics, and those schools, such as <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supply-side_economics.html" title="Supply-side economics">supply-side economics</a> or the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austrian_economics.html" title="Austrian economics">Austrian School</a>, which assume a general tendency towards <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_equilibrium.html" title="Economic equilibrium">equilibrium</a> in a restrained money creation economy. In <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neoclassical_economics.html" title="Neoclassical economics">neoclassical economics</a>, which combines Keynesian macro concepts with a micro foundation, the conditions of <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_equilibrium.html" title="General equilibrium">General equilibrium</a> allow for price adjustment to achieve this goal. More broadly, Keynes saw this as a <i>general</i> theory, in which resource utilization could be high or low, whereas previous economics focused on the <i>particular</i> case of full utilization. The acceptance of Keynesian economics completes the change in American policy from one appropriate to an economic and technological underdog on the world stage to the foremost leader in finance, military, technology and industry. The change in policy with regard to the American System reflected not a change in beliefs or values but a change in America's position in the world and thus the best policies for serving America's interests.<sup id="_ref-New_America_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-New_America" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>A <a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixed_economy.html" title="Mixed economy">Mixed economy</a> is an economy that contains both private and public, or state owned (or controlled) enterprises so by definition the American School is a mixed system, as perhaps are all <i>actual</i> systems.</p>

The central concept of supply-side economics is Say's Law: "supply creates its own demand," or the idea that one must produce before one has the means to buy. In evaluating public policy, supply-side economics is more concerned with the extent to which a reform will change producer incentives, rather than how it may stimulate demand.

<li id="_note-Michael"><b><a href="#_ref-Michael_0" title="">^</a></b> Lind, Michael: "During the nineteenth century the dominant school of American political economy was the "American School" of developmental economic nationalism… The patron saint of the American School was Alexander Hamilton, whose Report on Manufactures (1791) had called for federal government activism in sponsoring infrastructure development and industrialization behind tariff walls that would keep out British manufactured goods… The American School, elaborated in the nineteenth century by economists like Henry Carey (who advised President Lincoln), inspired the "American System" of Henry Clay and the protectionist import-substitution policies of Lincoln and his successors in the Republican party well into the twentieth century." — "Hamilton's Republic" Part III "The American School of National Economy" pp. 229–30.
