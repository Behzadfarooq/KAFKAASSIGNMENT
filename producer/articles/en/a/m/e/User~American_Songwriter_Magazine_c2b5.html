<p><i>American Songwriter</i> magazine was birthed in May of 1984 by a man known simply as “Bruce.” His goal was to produce a magazine that connected songwriters on all levels of success by showcasing informative articles and features promoting the songwriting craft. It began as small inter-industry publication distributed bi-monthly to mostly members of the Nashville songwriting community. The year 1987 saw a new leader for <i>American Songwriter</i>: Jim Sharp, a nomadic songwriting magazine prophet. Continuing what beloved Bruce had begun, <i>American Songwriter</i> continued to grow and feature songwriters from all genres such as Garth Brooks, Bob Dylan, Poison, Clint Black, John Denver, Smokey Robinson, Wilco, Bon Jovi, Willie Nelson, Billy Joel, Kris Kristofferson, John Mellencamp, Richard Marx, Drive-By-Truckers, Paul McCartney, Elton John, Beck, Dolly Parton, Eric Clapton, R.E.M., Jimmy Buffett, Merle Haggard, Rob Thomas, Toby Keith, Eddie Rabbitt, Roger Miller, Public Enemy, Sheryl Crow, Big &amp; Rich, Tom Petty, Neil Diamond and many, many more. Then came 2004: Not-a-Space-Odyssey. It was a year for the magazine very much like the apocalypse, but with pending optimism. Yes, the magazine once again changed hands. It was at this time that Publisher Thomas B. Clement, Sr., Associate Publisher Robert Clement and Editor-in-Chief Douglas Waterman took the reins of this untamed beast of a magazine. The dynamic trio totally revamped the design, graphics, and writing style. And so the interest of the readership was rejuvenated. All the women and children were saved from an otherwise horrible fate. Even with all of these radical changes, <i>American Songwriter’s</i> overall goals remained as old Bruce would have wanted them: 1. Produce a magazine that connects songwriters on all levels of success. 2. Showcase informative articles and features promoting the songwriting craft.</p>
<p>More specifically post-2004 <i>American Songwriter</i> has laid out these goals for itself.</p>
<center><b>*Inspire*</b><br />
<p>We inspire each other. Whether it’s extraordinary or ordinary, our thoughts define us. Every voice has a story. What inspires you?<br />
<b>*Educate*</b><br />
Every field has a learning curve. Through our conversations with the masters of song you’ll witness how they process and communicate their perspective. They can’t teach how it’s done, but they can tell you how they did it.<br />
<b>*Transcend*</b><br />
From tribal beats and string quartets to folk ballads and guitar rock anthems, we survey the musical landscape. The connection between the individual’s expression and the listener remains the common thread in all music.<br />
<b>*Create*</b><br />
The building blocks of song are equal part words and music, inspiration and perspiration. Intermingled with these are unseen forces like spirit, talent, instinct, luck and raw imagination. So create—for the sake of the song.<br /></p>
Whether you are an avid fan of music or a seasoned songwriter, join and share in our magazine’s dedication to the craft.</center>
