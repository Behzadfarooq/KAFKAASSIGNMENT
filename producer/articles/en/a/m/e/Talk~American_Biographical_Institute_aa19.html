<p>While it is true that the ABI and others market plaques etc. as a bye-product of being listed, this is never a criteria for being listed. Each firm is entitled to their business model and its naive to expect a plaque to be issued free (perhaps the Nobel...) or for them not to earn any money (they do not represent the government).</p>
<p>There is a genuine review process of persons listed although like any other human process it has its error rate. There are some real examples of errors of judgement of these institutes but many of the articles attempting to pull down this business model are by people who are either too idealistic (read "stupid") or simply plain jealous of a peer who got listed but they did not! The ABI for example, is quoted on the bio of many leading persons (including graduates from Harvard) who do respect the fact that they got listed in the first place - its naive to expect all of them to be "suckers". Its more strategic where these people like the branding that these publications confer on them.</p>
<p>By and large the publications are of a decent 95-97% quality with a 3-5% error rate. Also true that they do rely on other prestigous listings (such as Marquis) and there is a whole load of internet research which gets done. The latter is the principal source of risk.</p>
<p>The most prestigious listing is Marquis (over 100 years) who have been reviewed by <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D11F7395A0C708DDDA80994DD404482" class="external text" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0D11F7395A0C708DDDA80994DD404482" rel="nofollow">The New York Times, 2005</a> where they called them an "authoritative tool and valid portrait of [American] society". Forbes 2006 lists refers to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/11/06women_Indra-Nooyi_1S5D.html" class="external text" title="http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/11/06women_Indra-Nooyi_1S5D.html" rel="nofollow">Marquis as one source</a>. An earlier 1999 article by Forbes criticised Marquis, but it's since been taken over and their current reference to Marquis obviously reflects their confidence.</p>
<p>In conclusion, yes these products are imperfect but are still a valuable source of information - they profile people from around the world in different walks of life (nothing wrong with a leading Chef being listed unless we're saying that Chefs don't contribute...). There is currently no valid replacement for these products as the free awards (like the Nobel or a specific countries national awards) go to a handful of people (and there are political undercurrents to these awards...) who are a fraction of the achievers in different walks of life who much deserve recognition/ are an important source of information for researchers.</p>
<p>Hence instead of making a webpage on ABI under fraud, the author would do well to do proper research and think out his arguements. Regards, Paul Davies</p>

<dd>Wonderful to have another editor looking at this article. Please sign your contributions with four tildes as instructed at the top of the edit box. I have removed your material from the article as Wikipedia does not quote itself as evidence. Because you referred to the talk page and your own comments, basically you were providing a <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circular_reference.html" title="Circular reference">circular reference</a>. Evidence must come from third parties. I also removed what is termed <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">weasel words</a> such as <i>many believe</i>. Such phrases suggest something when no evidence is provided. You quote some statistics above on error rates. Where did they come from? It would be useful to have a citation. Having been twice offered <i>Man of the Year</i> I can tell you that the notability requirements for the ABI must be terribly low! Your raise the point about everyone is entitled to a business model. Mainstream biography companies such as <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who%27s_Who_098a.html" title="Who's Who">Who's Who</a> makes its money from selling its books rather than selling entries. I think that is a critical difference. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaustrauser_bb16.html" title="User:Maustrauser">Maustrauser</a> 06:12, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Well, I'm not sure how good or bad your credentials are... it is true that both ABI and IBC Cambridge titles are "sensationalist" in nature but that is the way they market their products. Both products are used by numerous libraries. Marquis for example, <a href="http://seoul.usembassy.gov/cd_rom_collections.html" class="external text" title="http://seoul.usembassy.gov/cd_rom_collections.html" rel="nofollow">is used by the US Embassy libraries</a>and also by respected universities such as <a href="http://er.library.northwestern.edu/details.php?rid=213949" class="external text" title="http://er.library.northwestern.edu/details.php?rid=213949" rel="nofollow">Northwestern</a>and <a href="http://www.hds.harvard.edu/library/research/guides/biography/biography00_all.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hds.harvard.edu/library/research/guides/biography/biography00_all.html" rel="nofollow">Harvard's Biography Resource Center</a>.</p>
<p><br />
Specificly, on ABI (and I have seen their offer letters to senior people) - they have a covering letter confirming selection and a questionnaire asking for details. A third form allows you to select a Plaque should you want one - this is always always optional. You seem to be against them for some reason, did your peer get selected who you're trying to pull down?</p>
<p>Maustrauser - I suspect that ABI will view your article as Defamation. I am also amazed that you simply deleted my para - you obviously don't want another point-of-view to be even given a chance! I'm adding my piece as a SEE ALSO URL - don't delete it again or I will take up the matter with WIKIPEDIA that you're suppressing another's opinion.</p>

<dd>Please sign your posts as requested on the edit box using four tildes. I have no objection to Marquis. Why are you placing ABI and Marquis in the same box? I have no real objection to ABI either. They appear to be fulfilling a need for people to feel good about themselves. I simply wish that people didn't claim that being listed by ABI was a qualification. I deleted your paragraph because it cited Wikipedia as its source as I clearly explained in my reasoning above. Please also see: <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECite_a996.html" title="WP:Cite">WP:Cite</a> Please read Wikipedia policies before accusing me of suppressing other's opinions.

<p>The main article must quote third party opinions, not the TALK PAGE - that's my view of the topic (thats why its called a discussion page...) Point is that there is another point-of-view which is not being currently taken up by your article (or even recognised). Why don't you recognise it? Yes, I agree that Marquis is the most respected of the Who's Who publications.</p>

<dd>Paul, I have not removed ANY material from the talk page. Thus I cannot understand why you are suggesting that I have. I have continually invited you to make verifiable edits on the article page. The only reverts of your material I have made are those that refer to your arguments on this talk page. Referring in the main article to a talk page discussion is not acceptable referencing. I think you would do best if you did a little editing here for a while before you started making allegations. I think you may have mixed up article pages and talk pages. I am always willing to have third parties review what I have written and look forward to any comments from other editors. And may I ask you for the fourth time to sign your posts, by typing four tildes once you have finished. It does make the debate so much easier to follow. <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaustrauser_bb16.html" title="User:Maustrauser">Maustrauser</a> 09:29, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have NOT suggested that you have made DELETIONS FROM THE TALK PAGE - you've made deletions from the main article as if its your exclusive right to display one point of view! I have raised the issue that your own article is based more on your personal opinion and are unsubstantiated allegations against a 40 year old firm and does not admit to a contrarian opinion/is not balanced. I have serious reservations on your approach as it amounts to DEFAMATION. If ABI was a fraudulent institution, why has the US GOVERNMENT not shut it down over 40 years??

<dd>Well in that case I apologise. Your earlier unsigned statement implied that. I can't cite it as you refuse to sign your posts. I have made deletions from the article on the grounds that you provided no references for your statements. If you have references please use them to make verifiable comments on the article page. The article is based on the references provided under the reference heading and a google search of all those who claim to be "Man of the Year" etc. I do not believe that ABI is a fraudulent institution. I have not stated that. I believe that some people who have paid for ABI entries or even had them given 'free' misuse them to make them look better than they really are. I think the article by Tucker Carson, cited above demonstrates that quite well (although he is talking about Marquis). <a href="../../../m/a/u/User%7EMaustrauser_bb16.html" title="User:Maustrauser">Maustrauser</a> 10:29, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You've registered the article under the FRAUD section and disclaim responsibility... I suspect that ABI would not take that view. Please specify that Tucker's Forbes article is dated 1999, and they themselves refer to Marquis today for their 2006 lists. Paul Davies 10:50, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Erm? Disclaim responsibility? I added the category fraud as I believe some people use their ABI affiliation for fraudulent purposes. Where have I used Tucker's commentary in the article? The only reference is on this page isn't it? How do you know that Forbes uses Marquis? They probably do, but do you have a citation for that?

<p>The article says the ABI "operates by writing to individuals who have been cited elsewhere and invites them to be included for a fee." That would seem to indicate that they have some standards.
