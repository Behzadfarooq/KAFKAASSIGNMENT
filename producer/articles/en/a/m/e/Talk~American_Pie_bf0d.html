<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/Talk%7EAmerican_Pie_bf0d.html" title="Edit section: Vietnam?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Vietnam?</span></h2>
<p>The article seems to lean very heavily on Beatle's lore, which may or may not have been a big influence on Don McLean. For instance, the section on the Vietnam conflict is very small for 1) a song that has to do almost exclusively with Americana and 2) A topic that was gripping the nation at the time. It seems almost absurd that McLean would not make reference to the war.</p>
<p>For instance, the lines:</p>
<p><i>While the sergeants played a marching tune/We all got up to dance/Oh, but we never got the chance!/`cause the players tried to take the field/The marching band refused to yield/Do you recall what was revealed/The day the music died?/</i></p>
<p>Might this not be referencing the LBJ public relations campaign just before the Tet Offensive in 1968, where press and government officials made it look constantly like America was winning the conflict(sergeants playing a marching tune/We all got up to dance)? However, when the Tet Offensive occurred (players(Vietcong) tried to take the field/the marching band refused to yield), Americans got the shock that things were not going so well after all, and that we might not be winning the war (do you recall what was revealed?)</p>
<p>Marching tunes in America are almost synonymous with victory and patriotism.</p>

<p>The interpretation seems very constricted. It's clear the song traces MacLean's path from youth to adulthood, anyone who is an adult knows we should compare our memories of youth with our adult experiences with a big caveat in mind. This song wouldn't have such popular and universal significance if the meanings were mainly parochial sectarian in nature. <a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuangdi_9c0c.html" title="User:Huangdi">Huangdi</a> 20:23, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I really appreciate all the effort this weekend to straighten out the references to the deaths of the three stars, but I don't see the purpose of the "the day the music died" link. It is just a short version of the American Pie entry.</p>
<p>This expression was invented by Don MacLean and put in the public ear by his song American Pie. I would be very surprised if anyone ever referred to that date as "the day the music died" before American Pie was released. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a> high school class of '58.

<p>I'm a little thrown by this: "Other critics have claimed the "widowed bride" is Joan Rivers."

<p>Surely the line "a generation lost in space" must at least in part refer to the <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo.html" title="Apollo">Apollo</a> missions that were going on at the time - perhaps McLean felt these were a distraction from what was really important, (hence lost). The whole space age thing was also an influence on the hippy era, giving many a new perspective on mankind's position in the universe. I'm sure McLean is alluding to all of this, not just to being "spaced out" on drugs or whatever. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">GRAHAMUK</a> 02:41, 12 Sep 2003 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>We should at least reconsider reinstating the "his fears were proven groundless" removal although I don't know what would count as evidence for that (Can we prove that McLean would like disco?)</p>
<dl>
<dd>My problem with that line isn't that it's not provable but it has nothing to do with the subject of the article; it's pure non-sequitur. The earliest of the styles mentioned didn't arise until decades after the plane crash and several years after the song. In fact, I'm not sure why "dance music" is specified in the first place -- Buddy Holly was not making dance music particularly. McLean himself put out many more albums; it's abundantly clear the music didn't "die" permanently. Perhaps there is a way to integrate it better, I can't see it. <a href="../../../j/g/m/User%7EJgm_096b.html" title="User:Jgm">Jgm</a> 18:53, 24 Oct 2003 (UTC)

<p>Also, why the reference to a synagouge? We can be pretty sure that McLean is Christian from the last verse, no? (It also seems more likely that he would be refering to sacred music in general, rather than a specific location...) <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaullusmagnus_2744.html" title="User:Paullusmagnus">Paullusmagnus</a> 16:53, 24 Oct 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are right, there's Christian imagery throughout the song, but I'm fairly sure Don McLean is/was Jewish, though I can't say how formally; at least several other of his songs ("Zion", "Dreidel") have Jewish themes. The stanza</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
 I went down to the sacred store
 where I'd heard the music years before
 But the man there said the music wouldn't play
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>seems to me to be to a specific place; at least one analysis I've seen claims this stanza means McLean took tried to take solace in religion to no avail, and it rings true to me. <a href="../../../j/g/m/User%7EJgm_096b.html" title="User:Jgm">Jgm</a> 18:53, 24 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Seems more likely that he is a Christian. "By the Babylonian River" is used as a Christian hymn, but "The three men I admire most/The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost" doesn't sound very Jewish. Also, apparently, he attended a Catholic school <a href="http://www.countryworks.com/artist_full.asp?KEY=MCLEAN" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.countryworks.com/artist_full.asp?KEY=MCLEAN" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I've wondered about "Dreidel"... why not just any top? The lyrics to "Jerusalem" <a href="http://www.poplyrics.net/waiguo/donmclean/053.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.poplyrics.net/waiguo/donmclean/053.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> seem to imply that he is really concerned with religious tollerance, so that might have something to do with it... Anyways, I doubt that he'd be refering to any specific place of worship anyways -- it's too specific an explanation. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaullusmagnus_2744.html" title="User:Paullusmagnus">Paullusmagnus</a> 17:27, 25 Oct 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have always believed the “Scared Store” was a literal place: A record store. Think of it this way: he’s going to the record store, the place where he first heard the music of his youth-The Buddy Holly Era. Since Holly has passed away the place acquires an even greater reverence, “I went down to the sacred store, Where I’d heard the music years before…” But by now it’s the early seventies and the music has changed by so many degrees. The store stocks what is contemporary and new; it’s selling these markets. The old guard of rock is no longer commercial. “But the man there said the music wouldn’t play.” It keeps in line with the lost world feeling in this part of the song.

<p>This is a fascinating article, though I found it tedious to go back and forth between this article and another window with the song lyrics in it so I could remember what the song itself said. Does anyone see a problem with putting the song lyrics into this article, and interspersing them with the explanation of what each line means? I think this would definitely fall under fair use - I don't see how including the song lyrics here could possibly infringe on the copyright holder's ability to make money from the song - but I thought maybe there's a reason why the lyrics haven't been included here yet? - <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Kendig_b38d.html" title="User:Brian Kendig">Brian Kendig</a> 15:01, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've added the song lyrics to the article. (Not the complete lyrics; I've omitted the chorus refrains.) I don't think this is a copyright violation because the lyrics can easily be found on many unofficial web sites out there, and I feel this article makes a whole lot more sense if we quote the actual lyrics it's talking about. - <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_Kendig_b38d.html" title="User:Brian Kendig">Brian Kendig</a> 17:12, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, and if you are, you should be made aware that full lyric reprints do not fall under "fair use". The words to a song are copyrighted by the songwriter, and, just like a copyrighted poem, cannot be rerprinted in their entirety without official permission. A lyric reprint does nto violate the copyright of the recording itself, but it does violate that of the songwriters and publishing company; a song's recording and a song's composition are copyrighted seperately and handled seperately. Again, if the full lyrics are to be included here, you need notorized permission from Universal Music. --<a href="../../../f/u/r/User%7EFuriousFreddy_75f4.html" title="User:FuriousFreddy">FuriousFreddy</a> 14:49, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Copyright laws in this country MUST be readdressed. They are derived from legal issues faced by 18th century print media and maintain their adherence to these archaic principles. If copyright is to be fair then it should make sense, but it does not make sense because copyright law only makes sense to the lawyers who outline eight hundred page regulations the rest of the populace is expected to easily digest. But these laws cannot be easily digested, and they cannot account for the march of technology. Look at what happened to the Audio Home Recording Act!

<p>Now the half-time air was sweet perfume<br />
--Gregoe86 22:42, 16 November 2005 (UTC) While sergeants played a marching tune<br />
We all got up to dance<br />
Oh, but we never got the chance<br />
'Cause the players tried to take the field<br />
The marching band refused to yield</p>
<p>Taking the lyrics literally, the image portrayed is that of halftime at an (American) football game. "Sergeant" is a title sometimes given to marching band leaders. The marching band is on the field, performing, and we (in the crowd) are interrupted in our enjoyment of the music because halftime is over and the football players want to resume the game, but the marching band wants to keep playing and won't yield the football field to the football players. The conflict is clearly between the "players" and the "marching band" with the crowd on the side of the band, NOT the (football) players! I don't know what each side represents, but it seems that any interpretation that puts the crowd at odds with the marching band is probably wrong. - CronoDAS 20:27, 1 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why not take them completely literally? The marching band refused to yield to the players because music meant more to them than any football game. The next lines are "do you recall what was revealed / the day the music died?"

<p>Including citations in this article is tricky but we need to overcome the challenge. McLean must be a primary source. He hasn't been mum about "American Pie". To the contrary, he insists, "In fact, Don McLean has spent 30 years doing little else but talk about American Pie!" <a href="http://www.don-mclean.com/americanpie.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.don-mclean.com/americanpie.asp" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Careful readers of McLean's website will find that Bob Dearborn's interpretation is specifically mentioned. Even more careful readers will find an archive of articles, some of which may have previously appeared as features on the website. In particular, the "American Pie" archive article <a href="http://www.don-mclean.com/articles/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.don-mclean.com/articles/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> was originally drafted by one Alan Howard, who is identified as McLean's "Official Biographer". Howard's archived article points to two additional interpretations (to be used as secondary sources) that I now feel should be used to draft this Wikipedia article -- they are Jim Fann's interpretation (already included) and Saul Levitt's interpretation (not currently included) on <a href="http://www.missamericanpie.co.uk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.missamericanpie.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. However, these references carry a warning -- Howard says, "Any evaluation of the accuracy of these theories should be put into the context of the detailed remarks that Don McLean has made about the song over the past 30 years." I agree. We should include interpretations that are consistent with or correlate very closely with known facts about: (1) McLean's life because McLean says "American Pie" is autobiographical; and (2) American popular music history because McLean says the song is about the evolution of music during the 1960s. Additional material should be included that are consistent with other known additional themes in the song -- namely, drug culture, the anti-war movement, and religion. I've started citing the article extensively and could use some help. --<a href="../../../d/k/w/User%7EDkwong323_74b9.html" title="User:Dkwong323">Dkwong323</a> 07:34, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I cleaned up and tried to NPOV the comment in the Apocalypse interpretation section a bit. I don't think it should be in there at all really, I question where the line between including every random interpretation written of the song, no matter how fringe and keeping the article focused on the song itself should be. Including anything more than a citation of any random group that chooses to come up with an interpretation of this song seems a bit like turning this into fodder for soapboxing and advertising. Just my opinion though, thought I should mention it. Perhaps if any interpretation is valid a seperate page for interpetations of the song would be appropriate. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmaccabe_72a4.html" title="User:Pmaccabe">Phil</a> 07:39, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Yes, there are references to The Byrds' "Eight Miles High" in two sections of "The American Pie (song)" article: one is in the section on The Byrds; the other is the section on Apocalyse and nuclear war. The song has an interesting history that you can read in the Wikipedia article "Eight Miles High". Roger McGuinn, the master guitarist who helped write the song, talks about its meaning and also performs it in a XM radio interview now available in mp3 format.

<p>I think it would be better if the Madonna section was made into an own article like American Pie (Madonna single). Someone who's looking for information regarding Madonna's version will have a hard time finding it in this article. Since this article also has become too big, a split wouldn't exactly hurt.

This is a pun, because when sung, it may be heard as <i>Lenin read a book on [Karl] Marx</i>. I'm speculating, but McLean may have actually intended to express a communist image into the song, since "American Pie" was released while <a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_War_f6d9.html" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> tensions were high. So, Lion King may have something there. However, McLean's lyrics are what they are -- they say "Lennon" not "Lenin".</dd>

<dd>Let me also thank you for going to so much trouble. Quite frankly, I am amazed to see "Lennon" copyrighted in 1971. My sheet music says Lenin, do you think I can lay hands on it? No! I have however, listened to "American Pie" ten times and I think we are dealing with the "Tangled Up In Blue" syndrome, in other words auto-suggestion. If one is expecting to hear "Split up on the docks that night" instead of "Split up on a dark sad night" you will hear it - same with Lennon and Lenin.

<p>Terse comments are not helpful to contributors to this article. Please keep the spirit of wiki alive by identifing which portions of the article you feel are not consistent with the original research policy. Please pause to consider while I do my part...</p>
<dl>
<dd>Note that the article's framework originates for the most authoritative source possible, Don McLean himself. For better or for worse, McLean is using the Internet to document his views. The material is indispensible, though it is, in part, a fan site. This may be frustrating, but we shouldn't be surpised -- he's a pop star after all.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article's emphasis on inpretation is significant because it has been nearly thirty-five years since "American Pie" was first performed. After years and years of interpretative hits and misses, many of them very bizarre (and almost certainly observed by McLean himself), it is a fairly recent development that McLean is giving the public more information about his intentions for the song and his personal beliefs. This is just wise because he probably wants the song to continue to be relevant (and sell) to people who didn't live through the 1960s. McLean's release of information and the collective interpretations in the references combine as secondary sources for the article. Considerable analysis (mostly filtering) is required given the diversity of views in interpretations that were mostly created before McLean's relatively recent relevations about the autobiographical nature of the song and of his being religious but not Christian. However, the core ideas underlying the interpretation is all from McLean: (1) the song is autobiographical; (2) the song is a music history that starts off with memories of the Buddy Holly's death; (3) the song contains fantasies; (4) the songwriter is religious but not Christian though the song is replete with Christian imagery; and (5) finally, the song is a source in itself, given everything else, it says what it says.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Feel free to remove POV elements that you feel make the article like a "fan site". Contributors seem to have restrained themselves from fawning over McLean and the song quite well, though the Madonna material that you suggested for inclusion in this article is a bit distracting (due to its prominence), but even that doesn't appear to be out of bounds for an article on popular culture.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, it was nice that someone nominated the article for featured article status -- the nomination was premature, but such status might be unattainable. Constructive comments appropriately noted that the article should address additional topics, and these should be drafted. However, unless McLean submits to publication of a biography or autobiography, we'll have to make due with Internet sources, videos, radio interviews, and yes, stuff that he posts on his own web site. Suggestions on how the article should deal with these concerns are, of course, welcomed. Everybody, let's wiki.</dd>

I would like to point out that the analysis in the article on American Pie (song) is very accurate considering what many other articles on the internet are like (including those on Mclean's own website). Also, speculation on songs like this should be allowed because that is what the authors of these songs intended for listeners to do. I believe as well that this song should be nominated not because of what we know for sure, but for what we guess. -flashstar- www.godsofallmedia.com</p>

<p><i>And while the king was looking down,</i><br />
<i>The jester stole his thorny crown</i><br /></p>
<p>I remember reading somewhere that the King here is 'Elvis Presley'. The lines <i>and while the king was looking down, the jester stole his thorny crown</i> refers to Dylan usurping Elvis from the no 1 position at that time. Does anyone else agree with this viewpoint? Amath 21:00, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I've seen both theories: that the "king and queen" were Elvis and Queen Elizabeth (not Connie Francis), and that they were Pete Seeger and Joan Baez. The latter frankly makes more sense, as the "jester sang for the king and queen", likely refers to the 1963 Newport Folk Festival. Joan Baez and Pete Seeger, then the darlings of the up-and-coming folk scene were headlining, and Dylan, a featured performer, effectively stole the show, and went on to become "the voice of his generation" (among the many other monikers thrust upon him). He, Dylan, later noted that it became as much a burden as a blessing, as he was soon expected to weigh in on almost any political issue that came up...hence the "thorny crown", which he stole from Seeger.</p>
<p>Since McLean himself has never, to my knowledge, clarified any of this, it is all based on conjecture on the part of music critics, fans and others, so it would seem to make sense to me to leave both theories in, since they both seem valid and likely. --Markt3 17:43, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I am curious as to what the like <i>"Oh and while the King was looking down"</i> actually means. Could it be reference to the way in which Elvis died (falling off a toilet)? It would then explain the thorny crown reference as being the price of fame and fortuen because it ultimately lead to his death. The jester steaing it once again eventually lead to Bob Dylans death by the same means. <a href="../../../e/n/i/User%7EEnigmatical_a9c5.html" title="User:Enigmatical">Enigmatical</a> 00:35, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> died in 1977, years after "American Pie" was recorded, so his death is ruled out. Saul Levitt in <a href="http://www.missamericanpie.co.uk/interpret.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.missamericanpie.co.uk/interpret.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> says Bob Dylan was known as a comic singer during his early singing career, providing him the rationale for McLean referring Dylan as "the jester". (Levitt cites a reference but the cite is incomplete. Maybe someone can help find me find it!) McLean's use of "king" may be at least dual. The Presley reference seems clear, but Levitt notes that on December 23, 1962, Dylan performed at the King &amp; Queen pub as part of a UK tour that included a performance on a BBC TV program. --<a href="../../../d/k/w/User%7EDkwong323_74b9.html" title="User:Dkwong323">Dkwong323</a> 06:49, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>IIRC, Little Richard at times performed wearing what was regarded as feminine-appearing makeup, such as eye shadow. I've heard him mentioned as the "Queen" in "American Pie", as both a reference to his status as the leader ("King") of R&amp;B/Soul and as a pun on his sexuality and appearance. Under this interpretation, folk/protest music (Dylan) stole the "crown" (of popular music) from Rock 'n Roll (Elvis) and from Soul (Little Richard). -- <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUnimaginative_Username_9f04.html" title="User:Unimaginative Username">Unimaginative Username</a> 19:00, 24 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

This article focuses mostly on the specific events that inspired them. However, McLean won't address those items. A true work of art says more than that. It speaks to a larger truth, in this case the loss of innocence, which most can relate to and hear in this song, even if they don't know the specific inspirations. When Katherine Bates wrote about the "purple mountain majesties" and the "alabaster city's gleam", she was inspired by Pike's Peak and by the Columbian Exposition, but again she was using them as metaphors; the song still works, even for those who know nothing of the 1893 fair, because it sings about American idealism as much as about those specific things. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 08:31, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

True, however I think that American Pie is actually a recount of the horrible things that happened to music and politics in general. However, it also depicts the power of the human spirit. I'm not sure why everyone thinks that everything is a loss of innocence, but American Pie certainly isn't based around this fact. It does contain an optimism similar to <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/America_the_Beautiful_16a1.html" title="America the Beautiful">America the Beautiful</a></i>.--<a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlashstar_34ff.html" title="User:Flashstar">Flashstar</a> 03:21, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Did Pearl Jam do a cover of it? If so, why isn't it mentioned in the cover versions?</p>
<p>In the article listing covers performed by Pearl Jam, it's listed as that they did a cover of it. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_covered_by_Pearl_Jam" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_covered_by_Pearl_Jam" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_covered_by_Pearl_Jam</a> Check out.</p>
<p>Anyone can confirm this? I've recently seen an acoustic version of "Daughter" by "Pearl Jam" labeled as "American Pie" on some p2p (on Gnutella network). Perhaps this could be the reason.

<p>hi ppl no fighting or anything but i suggest that this page be broken up, the don mclean pie is too big so there should be a separate page for covers only, example Madonna's version and other artist.

<p>Hmmm... I have to say that I don't buy "Who Wrote the Book of Love?" as Christian imagery. The song lyrics refer to a set of "rules" for romance, including breakup and reconciliation. If I were trying to interpret that reference, I would say that, in juxtaposition with the references to God, it's asking whether we (the listeners, the composer, whoever) still find that the world "works" by the rules we were taught (about relationships, religion, everything), or whether these somewhat simplistic rules no longer apply (or never did).</p>
<p>That's what I'd say if I were interpreting it - but I'm not, at least not in the context of Wikipedia, because that's not appropriate here. And I really have to question whether any attempt at sorting through the multiple interpretations of individual lines IS actually appropriate here.</p>
<p>In an encyclopedia entry on a popular song, it would seem most important to identify 1.) that the song is seen as requiring interpretation and is often interpreted, with varying degrees of consistency and historicity; 2.) whatever has actually been said about the song's content and meaning by its composer(s), as officially established interpretation, and 3.) a sampling of other prominent theories about its content and meaning and some of the strong/weak points in them (which is where a few examples of differing interpretation could be offered, along with their sources).</p>
<p>As long as the article is mainly an attempt to sort through interpretations for each specific line, there WILL be original research involved - it's inevitable. I suggest that it would be much more encyclopedic to change the format of the article; instead of sections on specific lines and verses, there should be sections on general themes, each containing a few examples of lines which contain those themes and how they have been interpreted. For instance, references to religion is a general theme; few could argue that it contains those. References to popular music and musicians, social/political references, etc. could also be general themes. Under those very broad categories, specific lyrics could be quoted to show the references, and then examples of prominent interpretations for a FEW of those quotes could be listed, along with their sources and any specific evidence for or against.</p>
<p>Without making some kind of change in this vein, I don't know that the article can ever be encyclopedic. Sure, interpretation IS what we as individuals and listeners are supposed to be doing with the song, but here we are not individuals and listeners, but writers and editors of a type of document which requires a lot more restraint.</p>
<p>Food for discussion, anyway (I hope).</p>
<p>Incidentally, I always thought the Chevy was attempting suicide. ;)</p>

<li>Since the artist has never explained his work, any interpretations of it are suspect. However, citing an expert who has studied the matter from many angles is better than us doing it ourselves, that being against the rules. As with many works of popular media, there is a literal interpretation which requires no extraordinary verification ("who wrote the book of love?" is a line from a 1950s song and the obvious source of the literal wording), but the symbolic interpretation, having religious overtones, is a different story. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 09:32, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
