<h2><span class="mw-headline">Removal of Okinawa from list of colonies</span></h2>
<p>I removed <a href="../../../o/k/i/Okinawa.html" title="Okinawa">Okinawa</a> from the list of former U.S. colonies recited in the article, because as far as I can discern no one ever intended Okinawa to become part of the national territory of the United States. That territory is occupied by a military of a particular country, does not itself cause the occupied territory to be a "colony;" rather, at least some intention to make the occupied territory a part of the occupying country (or at least an intention <i>never</i> to relinquish control of the occupied territory) should be present in order for the term "colony" to properly apply.</p>
<p>Thus even <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibraltar.html" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> might be termed a colony, or even <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holstein.html" title="Holstein">Holstein</a> in Germany (a stretch perhaps) because these territories (which were formerly under the administration of a foreign sovereign) are now either under permanent occupation or integrated into the national territory of the occupier, but I've seen no evidence that the U.S. ever planned to make Okinawa a U.S. territory or possession (or even to occupy it forever). --<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanaxp_4e21.html" title="User:Ryanaxp">Ryanaxp</a> 22:39, May 6, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dispute of neutrality</span></h2>
<p>I hereby dispute the neutrality of this article. While the author mentions that "America's military presence by itself is breathtaking and influential", I as an uninformed Reader would believe that the term is only used by some freightened people who do not want the US to bring Peace just because they prefer some undefinable form of diversity. Look how much the US has messed with the interior politcs of "Former" Colonies like Cuba or the Dominican Republic. There is a difference between calling a state independent and being independent - the current example is the recent "indepence" of Iraq.</p>
<p>I also believe that the millions of live lost because of american wars of agression and because they supported questionable regimes, for example in order to support the financial goals of US Companies ( United Fruit) should be mentioned in this article.</p>

<p>Ahem. While this is true, it is still false. Most of these (notably the Philippines) didnt get to be "independent countries" by the simple tutorship of America.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Meaning of paragraph?</span></h2>
<p>What exactly does this passage mean:</p>
<p>"Often by exporting America's self popularized political system to a conquered territory with false promises of self-government, only in exchange for America's military occupation and total control of its natural resources. Such can be seen where America's post Cold War military involvements are primarily focused on mineral rich regions of the world."</p>
<p>I think I understand the gist, but its wording is a little confusing. <a href="../../../j/2E/j/User%7EJ.J._f353.html" title="User:J.J.">user:J.J.</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>The "gist" of it is "America is evil." So much for a NPOV. This article is a masturbatory fantasy of the American extreme Left and for America-haters (or maybe not 'hate' as much as envy) around the globe. The article's very title betrays a horribly slanted POV. It is a political pamphlet pretending to be an unbiased source. Much like the American and European media. The real debate is whether it deserves a massive re-write or deletion. It's a disgrace. <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> 02:25, 24 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Note please that the paragraph quoted above has not been in the article for some time. Do you believe that the present version fails NPOV? Can you be more specific? (The title was changed from "American Empire" to "American Empire (term)" to avoid precisely the criticism you make, if you look at the talk and history.) Do you believe that criticisms of America as imperialist should not be described on Wikipedia? <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 04:37, 24 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The word "term" does mollify me somewhat, and there are some good qualifiers here, but is Wikipedia the place for this? Well, maybe, if Wikipedia is a compendium of every political argument. Frankly, I think this kind of article turns Wikipedia into more of a "chat board," complete with flame wars (disguised as 'talk pages') than a true encyclopedia. <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> 04:51, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>For major academic and political disputes? I think yes, Wikipedia is the (or a) place. Notice the number of citations for each point - and I've already removed most of the book title mentions in my recent reorganization, because they were crowding the article, and this is a sample only. I've generally never understood the preference many Wikipedians have for removing "unencyclopedic" and/or "obscure" material; it seems to me that since for something like Wikipedia there's very little cost to having extra articles, it should rather be used to expand the idea of an encyclopedia. But regardless, Wikipedia covers (1) historical facts, theories, and controversies, and (2) major political ideologies. The subject matter of this article falls into both categories. <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 15:58, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Today, what many consider to be the "American Empire" does not fit historical definitions of imperialism and colonialism, but the United States influence takes on different and <b>discrete</b> forms.</i></p>
<p>Did you mean discreet as in secretive? Discrete also would make sense because of the modular, sequential nature of US intervention.</p>
<p><a name="Further_dispute_of_neutrality" id="Further_dispute_of_neutrality"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Further dispute of neutrality</span></h2>
<p>I also dispute the neutrality of this article. Its thesis is that the United States is in actuality or effect, or acts like, an empire. It then proceeds to offer support for this argument. While I would not argue with most of the points made here, I don't think that this sort of polemics has a place in an encyclopedia.</p>
<p><a name="Name.2C_Split" id="Name.2C_Split"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Name, Split</span></h2>
<p>If this article is to be about a political and rhetorical view of the United States and not about some actual entity (the United States territory outside of the 50 states), then the article title needs some kind of qualification. In that case, information from this article about American imperial territory should be removed to some other article. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 18:24, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would think this article should be about American imperialism and how they incorporated their empire directly into their main territories - Josquius</p>

<dd>How that would be different from the article <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_United_States_imperialism_1c06.html" title="History of United States imperialism">History of United States imperialism</a>? --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> 13:58, July 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is totally politically charged, anti-American stuff as usual. In order to be imperialist, you would need an imperial family, or some sort of oligarchy to use that qualifier. From its inception, it has been a democracy. Not some kingdom with expansionist aims.</p>
<p>The United States of America is the only country in the history of the world to give back territory which it won in war, back to the people living there (i.e., Germany, Japan, Iraq, etc.)</p>

<dd>Being a republic does not automatically exclude a nation-state from being an empire.

<p>Since the end of the Cold War, the proliferation of military bases in over 130 countries in the world, and the use of a standing army, every time the United States has meddled with it's military abroad it has done so solely in order to expand it's global sphere of influence and impose it's capitalist and political systems on other nations, and is therefore explicitly imperialist, and thus, and empire.</p>
<p>In relation to the comment that a government can not be expansionist and a democracy I would like to point out the obvious example of the annexation of Hawaii. Hawaii was a self governing island with it's own government a queen to be exact. She opposed United States control of the islands and sought to make her nation more self reliant by controlling the influence of foriegn merchants. When this happened pineapple planter Sanford Dole (Dole bananas ring a bell?) with the help of U.S. marines staged a coup and had the queen removed from power. Three years later the U.S. had a new territory if this isn't a example of imperialism by America for corporate interests I don't know what is. <a href="../../../l/3/3/User%7EL337wm2007_26fa.html" title="User:L337wm2007">L337wm2007</a> 19:51, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">expansion and reorganization</span></h2>
<p>I did a fair amount of expansion and reorganization, as of 1/18/06. My main goal was to remove the excessive reliance on Stuart Creighton Miller in the body of the article, and to fix some resulting NPOV problems (the previous version was fair to neither defenders nor opponents of American empire... biased towards the middle is not the same thing as balanced.) I ended up making a fair number of other, relatively minor, changes as well. <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe that it's useful to include a little history in this article, even if it's primarily an outline of modern political positions and the major history is elsewhere. Therefore I've left in the defense of the occupation of the Phillipines and put in an abbreviated list of American interventions (pre- and post- 1945) on the other side. I think this gives a better sense of what both sides rationales are, without being too redundant, since for details, links are relied on. I'm not sure, however, whether even this little might be too much.</dd>

It would probably be more proper to just call them "the states" or "the U.S.".. but America is not universally accepted.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">cultural imperialism</span></h2>
<p>I moved a paragraph from the introduction to a new section on cultural imperialism. I outlined a little bit of that debate, mostly just enough to put in links to other articles. I also removed one clause entirely: <i>They point out that the U.S. has not actually expanded overseas with new territories in over 100 years,</i> This is simply false. Besides countless (officially) temporary occupations, the U.S. gained new territories in the South Pacific after World War Two, and if we're talking about actual annexation, I believe Alaska and Hawaii became states in the 20th century, though they were already territories. <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 21:09, 31 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm the author of that sentence. I'll try to expand it and see if you understand and can maybe suggest better wording. Neorealists think that all states determine their foreign policy on roughly the same basis, namely by determining what is in their national interest - which is not always well defined, but seems to be economic, military, and generally material - and carrying that out without much consideration of ethics or other ideological considerations. This view is supported by the Hobbesian argument that the anarchic nature of international relations forces actors to be self-interested; ethics only works when you have an enforcer of some kind. One of its consequences is that distinctions between "empires" and "non-empires" don't have much theoretical import; any such differences are matters of quantity of power not quality. <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 20:28, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some who hold an essentially identical view on American foreign policy are willing to call the United States an empire, but believe that it is a benevolent one; for example, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Michael Ignatieff, and Niall Ferguson. Ferguson has drawn parallels between the British Empire and the imperial role of the United States in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, though he describes the United States' political and social structures as more like those of the Roman Empire than of the British. He argues that all these empires have had both positive and negative aspects, but that the positive aspects of the American empire will, if it learns from history and its mistakes, greatly outweigh its negative aspects. <b>All these authors agree with those who deny a role for imperialism regarding the essential benevolence through history of American power, but differ on the proper semantics.</b></dd>

<p>This is an essay, not an article! And not just an essay, but an essay espousing the views of Stuart Creighton Miller. His name appears eight times in the text. "This idea of a completly unique social system makes it difficult for many Americans to come to grips with American social flaws associated with the 'Old World,'". Says who? "American exceptionalism is a popular view of most Americans" Oh, really? Where's your poll?

<dd>The article relies too much on Miller, but it's hardly just an exposition of his views. That's primarily true in the first section, on American exceptionalism, which is indeed a problem that needs correcting. You got other sources on the subject?

<dd>Miller is the only author I know who broke down the three types of way America its place in the world. There may be more than three, as other wikipedians have added, such as <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_imperialism.html" title="Cultural imperialism">cultural imperialism</a>. The majority of this article is based on the 3 pages of Miller, it started out as Miller stating their are three types of ways Americans see the world.</dd>

<dd><b>How can Stuart Creighton Miller espouse three views of American imperialism simultaneously?

<dd>"American exceptionalism is a popular view of most Americans" This is not Miller. I did not write this sentence. Another Wikipedian did. I added footnotes to this sentence, talking about how patriotic Americans are, and how Americans views are like a religion. If you want more arguments for this, I can cite them. Remember, we are talking about <i>ideas</i>, ideas are POV by nature. This article gives equal time to three competing ideas. In this strict context: citing sources, allowing different views, not using weasel words, these POV ideas are very encyclopedic.

<dd>I am of the opinion that discussion of subjects such as "the way America sees the world", whether or not empires were "benevolent", philosophical debates about whether the perceived imperialism exists or not, are subjects for historians, not encyclopaedians/Wikipedians. It is indisputible that "American Empire" is a term that is used by some, and that it is a loaded term, so there should unquestionably be an entry for it in Wikipedia. However, I think this article should stick to a factual description of the way in which the term is used: historical colonialism vs cultural imperialism, and a <b>brief</b> mention of the disagreement surrounding it. Readers interested in United States colonial antics should be quickly and clearly redirected to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_United_States_overseas_expansion_ad03.html" title="History of United States overseas expansion">History_of_United_States_overseas_expansion</a>. The whole article could be condensed into a couple of concise paragraphs. I would have a go, except it would entail severe reworking and rewording, which would undoubtedly offend those who have spent time writing the article! <a href="../../../g/s/d/User%7EGsd2000_20bd.html" title="User:Gsd2000">Gsd2000</a> 21:29, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Redundancy</span></h2>
<p>Given the fact that there are articles named British, French Spanish Empires, a reader interested in the territorial aspects of US colonialism may well end up looking at this article instead of the <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_United_States_overseas_expansion_ad03.html" title="History of United States overseas expansion">correct one</a>). Indeed, the Colonial Empires template linked to <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Empire_a365.html" title="American Empire">American Empire</a> until I changed it. I know "History of United States overseas expansion" is also listed on the right, but it's not redundant to make an explicit statement at the top directing readers to that page, especially so given Travb's statement above that the two articles are a result of being split up. <a href="../../../g/s/d/User%7EGsd2000_20bd.html" title="User:Gsd2000">Gsd2000</a> 23:27, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>re "as in-depth a treatment as Wikipedians are prepared to write"</b>: the right depth of the article, IMHO, should be tailored to the average reader, not to the depth to which those with specialised knowledge of or interest in the topic are <i>prepared</i> to write. Admittedly, it takes the latter to write the article in the first place, but the test of a "good" article is one that keeps the interest of someone with zero background knowledge of the topic. For that it needs to be concise, relevant and easy to read. This article is a little heavy going.

<p>Deleted: <i>"This idea of a completly unique social system makes it difficult for many Americans to come to grips with American social flaws associated with the "Old World," such as militarism, imperialism, inequality, and the misuse of power"</i></p>
<p>This is actually from Miller:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>The notion of such a cultural metamorphosis is entirely romantic, but the concept of a totally unique social system fashioned solely by the experiences of colonial Americans is in harmony with the prevailing pragmatic (practical) style of America. It also makes it difficult for many Americans to come to grips with social flaws associated with the “Old World,” such as militarism, imperialism, inequality, and the misuse of power. The tendency of highly patriotic Americans is to deny such abuses and even assert that they could never exist in their country. At the other end of the scale, overly self-critical Americans tend to exaggerate the nation’s flaws, failing to place then in historical or worldwide contexts.</i><a href="http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/4300.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/4300.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></dd>

<p>...but I can see why you feel it is POV <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a>.</p>
<p>There are some books I would like to read that address this subject, but I don't have the energy to pursue this now. Some of the books include:<a href="http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/45940.html" class="external text" title="http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/45940.html" rel="nofollow">Seymour Martin Lipset's American Exceptionalism: A Double-Edged Sword</a>. I have come across this deleted idea before in scholarly journals too.</p>
<p>But again how can you quantify what all Americans feel? Too broad. It just feels like POV. So I have to agree with your edit.</p>
<p>How to quantify such ideas? A poll? That is the problem with the social sciences, broad statments like this are hard to accuratly measure, especially when the author is talking about an entire society's views, beliefs, and ideas.</p>

<dd>Well, I think it's POV not because it asserts what Americans feel, but because it asserts something most Americans would disagree with. I think it's fine to assert, as the article does, that most Americans believe that America is exceptional in some way; I don't know anyone who would dispute that. But I know lots of people who would dispute the idea that Americans have a hard time coming to grips with militarism, imperialism, inequality, etc. The sentence shouldn't necessarily be deleted - but if it stays it should go under one of the "schools of thought" sections rather than the intro which is supposedly neutral between them. I suppose it would most likely be in the first, although Miller himself does not seem to be. <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 20:50, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">recent changes</span></h2>
<p>travb, your removal of weaseliness is mostly very useful, but I have two basic problems with the current state of the article, which I think involve a disagreement with your edits:</p>
<p>(1) less importantly, I think it is perfectly legitimate to make unattributed claims about what "some" say in the introduction to the article. The point is that these claims will be sourced in the detailed sections below. We can't mention every author in the intro, any selection would be arbitrary, but also the basic positions should be outlined. If there are claims in the intro that aren't sourced below, those should be removed, but some weasel-words might stay.</p>
<p>(2) more importantly, I think that Miller should <i>not</i> be used as a source for a description of any of the three schools of thought, in their particular section. Each should POV-describing section should base its description of the POV directly on those who hold it, not mediated through the position of someone who has his own, differing POV. For example I have a problem with including the claim that anti-imperialists are "overly self-critical Americans" in the section describing the anti-imperialist argument. That's a POV position, and its not the anti-imperialist POV which is being described, so including it there makes it sound like its supposed to be objective. I think problems like that are likely to be inevitable as long as we use opponents' characterizations of positions; this should be minimized to the greatest extent possible if not eliminated.</p>
<p>What do you think? For now, I'm just going to restore a new and improved cultural imperialism section, I'll wait to make changes along the lines above till I get an ok. <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 23:36, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>thanks for your comments and sensitivity to my feelings, edit away, I will let you know if I have objections. I agree that "overly self-critical Americans" is probably POV. You can take out the name Miller, but I suggest leaving the footnote to him, since the format was originally created by him and the idea of this format was inspired by him.

<p>I'll see if I can rephrase in passive voice. With regard to Miller, I'm not by any means advocating taking him out of the article. His discussion of American exceptionalism should stay sourced to him, and so should even the division into schools of thought. But he shouldn't be used for the actual description of those schools of thought in their sections, that should be left to people who fall under those schools. <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 17:37, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposed Merge <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Empire_a365.html" title="American Empire">American Empire</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_United_States_overseas_expansion_ad03.html" title="History of United States overseas expansion">History of United States overseas expansion</a></span></h2>
<p>I know these articles were originally split, but their content is now verging back to the same topics. I believe that the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Empire_a365.html" title="American Empire">American Empire</a> article should be massively condensed and merged into <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_United_States_overseas_expansion_ad03.html" title="History of United States overseas expansion">History of United States overseas expansion</a>.</p>
<p>There are three types of imperialism being discussed in these articles: (1) territorial imperialism in the mould of European empires of yesteryear (1898-1946) (2) political/military "imperialistic" characteristics of America's behaviour as a superpower, both during the Cold War and now as the world's only superpower and (3) cultural imperialism. Both articles cover all three. (2) and (3) definitely do not belong to an article entitled <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_United_States_overseas_expansion_ad03.html" title="History of United States overseas expansion">History of United States overseas expansion</a> even though they are discussed. Furthermore, discussion of (1) and (2) are confusingly intermingled in <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Empire_a365.html" title="American Empire">American Empire</a>. See the "Second school of thought", which refers to US reasons for going into the 1898 war and whether or not its rule of Spain's old colonies constituted imperialism in the traditional sense of the word - ie what I refer to as (1). There is then a subsection entitled "Benevolent Empire", about the "role of the United States in the late 20th and early 21st centuries" - this is the subject of (2) - and is far more controversial than (1), because it is indisputable that America ruled over, and without the consent of, other peoples from 1898-1946 - if you can deny that this was imperialism because it was supposedly for the good of the people being ruled over, you can deny that the British Empire was imperialist. Whether or not the hegemony that America enjoys today is an "Empire" is the controversial question here.</p>
<p>So I propose using <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_United_States_overseas_expansion_ad03.html" title="History of United States overseas expansion">History of United States overseas expansion</a> as the article to use as the base, and then <i>very judicious</i> integration of <i>portions</i> of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Empire_a365.html" title="American Empire">American Empire</a> into it. I know certain Wikipedians have put a lot of hard work into the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Empire_a365.html" title="American Empire">American Empire</a> article, but I say again that it really does read like a mediocre international relations dissertation, made worse by the "too many cooks spoil the broth" observation made above. Why? The introduction is completely garbled - it says that "American Empire ... [is a] politically charged term used to describe the historical expansionism ... of the United States" yet a couple of lines later it says "Occasionally, the term "American Empire" is used to only refer to U.S. possessions which were once or are currently in the possession of the United States". What is the difference?! Then it goes into a long ramble about <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Exceptionalism_06a4.html" title="American Exceptionalism">American Exceptionalism</a> that seems completely out of place, save for the reasonable comment "American imperialism has been the subject of agonizing debate ever since the United States acquired formal empire at the end of the nineteenth century during the Spanish-American war". Now we get into international relations student territory. Lots of paragraphs going on about Joe Bloggs arguing X and John Doe arguing Y, all the time referring to one historian, this Miller bloke. Bold statements speaking for the views of "...many Americans". When we are done with that, we get to a section on Cultural Imperialism, yet there is also a section on Cultural Imperialism here <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_United_States_overseas_expansion_ad03.html#Cultural_imperialism" title="History of United States overseas expansion">History_of_United_States_overseas_expansion#Cultural_imperialism</a>. The icing on the cake is a random and completely out of place quote.</p>

I am concerned by your critisms. I appreciate them, but I don't see you actively working on the article, adding anything to its content.

<dd>No, I would not delete the article. At the very least, discussion of whether US imperialism 1898-1946 was actually imperialism should go on the page devoted to the facts (the original state of History of United States colonialism).

<dd>(Wrote the following at the same time Travb was writing his post above, so I don't respond to it):</dd>
<dd>I think that it's ok for articles with closely related subjects to copy small parts of each other's contents; overlap isn't always bad or avoidable. I don't think that's sufficient reason to merge the articles.</dd>
<dd>I haven't been paying much attention to <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_United_States_overseas_expansion_ad03.html" title="History of United States overseas expansion">History of United States overseas expansion</a> but I agree that it does seem a little heavily influenced by your (2), and that should be reduced. That (3) exists in both is I think perfectly justifiable; it's doing different things in each. In neither should the debate about whether it's bad be given much, if any, space - that's for the original article. But any discussion of the role of American imperialism should include a discussion of the role of cultural imperialism as a compononent or support of military imperialism - which the Said section does. And any discussion of United States overseas expansion should include a discussion of how US cultural influence has expanded overseas - the current version is bad, I'll grant you.</dd>
<dd>You describe some flaws some of which are real, but which don't seem to me to have anything to do with a need for a merge. The benevolent empire subsection refers to authors who admit that the US is an empire and has been for a long time, but otherwise generally agree with those who deny that it's an empire - both in analysis of the Phillipines, etc, and analysis of US policy today - the only reason I think it seems out of place is that it's in the context of that somewhat out-of-place discussion of the Phillipines at the start of the section. The intro to American Empire needs re-wording, yes. The American exceptionalism section seems relevant to me; it frames why there's a debate about American empire and what form it takes. The article relies too much on Miller; that's something I've been trying to go through and systematically reduce - my goal is that he only be in the exceptionalism section. What do you think of the first subsection, from which I've eliminated him? That quote is random, I'll remove it now.</dd>
<dd>I strongly disagree with the merger because I think that a moderately detailed discussion of views on the question of American imperialism is worth including on Wikipedia, but not appropriate, at least not in sufficient length, in any article on the history of US overseas expansion. I think for example a reference that goes through the intersections and divergences of right-wing and left-wing critics of empire, that lists some of the important writers and associates them into categories by arguments they make, is useful, but wouldn't make sense in an article that wasn't specific to the topic.</dd>

<dd>I agree with Gsd2000 that these two articles aren't very good (yet?), and that they overlap in odd and confusing ways. I think the solution is not a merger, but rather a clearer definition of what each article should address (which should facilitate better writing), as well as the creation of a third article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, a clarification: these two articles were never actually part of one single article. Although there was some cutting-and-pasting from one to the other, they've always been two separate entries. I slightly renamed both of them with the hope that this would make the distinction between the two topics clearer. There is still some confusion, as Gsd2000 points out. I should have made the intended scope of the articles (or at least what I thought the scope should be) much clearer.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Personally, I expected <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_United_States_overseas_expansion_ad03.html" title="History of United States overseas expansion">History of United States overseas expansion</a> to be a tightly focused article about the <b>overseas territorial acquisitions</b> of the United States (i.e. primarily about territory acquired from 1898 to 1917, with a smattering of islands acquired in WW2 -- Gsd2000's #1 of the three types of imperialism). I suggested that the article should be merged with <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_colonization_outside_North_America_e454.html" title="United States colonization outside North America">United States colonization outside North America</a>, which covers the same basic material, though lacking in detail. I didn't expect an article with this title to be about Cold War or present-day foreign policy (the #2 type of imperialism), and certainly not about cultural imperialism (#3). Maybe "United States colonization outside North America" would have been a better title choice so as to avoid confusion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I also proposed that a new (as yet non-existent) article called History of United States foreign intervention be created to cover the Cold War and superpower stuff. This is a big topic -- maybe too broad -- and perhaps needs a better name, but I think keeping it separate from the "overseas expansion" topic might be helpful since, as Gsd2000 says, these are arguably two different types of "imperialism". I should have created this article earlier, but I'm easily distracted.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Empire_%28term%29_29ad.html" title="American Empire (term)">American Empire (term)</a> is about the longstanding debate about whether or not the United States is an empire. It could just as easily be named American Empire debate. By definition, it's about "Joe Bloggs arguing X and John Doe arguing Y". Clearly Gsd2000 doesn't like that approach, but, as Kalkin has written above, the amount of material written about this topic justifies its existence. It's a tough article to write, because it requires familiarity with a large body of writing in order to write an accurate overview of the debate. I think the contributors have been heading in the right direction, but the article is still disjointed and uneven. Will this improve? I hope so. I consider these articles to still be in the early stages of construction. Too early to pull the plug yet. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">(complaint dept.)</a> 16:45, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are you seriously claiming that lines can be blurred between debate about whether US inheritance of the remnants of the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_Empire_72b4.html" title="Spanish Empire">Spanish Empire</a> constituted an empire, and the debate about whether post-WW2 influence abroad through military bases, political pacts, economic investment etc constitutes an empire? That is like discussing the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>, and confusing the debate about whether it was a benevolent one and the debate about whether areas Britain exerted economic/political influence over (e.g South America and China) formed part of its formal empire (usually referred to as "informal empire"). <a href="../../../g/s/d/User%7EGsd2000_20bd.html" title="User:Gsd2000">Gsd2000</a> 23:57, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Certainly the lines could be blurred. Think about a Marxian theory of empire, which states that imperialism is necessarily connected to capitalism. Debates about this would involve evidence from all periods, and would involve arguing about similarities or differences in character of those periods. For example think about Hardt and Negri (referenced in the article), who argue that there's Empire now and empire then, but that they're different, versus traditional Marxists or Marxian theorists who argue empire is basicaly constant. Where would this kind of debate be outlined in your proposal. I think that I agree with Kevin Myers but <i>disagree</i> with you, Gsd2000, here. The article on US overseas expansion should probably be split, the specific debates about the Philippines should be switched to it. However there should remain an article on the <i>American Empire debate</i> or <i>American Empire (term)</i>. All need improvement, yes, but that's a seperate question. <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 00:05, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Nhprman's contibutions</span></h3>
<p>When I read: "unlike those empires of the past, the vast majority of Americans deny that America has ever had an empire" I think it's a rather foolish statement, since America never was an empire, and certainly isn't now, except in the eyes of its enemies (or from a "Marxian" view, as one poster has the audacity to have said above, years after the "Marxian" view of history was discredited completely - except in American classrooms, that is.) I suppose my rejection of the term strikes at the very "orthodoxy" of the entire article, which is meant to portray America from an outsider's point of view, but it's a fact. As for "other" empires of hte past, Britain WAS an empire. France WAS an empire. Germany WAS an empire. Spain WAS an empire. All were, both in name and in deed, and were, for centuries. Despite the tortured logic and (sometimes subtle) hatred dripping from this article towards its subject, despite the beliefs of a tiny minority, very few people have ever labeled America as such, and most never wanted or sought any such thing. Even if we grant that in the past some did, today that is clearly not the case, if anyone bothers to read the polls. Also, I'm curious, is there an article "List of nations brutalized by the Soviet Empire"? Just asking. <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>UserLists</sup></small></a> 00:44, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

Was America not acting like an imperial power when it <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philippine-American_War_37c4.html" title="Philippine-American War">brutally put down all forms of Filipino resistance</a>? Anyway, Nphrman, I think you're missing the point somewhat.

<dd>If the Spanish-American War is what you have to dredge up to 'prove' America had colonies, great. I think your answer proves the point of the article quite nicely. The debate "should we/shouldn't we" become an empire with literal colonies is about 100 years out-of-date.

<dd>Whilst you are on your soapbox, is there anything else that you consider "out of date", "academic" or "dry"? History by definition is "out of date", as it is <i>history</i>. Should we cease discussion of the past? <b>EVERYBODY THE WORLD OVER - STOP TEACHING HISTORY TO OUR KIDS!!! NHPRHMAN SAYS IT'S OUT OF DATE!!!</b> And perhaps you should write to academic institutions the world over and instruct them to stop discussion of the topics that <i>you</i> don't like because <i>you</i> consider them academic or dry. Looking at your Wikipedia edits I see this is not your field of interest - you are obviously an American with strong views, but I suspect that you have not done <i>any</i> background reading in this subject (especially if you accuse me of "dredging up" the Spanish-American War to support my arguments, when this war is critical to the debate - for starters it's why today the US owns islands in the Pacific and Carribean - just like Britain does <i>because they were the remnants of its Empire unwilling or too small to form a nation state</i>). Try reading the piece [<a href="http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=1988940" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=1988940" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>] in the Economist linked to in the main article, published in 2003. The debate wasn't out of date then, and it certainly ain't now. You are absolutely within your rights to deny that America ever was or is an empire, but by doing so you are participating in the very debate whose existence you deny, demonstrating that it is alive and kicking. <a href="../../../g/s/d/User%7EGsd2000_20bd.html" title="User:Gsd2000">Gsd2000</a> 13:45, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is brilliantly twisted. Clearly, I didn't say history should never be taught. What's out of date is the old fashioned mindless America-bashing this article represents. And if I dare to question it, I'm giving it legitimacy? Again, twisted. But the America-haters are twisted by their rage and hate. Thanks for more evidence, you and those who build this article into a towering pile of POV garbage. <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>UserLists</sup></small></a> 05:45, 11 March 2006 (UTC)

<h4><span class="mw-headline">Term empire used with pride</span></h4>
<p>In response, it has to be said that <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> in its colonial period considered itself to be an empire, just as the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> did. The term was used with a degree of pride. On the other hand, the term American Empire is politically charged and controversial, just as the article said, and should definitely not be merged with a general article on US history. The fundamental difference here is that colonial Spain (informally) called itself an empire, and the historical term is fairly non-controversial, just as no one would dispute that the British Empire existed. America may have acquired colonies (although I don't believe that America ever described itself as a colonial nation), and may have been a de facto empire, but it is not, and has never been, a de jure empire. This simple statement of fact does not make me an American apologist. I am not saying that the US was any less 'oppressive' in its colonial expansion than the Spanish were. I am just saying that the term 'American Empire' should not be used as an indisputable historical term, nor should it ever be used in anything other than an informal or interpretative context. The job of Wikipedia is not to make moral judgments about the Americans; it is to state the relevant legal and historical facts, and, where necessary, to cover different interpretations. We do not need to decide whether the US 'oppressed' its colonies or not. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 10:28, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You cite a difference between de jure vs de facto empires, but can you explain to me in what way legally the British Empire differed from the "American" one? Your argument rests in large part on the fact that there was some set of laws that defined European empires as "empires" but did not do so for the US possessions.

<p>At the height of the British Empire (between the <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleonic_Wars_898f.html" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> and the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" title="First World War">First World War</a>, the term was in widespread use among British people and foreigners, and would not have been considered a controversial or pejorative description. To put it simply, the British were proud of their empire. Americans, on the other hand, have had a historical distaste for the term 'empire' and the principles of imperialism. Many Americans would profoundly disagree if their nation were described as an empire. Furthermore, to answer Gsd2000's question, <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Victoria_69b5.html" title="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> was crowned Empress of <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> in the 1870s (I can't remember the exact date off the top of my head), making her a <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_jure.html" title="De jure">de jure</a> empress, as well as a <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_facto.html" title="De facto">de facto</a> one. I am quite certain that no US President has ever been crowned Emperor of <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guam.html" title="Guam">Guam</a> or <a href="../../../p/u/e/Puerto_Rico_f6b0.html" title="Puerto Rico">Puerto Rico</a>. As such, there is both a legal and a factual difference between the British Empire and the American "Empire". The two cannot really be viewed as historically comparable. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 11:47, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay let me see if I understand what you are trying to say. Yyou write: <i><a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Victoria_69b5.html" title="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> was crowned Empress of <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a> in the 1870s (I can't remember the exact date off the top of my head),</i> Therefore to be an empire, an empire citizens must:
<dl>
<dd>A) accept that they are empire</dd>
<dd>B) have a queen/president/king that is crowned as an empress/emporer of one of its territories. In other words, the country must admit by crowning its leader as emporer/emporess, to be an empire.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, by your reasoning, if a country does not meet those two criteria, they are therefore not an empire? If I understand you correctly, I don't know where you get this definition, but it sounds, on its face, highly dubious.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Before the queen of the British Empire was crowned emperess was the British empire not an empire?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>If only 30% of Britians believed their country was an empire, would this still make them an empire?</li>
<li>What about the other empires?</li>
<li>Does everyone meet this defintion that you present here? They would have to be, otherwise your narrow definition fails.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My questions are absurd, simply because I am trying to illistrate how your narrow definition, on its face, is absurd.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Where do you get this defintion, if I look up the defintion of empire in the dictionary: which is:</dd>
<dd>"A political unit having an extensive territory or comprising a number of territories or nations and ruled by a single supreme authority."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it mentions your two conditions:
<dl>
<dd>1. a certain percentage of a country's people must consider there country an empire to be an empire</dd>
<dd>2. a country must crown its leader emporer to be an empire.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The dictionary makes no mention of popular opinion, nor of crowning an emporer/emporess. America fits very well into the empire category, by the dictionary definition. Your erroneous defintion, on its face, can be dismissed out of hand. Travb 16:54, 22 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You and your ilk are very good at "dismissing out of hand" those inconvenient comments you wish to ignore. The bottom line is America is not, and has never been, as self-described "empire" even though some have advocated very much the same concept from a mercantile point of view. On that final point, I'll grant that there is an imperial element to the way some in America view their power, but that's a very imperfect definition of "empire." In truth, for many who use it today it is simply a term of derision, and it mostly comes from those who are jealous of, or hateful towards, America, its people or its successes. <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>UserLists</sup></small></a> 17:26, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I think your 'choices' show that you are simply trolling for reactions, and will continue to attack until you get the "right" answer. I'm not biting. It's pretty obvious that you and others have come here with biases to create a POV article and your POV is that "America is an evil empire" and you see your mission as "exposing" and defaming it. Good luck with that. You'll find a lot of support from America-haters online. And yes, it's largely hate, although some are clearly innocently sucked in by the obstensible initial desire for "balance" in a discussion. The discussion itself is rather poisonous, as we've seen on this page, and the article that has resulted from it. The fact that any defense of America someone may mount is an "irrational defence" tells us enough about where you're coming from = a visceral, measurable hatred. Get help for that.

I always knew defining all Americans a certain way was narrow, especially in a country of 280 million people, but I had yet, except in a few rare exceptions, to meet people who thought differently than yourself. Now that I am in the masters program of international relations, I realize that there are tens of thousands of Americans who don't see America with a "Disneyland version of history" and their view is often even more balanced than my own, which is humbling.

But I also don't take a "Hellhole" view of American history either. There is a happy medium, and I hope editors of a NPOV article would try to find it. While some try to sanitize history (point granted) others set out to emphasize ALL of the negatives and focus solely on them. One can easily do both, but people should avoid the temptation. America is powerful, and that lends itself to the "empire" label from critics who hate or envy or fear it as a superpower. But I would say that a vast majority of Americans (not just 'tens of thousands') do NOT EVER want to oppress other peoples and nations, do not want to dictate to others how they should live, or permenantly occupy other nations. That's why any talk of "empire" seems forced upon us, and doesn't really reflect the total reality of today's America, though in times past it may have been more relevant of a definition, and perhaps there are shades of this in the rhetoric and actions of some of our leaders and would-be leaders. <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>UserLists</sup></small></a> 22:05, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</font></font></dd>

<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">To Travb, I would like to say that I have no intention of practising "childish irrationality and name-calling", nor am I going to call anyone irrational or prejudiced. I accept that on one level, America does fit the definition of an <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire.html" title="Empire">empire</a>, and it's quite valid to use the term "American Empire", in a purely interpretative/historical sense, to refer to one interpretation of US history. However, I was looking at two main points:</font></font></p>
<dl>
<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">1) America does not call itself an empire. The only country that still refers to itself as an empire, ruled by an emperor, is <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> - which, incidentally, doesn't fit your definition of an empire, as it isn't a particularly large or multi-ethnic state.</font></font>

</dl>
</dd>
<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">2) In my mind, using the term 'empire' in an interpretative sense tends to have connotations. It implies a nation that is authoritarian or semi-authoritarian, in which power is vested in the centre, and in which authority rests on a combination of military force and hereditary or traditional legitimacy. I would also feel that calling a nation an empire tends to imply (though I understand that it isn't universally true) that that nation is a monarchy.</font></font></dd>
</dl>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">I accept that a nation can fit the dictionary definition of 'empire' without being a monarchy, or being authoritarian, or calling itself an empire. But nonetheless, using the term 'empire' tends to imply all these things, in my mind at least. To use the term of a federal republic, which has never had a royal or imperial house, has never been a military dictatorship or authoritarian nation, and vests its sovereignty in the people, seems to me to be misleading (although not necessarily wrong). I am not saying that America is 'morally superior' to an empire or a monarchy, in fact I am a staunch monarchist, as my username implies. I am also not an American. But, speaking as someone who is interested in law, titles and constitutions, America doesn't fit my idea of an empire. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 10:46, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</font></font></p>

But we should all try to examine this issue as historians, not as politicians, and no one, on either side of the debate, should be offended by any comments that may seem to be "anti-American" or "pro-American". As I am not an American, I feel I can treat this issue in an objective light. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 10:35, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</font></font></p>

That's why any talk of "empire" seems forced upon us, and doesn't really reflect the total reality of today's America, though in times past it may have been more relevant of a definition, and perhaps there are shades of this in the rhetoric and actions of some of our leaders and would-be leaders. <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_Userinterestlist_56e3.html" title="User:Nhprman/Userinterestlist"><small><sup>UserLists</sup></small></a> 22:05, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</i></font></font></p>

<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">We are all taught a very patriotic version of our nations history. In worldwide polls, Americans are consistently considered the most patriotic and most religious (for industrialize nations) contry in the world. There is a correlation to this, as others have argued.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue"><b><i>But I also don't take a "Hellhole" view of American history either. There is a happy medium, and I hope editors of a NPOV article would try to find it.</i></b></font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Since I have not seen your edits, I cannot confirm this one way or another. I assume that you do have a disneyland version of history and aplogize for Americas crimes, probably often calling them "mistakes". Sorry to bunch you into a group which maybe you don't fit into. People generalize all the time, it is how people think. I run into people who have a disneyland version of history and aplogize for Americas crimes all the time, and my unscientific experiences throughout my life confirm that most, but not all Americans think this way. Add my observations to polls and books I read on American sociology, and I think I have a convincing, albiet possibly flawed thesis about Americans <b>in general</b>. Yes there are generalities, and when I begin to debate, I do not point out those genralities. Could we both agree that the majority of Americans are very patriotic people who are taught and retain a very version of our nations history? That is my point I am trying to make.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">I will not repeat what I have argued elsewhere, you are welcome to read what I wrote, it is an artile entitled: <a href="http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/3837.html" class="external text" title="http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/3837.html" rel="nofollow">Four techniques many American's use to ignore American foreign policy history, Bill Bennett vs. Naom Chomsky</a> I think your argument falls within one of the four categories nicely.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">I just got done debating another wikiuser about this article I wrote, and I brought up many of the issues we have brought up here. He was a good debater. I was impressed. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:GreatGatsby#Re:_your_comments_with_TDC" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:GreatGatsby#Re:_your_comments_with_TDC" rel="nofollow">The debate is here</a>.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue"><b><i>But I would say that a vast majority of Americans (not just 'tens of thousands') do NOT EVER want to oppress other peoples and nations, do not want to dictate to others how they should live, or permenantly occupy other nations.</i></b></font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">If you ask an American do you want to oppress other peoples and nations? The vast majority of course would say no.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">But if you asked those same Americans if it is okay to practice manifest destiny, or if it is okay to free the people of the Spanish colonies, or if it is okay to go to the agressive war with Mexico, or if it is okay to contain communism, or fight the war on drugs, or fight the war on terror, most would say yes.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">So America has a rich and bloody history of oppressing other people's and nations, but most Americans either don't care, or they are frame this oppression in a different light. Every empire throughout history, to my knoweledge justifies its expansion and its oppresion.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Lets compare Americans justifications and Britians justifications. The only unique thing about our empire and empires of the past, is that as I quote in the article:</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">"...in Britain, empire was justified as a benevolent “white man’s burden.” And in the United States, empire does not even exist; “we” are merely protecting the causes of freedom, democracy, and justice worldwide."</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">In otherwords, to my knowledge, America is the first empire whose people actually deny that it is an empire.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">I believe a little bit of studying would make a non-American realize that America is NOT protecting the causes of freedom, democracy, and justice worldwide. In fact, that is what has happened throughout the world, people seriously question whether America is "protecting the causes of freedom, democracy, and justice worldwide".</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">For example, of the 35 countries America has intervened in, only one, the basket case Colombia, is a democracy ten years after our intevention. That is a pretty poor record of importing freedom and democracy. Please see the study: <a href="http://www.hooverdigest.org/042/bdm.html" class="external free" title="http://www.hooverdigest.org/042/bdm.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hooverdigest.org/042/bdm.html</a> BUT if you look at it from the perspective of American business's controling and exploiting third world natural resources, America's interventions have been an astounding success. America supports and has supported many brutal and bloody dictators consistently throughout its history. Many of these dictators America puts in power through military intervention or covert ops, sometimes even overthrowing democratically elected governments in the process. Anyway, I am repeating myself again. I could name a million examples of this, but I am bored with this discussion and need to do some homework. PS, America is not a hellhole. I am happy and thankful that I am born here, in this time.Travb 23:08, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</font></font></p>

<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue"><i>As for the 35 nation intervention article, it mischaracterizes the facts, somewhat. Nicaragua, Columbia, Grenada, Panama, Bosnia and (to a lesser degree, and so far, 7 years later) Kosovo, all ended up - or remained - democracies 10 years after interventions. So the article lies to make a point, which may or may not have some merit, by the way (you must assume I favor interventionism, just like you think I support a "Disneyland" view of history.)</i></font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Please remember that the author has strick guidelines for what they characterize as democracy:</font></font></p>
<ol>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="blue">limits on executive power,</font></font></li>
<li style="list-style: none"></li>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="blue">clear rules for the transition of power,</font></font></li>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="blue">universal adult suffrage, and</font></font></li>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="blue">competitive elections emerge within 10 years.</font></font></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="blue">The author acknowleges that Colombia is a democracy, 10 years after. The author's argue this is the only democracy.</font></font></li>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Kosovo/Bosnia may be another acception, but it has not been 10 years.</font></font></li>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="blue">I assume when you talk about Panama you are talking about the US invasion in 1989 (?) to overthrow our former puppet Noreaga. In 1999, 10 years later, was Panama a democracy? I don't know enough Panama right now to say. Please do some research on this point and I will write the author and ask them why this is not included or why Grenada is not considered a democracy.</font></font></li>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Grenada. I assume you are talking about the invasion during the Reagan administration when Reagan frightened the American population with an absurd claim that if Grenada became communist, then Soviet tanks are only a days ride to Texas. What year was this? Please do some research on this point and I will write the author and ask them why this is not included or why Grenada is not considered a democracy.</font></font></li>
</ul>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Unfortunalty, the list that the authors rely on by Patrick Regan, one of the pages, the 1980's is blocked by Google Print and the entire section is not available on Amazon. This just happens to cover the two conflicts that you mention: Grenada and Panama. I will attempt to get a hard copy of the book sometime in the future to complete this book.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Lets say though <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a>, that you are correct, and that these professors are incorrect, and that instead of one conficts, there are actually three conflicts were invasion has been successful in installing a democratic regieme. (Kosovo/Bosnia is still to early) 3 countries divided by 35 is better than 3% but it is still a dismal 8% success rate. Even if you do include Kosovo/bosnia in three years (when the 10 years has run), 4 countries divided by 35 is 11.4% success rate. That means that America has invaded 90% of the countries and been unsuccessful in installing democracies almost 90% of the time. This is a pretty dismal record.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">The record looks dismal unless you see American foriegn intervention as control and explotation of third world resources. If a person looks at this record that way, American intervention is a smashing success.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">In addition, the Bruce Bueno de Mesquita study does not discuss the dictatorships that America has actively supported since the end of WW2. Bruce Bueno de Mesquita study also does not fully touch upon the democratically elected governments which America has overthrown, either overtly or covertly.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">So go ahead and find me some research on Panama and Grenada. I will then study the information that you provide, and then ask the author via e-mail why these countries don't qualify or are not on the list.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">I am glad that after 4 or 5 responses, we are finally discussing topics of substance.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">---</font></font></p>
<ol>
<li><font color="blue"><font color="blue"><cite id="endnote_1" style="font-style: normal;"><a href="#ref_1" title=""><b>^</b></a></cite>&#160; INTERVENTION AND DEMOCRACY is a paper not avaiable on the internet which Mesquita e-mailed to me. It is much more complex but much more detailed than the article Why Gun-Barrel Democracy Doesn't Work, and is the study which Why Gun-Barrel Democracy Doesn't Work was based upon.<br />
The INTERVENTION AND DEMOCRACY article is much broader than the Why Gun-Barrel Democracy Doesn't Work, and includes studies of the success rates of the UN, autocracies, and other democracies in interventing in other countries and installing democracies after intervention. The study finds that the UN is the most successful of the four.</font></font></li>

<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">In my experience and in my readings, the vast majority of Americans support James W.

<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Less Americans support interventionism. In fact, America has had a strong history of support for isolationism by its popultation (but unfortunatly not by its leaders). For example, before both world wars America did not want to get involved with these wars, and there was a strong isolationist portion of America.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Interesting, and I just thought of this, it seems, on its face, that post World War 2 Americans were much more willing to invade other countries. Was it because of the propoganda which manfuactured fear was much more sophisticated then before World War 2? I don't have the answer yet.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">So in conclusion, while the vast majority of Americans subscribe to a <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/What%27s_the_Matter_with_Kansas%3F#Officer_Friendly_History_Books" class="external text" title="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/What%27s_the_Matter_with_Kansas%3F#Officer_Friendly_History_Books" rel="nofollow">"disneyland version of history"</a> much less Americans support interventionism.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">(1) The discussion of the dictionary definition has been put at the top under "definition of empire." It should be seperated from the historical discussion cleanly. As such it needs some changes.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">(2) The "benevolent empire" <b>is</b> a proper subsection of "no empire." This is because the agreement on historical facts and ethical judgements is nearly complete; the difference is terminology. People who argue that the U.S. is a good empire are much closer to those who argue that it is not one than they are to either those who argue that it is a bad empire or that it once was a bad one. The article is clearer if people with similar political and historical positions are kept in the same section, even if they prefer opposite terminology.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">(3) Removal of Miller's description of "no empire" theorists. It's unfair to describe them in others' words when their own are available. Miller is clearly hostile to the position and so should not be used to describe what it advocates.</font></font></p>

<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">My point is that the three arguments (america is imperialist, america is not imperialist, america is accidentally imperialist) are not sufficient to prove the hypothesis that america is an empire. Non-empires can be imperialistic (i.e. imperialism is a necessary but not sufficient property for an empire). What makes an empire then? My claim is that an explicit declaration of imperial policy is necessary to make an empire; if imperialism is not intentional, it is accidental. Everyone agrees that the US government denies being an empire and that the public doesnt understand itself to be an empire.</font></font></dd>
<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Someone who believes the US has an imperialistic foreign policy must still account for why teh US government claims it does not intend to have an imperialistic foreign policy to claim the US is an empire. This means showing they are lying or in denial. Also since the american people are generally opposed to the idea US being an empire (or else they would announce it), it means showing the US government conspires against the US people to implement an imperialist foreign policy. As an opponent of marxism I would claim Marxists overcome the issues of trying to prove conspiracy by including a definition of imperialism given by Lenin: capitalism is imperialism. Including this premise allows them to prove US foreign policy is at heart imperial.<a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 05:58, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</font></font>

<h3><font color="blue"><font color="blue"><span class="mw-headline">The detremental effect of many American's views</span></font></font></h3>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">I am not arguing that Zinn and Chomsky have ideas which are similar to Marixism. I am simply arguing that to call them Marxist is overly simplistic, and incorrect.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">In my observation, the thing that many Americans seem to lack is an ability to see nuainces. Especially when it comes to politics, their own history, and other countries, they have naive and broad generalizations, for very complex events and ideas. America is the country where simplistic "sound bites" and simplistic ideas, rule supreme. Worse, most Americans have no desires to even see the nuainces.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">I am an international relations major, and I subscribe to the Marxist view of intenational theory of business exploiting labor, without the silly quasi-religous Mosaic view that "Marxism is inevitable". <i>(I find it wonderfully ironic that the one night that my International Relations Theory class is canceled, I am talking about IR theory with you at the same time as my class should be taking place)</i> Both Zinn and Chomsky share my view of business exploiting labor.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Neither, to my knowledge, believe in the mosaic view that Marxism is inevitable. I have met American Communists and they have a religious tone to the future of humanity. I do not see that in either of Zinn and Chomsky's readings.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">I am not a "Marxist", no matter what people say in simplistic, broad generalizations. I am not even a socialist. Instead, I am a far-left liberal. Human beings, by our very nature, attempt to categorize and label complex processes and ideas into simple boxes. It is much easier, and much less intellectual work, for you to dismiss Chomsky, Zinn, and my own views as "Communist" and "Marxist". It is much harder, and much more intellectual work, to find the important nuainces between our views and those of Marxism.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue"><b>Lenin was not a Marxist</b></font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Also, please keep in mind that even Lenin was not a Marxist. Communism was a faux (fake) Marxist society for several reasons. First, Marx taught that their must be a capitalist society in existence before Communism.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">The revolution in Russia happened in a peasant society, which <b>never had capatilism</b>. Lenin adopted the "Vanguard theory"—-if you can teach people about their alienation, you can "jump-start the revolution" (Lenin believed that Russians were going to teach the people about their material alienation)"</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">This idea that you can "jump-start the revolution" is completly foreign to Marxism theory. Marx taught that the people would rise up and overthrow the ruling class. It was a bottom-up process, not a top-down process. My professor says that Marx would never accept Lenin as a Marxist.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Second, and most Americans do not realize this, I found personally in Ukraine that <b>Soviets themselves never saw themselves as a Communist society</b>--Communism was an <b>ideal</b> to be reached, hopefully someday in the undetermined future. The Soviet Union saw itself as a socialist country moving toward the communist ideal--the utopia of Communism.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue"><b>The terribly determinal effect of simplistic labels</b></font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">I am troubled by you calling Zinn and Chomsky Marxists. First of all, as I show above, it is incorrect (Chomsky is an anarchist). Second, throughout American history, Americans use the label of Communism and Marxism as a propoganda tool to stop a more socially equal society and to get the US into wars.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">This vicious propoganda is the reason why America, unlike Europe, has no real labor party. It was destroyed with years of violent oppression. This detremental propoganda is the reason why Americas social net is in such tatters. Why 37 million Americans, including myself and my family have no health insurance.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">As I often quote:</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue"><i>"What should one write to ruin an adversary? The best thing is to prove that he is not one of us -- the stranger, alien, foreigner. To this end we create the category of the true family. We here, you and I, <b>the authorities</b>, are a true family. We live in unity, among our own kind. We have the same roof over our heads, we sit at the same table, we know how to get along with each other, how to help each other out. Unfortunately, we are not alone."--Ryszard Kapuscinski in Shah of Shahs</i></font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Throughout American history, any person that attempts to question the business ruling class here in America, is labeled a "communist". Any group or people who threatens the business class of America is dismissed as "communist".</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Did you know that throughout America's shameful history, Social security, the 8 hour work day, minimum wage, unions, the FDA, have all been labeled as "commuist"?

<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">I apologize if this next statment comes across as rude. I argue that your view is naive and simplistic.

<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">In addition, I argue that your view is detremental to the social fabric of America as a whole, is the reason behind the deaths of millions of people worldwide, and is even determential to your own economic welfare and well being. What is so despressing is so many Americans have been conditioned to believe the same detrimental bullshit.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">So continue to label anything which questions American society as "communist" it is like labeling a person's view as "crazy".</font></font></p>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">This is exactly what Americans are doing to the leadership of Iran right now, without any desire to understand why Iran is justifiably so afraid of American hemogony. Once a person labels another as "crazy" or "communist" all of their ideas are automatically dismissed, no matter what the real merit of the ideas.</font></font></p>

<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">oh yeah. back burner. I think its pretty well established that Marx has had an influence on historical analysis and other social sciences. When I say Marxist I dont mean communist. I mean It assumes a Marxist frame or falls in the Marxist tradition. Im not an expert on marx so to me this has two major elements, economic class analysis of historical and social dynamics and a labor theory of value and exploitation. Economic class analysis is a useful approach, but I dont think its determining. I am sympathetic to the position that ideas are the primary mover of history (Hegelian). Class analysis is useful to understand and measure how the idea is incorporates into a society. As for the labor theory of value I dont agree with it or the consequent claim of capitalist exploitation. I knew Chomsky was a libertarian socialist, but when I said he has Marxist sympathies I mean with respect to particular ideas such as the premises of class analysis and labor theories of value, exploitation, and imperialism. In the case of Lenin I dont know much about him except that he is teh source of a claim popular and mostly incorporated into the Marxist frame-- capitalism as imperialism. All of which may be logically consequent if you agree with the labor theory of value as a premise.<a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 07:07, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</font></font></dd>

<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">I would have to concur with <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a>'s perspective that the word <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxist.html" title="Marxist">Marxist</a> is used in many different contexts. Although I don't know much about the situation in America, here in the UK Marxist and <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist.html" title="Communist">Communist</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_parties.html" title="Political parties">political parties</a> have almost no impact on mainstream politics; however, this doesn't mean that Marxist ideas haven't influenced many people on the left. In a sense, many academic historians could be, and frequently are, described as Marxist; not because they subscribe to Marxist or Marxist-Leninist political views, but because they have been influenced by Marx's interpretation of political history as being defined in economic terms, viz. those with property and wealth dominate power structures. Returning to the subject at hand, the interpretation of America as imperialist, as well as the perception of 'empire' as being dominated by big business and wealth production, is an interpretation that belongs to the Marxist school of historical thought. This does not mean that it is solely a Communist or socialist belief, nor that one has to be a Marxist to subscribe to it. But this interpretation of political-economic history is one that originates with Marx. I hasten to add that I am not calling anyone a Communist or a Marxist-Leninist. But while most socialists and leftists today would not subscribe to doctrinaire Marxism, the fundamentals of their political thought are based around the Marxist school of interpretation that stresses the power of capital. I also agree with Travb's statement that Marxism-Leninism is qualitatively different from philosophical Marxism in a number of ways. Marx was a thinker and historian; his views were based around abstract thought and academic interpretation. Lenin was an active politician, and so moulded some of the principles of Marxism to suit his immediate needs and advantages. As such, Marxism as practised in the USSR was not entirely true to the rather unrealistic dreams of <a href="../../../d/a/s/Das_Kapital_c638.html" title="Das Kapital">Das Kapital</a> and the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Manifesto_2ae3.html" title="Communist Manifesto">Communist Manifesto</a>. From my own more centre-right perspective, and from the perspective of a student of history, it appears to me that it is not mindless bigotry to refer to the ideas of 'American imperialism' and 'oppressive capitalism' as leftist views. They are, in essence, leftist views influenced by the economic-political theories of Karl Marx, among a variety of other writers and politicians. This does not mean that everyone subscribing to them is a radical leftist, and I am not in the habit of McCarthy-style anti-Communist rants against anyone who disagrees with me. Therefore, I hope no one is offended by this comment. If they are, I apologise. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 13:03, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</font></font></p>

In a sense, many academic historians could be, and frequently are, described as Marxist; not because they subscribe to Marxist or Marxist-Leninist political views, but because they have been influenced by Marx's interpretation of political history as being defined in economic terms, viz. those with property and wealth dominate power structures. Returning to the subject at hand, the interpretation of America as imperialist, as well as the perception of 'empire' as being dominated by big business and wealth production, is an interpretation that belongs to the Marxist school of historical thought. This does not mean that it is solely a Communist or socialist belief, nor that one has to be a Marxist to subscribe to it. But this interpretation of political-economic history is one that originates with Marx. I hasten to add that I am not calling anyone a Communist or a Marxist-Leninist. But while most socialists and leftists today would not subscribe to doctrinaire Marxism, the fundamentals of their political thought are based around the Marxist school of interpretation that stresses the power of capital. I also agree with Travb's statement that Marxism-Leninism is qualitatively different from philosophical Marxism in a number of ways. Marx was a thinker and historian; his views were based around abstract thought and academic interpretation. Lenin was an active politician, and so moulded some of the principles of Marxism to suit his immediate needs and advantages. As such, Marxism as practised in the USSR was not entirely true to the rather unrealistic dreams of <a href="../../../d/a/s/Das_Kapital_c638.html" title="Das Kapital">Das Kapital</a> and the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Manifesto_2ae3.html" title="Communist Manifesto">Communist Manifesto</a>. From my own more centre-right perspective, and from the perspective of a student of history, it appears to me that it is not mindless bigotry to refer to the ideas of 'American imperialism' and 'oppressive capitalism' as leftist views. They are, in essence, leftist views influenced by the economic-political theories of Karl Marx, among a variety of other writers and politicians. This does not mean that everyone subscribing to them is a radical leftist, and I am not in the habit of McCarthy-style anti-Communist rants against anyone who disagrees with me. Therefore, I hope no one is offended by this comment. If they are, I apologise. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 13:03, 18 April 2006 (UTC) (NB I have repeated this comment from earlier, as I put it in the wrong place before.

<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Once again, I must stress that I wasn't calling you or anyone else a Communist. I was just saying that many leftists, including some who might be described as Marxist, take the perspective that America is an imperialist state, dominated by capitalists, that exploits other nations in the interests of its own economic security. I'm not saying this isn't a valid view. I've already agreed, in a previous archived discussion on this page, that America is a <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_facto.html" title="De facto">de facto</a> empire, as it exerts influence and power, either formal or informal, over a wide area. (I've also stated that it isn't a <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_jure.html" title="De jure">de jure</a> empire, but admittedly that's not quite relevant here.)</font></font></dd>
<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">As to what I was saying when invoking the name of Marx as an economic-political-historical thinker, a good example of what I was describing would be the British historian <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Hobsbawm_c95f.html" title="Eric Hobsbawm">Eric Hobsbawm</a>, whose historiographical interpretation is based, broadly, on Marx's interpretation of economic politics, and who is sometimes described as 'Marxist' in academic circles. There are many other historians, both in Britain and the US, who take a similar perspective. This doesn't mean that they're Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries; they clearly aren't.</font></font></dd>

<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Returning to the question at hand (sorry I do tend to get sidetracked), America can be described as a de facto empire according to a dictionary definition; I've already agreed this. Whether America is an exploitative imperialist state, using the term 'imperialist' in its usual pejorative sense, is a matter of socio-political perspective. The view that America is such a state is one that tends to be associated with leftists - not necessarily Marxists. I was just saying that Karl Marx, purely as an academic thinker, has had an influence on this school of thought. This doesn't mean that anyone who believes it is a Marxist, and I have never said this. I have no respect for the kind of debaters who cry 'Communist!' at anyone who disagrees with them; such people exist not just in the US. I try not to be that kind of person. As a student of history, I only use the terms Communist and Marxist in relation to the actual socio-political-economic perspective of Karl Marx, not as a blanket statement for anyone who doesn't agree with me. And I hope that I haven't come over as insulting; I apologise again if you felt I was calling anyone Marxist. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 09:19, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</font></font></p>

<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">I have to raise a small objection to one of your statements here. You say "capitalists will build the rope to hang themselves with". To my understanding, this is a misuse of the term "capitalist", as you seem to be using it as a synonym for "conservative" or "rightist". Regardless of political perspective, I have only come across two uses of the term:</font></font></p>
<dl>
<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">1) (In economic theory) One who possesses <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capital.html" title="Capital">capital</a>, i.e. wealth and property.</font></font></dd>
<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">2) (In politics) One who supports a capitalist economic system, i.e. one that includes private property.</font></font></dd>
</dl>
<p><font color="blue"><font color="blue">(You've probably noticed that I like to list and categorise things - just a weird habit of mine.) Anyway, definition 2 is not a synonym for 'conservative' or 'right-wing'. There are plenty of people on the centre or centre-left of politics who could be described as 'capitalist', in that they support the principle of private ownership of property, and do not support nationalisation or co-operative ownership of industries. Many such people would be offended to be described as conservatives. The only people who can be properly described as non-capitalist would be <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marxists.html" title="Marxists">Marxists</a>, far-left democratic <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialists.html" title="Socialists">socialists</a>, and <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-syndicalists.html" title="Anarcho-syndicalists">anarcho-syndicalists</a>, as these are the only people who believe that no substantial property or wealth should be in private hands. I hasten to add that it doesn't offend me; I am both a conservative and a pro-capitalist. As to the film <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Corporation_fd7a.html" title="The Corporation">The Corporation</a>, I've never seen it myself, but after reading your contribution I looked up the article on the film. It sounds like a valid point of view, and I certainly wouldn't dismiss it as 'communist'. Like any other system, global capitalism has an impact that is worth addressing, and I don't think anyone would seriously argue that there should be no state regulation or review of the activities of global corporations. This viewpoint isn't communist, or even necessarily leftist. Sorry, I've got rather sidetracked from the point of this debate, so it might be best to start a new section. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 13:33, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</font></font></p>

<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Secondly please don't take this negatively but Military intervention might be a little strong for what happened exactly with the Panama canal situation, gunboat diplomacy or big stick diplomacy which is exactly what your article claims they did might be better. <i>Panama proceeded to proclaim its independence on 3 November 1903, and the USS Nashville in local waters impeded any interference from Colombia (see gunboat diplomacy).</i> and more specifically <i>big stick diplomacy</i>. Would it be alright with you if either gunboat diplomacy or big stick diplomacy is used? Either of those would be completely acceptable with me and I hopefully they meet your definition. If not please tell me as soon as possible and I'm sure we can quickly agree on a topic. - <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatman2648_01fe.html" title="User:Patman2648">Patman2648</a> 04:13, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</font></font></dd>

I'm really sorry that people are so intolerant of your views, I try to appreciate everybody's views so that I see the full spectrum of ideas and choose which one is best for me, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marketplace_of_ideas.html" title="Marketplace of ideas">marketplace of ideas</a>, which what makes democracy and a free society so great is that people can choose their own beliefs from a wide variety and pick which one fits them best. I know that you're an intelligent and passionate person and should be treated that way not with condemnation and cries of heresy. The best words of advice that I can give you about wikipedia is to not edit pages that you feel too passionately about because then bias can come out and when someone edits your words then it'll angry you. Also if people are ignorant and uncivil towards you then try to be civil in return and if that doesn't work then don't talk to them, some people are real jerks and you just have to leave them alone because there are plenty of wonderful intelligent people out there like you. In the end I just want to say that I appreciate your kind words towards my character and am equally impressed by your great personality.

The reason I chose to use peacekeeping for Yugoslavia was because the word interference was another poor word to use, interference is where something unwanted interrupts, most would agree that the war crimes shouldn't be allowed to carry on and almost the entire world community wasn't supporting the brutality and ethic cleansing that Milosevic was doing, intervention which you proposed is a much better word than interference. NATO claimed the intent to peacekeep so that's why I put it there, in fact the demands of NATO was for Yugoslavia to allow "peacekeepers" into the country and return borders to status quo but Milosevic refused that why I use peacekeeping but I'm equally fine with intervention because broader words the better when dealing with controversial issues so don't worry and its not a problem with me at all. I also completely agree with your choice of using broad terms of using Iraq War and Gulf War because just like you said that, people unaware would better understand. The reason I used military terms for the it was because the section is talking military interventions and using the exact terms for the military interventions would be best and if you clicked on the links they went to the the page of Gulf War and Iraq War anyways so we had the same pages in mind. In the end, I just want to reiterate that I'm fine with the changes and I liked the work that you did and appreciate you discussing the issues with me instead of just tinkering with the page and not talking about it. I gave the courtesy to talk about what I was going to change and why and I'm very happy that you also were very courteous and civil to do the same.

The immaculate conception is, obviously, a theological concept believed by all members of the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a>. If the author is trying to say that Americans are deluding themselves into believing an "innocent" view of their national history (which would be a POV statement in itself), and is comparing this with Catholics' belief in the purity of the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Mary_d301.html" title="Virgin Mary">Virgin Mary</a>, couldn't this be regarded as an anti-Catholic comment?

<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">"Miller argues that this agony is because of America’s sense of innocence, produced by a kind of "immaculate conception" view of America's origins. When European settlers came to America they miraculously shed their old ways upon arrival in the New World, as one might discard old clothing, and fashioned new cultural garments based solely on experiences in a new and vastly different environment."</font></font></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">Basically Miller argues that Americans view themselves as unique. This is why American's text books focus little on the origins of the ideas which brought America into existence. As the saying goes: no event is born in a vaccuum. By deemphisizing or ignoring the similarities that America has with other cultures, America get a religious view of their country, that their country is special, and unique, and even blessed by God:</font></font></dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">"Miller believes that school texts, patriotic media, and patriotic speeches on which Americans have been reared do not stress the origins of America's system of government, that these sources often omit or downplay that the "United States Constitution owes its structure as much to the ideas of John Calvin and Thomas Hobbes as to the experiences of the Founding Fathers; that Jeffersonian thought to a great extent paraphrases the ideas of earlier Scottish philosophers; and that even the allegedly unique frontier egalitarian has deep roots in seventeenth century English radical traditions."[6] Philosopher Douglas Kellner traces the identification of American exceptionalism as a distinct phenomenon back to 19th century French observer Alexis de Tocqueville, who concluded by agreeing that the U.S., uniquely, was "proceeding along a path to which no limit can be perceived.""</font></font></dd>

<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">OK, "anti-Catholic" would be too strong a term to use. I'm not hugely familiar with Miller's work, but on closer perusal, I see that the article's wording traces the analogy firmly to Miller. As such, it's a valid point of view, although I don't personally concur with Miller's interpretation in the slightest. Don't most people, in all nations, have <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriotic.html" title="Patriotic">patriotic</a> feelings that may bias their perspective on their own country's history? Certainly, many Americans believe that the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional.html" title="Constitutional">constitutional</a> concepts of liberty and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Representative_government.html" title="Representative government">representative government</a> are a purely American invention, while in reality they can be traced back to a variety of European philosophers.</font></font></dd>

<dd><font color="blue"><font color="blue">But we're all biased towards our own nations, and there's nothing wrong with that. To give a completely different example, most people in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_2311.html" title="New Zealand">New Zealand</a> staunchly maintain that the <a href="../../../w/r/i/Wright_Brothers_bd60.html" title="Wright Brothers">Wright Brothers</a> did not develop the first aeroplane; it is a historical controversy whether New Zealand farmer Richard Pierce was in fact the first man to construct a powered aircraft. Of course, most air historians are quite satisfied that the Wright Brothers' flight was the first flight long enough to be regarded as successful - but just try telling a New Zealander that. Sorry I've got a bit sidetracked, but basically I am only trying to prove that every nation has a slightly distorted conception of its own history. That isn't unique to Americans. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 09:13, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</font></font></dd>
