<p>Anyone want to comment on the Clintons? I still think they should be listed. I've outlined why Bill Clinton is a liberal above. Revolucion pointed out that Bill hasn't supported gay rights as much as some other liberals. I'd respond by saying that gay rights activism is a tiny part of liberalism when compared to "big" topics like social welfare, environmentalism, foreign policy, and education. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 23:46, August 25, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Moved over here for easier discussion. How about taxes, abortion (specifically partial-birth abortion), universal health care, education, gun control. I don't think I need to go on. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 19:17, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Clintons support the ban on partial-birth abortion, support tax cuts, oppose universal health care that's actually <i>universal</i>, and refused to take a stand on the <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_voucher.html" title="School voucher">school voucher</a> issue.
<dl>
<dd>So that's why he "adjusted" taxes higher, vetoed a partial-birth abortion ban, and proposed his health plan, which is basically universal... see <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinton_health_care_plan.html" title="Clinton health care plan">Clinton health care plan</a>. (I suppose it is not truly <i>universal</i> since it does not cover Martians. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 19:32, 26 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That would be why he signed tax cuts for everybody except the top 10%, vetoed a partial-birth abortion plan with a ton of other, nonrelated amendments on it, and proposed a health care plan that wasn't universal because it didn't cover everybody in America or even cover all of their medical expenses.
<dl>
<dd>Have you even studied Clinton at all? We are proud to call Clinton a liberal. Perhaps you should start by reading <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">this article</a>. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 19:37, 26 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Who's "we," kemosabe? You are the first and only Democrat I know to claim Clinton as a liberal. All of the other Democrats I know (and they number in the hundreds, if not thousands) either hated his nonliberalism or praise it, but they all acknowledge it as a fact. The only people who think Clinton was liberal are conservatives, compared to whom <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Wallace_0df8.html" title="George Wallace">George Wallace</a> was pretty damn liberal.
<dl>
<dd>No, Democrats you know are probably just ashamed to call a spade a spade. People now claim being a liberal is a bad thing. People want to change the language of politics. "Extreme Liberal" becomes "Progressive" and "Liberal" becomes "centrist" or "third way". Not calling Clinton a liberal would be like not calling Bush a conservative. I'll give you the fact that he is not the <i>most</i> liberal person on the list, but he's a liberal nonetheless. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 19:46, 26 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Clinton is guilty of those crimes. If he knew you were calling him "liberal," he would vehemently deny it and explain, in detail, why it's inaccurate. Bill Clinton hates liberals and that's why he used the term as an insult against <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Harkin_d0d4.html" title="Tom Harkin">Tom Harkin</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Brown_fc91.html" title="Jerry Brown">Jerry Brown</a>, both of whom are on the list, when the three of them ran for president.
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, and I'm sure Ann Coulter wouldn't refer to herself as a crazy right-wing whacko, but just because someone doesn't want a label, does not mean they do not deserve it. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 20:02, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There is a difference between the two phrases you compared. Many liberals indeed call themselves "liberals". And no doubt Ann Coulter would call herself a conservative (even though she is indeed more than just a conservative, she's a crazy right-wing wacko). --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_5794.html" title="User:Revolución">Revolución</a> <i>(<a href="../../../r/e/v/User_talk%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_6ee1.html" title="User talk:Revolución">talk</a>)</i> 16:30, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let's compare the records of Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clinton: "The era of big government is over." Nixon: "We are all <a href="../../../k/e/y/Keynesian_economics.html" title="Keynesian economics">Keynesians</a> now."</li>
<li>Clinton: NAFTA and welfare reform. Nixon: EPA and OSHA.</li>
<li>Clinton: Bottom income tax bracket of ten percent. Top income tax bracket of 37%. Nixon: <a href="../../../n/e/g/Negative_income_tax.html" title="Negative income tax">Negative income tax</a> for the poor. Top income tax bracket of 70%.</li>
<li>Clinton's failed health care plan: Hillarycare. Nixon's failed health care plan: Canadian-style single-payer.</li>
<li>Clinton: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman." Nixon: "I am not a crook."</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: If Clinton gets to be a liberal, so does Nixon.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The article has an entire section discussing the question of whether Nixon should be counted as a liberal. A similar section on Clinton might well be in order. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 05:50, August 27, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hell no. The facts are neither Clinton nor Nixon (why would anybody even suggest that?) are liberals. Nixon was a conservative. Clinton was a centrist (who has been looked upon as "liberal" by extreme conservatives). --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_5794.html" title="User:Revolución">Revolución</a> <i>(<a href="../../../r/e/v/User_talk%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_6ee1.html" title="User talk:Revolución">talk</a>)</i> 16:43, 27 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When I suggested it, I was sarcastically making the point that Nixon was to the left of Clinton a number of issues and if Bill Clinton, Mr. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Democrat_0cbd.html" title="Conservative Democrat">Conservative Democrat</a> himself, got to be on the list, so should Nixon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Nixon may have been less conservative and a bit more secular than the current extremist conservatives, but he was in no way a liberal or even a moderate, he was a conservative. Remember, he had an "<a href="../../../n/i/x/Nixon%27s_Enemies_List_21b8.html" title="Nixon's Enemies List">enemies list</a>" which includes many liberals, including the wonderful <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Conyers_bd70.html" title="John Conyers">John Conyers</a>. --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_5794.html" title="User:Revolución">Revolución</a> <i>(<a href="../../../r/e/v/User_talk%7ERevoluci%C3%B3n_6ee1.html" title="User talk:Revolución">talk</a>)</i> 18:54, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Looking from the left, I'd say that Clinton and Nixon have about equally good claims on being liberals (which is to say, not much in either case, but about equal). Nixon was president during the era of the liberal consensus, and governed from the right edge of that consensus, but mostly from within it. Clinton was president during what was basically an era of conservative consensus (certainly the liberal consensus had been broken), and governed more or less from the left edge of that consensus but, again, within it. The results were not radically different. I seriously do think we could use a medium-sized, well-cited section discussing Clinton, much as we have one on Nixon. It would be much more useful than adding him to a list. It would be particularly useful to cite both authorities who say he was a liberal as president and authorities who say he was not. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 02:27, August 31, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The concensus is that Clinton is a liberal.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The hell it is. I see two guys arguing that Clinton is liberal. Three have just advanced arguments to the contrary. No consensus has been reached and a majority say that Clinton isn't liberal.
<dl>
<dd>As someone who's studied liberalism for much of my life, I'm assured by all reputable sources that Clinton is liberal. He consistently and genuinely supports human rights over property rights, whenever there's a conflict between the two, which has come to be a litmus test for differentiating liberals and conservatives. Furthermore, he carries on the liberal tradition of strengthening international law and global governance, a position abhorred by conservatives. There's a reason that conservatives hated Clinton more than they have hated any president since Roosevelt. luketh 01:51, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Liberal Republican</span></h2>
<p>With reference as to why I restored "liberal wing" rather than "moderate wing" of the Republican Party in the section about Nixon: in 1968, the Republican Party still had a liberal wing, based largely in New York and New England. For example, when Vermont was solidly Republican, it was not notably more conservative than today. Republicans were strongly identified with liberal, anti-machine reformism in New York City (reform mayors <a href="../../../f/i/o/Fiorello_LaGuardia_f49f.html" title="Fiorello LaGuardia">Fiorello LaGuardia</a> in the 1930s and <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_V._Lindsay_2b71.html" title="John V. Lindsay">John V. Lindsay</a> in the 1960s, for example), and I believe the same could be said of many New England (and probably even New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ohio) cities, but as a New Yorker I don't know the names offhand.</p>
<p>Remember that, only a few years before, the "solid South" was solidly in the Democratic Party. This was the last era in which the Republican Party still had clear descent from its <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abolitionism.html" title="Abolitionism">abolitionist</a> past, by way of the Teddy Roosevelt Progressives. One of the key ways in which Nixon was <i>not</i> a liberal was his role in the realignment of American politics through his so-called Southern Strategy, playing up to Southern white prejudices.</p>
<p>Just to rattle off a few other names, though, of liberal Republican leaders from the 1960s: Nixon's running mate in 1960), <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Cabot_Lodge_b4e4.html" title="Henry Cabot Lodge">Henry Cabot Lodge</a>; New York senator <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob_Javits_2e57.html" title="Jacob Javits">Jacob Javits</a>; New York governor <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Rockefeller_e416.html" title="Nelson Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a> (though many consider him to have totally sold out liberalism and made a play for a role in the new, more conservative Republican Party in his handling of the Attica rebellion); Pennsylvania governor <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Scranton_c08b.html" title="William Scranton">William Scranton</a>; and, arguably, Michigan governor <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Romney_6248.html" title="George W.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Anonymous Poster's List</span></h2>
<p>An anonymous poster who keeps placing the very unliberal <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> on the list of liberal leaders has accused me of having too narrow a definition of "liberal." As evidence, he cited several other people on the list as people I should remove if I left Clinton off. Unfortunately for him/her, he/she forgot that I was the one who put them all on the list in the first place. I shall now explain their placement.</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, I agree that all these people except Huey Long (Huey Long!) should be on the list. You misunderstand me. My argument is that if these people are on the list, Clinton should be on it too, because, like Clinton, these people all have some conservative traits.
<dl>
<dd>These people, unlike Clinton, had almost completely liberal traits. You need a flashlight and a tweezer to find Clinton's liberalism.</dd>

<dd>My personal favorite – I love this man (remember the Humphrey-Hawkins bill?), and I cast my first vote for him in a Democratic primary in 1972. However, if you ask any American male of draft age in 1968 what he thinks of Humphrey, he’ll go berserk on you. In 1968, the far left considered Humphrey a warmongering vulture for his support of the Vietnam War, and (shades of Ralph Nader) they refused to vote for him, thereby helping Nixon get elected. No question about it, Humphrey was a hawk when it came to Vietnam, the Iraqi war of the 1960s. Does that make him a “centrist”?
<dl>
<dd>One wrong step does not erase Humphrey's lifetime of liberalism. If Clinton had been in his shoes, he would have been trying to cut food stamp funding because "the era of big government is over." And how does anyone know where Humphrey stood on the war? He never voiced opposition to it, but he never said he supported it, either.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Notice: I didn’t put Kerry on my list; you put him here. And I’m surprised you did, because Kerry’s politics are nearly the same as Clinton’s. He voted to support the war in Iraq in October 2002. He voted for the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction act and the Patriot Act. You’re wrong about welfare reform. Kerry voted for the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. He voted for NAFTA. (See <a href="http://www.covertactionquarterly.org/KerryTragic.html" class="external free" title="http://www.covertactionquarterly.org/KerryTragic.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.covertactionquarterly.org/KerryTragic.html</a>). Although you're right and he is most certainly a liberal like Clinton, by your definition Kerry is most definitely a “centrist.”
<dl>
<dd>I was talking about Bob Kerrey, not John Kerry. And John Kerry still gets to be on the list. Why? Because he has a liftime average of 92 from Americans for Democratic Action. That's the same as Tom Harkin. That's also higher than Birch Bayh, Bill Bradley, Frank Church, J.

It's even higher than Ted Kennedy. To get a 92 from ADA, you have to be doing something right.</dd>

<dd>You're lack of understanding of American history is really showing here. I'm very surprised this racist is on the list. If Huey Long is a liberal, so is Moussolini, who also built roads and bridges. Long was the worst race baiter in American politics. That immediately disqualifies him as a liberal. You can make him one of your “centrists” if you want, but before you do that, please, please, please read up on his history. He was a little Bayou fascist, not a liberal or a "centrist."
<dl>
<dd>I just got finished reading T. Harry Williams' nine-hundred-page-long, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Long. He didn't do anything for blacks (that would have been political suicide) but he didn't do anything against them. Certainly, he did not engage in "race-baiting." His specialty was <a href="../../../c/l/a/Class_warfare.html" title="Class warfare">class warfare</a>, which a fascist like Mussolini would definitely have frowned upon. By the way, J. William Fulbright voted against every piece of civil rights legislation he came upon. Shall we take one of the four most famous Vietnam opponents off the list, too?
<dl>
<dd>You have got to be kidding me. Did you know that <a href="../../../u/p/t/Upton_Sinclair_68d1.html" title="Upton Sinclair">Upton Sinclair</a>, who you mentioned above, modeled the main character of his "It Couldn't Happen Here" on Huey Long? I haven't read the book you mentioned, but it couldn't have been very good if it didn't go into Long's race baiting. I beg you to please consider removing this guy from your list. On Long's death, the NY Times wrote about him: "What he did and what he promised to do are full of political instruction and also of warning. In his own State of Louisiana he showed how it is possible to destroy self-government while maintaining its ostensible and legal form. He made himself an unquestioned dictator…. In reality, Senator Long set up a Fascist government in Louisiana. It was disguised, but only thinly. There was no outward appearance of a revolution, no march of Black Shirts upon Baton Rouge, but the effectual result was to lodge all the power of the State in the hands of one man. If Fascism ever comes in the United States it will come in something like that way."
<dl>
<dd>You cannot comment on Huey Long if you haven't read T. Harry Williams' book. It won the 1970 <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Biography_or_Autobiography_5eae.html" title="Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography">Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography</a> and the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Book_Award_03c8.html" title="National Book Award">National Book Award</a>. It's over 880 pages long and it has over fifty pages worth of notes. And that's the paperback. It is widely recognized as <i>THE</i> book on Huey Long. As to his alleged Fascist tendencies, the same could be said about every Democratic Party in the South. Or didn't you wonder about how <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Yarborough_b0af.html" title="Ralph Yarborough">Ralph Yarborough</a> got elected to statewide office in Texas? And you still haven't answered my question: If we remove Huey Long for his alleged racism, what possible excuse could you come up with for keeping <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._William_Fulbright_770d.html" title="J. William Fulbright">J. William Fulbright</a>?
<ol>
<li>Upton Sinclair's book is called <i>It Can't Happen Here</i>.</li>
<li>Long was certainly on the left, but I would not call him a liberal. And the issue isn't racism, it's that he had no respect for constitutionalism.</li>

<dd>I'd like to sign my comments, but as I never received that tutorial, I don't. As for Long, I still say that the description fits most every Southern Democratic politician going back from the mid-1960s to the dawn of time. Lyndon Johnson, for instance, got himself elected to the Senate by paying illegal immigrants $10 a pop to vote for him and by making a few inconvenient ballot boxes disappear. Of course, his opponent in the primary pulled the same tricks, so Johnson won by only 87 votes out of a million cast. Hence his nickname: "Landslide Lyndon."</dd>

<dd>TR practically invented American imperialism. This is man who described his foreign policy this way: "Walk softly and carry a big stick." He sent the Great White Fleet, a menacing armada of American gunships, on a tour of the world in 1902 to serve notice that America was a world power. Congress initially refused to fund this little imperial show of strength, so TR sent the Fleet halfway around the world. Congress had to fund its return. (The antiquities act...&lt;chuckle&gt;). This Yankee adventurer created some national parks, but c'mon, he doesn't belong on the list. He is a "centrist" at best.

<dd>Another one of my personal favorites. You forgot to mention his greatest achievement – forcing open shops to union membership. However, he ordered the dropping of the atomic bomb. If Michael Moore were alive in 1944, he would brand Truman a mass-murderer. Truman’s “containment doctrine” unleashed the CIA and its operatives against thousands, maybe millions, of innocent socialist and communist sympathizers in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Greece (during that country’s civil war).

<dd>Typically, you tag Warren as a liberal because all you know is his history on the Supreme Court. Ask a Japanese-American about Warren. As California Attorney General in 1942, he race-baited Japanese, calling them a threat to American security. He did it to advance his political career and pave the way for a run at Governor of California. Japanese-Americans remember him with scorn for casting them in the Willie Horton role. More than anyone, he was responsible for their internment (I believe remorse over this episode is the reason for his courageous support for civil rights on the Supreme Court). A race-baiter, someone willing to scapegoat a minority group to advance his political career – that makes him a scoundrel, and maybe a “centrist” too.

He never once, in his entire administration, attempted to do anything really liberal.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You say he attempted “nothing liberal.” You forget his first act in office – permitting gays to be in the military. His noble but doomed attempt to give us national health care in 1994 was admirable. And don’t forget that he passed the assault weapons ban in 1994 even though he sacrificed the Democratic Party’s majority in the House to do it. Clinton's "era of big gov't is over" was merely a statement of fact, as Americans have abandoned the idea of big gov't projects. Clinton did not oppose campaign finance reform (the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 was signed into law by G.W. Bush; Clinton did not oppose it). Clinton did “end welfare as we know it,” but what he ended was cash payments to poor people. He greatly enlarged the number of social programs in the United States, and this in spite of having to work with a Republican-controlled House and Senate from 1995 to 2001. You may remember that Clinton’s State of the Union addresses were laundry lists of social programs he wanted passed – programs that helped many millions of people. I’m especially fond of Americorps. On balance, I’m convinced that Clinton was a liberal, not one of your “centrists.”
<dl>
<dd>His noble-but-doomed attempt at creating national health care might still have worked, had liberals not opposed it for being neither universal nor even guaranteed. And the assault weapons bill is easily balanced-out by his ultraconservative crime bills, which contributed to the fact that we currently jail more of our citizens than Stalin did. He strenuously opposed campaign finance reform, both by word (voicing the fact that he wouldn't sign McCain-Feingold) and by deed (shoveling millions of dollars into illegal and shady donations into his campaign kitty). Name three social programs (other than Americorps) that Clinton created. Then explain how they made up for for the loss of cash payments.
<dl>
<dd>Clinton was a pragramtist. You can't have Canadian or English-style health care in the U.S. He tried his best to make it work in the USA. I see we're just going to keep disagreeing. I don't care to debate with you anymore, as I believe you're too stubborn and unwilling to hear differnent opinions. And your completely erroneous judgement of Huey Long leads me to question your reasoning ability. So long, Greenie-weeny!
<dl>
<dd>You actually <i>can</i> have a Canadian-style system here in the United States, since upwards of 80% of the American peaople support it. The reason that <i>Clinton</i> couldn't do it was the millions of dollars in soft-money contributions he took from insurance companies that would be hurt financially if the government started to compete with them. His "valiant attempt" at creating a national health care system was, in reality, a system for fattening the pockets of HMOs while insuring less than one-fifth of the people in this country who are uninsured. And you know something else? It is actually possible that some people in this country could still be liberal without being green. Do you think you could possibly wrap your condescending little mind around that?</dd>

<dd>Wilson did those things because he really believed in them. The bosses who sponsored him to be Governor of New Jersey expected him to be just another stooge for them and their big business buddies. Boy, did they get the shock of their lives when, upon taking office, he sponsored the people's preferred candidate for the U.S. senate over the bosses' candidate, then proceeded to institute a statewide <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minimum_wage.html" title="Minimum wage">minimum wage</a>, strong <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antitrust.html" title="Antitrust">antitrust</a> laws, and a system of <a href="../../../u/n/e/Unemployment_benefit.html" title="Unemployment benefit">unemployment insurance</a>, all of which formed the basis of his platform at the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_National_Convention_6035.html" title="Democratic National Convention">Democratic National Convention</a> and gained him Bryan's support. Say what you will about his racial views and treatment of wartime dissenters (and I have said a lot, sometimes very loudly), he was a liberal who advanced the cause of economic justice farther than any of his predecessors.
<dl>
<dd>Advanced the cause of economic justice? Then why did he arrest Socialist Party candidate <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugene_V._Debs_9874.html" title="Eugene V. Debs">Eugene V.

<dd>That's a non sequiter. The fact is that he did all of the things I named above to advance the cause of economic justice AND he jailed Debs.

<dd>You're lack of understanding of American history is really showing here. I'm very surprised this racist is on the list. If Huey Long is a liberal, so is Moussolini, who also built roads and bridges. Long was the worst race baiter in American politics. That immediately disqualifies him as a liberal. You can make him one of your “centrists” if you want, but before you do that, please, please, please read up on his history. He was a little Bayou fascist, not a liberal or a "centrist."
<dl>
<dd>I just got finished reading T. Harry Williams' nine-hundred-page-long, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Long. He didn't do anything for blacks (that would have been political suicide) but he didn't do anything against them. Certainly, he did not engage in "race-baiting." His specialty was <a href="../../../c/l/a/Class_warfare.html" title="Class warfare">class warfare</a>, which a fascist like Mussolini would definitely have frowned upon. By the way, J. William Fulbright voted against every piece of civil rights legislation he came upon. Shall we take one of the four most famous Vietnam opponents off the list, too?

Did you know that <a href="../../../u/p/t/Upton_Sinclair_68d1.html" title="Upton Sinclair">Upton Sinclair</a>, who you mentioned above, modeled the main character of his "It Couldn't Happen Here" on Huey Long? I haven't read the book you mentioned, but it couldn't have been very good if it didn't go into Long's race baiting. I beg you to please consider removing this guy from your list. On Long's death, the NY Times wrote about him: "What he did and what he promised to do are full of political instruction and also of warning. In his own State of Louisiana he showed how it is possible to destroy self-government while maintaining its ostensible and legal form. He made himself an unquestioned dictator…. In reality, Senator Long set up a Fascist government in Louisiana. It was disguised, but only thinly. There was no outward appearance of a revolution, no march of Black Shirts upon Baton Rouge, but the effectual result was to lodge all the power of the State in the hands of one man. If Fascism ever comes in the United States it will come in something like that way."
<dl>
<dd>You cannot comment on Huey Long if you haven't read T. Harry Williams' book. It won the 1970 <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Biography_or_Autobiography_5eae.html" title="Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography">Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography</a> and the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Book_Award_03c8.html" title="National Book Award">National Book Award</a>.

Or didn't you wonder about how <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Yarborough_b0af.html" title="Ralph Yarborough">Ralph Yarborough</a> got elected to statewide office in Texas?

Lyndon Johnson, for instance, got himself elected to the Senate by paying illegal immigrants $10 a pop to vote for him and by making a few inconvenient ballot boxes disappear. Of course, his opponent in the primary pulled the same tricks, so Johnson won by only 87 votes out of a million cast. Hence his nickname: "Landslide Lyndon."</dd>

<dd>I disagree with the idea of Jackson being a liberal. He was a McCarthyite all the way down the line and his record on economic issues wasn't too hot, either. His Americans for Democratic Action score was 62, which would make him the second-lowest-rated senator on the list. The only guy with a lower score was Fulbright, who manages to slide in by the skin of his teeth on the strength of his opposition to HUAC and the Vietnam War, and his support of the New Deal, which would have been before ADA was founded.12.217.121.245 01:27, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think it would be impossible. I'll start. The list would definitely have FDR on it. There's one. Now we just put 10 other people and we're good. Please, let's whittle this list down. Okay, below will be the working list. I am going to assume FDR will be on it, so I put him on there. The numbers don't mean anything. There's room for 15 people. Add until it's filled, then we can start to change the list. Hopefully this works. And no, Bill Clinton does not have a spot. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 13:57, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>FDR is already on the "American Liberal thinkers" list. Can he be on both lists? I think before you start whiddling the list down to 10 or 15, you have to come up with a criteria; otherwise you just bandy names around. How about this for an initial criterion: To be on the list, you must have had a wide influence on liberalism, and your influence must have lasted at least 15 years. This criterion will remove fly by nights and one hit wonders from the list. Under this criterion, FDR is definitely on the list, as his influence is felt to this day. -- Griot
<dl>
<dd>That sounds good. I don't have problem with FDR being on both lists... perhaps we combine the two lists into people who a great impact on American liberalism and its philosophy. Dunno. By the way, you can sign your name by typing 4 tildes ~~~~. Or sign your name "Griot" and type 5 tildes for just the date. Helps to keep order. --<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Voldemort_ca3f.html" title="User:Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> <sup><a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELord_Voldemort_cf5f.html" title="User talk:Lord Voldemort"><font color="#3D9140">(Dark Mark)</font></a></sup> 20:25, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I really don't think this is doable. There is really no way that you can take a 150-name list and cut it down to ten and still keep everyone happy. Not mention the fact that if we just have a ten-name list, some future person with a spare hour or two to kill is going to come by, deem the list inadequate, and add a few dozen more names. That's why I think what we have to do, in the interests of a thorough (yet shorter than 150 names) cataloguing of American liberal leaders, is break the list into sections, weed the people into each section down to the essentials, and then explain what they have to do with liberalism. --12.217.121.245 21:19, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hmmm... well, I don't know then. I know what these people did, but the article starts by saying that American liberalism generally started in the early 20th century.

<dd>All three of them. And if the article says that, then the article is wrong. Thomas Paine lived and died in the 18th century and he wrote at length about the necessity of things that liberals still fight for today. --12.217.121.245 22:06, 8 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>YOu guys will go back and forth on these questions forever unless you establish criteria for deciding who goes on the list. Before suggesting names, how about deciding on criteria. Above, I suggested to be on the list, you must have had a wide influence on liberalism, and your influence must have lasted at least 15 years. Any other ideas for criteria? ~~Griot
<dl>
<dd>The problem with that is threefold. Firstly, you have no way of quantifying how much of an impact one individual person had on a centuries-long movement, particularly since politics is mostly for show and actual governing takes place mostly behind closed door. Secondly, even if someone could quantify it, the definition would vary from person to person. And thirdly, your terms would pretty much exclude anyone who has become famous or influential or was elected since 1990, including <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Wellstone_f264.html" title="Paul Wellstone">Paul Wellstone</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russ_Feingold_9a08.html" title="Russ Feingold">Russ Feingold</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Hightower_1061.html" title="Jim Hightower">Jim Hightower</a>, and <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Dean_da7d.html" title="Howard Dean">Howard Dean</a>. Are you really prepared to argue that none of them qualify as the liberal leaders of our time? --12.217.121.245 02:15, 9 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I could argue against some of those guys. Hightower, for example, has never held an important office in gov't, and his influence has been small. But getting back to my point: What are the criteria? Obviously, you and everyone else who puts names on the list has a set of criteria. All I'm saying is -- put it in the open so everyone has some basis for judging. Otherwise, it's just back and forth, tit for tat. I think Voldemort has a good point when he says that the definition of liberal should square with the definition in the wikipedia article. You could start from there. ~~Griot
<dl>
<dd>I find it ironic that the guy who added <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Lloyd_Garrison_1e12.html" title="William Lloyd Garrison">William Lloyd Garrison</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horace_Greeley_1d1e.html" title="Horace Greeley">Horace Greeley</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gouverneur_Morris_1202.html" title="Gouverneur Morris">Gouverneur Morris</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Paine_c9d3.html" title="Thomas Paine">Thomas Paine</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Peabody_f3a1.html" title="Elizabeth Peabody">Elizabeth Peabody</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Cady_Stanton_6412.html" title="Elizabeth Cady Stanton">Elizabeth Cady Stanton</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/a/Thaddeus_Stevens_bf0f.html" title="Thaddeus Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Sumner_6761.html" title="Charles Sumner">Charles Sumner</a> to the article is now lecturing me about not putting up anybody from before the 20th century. And I said it before and I will say it again: If the article says that liberalism is a modern phenomenon, then the article is wrong. Thomas Paine, Horace Greeley, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton clearly fit the definition of liberal as presented in <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Liberalism_b1f8.html#Some_positions_associated_with_American_liberalism" title="American Liberalism">the list of liberal positions</a>. (And by the way, Hightower doesn't have to have served in high office to have influence. <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_Jackson_14cf.html" title="Jesse Jackson">Jesse Jackson</a> has never been elected dog-catcher, and I would describe him as influential. I am willing to gamble that Hightower has more influence now than most Democratic congressmen.) --12.217.121.245 07:38, 9 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hold your horses. I'm not lecturing you about anything. I'm trying to establish criteria, and your last post shows very plainly why this is necessary. Suppose we were to make "influence" a criterion, as I have suggested. Then, to put Hightower on the list, you would have to demonstrate how precisely Hightower has been influential, rather than making a blanket statement of some kind ("..has more influence than most Democratic Congressmen"). I propose two criteria to start: The person must have been influential, and the liberalism he espoused must jibe with the Wikipedia article definition of liberalism. How about it? (If you object to the Wikipedia definition, then see about changing it, although I must warn you, the definition in this article is the standard defintion). ~~Griot</dd>

<dd>Clinton tried to restrict handgun sales, strengthen environmental regulations, protect the jobs of workers during pregnancy or medical emergency, and pass a national health care bill. That makes him a liberal by modern standards, though a moderate liberal, certainly not a classical liberal. I would describe him as a pragmatist, willing to listen to ideas from both sides.

<dd>To return to the subject at hand, American Revolution to Civil War, certainly Benjamin Franklin belongs on the list.

<dd>On Tom Jefferson? Well, he wrote in the Declaration of Independence, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal and are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, amoung these the right to life, liberty, and the persuit of happiness." Almost a direct quote of Locke, except substituting "persuit of happiness" for "property". He said something to the effect that we were better off with a free press and no government than with a government and no free press. He wrote on religious liberty, and freedom of concience. He tried to establish peaceful and friendly relations with the American Indian, and brought many Native American leaders to Washington. I could go on, but I'll stop there, since I'm not sure that the question I'm answering is the one you are asking. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Norwood_6566.html" title="User:Rick Norwood">Rick Norwood</a> 20:25, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Solution: Just Drop The List.</span></h2>
<p>You want the best solution to the who's-a-liberal-and-who's-not list? Just don't include one. A lot of other articles on political ideologies -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">Conservatism</a>, for instance -- get along fine without one. This doesn't mean there shouldn't be any names named in the article; someone reading through the whole thing will still learn that Franklin Roosevelt instituted the New Deal, that Lyndon Johnson started the Great Society programs, and so on, because these are concrete and factual historical accomplishments associated with liberalism. But a section called "Notable American Liberals" well get bloated and be subject to endless dispute, as we're seeing here.</p>
<p>So, I say get rid of the list altogether, like <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservatism.html" title="Conservatism">Conservatism</a> does. Anyone with me? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 02:55, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Agreed. This list is meaningless unless you want to define exactly what a liberal is, and no one has the energy to do that. You will have trouble deleting the list, however, because it is sacred territory to some of the people who contributed. --Griot</p>
