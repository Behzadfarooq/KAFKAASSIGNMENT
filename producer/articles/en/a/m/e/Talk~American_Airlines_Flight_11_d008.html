<p>Can we please modify or delete the "inconsistencies" when the BBC erroneously reported that Waleed al-Shehri was alive, when they were interviewing someone different and has since been confirmed he is dead? This seems to be put in there by someone who hasn't been updated as to this news, or someone who chooses to ignore news. <a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7ERegBarc_2f88.html" title="User:RegBarc">RegBarc</a> 08:46, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>We need to pick one way or the other, I agree. But as far as I can find BBC hasn't retracted its story. It's still online, for example here: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1559151.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1559151.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1559151.stm</a> and I google isn't giving me any retractions or corrections on it from BBC (if you have one, that will settle the whole question). Waleed's article claims the BBC was duped and cites a Spiegel report saying BBC had the wrong Waleed, but if BBC doesn't confirm that mistake we're down to one media outlet vs. another. Flip a coin?</p>
<p>If there's a retraction of this we should pull the "inconsistencies" line involving him and my edit to his mention at the beginning of the article. Whatever the case, it would be nice if all parts of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Airlines_Flight_11_b841.html" title="American Airlines Flight 11">AA 11</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Waleed_Al-Shehri_f920.html" title="Waleed Al-Shehri">Waleed Al-Shehri</a> would all say roughly the same thing about whether or not he's alive or dead. (I have no particular opinion or knowledge of which one it is; I made the edit to the top just to keep consistency within the article.) <a href="../../../d/m/e/User%7EDmesg_fbf3.html" title="User:Dmesg">dmesg</a> 10:33 1 May 2006 (EDT)</p>

The first paragraph refers to a particular <b>airplane</b>. The article is about a particular event in which one particular airplane took off, flew, and crashed.

<p>Do you really think that anyone is going to interpret it in that fashion aside from that one guy who did not apparently read the article properly? The renumbering occurred after and because of the Sep 11 attack.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I sure didn't know what to make of it. I'm not an idiot (I like to think so, anyway, otherwise I'd have completely destroyed the server by now with my maintenance on the software) but I don't fly much and am not familiar with airline flight numbering systems, and would not know what "the flight was renumbered" refers to. It would surprise me very much if there are only two people who find the previous wording confusing; the clearer wording harms nothing. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 01:57 Dec 19, 2002 (UTC)

<dd>I find the previous wording confusing too. As a non-flyer, I thought that each individual flight (as opposed to each service) had its own flight number, so the correct interpretation of this would never have occured to me. The version Brion restored might not be the best way round the problem, but it's better than what was there before. --<a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECamembert_9597.html" title="User:Camembert">Camembert</a></dd>
<dd>i agree with you both and that is why i made the original change - Arno shouldn't complain - i was merely trying to make it clearer for Wikipedia readers</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>-- Paul Melville Austin</p>
<p>OK, I lost my last two replies because Camembert and then Austin was here at the same time. I could not locate a date the flight number was changed - it was before Dec 2001 (there's nothing in American Airlines' press releases after that date, and no press releases available before December 2001) , and most probably Oct 2001 (as that was when flight 93 was renumbered - albeit by United Airlines).</p>
<p>But I have added a single word to this most controversial paragraph. It should now flow on from the very first paragraph. Incidentally, the copied bit came from the second paragraph.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Honestly, "flight route designation" isn't any clearer to me than "flight number", particularly when only one term shows up without the other. What's wrong with "The regular Boston-Los Angeles morning flight was later renumbered...", which is clear and unambiguous? (Of course there's also the question of motive -- call me cynical, but "out of respect for those who died" sounds less likely than "to avoid creeping out customers, who might switch to another airline or stop flying altogether".) --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>Hmmm. I'm a little lost. You say "Flight" makes more sense to you than "Flight number" or "Flight route designation"? But you didn't like the term 'flight' in the first place. Also, is flight 11-cum-25 a morning flight only? I'm not so sure on that one.</p>
<p>As for your cynicism - I don't say no to financial/business concerns being a secondary motive to the renumbering. I suspect that Flight 11 (and for that matter, Flights 175 and 77) now has the same ring about it as the name 'Titanic' - there never has been another ship by that name since the famous one that sunk in 1912. But I do believe that respect also figures in there somewhere.</p>

<p>Someone else said: "I still think the jet fuel theory has been dismissed, anyone KNOW?"</p>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I know the jet fuel theory still is the most widely accepted one. That is if by "jet fuel theory" you mean that the burning jet fuel is what caused the structural collapse. From what I have read in newspapers and seen in documentarys on the Discovery and History Channels: The force of the impact destroyed the fire retardant form and the burning fuel melted the metal supports that held the floors to the load-bearing beams that formed the outer and inner walls. They eventual failed and this caused an unstoppable pancaking chain reaction as one floor hit the one below and those two floors hit a third below them and those three ..... The fire also melted the structural supports themselves and when the floors (read: horizontal bracing) started to pull away from the load-bearing walls and pancake there was nothing to keep the outer load-bearing walls from bending inward. They then quickly snapped (gross exaggeration: H -&gt; &gt;&lt;). --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that's it, the initial reports were, I think, distorted in making the fire much hotter and much longer-lasting than non-aviation-fuel fires, neither of which was true. It's the initial reporting that was discarded: the fire remains the cause of the collapse, not because it was so hot or so enduring but because the unevenness of the heating of the steel led to structural collapse. The rôle of the jet-fuel tends to be overemphasized: it's the fire left after the jet-fuel had been consumed that made the building collapse by reducing the structural integrity of the bracing. So the article wasn't wrong <i>per se</i>, I was just reacting to the over-emphasis in the initial reporting on the jet-fuel. I think there may have been a reoport after thae analysis of the microscopic structure of the recovered steel that talks about this, but I can't find it on the net. -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a></dd>

</dl>
<p>My understandig is that the trusses - ie the floor supports of the towers - were simply not built to withstand the sort of temperatures that was produced by the burning fuel from a 767 aircraft. <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArno_4ba5.html" title="User:Arno">Arno</a></p>
<p>According to a report I remember hearing (I think in 2005), but cannot specifically reference, the paper ignited by the jet fuel was the bigger factor in the collapse. Paper and wood fires are nasty things, and according to this same report, the fire was much hotter because of the paper than the jet fuel. It sounds counter-intuitive, but that's what I remember. -- BlueNight</p>
<p><br />
The jet fuel theory is still the officail version. Both towers are lumped under the same cause - seems unlikely but there it is. Building #7, however, wasn't hit so the foam falling off totally and/or symmetrically, if there was any foam, ( doesn't really matter ) and jet fuel ( way too low in temperature and BTUs to melt steel - so what!) - doesn't apply. Anyway #7 dropped like a brick - suddenly and vertically - no fuel, no structural damage, ah what the hell.</p>

I'm particularly thinking of the timeline - better to mention key events than list the whole timeline.</p>
<p>It's important to record as much detail as is available, but not all of it should be on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESingkong2005_96e7.html" title="User:Singkong2005">Singkong2005</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/i/n/User_talk%7ESingkong2005_cdc9.html" title="User talk:Singkong2005">talk</a></sup></small> 06:43, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

It is reported that Atta broke into a fight in the parking lot of Portland International Jetport.</p>
<p><b>6:45</b>: Atta calls another hijacker to confirm the attacks are on while sitting on Logan International Airport.</p>
<p><b>7:59</b>: Flight 11 takes off from Logan International Airport; it is bound for Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p><b>8:13</b>: The last radio communication is made from Flight 11, when a hijacker accidentally addresses flight control rather than the plane intercom. A recording of what is believed to be Atta's voice says, "Nobody move. Everything will be OK. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet." The flight path begins to stray away from the scheduled one and moves southwards. It is also reported that Flight 11's <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transponder.html" title="Transponder">transponder</a> signal is turned off at this time.<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/news/planes_reconstruction.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/news/planes_reconstruction.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/16/national/16FLIGHT11-TEXT.html?ex=1107666000&amp;en=d58a78bb72db550c&amp;ei=5070&amp;oref=login" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/16/national/16FLIGHT11-TEXT.html?ex=1107666000&amp;en=d58a78bb72db550c&amp;ei=5070&amp;oref=login" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/0913/p1s2-usju.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/0913/p1s2-usju.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</p>

<p><b>8:20</b>: The FAA's Boston Center flight controllers decide that Flight 11 has probably been hijacked.</p>
<p><b>8:21</b> Flight 11's transponder signal is turned off but the plane remains on radar screens. (Prior to the 9/11 Commission's report, news organizations reported this time as 8:13 or immediately thereafter.)</p>
<p><b>8:25</b>: Boston Center flight controllers alert other flight control centers regarding Flight 11; however, <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_American_Aerospace_Defense_Command_365a.html" title="North American Aerospace Defense Command">NORAD</a> is not yet alerted.</p>
<p><b>8:37</b>: Flight 175 confirms sighting of hijacked Flight 11 to flight controllers, 10 miles (16 km) to its south.</p>
<p><b>8:37:52</b>: Boston Center control notifies NEADS (Northeast American Defense Sector), the northeast sector of NORAD, of the hijacking of Flight 11. The controller requests military help to intercept the aircraft.</p>
<p><b>8:42</b>: The FAA's New York Center requests information about Flight 11 over the radio. <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flight_175.html" title="Flight 175">Flight 175</a> responds: <i>"Ah, we heard a suspicious transmission on our departure out of Boston, ah, with someone, ah, it sounded like someone keyed the mikes and said ah everyone stay in your seats."</i> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/wtccrash/story/0,1300,575518,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/wtccrash/story/0,1300,575518,00.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> New York Center acknowledges and says it will pass the information on. Shortly after, Flight 175 itself is hijacked and also begins to move southwards.</p>
<p><b>8:46</b>: Two <a href="../../../f/-/1/F-15_Eagle_89ec.html" title="F-15 Eagle">F-15</a> fighter jets are scrambled from Otis Air Force Base in <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massachusetts.html" title="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, intended to intercept flight 11. Because Flight 11's transponder is off, <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_81b3.html" title="United States Air Force">United States Air Force</a> pilots do not know which direction to travel to meet the plane. NEADS spends the next several minutes watching their radar screens in anticipation of Flight 11 returning a radar contact.</p>
<p><b>8:46:40</b>: Flight 11 crashes at roughly 490 mph (790 km/h) into the north side of the north tower of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Trade_Center_57c9.html" title="World Trade Center">World Trade Center</a>, between floors 93 and 99. (Many early accounts gave times between 8:45 and 8:50). The aircraft enters the tower mostly intact. It plows to the building core, severing all three <a href="../../../g/y/p/Gypsum.html" title="Gypsum">gypsum</a>-encased stairwells, dragging combustibles with it. A massive shock wave travels down to the ground and up again. The combustibles and the remnants of the aircraft are ignited by the burning fuel. Since the building lacks a traditional full cage frame and depends almost entirely on the strength of a narrow structural core running up the center, the fire at the center of the impact zone is in a position to compromise the integrity of all internal columns. Two home video cameras are known to have recorded the impact (see above). People below the severed stairwells in the north tower start to evacuate; no one above the impact zone is able to do so.</p>
<p><b>8:46</b> to <b>10:28</b>: At least 100 people (some accounts say as many as 250), primarily in the north tower, trapped by fire and smoke in the upper floors, jump to their deaths. There is some evidence that large central portions of the floor near the impact zone in the north tower collapsed soon after the plane hit, perhaps convincing some people that total collapse was imminent. One person at street level, firefighter Daniel Thomas Suhr, is hit by a jumper and dies. No form of airborne evacuation is attempted as smoke is too dense for a successful landing on the roof of either tower.</p>
<p><b>8:49:34</b>: The first news and radio organizations report an explosion or incident at the World Trade Center. <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_2435.html" title="CNN">CNN</a> breaks into a commercial at 8:49. CNN headlines first read 'World Trade Center disaster.' <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carol_Lin_86c3.html" title="Carol Lin">Carol Lin</a>, who was the first anchor to break the news of the attacks, said:</p>
<p><i>"Yeah. This just in. You're looking at obviously a very disturbing live shot there. That is the World Trade Center, and we have unconfirmed reports this morning that a plane has crashed into one of the towers of the World Trade Center. <a href="../../../c/n/n/CNN_Center_875b.html" title="CNN Center">CNN Center</a> right now is just beginning to work on this story, obviously calling our sources and trying to figure out exactly what happened, but clearly something relatively devastating happening this morning there on the south end of the island of Manhattan.

<p>Later, Sean Murtagh, CNN vice-president of finance, in an on-air phone call, said from his office in the CNN New York bureau that a large passenger commercial jet hit the World Trade Center.</p>
<p><b>8:50</b>: <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northeast_Air_Defense_Sector_36e5.html" title="Northeast Air Defense Sector">NEADS</a> is notified that a plane has struck the World Trade Center as they continue to locate the flight on radar.</p>
<p><b>8:53</b>: The F-15s at Otis Air Force Base are airborne. Still lacking an intercept vector to Flight 11 (and not aware that it has already been crashed), they are sent to military controlled airspace off Long Island and ordered to remain in a holding pattern until between 9:09 and 9:13.</p>
<p><b>10:28:31</b>: The north tower of the World Trade Center <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collapse_of_the_World_Trade_Center_cfbf.html" title="Collapse of the World Trade Center">collapses</a> from the top down, as if being peeled apart. Probably due to the destruction of the gypsum-encased stairwells on the impact floors (most skyscraper stairwells are encased in reinforced concrete), no one above the impact zone in the north tower survives. <a href="../../../3/_/w/3_World_Trade_Center_b9fc.html" title="3 World Trade Center">The Marriott Hotel</a>, located at the base of the two towers, is also destroyed. This second collapse (the south tower had already collapsed) is also viewed live on television and heard on radio.</p>

<dd>On UA93, I think the captain Jason Dahl fought with the hijackers and may have done something to damage the autopilot. By this time, airplanes flying around the country (UA93 included) had been alerted of the attack on the WTC, so Jason was aware of what was going on. The autopilot may have still been working, but if you look at the altitude profile for UA93, you see that <a href="../../../z/i/a/Ziad_Jarrah_e388.html" title="Ziad Jarrah">Ziad Jarrah</a> may have had trouble flying the airplane and was a particularly poor (and most poorly trained) pilot of the four. The plane rapidly lost altitude after it was hijacked. Keep in mind that at point G on the chart, they were flying over <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westmoreland_County%2C_Pennsylvania_ec73.html" title="Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania">Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania</a>. Here and in <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset_County%2C_Pennsylvania_df1d.html" title="Somerset County, Pennsylvania">Somerset County, Pennsylvania</a>, the tops of some mountains exceed 3000 feet, so the plane was already frighteningly close to the ground when the passenger revolt happened. The field near Shanksville is 2200 ft above sea level. If the passengers never took the plane over, I'm not sure Ziad had the ability to keep flying the plane all the way to Washington. They were heard on the CVR saying something like "bring the pilot back", perhaps meaning that the First Officer Leroy Homer was still alive and was needed. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 15:47, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>How exact is the picture in the article about the flight path. Maybe there are other pictures, that show a more detailed flight path (with more steering corrections)? (give me a link). Even from the shown fligth path in the article it seems to me not straight enough for sole autopilot use. The same is for the not very straight flight path of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Airlines_Flight_175_c83d.html" title="United Airlines Flight 175">UA 175</a>. The pictures make me think that there should have been at least many heading corrections to the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autopilot.html" title="Autopilot">autopilot</a>. Given the excellent visual flight conditons at that day, from how far could they have seen New York. Does there flight path follow some other visual clues (river, interstate highway, big cities)? In many countries investigators tend to make after a crime a detailed reconstuction with participation of the caught criminal (sometimes filmed and shown in the news). Was there a live reconstruction of the flights of the four airplanes and the military airplanes? I confess, that I can't see a real sense for that, but in many countries a <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime_reconstruction.html" title="Crime reconstruction">Crime reconstruction</a> is routine. And since we know (a little bit) how many detailed investigation was carried out after the attacks I could imagine such reconstruction flights (maybe with switched off transponders) to compare with the radar data targets of Sept. 11. --84.137.58.178 20:56, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
