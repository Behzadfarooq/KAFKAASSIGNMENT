<p>As it currently stands, it appears that the <i>American Girl Collection dolls</i> is a subcategory under <i>History</i>, and that <i>American Girl Today</i> and <i>Other Product lines of note</i> are subcategories under <i>Felicity</i>. To me, this makes no sense, which is why I made Kaya and Felicity subcategories. Will you please explain why it should be like this?

<dd>"American Girl" is the proper name of the toy.

<p><i>Addy and her mother were forced to leave their baby girl behind-all Addy can think about is seeing her again, along with her brother and her father. She hopes she will be reunited with them soon.</i></p>
<p><i>This captivating, inspiering story about Addy has captured girl's dreams for years, showing them that with a little hope and detirmenation, you can go anywhere.</i></p>
<p>Even though these details are nice, this is an encyclopedia - not a marketing tool. I don't think that plot details and backstory are appropiate here, just a description of the product and some relevant minor details. Thoughts?</p>

<p>I edited the page to remove unnecessary details from the Limited Edition doll's listings. While interesting, there are other places on the internet to get the details of the collections, and an encyclopedia does not seem like the best place to provide an item-by-item description. Just my opinion - this is already a huge page, and it would be nice to keep it down.</p>
<p>Also, I removed the rumor that the doll for 2005/2006 was supposed to be named 'Julie Andrews.' Belated April Fools, anyone?</p>

<p>I am looking for an old catalog to support me, but I am certain that the first run of Addy dolls was done using the original face mold - i.e. the mold that Kirsten, Samantha and Molly shared.</p>
<p>I own an Addy doll and my cousin has a Molly doll. I can mentally compare them and they are different. Sorry, you only had a catalog, I had REAL visual aid.</p>
<p>When did you get the doll? Was it in 1993, the first run of dolls, or later? Becuase if it was later then you have one with the new facial mold. --Becka 16:34, 3 August 2006 (UTC)BeckaJo</p>

<p>I don't think that the Molly picture is necessary because none of the other dolls get pictures.

<p>Well, yeah. It's nice to have the pictures, but perhaps we should look for official AG images that are available for public use rather than fan-provided images.</p>

Maybe the descriptions of the individual Girls of the Year should mention which face mold they use. But I don't think that they belong up in the first section, because it's chronologically out of order. Becka 05:51, 20 September 2006 (UTC)RJWestBecka 05:51, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am getting EXTREMELY annoyed at whoever keeps deleting my contributions about Kit's movie. I assure you this is real news and deserves to be on the page. I would like to propose a permanent "Kit's Movie" subcategory under "Movies" and include some information about it under Kit's description. Please stop deleting my contributions!</p>
<p><br />
I have not deleted your contributions, and the minimal information about the movie (i.e. the production company, screenwriter and planned appearance in theaters) seems appropriate. But, in a related issue, I'm not so sure that Ruthie should be listed. Just because her name is trademarked does not mean she's going to be produced; even though she'd make sense in the context of Kit's stories is not a promise. It would have made more sense to have Linda or Susan for Molly, after all...Becka 00:49, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>How about the American Girl (company) page contains content about the history of the company, controversy, and news, but there are links to OTHER wiki pages about AG? For instance: "Kaya" leads to info about Kaya, "Felicity Merriman" leads to info about Felicity, etc...</p>
<p>In the interest of keeping things short and in line with Wiki's standards, I've removed a lot the details about Nicki, etc. from the pages. This is an encyclopedia and that much detail seems inappropriate. I'm putting the Nicki information here, however, because until she's released I realize people are curious.</p>
<p>"Nothing is known or confirmed about her appearance, though there is speculation that she has long curly hair that is dark brown or red. Nicki will have two books, <i>Nicki</i> and <i>Thanks to Nicki</i>. She will be the first doll of the year to have two books about her. The books are said to have two different release dates. Girls will love meeting Nicki, the Girl of the Year 2007! Nicki Fleming is a natural with animals. When the chance to train a serivce dog comes up, she just can't say "no," even if it means taking on more responsibility and having to give up some of the things she loves doing. When Sprocket the puppy turns out to be a handful, Nicki has to muster all of her compassion to continue his training. She knows that one day Sprocket will make someone else's life better--and that makes all the difference. The "True Story" section at the back of the book focuses on real girls who have experience training service dogs.</p>
<p>Nicki's story continues, with a second book about the Girl of the Year 2007. Ten-year-old Nicki Fleming has been having a busy summer on her Colorado ranch. When she isn't training Sprocket to be a service dog, she's helping her mother, who is expecting twins soon. Yet Nicki is dreading the fall--that's when Sprocket will have to leave for more training and eventual placement with a person with special needs. The beginning of the school year also means she's stuck in the middle--caught between her two best friends, Kris and Becca, who can't seem to get along. Can Nicki find a way to let Sprocket go and keep both of her good friends close? The "True Story" section at the back of the book focuses on real girls who have experience training service dogs.</p>
<p>She follows the same standard mold for the other caucasian dolls. She has long brown hair in tight curls similar to GT26. The hair flows down to her butt. She has blue eyes and freckles. She is reported to look just like 23 but longer.</p>
<p>Her meet outfit is a white long sleeved shirt with ruffles. She is wearing a skirt that is a teal or light blue with some embroidered design on it. She also comes with some suede or leather cowboy style boots and a leather belt. Her necklace is almost like a teal coloured stone necklace....the name is beyond me right now.....sorry.</p>
<p>She has two other outfits. One is a pink patterned party dress. The other outfit is a pair of pants, a long sleeved tee and a pair of chaps.</p>
<p>OK so then we have her pets....yes PETS. One is her dog. I am told it is like a burmese or st. bernard "type" looking dog. At least those are the colourings. Then she will also get a horse. The horse is a grey/ brown with dark hair either black or deep brown.</p>

An illustrtation of Nicki on her first book can be found at www.amazon.com. It is of the above desciption of her in her meet outfit."</p>

<p>While it seems strange that the years for Nellie and Elizabeth are not the same as their "best friends" Elizabeth's book is not set the same time as Felicity's (it says 1775 on the cover) and neither is Nellie's (1906). Emily's is the only one that is in her main character's "year."The core six books cover a span of about two years; the four at the end is generally the year the Meet book is set. I've edited the main part to discuss the span of years. --<a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENethilia_bf4e.html" title="User:Nethilia">Nethilia</a> 06:25, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Lately, I have seen two edits adding in a post that links to a blog where a young girl was allegedly turned away violently from the salon for asking the salon to do the hair of a non-American Girl doll. Having read this story on the blog, I think there are a lot of holes in the story and doubt the authenticity of the event. Until this story is verified by more than a single sensational blog post, I do not feel that this addition to the page is anything but hearsay/mob mentality and that it should not become part of the page officially. So that others can see and thus analyze, I will link it here:</p>
<p><a href="http://oneofthosehorriblemoms.blogspot.com/2007/03/fake-out.html" class="external free" title="http://oneofthosehorriblemoms.blogspot.com/2007/03/fake-out.html" rel="nofollow">http://oneofthosehorriblemoms.blogspot.com/2007/03/fake-out.html</a></p>
<p>As for false advertising: nothing on the website says that American Girl Place does anything for any non-American Girl doll anywhere on the site. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENethilia_bf4e.html" title="User:Nethilia">Nethilia</a> 16:35, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree, and feel that if anywhere, it should be placed under critism. Not on the external links.--<a href="../../../n/e/l/User%7ENelliebellie_8225.html" title="User:Nelliebellie">Nelliebellie</a> 07:20, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone should compose a short paragraph about the AG*Minis line under Other Product Lines of Note. It had a wider breadth than Girls of Many Lands, and lasted longer, as well. Possibly even had a longer selling run that Hopscotch Hill, though I'm not sure. Angel the Techrat 05:30, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've added one to the pages. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENethilia_bf4e.html" title="User:Nethilia">Nethilia</a> 04:54, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The whole page clearly says that every character named on the page is in a book or is a doll at some point in the pages, such as mentioning that Felicity was removed from catalogs. I do not think that there needs to be a tag about the page not lining up with fiction, as all the pictures are of dolls and not of actors or people. Adding notes to each character that she is fictional, especially when they don't have their own pages, seems superfluous. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENethilia_bf4e.html" title="User:Nethilia">Nethilia</a> 07:23, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
