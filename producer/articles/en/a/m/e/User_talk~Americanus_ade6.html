<p>Hi Americanus, I hope you won't take offense at this, but I have nominated this article for deletion. I wish that you would have continued discussing the matter with me on the main article's talk page so that we could reach a consensus on how to handle our disagreement. My last suggestion was answered with you creating this page, unfortunately. I don't think it's appropriate for Wikipedia, so I have nominated it for deletion. You can see my nomination and vote on it yourself if you wish here <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Energy_Policy_Act_of_2005_Vote_24a5.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Energy Policy Act of 2005 Vote">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Energy Policy Act of 2005 Vote</a>. Again, I don't mean to be antagonistic, and hope you won't take offense.

<p>As for welcome message, you are welcome&#160;:) If you'll need more help or assistance, don't be afraid to ask.</p>
<p>As for the deletion, I will vote to keep, since you kinda promised to develop it further. I hope to see a full develop article with all the votes and analysis. Otherwise I might change my vote.</p>
<p>A side note: be aware that many people send new underdeveloped articles either directly to <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_deletion_1a12.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy deletion">Wikipedia:Speedy deletion</a> or to <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion</a> (because they monitor <a href="../../../r/e/c/Special%7ERecentchanges_05b8.html" title="Special:Recentchanges">Special:Recentchanges</a> page). So when creating article try to make it as developed as possible especially on some questionable subjects.</p>
<p>A side note #2: don't get discouraged. Wikipedia is a collaborative encyclopedia where many users have many different opinions about many different things. But that's exactly why it is great! Keep posting&#160;:) <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenata3_94d8.html" title="User:Renata3">Renata3</a> 03:02, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>As an individual who has worked in the energy industry, in one form or another, for several years now, I have always though that peak oil proponents are a bit hysterical. I would direct you to research more on the topics of oil shale, sand oil and methyl hydrates in conjunction economic production models, in order to get a better grip on a subject you seem to have so much interest in. I would also be happy to answer any question you have on these topics. <a href="../../../t/d/c/User%7ETDC_c89f.html" title="User:TDC">TDC</a> 19:21, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The research I've done thus far into these non-renewables is that the ratio of energy expended to energy provided is fairly low, like 2:1 or 1.5:1 or something like that. I have no doubt that these areas will be looked at closely, but they certainly do not address the reality that global energy use will peak, after which we will have to use less energy.</p>
<p>Something I am very curious about it the maximum amount of energy that we can produce when all the fossil-fuels are gone. Is it 10% of current energy production? Higher? Lower?</p>

<p>Well, it did come to a bit of a shock when I was driving home one night a couple of weeks ago and began to work out the implications for gasoline that was $2.79 in my area. There are a lot of working class families here in Michigan, and some are my family and friends. When gasoline (regular) exceeds $3/gallon, I think people are going to start to realize that something is up. When it hits $4/gal, even more so. I am going to do some analysis later today on the rate of increase of the oil prices so that I can give a best prediction for upcoming prices in the Fall, assuming the USA doesn't do anything militarily or politically that could accelerate the increase. <a href="http://www.wtrg.com/prices.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wtrg.com/prices.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>If we have an annual 65% increase in oil prices, then we'll be above $100/barrel by the end of April. That doesn't even take into account the current cycle that oil prices are in.</p>
<p>It looks like last year oil prices climbed steadily from Labor Day until Halloween, after which they leveled until after the New Year, followed by another climb for a couple of months.</p>
<p>Here's some interesting data on gasoline prices: <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publications/wrgp/mogas_history.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publications/wrgp/mogas_history.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Looks like the price doubled in two years, which means $5/gallon sometime in late 2006.</p>
<p>Michigan has also suffered a huge amount from the oil prices being low so long. Most of the corporations have globalized, and many people are unable to find jobs. In fact, Michigan is something like the 2nd highest for unemployment in the nation; and this is only the official figure, not the actual number for those who are no longer receiving benefits.</p>
<p>I am concerned about the possiblity that we will jump above the 5% over use line in the winter. If so, then 1973 and 1979 are the only models we have to work with in the USA as to how to respond.</p>
<p>I'll look forward to your thoughts! 216.120.141.3 20:18, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi. Just wanted to let you know that I'm trying to flesh out <a href="../../../o/i/l/The_Party%27s_Over%7E_Oil%2C_War%2C_and_the_Fate_of_Industrial_Societies_5041.html" title="The Party's Over: Oil, War, and the Fate of Industrial Societies">The Party's Over: Oil, War, and the Fate of Industrial Societies</a>, which is probably one the better introductions to the subject of <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peak_oil.html" title="Peak oil">peak oil</a>. You may want to link it on your people page. Also, regarding the opponent above, he is right, there are many emerging technologies which could help us such as in situ conversion process, but oil/fossil fuels are still more or less finite and we need to be proactive. keep up the good work!

<p>Hi, just a little comparison; in Sweden the gasoline price is currently on an all time high of $6.53 per gallon, with the Environmental party proposing higher gas taxes, a shocking $5.44 per gallon in just taxes... Talk about impact on less fortunate people...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I wanted to let you know that the Category:User:Americanus page has been nominated for deletion, and that you might want to vote to retain it at <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_for_deletion_ac22.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories for deletion">Wikipedia:Categories for deletion</a>. I wasn't involved in nominating this page; the arguments of most of the other participants seem to be that this "isn't what categories are traditionally for" and that there are other possible ways to organize this information. I've been trying to argue that there's no reason to delete it, but another voice would be helpful, particularly if you can argue that you use the page. Feel free to leave me a talk page message if you have any questions about the process. -- <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreidieki_9302.html" title="User:Creidieki">Creidieki</a> 16:50, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
