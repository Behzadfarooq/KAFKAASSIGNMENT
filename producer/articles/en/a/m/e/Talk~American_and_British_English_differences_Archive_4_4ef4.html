<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposed New Sections</span></h2>
<p>You know what? The Philadelphia (er, California) lawyer kinda hit the nail on the head in the above posts. The article says squat about "Word order" or "Word choice." I mean, nobody ever wrote anything about differences in word order. As for "word choice," it's not just the chestnut petrol vs. gasoline thing. Many words are standard in both dialects, but the same word may not be equally idiomatic on both sides of the Pond. We gotta take some action.

<p>Transatlantic differences that don't appear to have been covered, which I need to know about, are:</p>

<dd>I don’t think there is a BrE/AmE distinction for these forms. <i>Different than/from</i> is not a simple matter of preference in formal writing, but rather a question of context and idiom. For example, Bryan A. Garner’s <i>Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style</i> says:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>…Thus, writers should generally prefer <i>different from</i>—e.g.: “He performed to everything from jazz to the bossa nova to Brahms and Scarlatti, establishing a style very <i>different from</i> that of Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, Fred Astaire and the Nicholas Brothers” (<i>Dayton Daily News</i>).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Still, it is indisputable that <i>different than</i> is sometimes idiomatic, and even useful, since <i>different from</i> often cannot be substitued for it—e.g.: “This designer’s fashions are typically quite <i>different</i> for men <i>than</i> for women.”</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, <i>different than</i> may sometimes be useful to begin clauses if attempting to use <i>different from</i> would be so awkward as to require another construction—e.g.: “Life for Swann, who held out to sign a two-year $7 million contract in August, is a lot <i>different than</i> it was for him in Lynn” (Boston Herald).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Similarly, 'outside/inside (of)' is not a simple preference, but rather a question of context. When <i>inside</i> or <i>outside</i> is used as a noun, then it’s absolutely mandatory: “The inside of the house was much cooler than outside.“ Similarly, sometimes ‘of’ is necessary with ‘outside’. The sentence “There were Golden Jubilee celebrations outside of London as well” has a very different meaning from “There were Golden Jubilee celebrations outside London as well”.</dd>

<p>Yes, admirably, thank you. I guess my query concerns uses of 'different than' and 'inside/outside of' that are <i>not</i> necessary in their contexts. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 04:40, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">dipthongal ligatures in British English</span></h2>
<p>The use of dipthongs and ligatures should be mentioned somewhere - e.g. lævo- or laevo- pops up quite often in chemistry-related articles; in American English, it's spelled levo. Similarly, fœtus/foetus -&gt; fetus.</p>
<p>I'm not sure where this would placed in the article, however; in general, the text seems more concerned with pronunciation rather than spelling. (Somewhat odd, considering the textual basis of Wikipedia, but I digress.)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Compound noun/noun phrase formed with a verb</span></h2>
<p>The article has this point under <i>Slight lexical differences</i>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In compound nouns of the form &lt;verb&gt;&lt;noun&gt;, sometimes American English favours the bare infinitive where British English favours the gerund. Examples include:</i> fry pan <i>/</i> frying pan<i>;</i> jump rope <i>/</i> skipping rope<i>;</i> racecar <i>/</i> racing car<i>;</i> rowboat <i>/</i> rowing boat<i>;</i> sailboat <i>/</i> sailing boat<i>;</i> swimsuit <i>/</i> bathing suit<i>.</i> ...</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most of the left-hand (ostensibly American) versions in that list seem correct to me as an American. However, I don't think I have <i>ever</i> heard the term <i>fry pan</i>; instead it's always <i>frying pan</i>. Also, to my knowledge <i>swimsuit</i> and <i>bathing suit</i> are interchangeable in American usage. <a href="../../../d/d/a/User%7EDdawson_b9c9.html" title="User:Ddawson">Ddawson</a> 01:03, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There are a number of British-flavoured terms that are interchangable in America; however, many are not <i>commonly interchanged</i> terms.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most Americans know what "Autumn" means, and may very occasionally even use it without regarding it as a Britishism; yet the overwhelming tendency is for them to use "The Fall" - I think I'm going to start a page on this if one doesn't exist. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPromsan_7dd7.html" title="User:Promsan">Promsan</a> 2K5/SEP.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, most Americans are aware of both "autumn" and "fall," but they see them more as synonyms both in common use in American English; "autumn" is not really seen as a Britishism. However, you are correct in asserting that "fall" is more commonly used than "autumn." Autumn is generally seen as more formal.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, it's not necessarily "the fall." Although one can say, "I think rural New York is most beautiful in the fall," one could also say "Fall is the most beautiful season of the year," or "I will be attending UC Berkeley this fall." --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 22:18, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h4><span class="mw-headline">later</span></h4>
<p>Some months have gone by and this paragraph now reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In compound nouns of the form &lt;verb&gt;&lt;noun&gt;, sometimes American English favours the bare infinitive where British English favours the gerund. Examples include: jump rope / skipping rope; racecar / racing car; rowboat / rowing boat; sailboat / sailing boat; file cabinet / filing cabinet. In each of these pairs, the former term is more common in America than the UK and the latter more common in the UK than America (although it is not necessarily the case that the former is more common than the latter within America or the latter more common than the former within the UK).</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The general point seems clear enough but I find it hard to understand what the last sentence is trying to convey.</p>
<p>To take an example derived from the text: "Sometimes American English favours the infinitive... an example is <i>rowboat / rowing boat</i>. <i>Rowboat</i> is more common in America than the UK. (But even though American English "favours" <i>rowboat</i> over <i>rowing boat</i>, it is not necessarily the case that <i>rowboat</i> is more common than <i>rowing boat</i> within America.)"</p>
<p>That seems to be what the text says at the moment. Or perhaps not. In any case, it's hard to understand what the last sentence is trying to add. Can someone clarify this? <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_Robson_f616.html" title="User:Adrian Robson">Adrian Robson</a> 15:17, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your interpretation is correct. The wording was designed to forestall the removal of examples because "Americans say frying pan more than fry pan", when the point is that "Americans say fry pan more than Brits say fry pan". I guess it would be simpler just to list examples that work both ways to prevent such quibbles: the slight loss in precision could be trumped by the gain in comprehensibility. Indeed "fry pan" is gone already. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoestynes_50e7.html" title="User:Joestynes">jnestorius</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoestynes_bba0.html" title="User talk:Joestynes">talk</a>)</sup> 16:51, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I remember the fry(ing) pan issue, although I was not a registered user then. That wording is misleading at best and bamboozling at worst. I guess it's pretty safe to say just that the first item is the American usual choice and the second is the British preferred option. Then come the exceptions---AmE has both frying pan &amp; fry pan, but frying pan is commoner (many avoid the issue by saying just <i>skillet</i>...); "looking glass," "hiding place," etc. are in both. I even have a counterexample: Brit. cheque account vs. Amer. checking account (Canadian spelling "chequing account" makes it even more noticeable.) Not to mention skimmed milk vs. skim milk (-ed, not -ing; but skim milk seems to be used in Olde Englande also.) "Barbed wire" is in both, but AmE has also "barb wire"---sometimes even spelled <i>Bob wire</i> (please don't laugh) to reflect a typical R-dropping pronunciation.... --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLumber_a5b8.html" title="User:JackLumber">JackLumber</a> 20:44, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Cheque account" is Australian, which has more AmE influence than BrE does. Usual BrE is "current account". The word "sometimes" is important: your "exceptions" are simply the "other times". The -ing/bare distinction is real enough to be mentioned in <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randolph_Quirk_124c.html" title="Randolph Quirk">Quirk et al</a>'s <i>A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language</i> (IIRC Appendix I is word-formation; if someone has a copy they could add a reference).

<dd>JackLumber: I was trying to say that a few reverse examples [skim, barb] should not weigh as heavily as an accepted trend.

<dd><i>Cheque</i> is not a verb, but sometimes suffixes like <i>-ing</i> or <i>-ed</i> are added to verbs, or nouns, to construct adjectival forms---and this is indeed the trend: compare cookery book / cookbook; Smith, aged 40 / Smith, age 40; 3-roomed house / 3-room house; and plural vs. singular: drugs problem / drug problem. Now the divide in British usage is somewhat blurry, but British English does have a tendency to add inflectional suffixes. As you see, I'm not challenging the existence of the trend---actually I added a couple of pairs to the list (fil(ing) cabinet and dial(ling) tone). I'm way too lost in lexicography to dispute trends!

<dd>To add to the current cheque discussion. I would say (as a Brit) that in Britain it used always to be "current account", but "cheque account" has gradually become more common. But we would NEVER call it a "checking account" (because that (to us) looks like an account that is doing some checking of something); nor a "chequing account" (because "cheque" is not a verb and "chequing" is not a word!). <a href="../../../t/d/w/User%7ETdw_dd74.html" title="User:Tdw">TrevorD</a> 23:13, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Misleading Classification</span></h2>
<p>The classification implied in the title of this article is extremely misleading in relation to the content. There should be more emphasis on the fact that the classification is only vaguely coherent in relation to written English. As for most of the other points raised, English spoken in Southern Britain and Australia has much more in common with American English than it does with Scottish or Ulster English. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalgacus_587c.html" title="User:Calgacus">Calgacus</a> 17:10, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">When "American" Refers to Language . . .</span></h2>
<p>This brings up a different issue than those mentioned in the discussion in Manual of Style archive ("U.S." or "American") in that it refers specifically to the name of the language spoken in the US, not the use of the language to name things other than itself.</p>
<p>Because the word "American" has multiple uses, referring to either the US exclusively or to what is pertinent to cultures/peoples in either the Americas (North, Central, and South) or North America, its use on pages dealing with language is not transparent because it cannot be immediately interpreted. There are distinctions between American (North American) English and British English. This is a different matter than the differences between US English and British English and Canadian English.</p>
<p>Canadian English (which is distinct on a number of counts from British English and has certain elements in common with US English) is, in a certain sense, "American English," and though the article explains its exclusion, a change of title would remove the need to make this distinction. Since "Canadian English" is a distinct article, one would think that the parallel for the country just south would bear that country's name, not a name that can also refer to the continent.</p>
<p>So, arguably, this article should be titled "US and British English Differences" (and any parallel changes in other articles made) in order to disambiguate the meaning of the word "American" with reference to the English language. This would allow the ability to distinguish without confusion or need for explanation between US English usage and usage that extends to multiple countries in the Americas, which would be useful given the realities of language use.</p>
<p>(n.b. I follow M-W 11th in using US rather than U.S. [i.e., the entry, not the style guide, which contradicts the entry], and am not meaning to raise that issue here.)</p>

<dd>I disagree with that proposed change. "American English" is how the vast majority of Americans (myself included) refer to their own language. Calling it "US English" instead would, as a matter of statistics, create far more confusion than it alleviates. American English speakers are technically a supermajority of native English speakers at the moment, see <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a>.

<p>Also there's the fact that non-American speakers refer to the US as America and the accompanying adjective as American, and have since time began (or at least, it's not a novelty caused by the huge US population nowadays). Also also, what about the English used in say the United States of Mexico? Why should America usurp 'US' to refer only to themselves? — <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECassowary_f04f.html" title="User:Cassowary">Felix the Cassowary</a> 23:17, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>It seems a bit unfair to say that. The same reason "American" should be used is the same reason "United States" (abbr. US) could be used. All other uses of "United States" (that I know of) came after the formation of the "United States of America". Anyway, "American" just implies "from USA", and I see no need to change anything.&#160;— <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheKMan_941b.html" title="User:TheKMan"><b><font color="#0000FF">The</font><font color="#FF0000">KMan</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheKMan_98f4.html" title="User talk:TheKMan"><font color="#000000"><sup><u>talk</u></sup></font></a> 07:17, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that it seems clear, but perhaps that's because I know what it's attempting to say. The sentence really is a bit on the long side. It also seems a little bit emotive in its wording (IMHO). In fact, I'd suggest that in many commonwealth countries written English conforms to a relatively homogeneous standard that do not relate to the local spoken dialect. In fact it's not even confined to English. Written (formal) German is used across Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, while spoken German is in the local dialect.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps it could be re-phrased similar to:</dd>
<dd>"Formal written English in Scotland and Northern Ireland generally conforms to British English standards. In contrast, spoken dialects in this area are not sub-dialects of British English, although they share some features." (NB- I haven't checked this re-phrasing in context)<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 10:03, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think saying they're "not sub-dialects" is ambiguous. If you start from the (possibly false) assumption that there is a British dialect, then saying they're not sub-dialects could either mean that there's no difference between the speech of southern England and that of Edinburgh; or that they're so different that, for example, Northern Irish is completely incomprehensible to the Southern Irish. Clearly neither of these is true and I think the problem arises from saying that they're "not" sub-dialects. Instead, it might be clearer to say what they are.</p>
<p>It seems to me that an article like this should be aimed at explaining the subject to an intelligent reader who knows little or nothing about the subject. In the special case of articles about the English language, I think that implies an intelligent, possibly university age, non-native speaker. And I think that someone in this group might take the above sentence to mean that a southern English speaker would find a speaker from Edinburgh completely unintelligible. This is a long way from the truth and I doubt that it's what the writer originally intended.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I wholeheartedly support Limegreen's clarification of the distinction between written and spoken language. The article as a whole would benefit from distinguishing when the comments refer to spoken and when to written language <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_Robson_f616.html" title="User:Adrian Robson">Adrian Robson</a> 10:48, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see your point, however, it's worth noting that dialects occur on a continuum from the more mutually intelligible to the bloody difficult. While a southern english speaker would likely have little problem with a speaker from Edinburgh, the same can't be said for Glasgow or Liverpool. If you consider the development of English dialects tree-wise (which does have admitted problems), Scottish dialects probably split from English English more distantly than many commonwealth englishes (e.g., AusE, NZE, SAfE). Actually, kind of referring back to the previous point about most Commonwealth written Englishes being similar, it really seems that this article is mostly about differentiating written English, and perhaps American vernacular from accepted Commonwealth forms. <a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 21:01, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><i>On informal occasions, the British would use "have got", whereas Americans would say "have" or just "got". "Have got" is occasionally used by Americans to denote urgency, such as in "I have got to go to the bathroom." "Have" is the only form used in formal writing.</i> Umm... no. As an American, the phrase "I've got", "he's got", etc. is very common in informal speech. "To have got" is very common to mean both "to need to"/"to be required to" as well as "to possess". I've rewritten this.</li>
<li><i>In the United States, the word through can mean "up to and including" as in Monday through Friday. This causes little confusion in Britain though it is rarely used by British speakers, who might instead say Monday to Friday inclusive, or simply Monday to Friday. Some areas of the UK also use the term while in the same way, as in Monday while Friday. This is generally a feature of Northern England.</i> What does this mean?

<dd>I assume the point with "through" is that the British don't use it, and find it quaint/unusual on hearing it (apparently the inverse situation to "queue").<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimegreen_7840.html" title="User:Limegreen">Limegreen</a> 00:29, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">long form time</span></h2>
<p>I have just added a small but important detail to the long form date section. it said that "25 December 2000" was occasional in UK &amp; common in US and that "December 25 2000" was occasional in US &amp; common in UK</p>
<p>perhaps true - but nearly always written "25th" in the UK. I hope I have managed to add it without disrupting the flow too much. see what you think. It would have helped a lot if I could find out what the "st, nd, rd, th" suffix thingies were called. any ideas?</p>
<p>By the way - have any fellow brits noticed the relatively recent (last 5 years or so) adoption of 'get' as in "can I get a cup of coffee" to a shopkeeper. rather than "can I have a cup of coffee". It seems almost entirely limited to the under 25s and i assume an americanism. perhaps an addition to the section on adopted phrases. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidParfitt_fb4e.html" title="User:DavidParfitt">DavidP</a> 04:03, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"'25 December 2000' was occasional in UK &amp; common in US</dd>
<dd>and that 'December 25 2000' was occasional in US &amp; common in UK" - Isn't the opposite true? "December 25th, 2000" is far more common&#160;:in the US than "25th December 2000". --68.80.78.11 00:57, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's what I wrote originally, if someone's changed it around, they are wrong. To recap, both the US and UK tend to use the "December 25, 2000" form more often than the "25 December 2000" form, although both are correct, and some people (I mentioned Strunk and White) strongly prefer the latter for its sequential order and lack of punctuation. The latter form is somewhat more common in the UK than the US.</dd>

<dd>BTW, many people (and perhaps even more so in Britain) might add the "th" and so on while writing letters, signing cheques, etc., but a newspaper (say) is very unlikely to use this form, not least because the additional letters are thought to be somewhat superfluous; furthermore the user above has omitted the comma in "December 25, 2000"; this form is far more common, and accepted, with a comma between day and year than without. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a> 18:12, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would say that when the year is included, most Brits would write the day before the month. <a href="../../../g/a/i/User%7EGailtb_f4c4.html" title="User:Gailtb">Gailtb</a> 21:44, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Perhaps true, but in the absence of a study indicating this it would be reasonable to say simply that this is "common" usage. At the same time, we can easily demonstrate that most major British newspapers use "December 25, 2000" as their date form. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProhibitOnions_1d13.html" title="User:ProhibitOnions">ProhibitOnions</a> 06:19, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>the guardian uses the form Saturday 26.11.05 on its cover pages, for page headers it uses Saturday November 26 2005 and 26/11/05 - remember that these are prescribed by typographic layout rather than good usage, heaven forbid if we all started talking headline speak.
