<p>The classification of German Mercenaries/Loaylists as combatants is strange, as it implies that they were a party of war in their own right (which was obviously not the case). Actually all dicisions were made by Great Britain. Mercenaries and Loyalists were integrated into the military organisation of the Royal Army. The above classification contradicts the Wiki style used for other war, too. E.g. the wars of Emperor Charles V were fought by mercenaries from different counties. But the info boxes state only H.R.E/Spain as combatants and not e.g. H.R.R/Spain/Swiss Mercenaries/Italian Merceneries etc.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is true. The Warbox typically lists only political entities. Fixing now. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbrecht_dcaf.html" title="User:Albrecht">Albrecht</a> 17:06, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That's an error, actually. The warbox guidelines currently say this about the combatants entry: "This is most commonly the countries whose forces took part in the conflict; however, larger groups (such as alliances or international organizations) or smaller ones (such as particular units, formations, or groups) may be indicated if doing so improves reader understanding." To list the 13 Colonies as allies of the Britain, and yet ignore 30,000 Germans and 13,000 American Indians who fought for the Brits, hardly helps readers to understand the combatants at a glance. Better to ignore the Eurocentric political bias (i.e. the concept of states) and instead list who actually fought in the war, as this warbox has always done. • <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin</a> <small><a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">(complaints?)</a></small> 01:19, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I note that the current "to do list" proposes reducing the "War at Sea" section in favour of a short summary paragraphs without headings. The section is poorly constructed, but reducing it will relegate the primary war efforts of the most powerful participants (Britain and France) after 1778 to an even lower status than they currently have in the article. I raises the issue of what the war was about (and, hence, what this article is about).</p>
<ul>
<li>For the Americans, the war was a clear cut revolution and struggle for Independence (with most in favour and some against)</li>
<li>For the British, the war was initially a struggle to retain (or regain) the Americans' loyalty. But from 1778 it became a far more complex war with France and later Spain and the Netherlands. The war with France and Spain soon dominated British concerns, with a significant reduction of effort in America (where arguably the struggle had already been lost after Saratoga).</li>
<li>Similarly, for France, Spain and the Netherlands, the war in America was something of a side show. France and Spain were principally seeking revenge for their defeat in the Seven Years War, and their strategy focused on taking British possessions in Europe (Minorca, Gibraltar etc.), the West Indies (Dominica, Grenada, Tobago, Jamaica etc.) and the East Indies. While French support for the United States was of great importance, it was not the primary aim of the French war effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, if the "War at Sea", or perhaps "the wider war", is not worthy of significant mention in this article on the "American Revolutionary War", perhaps the wider war does deserve an article of its own under "American War of Independence". (For comparison, see the way the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_and_Indian_War_3b82.html" title="French and Indian War">French and Indian War</a> has evolved as a separate article to the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Years_War_5730.html" title="Seven Years War">Seven Years War</a>. JimmyTheOne 22:47, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The "wider war" article you're talking about already exists as <a href="../../../n/a/v/Naval_operations_in_the_American_Revolutionary_War_a958.html" title="Naval operations in the American Revolutionary War">Naval operations in the American Revolutionary War</a>. That article is still a bit rough, being based mostly on the turgid prose of the 1911 Encylopedia Britannica. But much could be done there, including perhaps a name change, though not to "American War of Independence", since that's a recipe for confusion with this article. (Something like "Naval War of American Independence"?) When revised, this article and that one would be complementary: this one primarily about the land war in North America (with reference to the wider naval war that eventually emerged), and vice versa. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">(complaint dept.)</a> 19:14, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. <i>Here</i> is the place to describe the global war in all its bearings: the American Revolutionary War. An article should not favour one POV over others just because one side has a bigger sentimental attachment. Concerns of purely American character should be expanded upon in <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolution_bd44.html" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a> or other appropriate articles. The description of military operations should give equal weight to all belligerents regardless of geography. The attempt to consolidate a U.S. monopoly over this article and to lump everything else under "Naval operations," I find, is misguided and wrong. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbrecht_dcaf.html" title="User:Albrecht">Albrecht</a> 22:34, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>As so often happens on Wikipedia talk pages (where comments on a previous version of an article remain long after the article itself has changed), you're beating a dead horse: the article no longer lumps everything outside North America under "naval operations". The article is now structured chronologically by major campaigns, rather than land here and naval elsewhere.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ironically, the previous arrangement (one article on the land war in America and another on the wider naval war) which you call an "attempt to consolidate a U.S. monopoly over this article" was actually British in origin: it was copied directly from the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica. The original 1911 text slowly disappeared from this article, though much still remains in the "naval operations" article, which was essentially the story of the Royal Navy in the war.</dd>

<dd>There is still much work to be done on campaigns outside North America, to be sure. Two notable examples: the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Siege_of_Gibraltar_56cf.html" title="Great Siege of Gibraltar">Great Siege of Gibraltar</a> and the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Juan_expedition_06a7.html" title="San Juan expedition">San Juan expedition</a>, two major operations involving British, Spanish, and French (but not American) troops, had almost no mention on Wikipedia until I added them very recently. I assume that their lack of coverage on Wikipedia was due to editor disinterest rather than a conspiracy to exert a "U.S. monopoly" over coverage of the war, but your mileage may vary. As John Shy noted in his introduction to Piers Mackesy's classic British study of the war, British historians and readers have traditionally been relatively uninterested in this war, which may explain the sorry state of articles like the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Anglo-Mysore_War_4d2d.html" title="Second Anglo-Mysore War">Second Anglo-Mysore War</a> and the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Anglo-Dutch_War_9c55.html" title="Fourth Anglo-Dutch War">Fourth Anglo-Dutch War</a>. No one is likely to blame the condition of those articles on American sentimentality for the Revolution, but anything is possible. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">(complaint dept.)</a> 01:37, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Perhaps this explanation ought to be inserted into the introduction, rather like a health warning:-</p>
<p>"The War of Independence is often a misunderstood conflict. It has been mythologised as a rebellion of the American colonists against the British, but it was more in the nature of a civil war. Most of the participants initially thought of themselves as Brtish in some sense, identifying themselves with one of the two factions in the British parliament. The rebels incorporated the union jack in the first version of their flag, and referred to the colonial loyalists as 'Tories'. Many loyalists enlisted in scratch British units (some of them serving under the infamous Banastre Tarleton). In turn, there are many instances of loyalist civilians being 'tarred and feathered' or driven from their homes and busineses in a form of 'political cleansing'. In Britain, the governing elite were split down the middle. Some British officers resigned their commissions rather than fight the rebels. The war was so unpopular that the government resorted to employing Hessian mercenaries."</p>

<p>The perception of the conflict as a civil war amongst the British played a major role in the collapse of popular support inside parliament itself. The conclusion of the artical presents the British position as one of solid unity, whereas in realitiy it was the collapse of popular support in parliament for the conflict that led to the war ending. The over-empahsis on the military reasons for the British faliure can easily be balanced out with a few lines mentioning the divisions within parliament, the lack of support amongst parliamentarians for attacking their own colonists, and the wavering and collapse of support as the conflict dragged on with no resolution. --Korona 14:39, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A search of Wikipedia for the phrase <i>War of Independence</i> brings up titles referring to the Wars of Independence of at least sixteen countries. The term <i>Revolutionary War</i> is applied to just one country. I doubt the United States' war was much different in principle to the many others. In referring to it as <i>Revolutionary</i> are we not just clinging to the patriotic mythology of which we Americans are so fond; which we learned at school instead of history and which we get bombarded with by Hollywood?</p>
<p>I have read the archived discussion concerning changing the title and the arguments against it have a strong flavor of nationalistic bluster: "We won the war so we get to choose the title."</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. I suspect that your Google search reflects only that most references on the Web to the War are written by Americans. In Wikipedia, the Spanish, French and German language articles on the first British-American War are titled, respectively, <i>Guerra de la Independencia de los Estados Unidos</i>, <i>Indépendance américaine, guerre de l</i>, and <i>Amerikanischer Unabhängigkeitskrieg</i>, each of which translates directly to <i>American War of Independence.</i> The situation appears to be that everyone outside of The United States refers to the war as a <i>War of Independence.</i> Even within the United States, the American War is uniquely named; every other country's war for sovereignty is called a <i>War of Independence.</i> In summary, everyone refers to this kind of war in general as a <i>War of Independence</i>. Everyone, except those in the United States, refers to this particular war as a <i>War of Independence.</i> The passion with which we Americans cling to our name for it suggests, to me, jingoism, which is out of place in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/j/b/User%7EKjb_7183.html" title="User:Kjb">Kjb</a> 15:32, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>--I have just been reading through the Talk page on the Seepoy Mutiny (aka First Indian War of Independance - depending on your POV). Their consensus has been to name the article Indian Rebellion of 1847 - which is not it's commonly used name anywhere, as far as I know, in order to stop the article taking on a viewpoint that is either NPOV or inaccurate. (The war was both a mutiny AND a (although not national) war of independance.) --I would suggest that this is a suitable 'example of good practice' as it were to justify the current naming of this article. The existing Revolutionary War is based upon only fact and inspires no prejudgement about the justness of the cause of the rebellion. In common useage a War Of Independance is most often seen as being a struggle against unjust opressors and the American Revolt is just as bad in the other direction. Leave the current title as is, I would suggest.--88.96.3.206 21:35, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Hessians, who are in this article referred to as German Mercenaries, were in fact soldiers not unlike those of any other European army in the 18th century. While some volunteered, most were peasants, petty criminals, and unfortunate travelers who were forced into the armies of several German princes by recruiters desperate to meet their quota. The princes, in turn, offered these armies to foreign powers for exorbitant amounts of money. This is in stark contrast to the modern-day idea of a mercenary as an individual who, of their own free will, offers their dubious services in exchange for personal profit. Thus, it would be much more accurate that Hessians in this article should be referred to as Germen auxiliaries, and not as mercenaries.</p>
<dl>
<dd>We use the terms used by the published scholarly works. Boatner's <i>Encylcopedia of the American Revolution</i>, Cowley &amp; Parker's <i>Reader's Companion to Military History</i>, Mackesy's <i>War for America</i> all use the term "German mercenaries", to name just the first 3 books I pulled off the shelf. The only source I know of off-hand which slightly questions this traditional label is Fischer's <i>Washington's Crossing</i>, where he says the Hessians "were not mercenaries in the usual sense" (p. 59). Note he doesn't say they weren't mercenaries, just not in the "usual sense", and for different reasons than what you cite. (Hackett argues that the Hessians "believed in service to their prince", i.e. they were still patriots, even though serving in a war that was not their own.) Because the army was rented as a whole, the Hessians were mercenaries collectively rather than individually, which is why the term <i>mercenary</i> is usually applied to them as a group. If you know of any source which challenges this traditional label, we can discuss it here, but otherwise we use the terms the scholars use.</dd>

<dd>Likewise, recently someone changed "German" to "Germanic" since they said "Germany didn't exist at the time", but not only have they confused the creation of a nation-state with the age-old geographic expression, they are going against standard scholarly usage.

<dd>By the definition of the Wikipedia article on mercenaries the 'Hessians' were indeed not mercenaries and calling them such is in some ways offensive. Lending out armies to other sovereigns was not rare throughout history. And except for that there is very little difference between the recruitment of the 'Hessians' and British troops (for example the newly raised scotish regiments). (Actually, this system is very similar to how the Greek City States armies worked, yet no one would call them mercenaries (actually corecting myself, Alexander the Great did and committed atrocities against them)).

<p><i>Suppressing a rebellion in America also posed other problems. Since the colonies covered a large area and had not been united before the war, there was no central area of strategic importance. In Europe, the capture of a capital often meant the end of a war; in America, when the British seized cities such as New York and Philadelphia, the war continued unabated. Furthermore, the large size of the colonies meant that the British lacked the manpower to control them by force. Once any area had been occupied, troops had to be kept there or the Revolutionaries would regain control, and these troops were thus unavailable for further offensive operations. The British had sufficient troops to defeat the Americans on the battlefield but not enough to simultaneously occupy the colonies. This manpower shortage became critical after French and Spanish entry into the war, because British troops had to be dispersed in several <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theater_%28warfare%29.html" title="Theater (warfare)">theaters</a>, where previously they had been concentrated in America.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></i></p>

<p>as a new user of wikopedia ...but a fast study. it is apperant that there are smart guys that will not let a thing go...chop chop the artical . These guys like to do as many chop edits as possible. many encylopedia contain commentary blindly written and commentary to the contrary thus expressing both sides.... sources need not be on the internet...or nothing futher would make to the internet...because it isnt already referanced. A catch 22. So i have used some of the rules for articals in a review of this artical...within the guide lines ect. They are "african americans salve and free"...sites a page...that does not mention anything in support of the statement of fact in the sentance....facts need support especialy when a page or link is sited and no support is present. Thomas Hutchens ...the artical does not provide sources for statements of fact ether cited or linked. In my artical facts were such that they created an opionion in the reader simply because of what they stated...this does not necessary mean they are biased but rather that the facts if true and refs and sources were checked...than that opionion would most likley prevale. If your artical retains itg good artical standing and the sections removed are reverted than my artical submissions without internet links...but raw source citing and written without candy coating ...such as council minutes and hearings minutes to convey events...will certainly have to stand. Lets remember one thing...if a person wantedto find out about mel gibson...and wikopediad him...the biased articals,according to some, would be part of the big picture. Its not just the birth date and benigne info.... <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnekooleskimo_197a.html" title="User:Onekooleskimo">Onekooleskimo</a> (<a href="../../../o/n/e/User_talk%7EOnekooleskimo_67cb.html" title="User talk:Onekooleskimo">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Onekooleskimo_7b6d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Onekooleskimo">contribs</a>) 17:56, 3 December 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>The opening sentence reads "The American Revolutionary War....was a war between Great Britain". It doesn't specify a second combatant (the colonies). Is this supposed to mean "an internal war within Great Britain", or did someone just delete the colonies?

<p>Given the, uh, "quality" of recent anon edits, it seems that semi-protection on this page would be appropriate.

<dd>I'd probably agree (certainly that most fought with the British), but for that differentiation one would have to list the various nations/tribes/bands individually for each side...

<dd>My guess is that some historian did the legwork and calculated how many Indians were on each side, but I have not seen it.

<p>there were no significant Polish or Prussian units, and the Oneida Indians were officially neutral ((and unofficially most supported the Americans before 1779 and the British afterwards).
