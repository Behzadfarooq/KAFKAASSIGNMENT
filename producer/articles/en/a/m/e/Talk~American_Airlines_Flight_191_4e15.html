<p>"I was aboard American Airlines Flight 191 on May 24, 1979. They had a live video feed from the cockpit and I was able to watch the take-off from over the pilot's shoulder. I thought it was amazing and very cool at the time.</p>
<p>The following day, that very same flight had an engine fall off on takeoff and it killed 273 persons. I thought about the view that those passengers had of the plane rolling and the ground in windshield and the pilot vainly fighting for control. I didn't think it was so cool after that.</p>
<p>As long as everything is working correctly, I would imagine this would be fairly interesting to the passengers. But, "According to the Federal Highway Administration, a train strikes a vehicle or a pedestrian at a rail crossing approximately every 2 hours in the United States." The view of that could be very disturbing to passengers. Klaatu, May 03 2004"</p>

<p>According to my dictionary, an accident is: <i>1. mishap causing injury or death&#160;; 2. event happening by chance. -- Collins English Mini Dictionary 1998</i>. It lists mishap as a <i>minor accident</i>. Can we really call it an accident? By chance? Especially in the light of the NTSB report.

<p>The lead paragraph as it was changed was just plain incorrect based on the way the NTSB and FAA account for airplane crash fatalities. The figures include not only those killed on board but those on the ground. Therefore, the death toll from each of the WTC planes exceeds those killed in this crash given the many ground fatalities (neither of the other two 9/11 crashes exceeded Flight 191's fatalities). While part of a coordinated attack each one of these crashes was a single aircraft crash. I think it also gives the reader perspective -- this was the deadliest crash in US history for over 20 years and was only exceeded by planes being intentionally flown into buildings causing massive fatalities. When you consider the cause of this accident -- cost cutting by an airline as opposed to pilot error, etc, makes it all that more significant. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 07:04, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, and I believe the word "crash" is more than appropriate, the American OED defines it: " (of an aircraft) fall from the sky and violently hit the land or sea." I don't believe the word "crash" has any indication of whether something is accidental or not. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 07:10, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The lead as I have changed it back to again, as it stood for well over a year, is the only accurate and clear summation of the fatality count from this disaster. The following changes are not:</p>
<p><a name="Combined_9.2F11_Fatalities_Exceed_AA191" id="Combined_9.2F11_Fatalities_Exceed_AA191"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/Talk%7EAmerican_Airlines_Flight_191_4e15.html" title="Edit section: Combined 9/11 Fatalities Exceed AA191">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Combined 9/11 Fatalities Exceed AA191</span></h3>
<p>While true it's not very precise, both AA11 and UA175, individually caused more fatalities. Were there some fatalities co-mingled in here? Almost certainly amongst emergency workers who were working the crash site but the fact is whichever plane or tower you pick, both of these crashes exceed the fatalities in AA191. Mucking up the lead with parentheticals doesn't clarify anything, it mucks it up, there are links to the articles fo AA11, UA175 and 9/11 if people want to learn why those were deadlier air disasters.</p>
<p><a name="Single_Largest_Loss_of_Life_for_Any_.22Single.22_Airliner" id="Single_Largest_Loss_of_Life_for_Any_.22Single.22_Airliner"></a></p>

<p>Again, totally inaccurate. AA11 crashed into Tower 1, <b>BUT FOR</b> AA11 crashing into Tower 1 none of those people die. Their deaths are directly linked to the air disaster and so those fatalities, as per every NTSB report are duly noted and counted in the total. Same thing with UA175, UA175 crashed into Tower 2 and directly caused the deaths of those people. Other than the fact this was a coordinated attack neither of the crashes had anything to do with each other, i.e. AA11 crashing into Tower 1 didn't make Tower 2 collapse.</p>
<p><br />
The lead as written is clear, concise, accurate, gives people a place to look for more info. To me, the only thing that could possibly be more specific is that AA191 resulted in the deaths of more passengers than any other US soil air disaster but, again, that bogs things down with wording that is not needed. It was the deadliest, these two crashes surpassed it, simple and concise. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 14:13, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>According to aviation hobbyists, the plane that recently crashed in KY was known at Comair to be Flight 191, while for ticketing purporses, Delta stamps it as Flight 5191. In any case, I think it should remain as part of the list of other accidents that have been tagged as a Flight 191. --Prn51 00:21, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Another item in the growing "jinx" list of 191's. If you can verify that, it would make an interesting addition to that part of this article. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 00:26, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think that with the Comair incident there will be a lot of talk on flight number 191 being a jinx. In any case I will take your advice and avoid any flight 191s.--Prn51 07:27, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Does any of this sound like it belongs in an authoritative reference? This is not about supernatural jinxes to numerical flight numbers. I removed this reference yesterday and it was immediately put back; this seriously hurts the credibility of this article. There is no talk on any serious aviation-related site that I frequent of any connection whatsoever between AA191 and Comair 5191. No connection exists. Basscadet 14:45, 31 August 2006 (UTC)basscadet

<dd>This meant that the pilots were unaware of the aircraft's true configuration. DC-10 aircraft engines are not visible from the cockpit windows and the control tower did not inform the flight crew of what they had seen.</dd>
</dl>
<p>But later on in the article it states the control tower did try and tell the pilots what had been seen but the pilots were too busy to listen. This makes much more sense since it would seem extremely unlikely for the control tower not to inform the pilots that their engine fell off... Also do whole thing seems a bit speculatory to me. Presemuably the pilots had some idea what had gone wrong, although whether they realised the engine had fallen off I doubt we'll ever know. I do also question the relevance of this factoid. Does it matter whether or whether not the pilots were aware their engine had fallen off? As I understand it, the problem was the damaged cause by the engine falling off and yet still the pilots might have been able to recover if they were aware of the limitations of the airplane (but in any case the pilots didn't do anything wrong) <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 18:00, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Reading and listening so more, I've now realised that it appears it wasn't actually inconsistent and the tower didn't actually inform the pilots they lost an engine. They simply asked them if they wanted where they wanted to land. I guess this has to do with what I was saying about the likely lack of importance of the fact an engine was lost to the pilots (assuming they really didn't know precisely)... <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 18:14, 21 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Reading a bit more, perhaps I've misunderstood the IMHO poorly constructed sentences:
<dl>
<dd>Unusually, the backup power to the captain's instruments was not engaged by the flight engineer. This meant that the pilots were unaware of the aircraft's true configuration.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Is this actually trying to say
<dl>
<dd>Unusually, the backup power to the captain's instruments was not engaged by the flight engineer. This strongly suggests that the pilots were not aware of the aircraft's true configuration.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I.E. the fact that the backup power was not engaged suggests the pilots (and flight engineer) didn't realise the engine had been lost? <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 18:24, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
