	    <p>I've merged in the peripheral articles on various certifications/designations, as they were all very similar. After taking away the common sentences, little unique information was left; so now they are here instead. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarasmusine_675c.html" title="User:Marasmusine">Marasmusine</a> 04:26, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I have cleaned up the page as best possible. Looking forward to insight and the removal of the Header regarding advertisement style language. As the AAFM is at the forefont of many areas of global training, some of the language and facts do seem compelling. An even more neutral point of view has been attempted.</p>

<p>This site is not an advertisement. The entity has 40,000 members in 145 countries. It is legitimate to maintain this entry for informational and regulatory purposes.</p>

<dd>I'm not sure where to start with this article. The size of the organization isn't important (in terms of the advert flag). It has a strong self-promotional flavour. Having a dozen <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">external links</a> to the organizations websites, for example. I'm not saying the references aren't there, but it needs to be made clearer where statements like <i>The American Academy is said to be the 1st Graduate Financial Organization in the world to have mutual cross- recognition agreements from the AACSB and ACBSP.</i> are sourced from. At the moment it reads like a promotional brochure. To go back to a comparison made before, take a look at the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">Harvard</a> article; it's not perfect but there's less one-upmanship and more actual information. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarasmusine_675c.html" title="User:Marasmusine">Marasmusine</a> 22:57, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The words 1st were removed to satisfy your request even though it is referenced already. As a note, there are link references at the bottom of the page from the 2 accreditation organizations AACSB and ACBSP that state their mutual global recognition. Also, how many links to this worldwide organization's country specific activities do you suggest? The Harvard page is extremely advert related, but I am sure most respect their factual self promotion.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help, and please remove your advertisement header logo if the present content is acceptable to your needs. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlobalprofessor_416e.html" title="User:Globalprofessor">Globalprofessor</a> 19:07, 4 November 2006 (UTC)]</p>

<p>It really is irrelevant what programs the AAFM recognizes. What is much more important is what evidence is there that reputable external parties recognize AAFM designations. No evidence of that is currently provided.</p>

<p>Good points again,</p>
<p>Please remove any reference to Newspapers and their recognition; however, the AAFM has received positive commentary and editorials as having prominent and cutting edge executive training and certification courses from many mentioned major news sources worldwide over the years. Note: AAFM was featured and compared to the New York University Certificates in Wealth Management in Finanical Management in the WSJ article.</p>
<p>Please review the included external reference links to the listings in the SEC/NASD, AACSB Legal recognition agreements, ACBSP legal recognition agreements, Department of Labor links or other. As far as external recognition, the AACSB and the ACBSP are the to most prominent &amp; government recognized accreditation agencies in the USA for business school college and degree education. There are links at the bottom of the page that clearly show this alliance.</p>
<p>In the USA, legal sanction or accreditation is not provided to professional or self regulated organizations or board certification such as: Chartered Accountants, CFPs, ChFCs, CFAs, or other. If an organization is run or taken over by the state or federal authorities, then such recognition or government sanction is possible. As you may already know, examples of state run or regulated professional groups that provide credentials and licensing are: Lawyers/JDs, CPAs etc. This is just my legal and academic opinion based on research.</p>
<p>Thanks for the editing and please remove the advert code after you have removed any other overtly self-promotional wording that has been added by surfers. After a review of similar and germane associations, many of them or their members seem to be involved in shameless self-promotion. Thus, I am sure it is a tough call on the other sites. If you need help in a legal review of other sites that you focus on, please advise.</p>

<dd>It's not a question of being "opponents" of AAFM (or otherwise) but rather seeking a fact-based and objective article suitable for inclusion in WP. That means verifiable and <i>reputable</i> sources of information, other than AAFM itself. Psnae 02:48, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If the ACBSP is an recognized accreditor of educational courses, why is its domain name ending in .org and not .edu? Psnae 05:17, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Last time I checked, .edu domains are strictly held for educational institutions that are insitutionally accredited. ACBSP does have a .edu domain, which is held by one of our member schools (Mount Saint Vincent). All it does it redirect to acbsp.org. For more information on the .edu domain, go to Educause<a href="http://www.educause.edu/edudomain/eligibility.asp#regional" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.educause.edu/edudomain/eligibility.asp#regional" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../p/h/n/User%7EPhnxFyreG_d682.html" title="User:PhnxFyreG">PhnxFyreG</a> 16:39, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, accreditation agencies are NOT colleges. Last time I researched and checked, the CHEA is a FEDERAL Government Recognized Agency which is also at a DOT ORG address. Further, the NASD is a GOVERNMENT Recognized agency and is on a dot com address. So, please review CHEA <a href="http://www.chea.org/default.asp?link=7" class="external free" title="http://www.chea.org/default.asp?link=7" rel="nofollow">http://www.chea.org/default.asp?link=7</a> Thus, ACBSB and AACSB are the two most recognized AND government sanctioned accreditation agencies in the USA specifically for regionally accredited business schools. Therefore, if a business school has AACSB or ACBSP accreditation; then, they are DOUBLE accredited by the regional accreditation agency AND the Business School Accreditation. This organization, AAFM is the only financial organization that does what is most legal and ethical by recognizing government recognized and accredited business school education, courses and degrees. Other oganization create their own schools from scratch. AAFM recognizes and accepts business school credits from NYU, Stanford, Harvard, Princeton and 560 other double accredited business schools &amp; law schools....through the legal cross recogniztion agreements of the AACSB and ACBSP and specific law school programs...</p>

<p>Here is a list of government recognized accreditation agencies from the CHEA: <a href="http://www.chea.org/Directories/special.asp#acbsp" class="external free" title="http://www.chea.org/Directories/special.asp#acbsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.chea.org/Directories/special.asp#acbsp</a> Many of these accreditation agencies are .org and .edu.</p>
<p>AACSB and ACBSP are the 2 USA Government recognized professional accreditations specific for USA business schools. Thus, a top tier business school would generally be double accredited. i.e. regional accreditation plus AACSB or ACBSP.</p>

<p>The advert tag should not be dropped and left on the page without prompt talk or discussion. It seems that the references and citations have been enhanced and fixed several times by various editors. Thus, it should be ok, or somebody should simply remove a reference that is not cited instead of putting the advert tag up for weeks at a time.</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is still a paucity of <i>verified</i> references to <i>reputable</i> sources. Psnae 03:36, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It seems that all of the relevant facts now have citations. Other than that I can not find any advert style language. If there are facts that readers would have trouble with, please advise. Otherwise, this article should not have advert spam on it and should only have a style or cleanup link on it with suggestions provided for quick cleanup?</p>
<p>It is confusing that there has been so much discussion over this page? Is there a cultural misunderstanding? Under the USA laws, this article seems to have all of the documentation necessary and is more authenticated that most other articles in the same sphere. <a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlobalprofessor_416e.html" title="User:Globalprofessor">Globalprofessor</a> 22:16, 6 February 2007 (UTC)globalprofessor<a href="../../../g/l/o/User%7EGlobalprofessor_416e.html" title="User:Globalprofessor">Globalprofessor</a> 22:16, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Most of the "citations" are completely irrelevant to the point at hand. And the "mutual cross-recognition" agreements from AACSB and ACBSP seem to be nothing of the sort. All the press releases refer to is the fact that AAFM is extending recognition to these programs. No reference is made to anyone recognizing or accrediting any AAFM designations. There is not a single reference to suggest that AAFM qualifications are given credence (AAFM accrediting others is irrelevant) by any <i>official</i> or <i>reputable</i> souce - eg U.S. or state governments, reputable universities, professional bodies like AICPA etc. Psnae 03:55, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>This article is backed up by multiple legal and academic sources including the NASD, Dept of Labor, the 2 best accreditation agencies for business schools in the world. Clear legal and global recognition. Please read the AACSB and ACBSP legal press releases. The AAFM is a global organization with about 40 thousand members in something like 150 countries.... Plus, AAFM is only for college grads. The above post can not be serious and must be vandalism? Further, I agree with the prior post that some people must not be familiar with US, Latin &amp; South American, or Canada Laws which represent over 25 countries. Again, in the West, having recognition and disclosure with AACSB, ACBSP, the NASD, Dept of Labor, Dept of Education is the highest you can go without becoming absorbed by the government. AAFM is also recognized in many other countries by their laws. Please do research before making such claims against such a large and esteemed global organization.</p>
<dl>
<dd>For example. <a href="http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/enewsline/Vol-2/Issue-4/assoc-aafm.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.aacsb.edu/publications/enewsline/Vol-2/Issue-4/assoc-aafm.asp" rel="nofollow">This AACSB press release</a> states that "The American Academy of Financial Management (AAFM) Board of Standards officially recognized AACSB International accredited business schools on Feb. 11, 2003.". However <b>nowhere</b> does it refer to AAFM designations being recognised or accepted by any third party. There is a similar lack of references to any <b>third party</b> recognition of AAFM designations in all the other cited references. Psnae 04:22, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Glad you read that press release. I too was impressed by it. The AACSB is the most recognized accreditation agency in the world for business schools. Further, AACSB is Government recognized by several authorities. As you can see, they accepted recognition from AAFM along with posting a global press release on their website about it. Thus, the AACSB International and their director welcomed and promoted the alliance. It looks pretty clear. In sum, this press release is a recognition, sanction and approval of the AACSB courses and degrees by AAFM that was well received. This recognition was acquiesced to as per this press release. In any event, this is the first alliance of its kind. Most other insurance or financial planner organizations will go from school to school to try and form an alliance. The AAFM and AACSB simply formed a direct alliance which covers over 400 of the best business schools at the best universities and colleges worldwide. Overall, this type of recognition and mutual acceptance is probably the strongest type of reference that any financial organization could ever desire.</dd>
