<p>Practitioners of Songahm Taekwondo study poome sae (forms, a preset combination of offensive and defensive technigues, designed to simulate sparring an imaginary opponent), gyeo-roo-gi (sparring), one-steps (scripted sparring segments), self defense, board breaking, weapons and leadership skills. Songahm taekwondo has a leadership program that allows students to work as leaders in junior classes and helps the leadership workers become qualified taekwondo instructors.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Taekwondo_Association_470f.html" title="Edit section: Belt and rank system">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Belt and rank system</span></h2>
<p>The American Taekwondo Association uses a rank system divided into two series: the colored belt series, and the black belt series. The purposes of a rank system include establishing a chain of command, and measurement of student progress. Each series has nine ranks within it due to the significance of the number nine as the highest attainable goal of a measurable endeavor in Oriental culture.</p>
<p>Each rank from orange belt to second degree black belt may be held either as a Recommended (R) or Decided (D) rank. The "decided" rank is a half step above the "recommended" rank. Some schools denote this rank with a piece of black tape around the end of the belt hanging on the student's right side. Other schools show the recommended rank with dual colored belts. Your higher rank would be worn as the top half of the belt and the lesser rank as the bottom half of the belt. Decided ranks wear the full color belt. At promotional rank testgings, students may receive a "Full Pass," "Half Pass," or "No Change." In rare cases where students have prior martial arts experience, they may be promoted by 1 1/2 ranks or "double test" and get a full two rank promotion. For example, a decided Camo Belt (6D) could go half a rank to recommended Green Belt (Half Green/Half Camo - 5R), a full rank to decided Green Belt (Solid Green - 5D), or stay the same. And in extreme cases, if they go 1 1/2 ranks, they would become recommended Purple Belt (Half Purple/Half Green - 4R) or "double Test" and achieve decided Purple Belt (Solid Purple - 4D).</p>
<p>However, if a closer look is taken at the philosophy behind the belt, then the colors chosen for each belt are clear. ATA uses a progressive symbology of a pine tree growing on a mountain, and each belt represents a stage of growth. The camouflage belt, as an example, has the meaning behind it of "The sapling is hidden among the taller pines and must now begin to fight its way upward". This is further reinforced by the fact that camouflage belt is the first level where the student begins to free spar, as opposed to formalized one step (scripted) sparring segments.</p>

<p>Each belt has a meaning that compares the students growth in Taekwondo to the growth of a pine tree.</p>
<ul>
<li>White belt compares the student to having a clean slate in Taekwondo (white is used to represent "clean")</li>
<li>Orange belt compares a student's knowledge to the sun rise, the student sees the beauty of Taekwondo but not the power.</li>
<li>Yellow belt states that the seed has seen the sun, the student is learning the basics and has "seen the sun"</li>
<li>Camo belt states that the student has seen their place in the world of Taekwondo and must now fight their way up the ranks (students start sparring now).</li>
<li>Green belt compares a student to a sapling that is growing in strength and entering a new level of training.</li>
<li>Purple belt represents the student's reaching a "mountain" in their training as their forms become more difficult and curriculum moe challenging.</li>
<li>Blue belt represents student's reaching towards new heights. The student is now considered an advanced belt (new heights being the sky for the pine tree and black belt for the student).</li>
<li>Brown belt signifies that the student has firm roots in Taekwondo (brown is used to represent the earth).</li>
<li>Red belt represents the first day (red is used to represent the sun set) of a student's training being over, and the student's beginning of work towards their black belt.</li>
<li>Red/black belt signifies the sun's rising on the second day of training, as a student works toward their black belt.</li>
<li>Black belt has special symbolism, as black is created when all colors of the spectrum are absorbed into an object, as the student has "absorbed" the knowledge of all previous belts.</li>

<p>Upon attaining the rank of 6th Degree black belt, the next step is earning the mantle of "Master Instructor." This is not automatic. A 5th Degree may only test for 6th Degree at the Songahm Taekwondo World Championships, held in <a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Rock%2C_Arkansas_8f37.html" title="Little Rock, Arkansas">Little Rock, Arkansas</a> each June. The new 6th Degree will have new criteria which must be met in order to apply for Mastership, and cannot be awarded until Worlds the following year. Similarly, there is a minimum period of a year between earning a 7th Degree and the Senior Master title, as well as 8th Degree and the Chief Master title. Mastership is only earned after many years of dedication to the ATA, which is why Masters are styled "Instructors of Instructors."</p>

<p>A form (poome sae) is a series of kicks, blocks and punches put together in a set pattern. The pattern becomes more complex as the student progresses through the ranks. For example, the 9th grade white belt form contains eighteen moves. The 5th grade green belt form has 34 moves and the 1st degree black belt form has 81 moves. If all of the forms (eighteen in all)are done in sequence, they form the pattern of a nine pointed star (eight outer points plus a center point) referred to as the Songahm Star. In general, forms create a contextual application for new material learned at each belt level.</p>

<p>One steps are a short combination of blocks, strikes and kicks that serve as a precursor to free sparring. Through one steps, students learn to put moves into combinations, focus their techniques at a specific target, learn distancing and gain self control. There are three specific one steps for each belt level starting at white belt and ending with green. As with the forms, the one steps become more complex as a student progresses in rank.</p>

Each <a href="../../../d/o/b/Dobok.html" title="Dobok">dobok</a> has on the right breast an ATA shield patch with a school or club-specific patch on the left. On the back of the uniform, instructors and trainee instructors are required to have the word "TAEKWONDO" arching over a red and blue ATA patch. Underneath the patch is the instructor's name, either as "JOHN DOE" or "J. DOE." Non-instructor students may wear a uniform with "TAEKWONDO" and an ATA patch on the back, however, these students may not wear their names on their backs. Instead of a name, the student will have the location of the dojahng (<a href="../../../d/o/j/Dojo.html" title="Dojo">dojo</a>) he or she attends, e.g., "Lincoln, NE."</p>

<p>In addition, a 1/2 inch black stripe is added down the sides of the pant legs after a student or instructor has reached 4th degree Black Belt. Any individual attaining 4th degree Black Belt wears this pant leg stripe regardless of instructor level or school ownership.</p>

<p>At promotional testings and ATA tournaments, Level 3 Certified Instructors have the option to wear navy blue suits in lieu of their <a href="../../../d/o/b/Dobok.html" title="Dobok">doboks</a>. Fifth Degree Black Belts and up wear matching blue pants, while 1st through 4th degrees wear grey pants. A special ATA patch is worn on the instructor's left breast. The patch is navy blue with all stitching being done in silver for 1st-4th Degrees or gold for 5th and up. Underneath the shield on the patch is a silver or gold banner (as appropriate) with the instructor's title and name stitched in navy blue, e.g., "Mr. J. Spitsen," "Master P. Saberzadeh," "Sr. Master R. Terrell," "Chief Master Clark," "Grand Master Lee." On the right breast, the instructor wears any medals or ribbons he or she has been awarded, giving the suit a militaristic, naval look.</p>
<p>On each collar just above the lapel, the instructor wears rank insignia. First through 4th Degrees wear navy patches with stitched silver borders. Silver bars are stitched on the patches relative to the instructor's rank. These patches are the same as the patches on their black belts, only the belt patches are gold on black rather than silver on blue. Fifth through 9th degrees wear metallic gold pentagonal stars which pin to the lapels.</p>

<p>The Songahm Taekwondo Federation is a branch of ATA established for South America. It was founded in 1984 by Grand Master H. U. Lee and Senior Master Cesar Ozuna. This was the first international chapter for the Songham style of Taekwondo outside of the US and Canada and is rapidly gaining popularity.</p>

<p>Founded during the fall of 1990, The World Traditional Taekwondo Union (WTTU) is a division of Songahm Taekwondo. While the ATA consists of Taekwondo schools in the United States and the STF consists of schools in South America, the WTTU covers the remainder of the world.</p>

<p>ATA Xtreme is a hybrid of traditional taekwondo open-hand and weapons forms, acrobatics, and gymnastics.

<p>The ATA Taekwondo system recognizes nine color belts, and a black belt recommended rank in the progression from white belt (novice or newcomer) to <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Belt_3db4.html" title="Black Belt">Black Belt</a>. Additionally there are nine degrees of black belt plus another "recommended" level prior to 2nd degree. With the large number of belts (including uncommon colors such as the camouflage belt), the fact that each test costs an additional fee, and the relatively rapid promotion through the belt ranks (it is not uncommon to achieve black belt within two years for excellent demonstration at each rank) have led some critics to label ATA schools with the derogatory phrase "belt factories" and "<a href="../../../m/c/d/McDojo_0c78.html" title="McDojo">McDojos</a>".<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[4]</a></sup> This practice is similar to the stripe approach used by many other Taekwondo organizations, including the ITF and the WTF, whereby fewer belts are used, but the students periodically test for stripes to be added to their belts.</p>
<p>The use of nine levels in the colored belt and black belt systems, while attributed to a belt factory mentality, is in fact rooted in Korean numerology and has been explained by General Choi (nine is an important number in Korean culture). The increased number of smaller goals provided by nine levels of colored belt rank likely satisfies the need of many American students for immediate gratification.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Within the Songahm system of Taekwondo, there is at most one 9th Degree Black Belt within the organization at a time. This individual holds the title of Grand Master and is considered to be the leader of Songahm Taekwondo. Past and present Grand Masters include:</p>

<p>Upon being diagnosed with cancer in 2000, Grand Master H.U. Lee realized the importance of ensuring that his vision for Songahm Taekwondo be kept alive after his death. In September 2000, Grand Master Lee formally created the Songahm Master's Council comprised of his most trusted advisors. Inaugural members of the Master's Council included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Soon Ho Lee (9th Degree Black Belt)</li>
<li>Robert Allemier (8th Degree Black Belt)</li>
<li>In Ho Lee (8th Degree Black Belt)</li>
<li>William Clark (8th Degree Black Belt)</li>
<li>G.K. Lee (8th Degree Black Belt)</li>
<li>M.K. Lee (7th Degree Black Belt)</li>
</ul>
<p>After being unanimously confirmed by the Master's Council as the next Grand Master Candidate, Soon Ho Lee removed himself from the Master's Council to focus on his training to become Songahm's second Grand Master. H.U. Lee holds an honorary position in the Master's Council.</p>
