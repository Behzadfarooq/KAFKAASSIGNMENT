	    <p>ACU is operating in more than 20 countries and working with some of the best schools in the world. How can you assume otherwise and base your views on just an article by a yellow journalist. It is fair that you remove the lies and put truth on your website. Your website is not about tarnishing image of people and should not become a party supporting the competitors rather provide factual history of an institution. If you find it difficult then please remove the ACU information from your website. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 219.95.25.167 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_219.95.25.167_5562.html" title="Special:Contributions/219.95.25.167">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<p>The paragraph above was prepended to my last comment without signature, making it appear that I had written it. I did not. (I added the indentation and the paragraph break, to attempt to clarify this. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicki_Rosenzweig_719b.html" title="User:Vicki Rosenzweig">Vicki Rosenzweig</a> 01:07, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I note that while defenders of this school have periodically pasted in material from the school's website, nobody has supplied basic, factual data that I'd expect people reporting on a legitimate university would provide, such as the size of the student body. (To do so, they might need to do further research, since that's not on said website.) That would be actually informative, unlike unsourced assertions that the newspaper articles are false. <a href="../../../v/i/c/User%7EVicki_Rosenzweig_719b.html" title="User:Vicki Rosenzweig">Vicki Rosenzweig</a> 02:40, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Putting false information on Wikipedia is neither legal nor ethical.I do hope you will be able to provide true picture of the university and not views of some newspaper reporters who due to instigating of competing parties which to villigy an entity.

<p>The AP stories in the Casper Star Tribune look fine to me. If you can cite some non-interested sources that counter the information in these stories, or that provide hard evidence that a lawsuit <b>has</b> been filed, then do so. Even if you don't like that info and you think it should be replaced, that's no reason to copy chunks of text from ACU's website; this is neither neutral nor verified, and it violates ACU's copyright. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckRose_0826.html" title="User:BuckRose">BuckRose</a> 23:28, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Please note that the information provided by AP is falsee and deragatory. A law suit may be in the offing against the paper. Your article should be based on facts and not tarnishing the reputation of an entity. You have also misquoted another website which has got nothing to do with ACU. That is a bogus entity confusing people with ACU. Thank you for your time and understanding. <b>NOTE:</b> This unsigned comment was left by 219.95.238.101 at 01:54, 23 February 2007. It isn't that hard to sign comments, folks; four tildes will do it. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckRose_0826.html" title="User:BuckRose">BuckRose</a> 23:21, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Let's put the most recent comments at the top. I have asked that this page be protected. It's been subjected to repeated whitewashing, replacing the entire body of the article with text that is largely merely copied from the website of this entity. This violates several Wikipedia policies -- <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_violations_2ca9.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright violations">Wikipedia:Copyright violations</a>. The current version of the page (reverted yet again from whitewashing) does include information which could be seen as detrimental to ACU. This is well-documented with references to news items from the Associated Press and the Casper Star Tribune. I see no reason to remove this information and replace it with promotional material copied from ACU, unless one is trying to cover up the true history and reputation of ACU. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckRose_0826.html" title="User:BuckRose">BuckRose</a> 18:30, 18 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>ACU is a good school which offers quality education in many countries. Yes you are right that it is not recognised but we should not be bad mouthing such type of schools. John ( <b>NOTE:</b> Note: This unsigned comment was left by 219.95.237.11 on 18 February 2007. For whatever reason, he also changed the URLs mentioned below by Ybunkwok, making both of them refer to acusa.net, rather than one to this domain and the other to acuniversity.org <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckRose_0826.html" title="User:BuckRose">BuckRose</a> 18:30, 18 February 2007 (UTC)).</p>
<p>They took out the accreditation info, so I put a tiny blurb about lack of accrediation back in. I think you will need to request the page be protected.</p>
<p>With MBA schools, if you want to get a job after graduation, it's important that the school be appropriately accredited. Any school that doesn't blatently list their accrediation info is one to be concerned about. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoaringMice_7bc5.html" title="User:RoaringMice">RoaringMice</a> 16:50, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article has been repeatedly whitewashed by anonymous users. Please, if you have issues with the current article, discuss that here on the talk page. If you continue to whitewash, I'll request that the page be protected. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckRose_0826.html" title="User:BuckRose">BuckRose</a> 01:07, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Folks, if you've looked at a version of this article that 1) doesn't mention that ACU is not accredited by any organization recognized by the US Department of Education, and 2) doesn't even include a link to ACU's own website, you're probably looking at a whitewashed version. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuckRose_0826.html" title="User:BuckRose">BuckRose</a> 23:13, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

I found two websites for "American Central University," as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.acusa.net/" class="external free" title="http://www.acusa.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.acusa.net/</a></p>

<p>Do they refer to the same school or two different schools? Are they recognized or formally accredited? <a href="../../../y/b/u/User%7EYbunkwok_ea81.html" title="User:Ybunkwok">Ybunkwok</a> Jan 17, 2007</p>
