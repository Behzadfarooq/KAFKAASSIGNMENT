He was the grandson of Lorenzo Dow Key, MD, a 1878 graduate of <a href="../../../m/e/h/Meharry_Medical_College_ca1d.html" title="Meharry Medical College">Meharry Medical College</a> in Nashville, Tennessee and (Mrs.) America Davenport Gray Key. Dr. Nelson was the maternal great-grandson of Hillery Wattsworth Key, D.D., who had served as a Trustee of Meharry and Walden University. Dr. Nelson's maternal great-grandfather had also been one of twenty-two (22) members who founded the Methodist Episcopal Church North in Murfreesboro, Tennessee on October 11, 1866, a distinction that was honored by the Tennessee Conference of the United Methodist Church, Clarksville, Tennessee on October 12-14, 1979 by naming the Key Memorial United Methodist Church as a historic site. Two other churches in Gallatin KEY-Stewart United Methodist Church and Hartsville, Tennessee are named for Hillery Wattsworth Key, D.D.</p>

<p>During a Reunion of the 366th Veterans Association a plaque was given to him on April 14, 1979, noting that he was the "Physician and friend to the Regiment who will forever be remembered as 'Doc' Nelson, the Regimental Surgeon. The former Captain Hondon Hargrove, author of THE BUFFALO SOLDIER IN ITALY, gave a person tribute to him in stating, "He was the most gentle of all men for helped men to face with courage the most difficult circumstances." Judge John Letts, who gave a tribute to him at his final Memorial Service in the Chapel and Internment at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Custer_National_Cemetery_8c89.html" title="Fort Custer National Cemetery">Fort Custer National Cemetery on</a> August 11, 1994, said as he reflected upon his deep caring not only of the Men and Officers of the Regiment, but also of their families said, "Of all men that I have known, he was one of the rarest." Colonel Charles Fisher, Retired, Regimental Chaplain, 366th Infantry, who Officiated at Dr. Nelson's service at Frank Howe's Chapel, Garratt Theological Seminary, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northwestern_University_b7d7.html" title="Northwestern University">Northwestern University</a>, Evanston, Illinois on July 2, 1994 stated, "he was a universal man, a man of the universe, who cared for the enemy, prisoners-of-war, refugees, children of the war, as well as his own Men and Officers equally. He was a man beyond race, color or creed."</p>
