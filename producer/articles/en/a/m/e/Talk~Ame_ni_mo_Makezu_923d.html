I think,<br />
"homerare mo sezu"(誉められもせず)<br />
"ku ni mo sarezu"(苦にもされず)<br />
are a pair. ("ku ni mo sarezu" shouldn't be read as　"kuni mo sarezu 国も去れず"(can't leave a country/land/nation).)</p>
<p>So, the translation of this part will be like;<br />
"without being praised"<br />
"without being blamed"</p>
<p>User:Nopira 0:14, 24 September 2005(JST)</p>
<p><br />
And, using katakana was not odd thing in Japan before 1945. In post-war Japan, children are taught hiragana first, but before GHQ and the Ministry of Education started the reformation of language education, children was taught katakana first.</p>
<p>But I think this part is right;</p>
<p>"it might be viewed as a move to make his poem more accessible to the rural folk of northern Japan with whom he spent his life"</p>
<p>because a lot of people(farmers, workers, housewives and so on) in rural area might be able to use only katakana (by the lack of education, education only at primary schools), and katakana was more common letter at not-official scene then. (to send short letters to friends or family, or urgent business letters and telegraphs, to take a note or memo, to keep a diary, ....)</p>

<dd>Great, Nopira, thanks! That's the trouble with kana-only for non-native speakers, we're not always sure how to parse the text. My original reading did seem to end on a depressing note -- "unable to leave" sure doesn't sound happy -- and "not being blamed" makes more sense given the tone of the work. &#160;:) I'll make the fix. Thanks again!</dd>

<p>Hello Gniw --</p>
<p>I just recently went through the page's history and ran across your edit summaries. Thanks for your input. I have some comments and questions in response.</p>
<p>About the title, since <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenji_Miyazawa_cc8a.html" title="Kenji Miyazawa">Kenji Miyazawa</a> put it primarily in <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katakana.html" title="Katakana">katakana</a>, the use of lower case was intentional as it seemed more appropriate, c.f. <a href="../../../e/2E/_/E._E._Cummings_50b7.html" title="E. E. Cummings">e.e. cummings</a>. To which I have a riddle about style in English&#160;:) -- if there's a proper noun that is deliberately spelled in lower case, and that noun starts a sentence, does one capitalize it?</p>
<p>Also, the first two lines in the translation had been intentionally swapped, as it is more idiomatic in English to say "the wind and the rain", i.e. the wind comes first, and not "the rain and the wind". This then cuts to the meat of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Translation.html#Measuring_success_in_translation" title="Translation">a key question in translation</a>, specifically keeping as close as possible to the source text on the one hand, and producing a target text that covers the meaning of the source but in a more natural style / format / idiom for the target language on the other. Here with these two lines, my thought is ultimately どうでもいい, but this is a question worth bringing up. Any thoughts or comments are welcome.</p>
<p>Cheers, <a href="../../../e/i/r/User%7EEirikr_d43d.html" title="User:Eirikr">Eiríkr Útlendi</a> 16:39, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does anyone have any references to the original format of this poem? I seem to recall reading somewhere that it was originally done *entirely* in katakana, but I can't seem to find any specific mention of this, in either English or Japanese. Plus, the only versions of it I can find online include kanji.</p>
<p>Nopira, do you happen to know the answer to this? I thought that the use of katakana was more of a style issue due to the use of kanji. If Miyazawa used katakana purely for legibility among the under-educated rural people, would he still have used kanji? Or is the version here incorrect, and the original was, indeed, all in katakana? Any (constructive) input anyone can give is appreciated! &#160;:)</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<dd>Hi Eirikr, I found the original Miyazawa's poem on the notebook. This notebook was found after death of Miyazawa, and this original version was written in both katakana and kanji. Just like in your article.</dd>
<dd><a href="http://www3.ocn.ne.jp/~gogouan/Ryokan/kenji.html" class="external text" title="http://www3.ocn.ne.jp/~gogouan/Ryokan/kenji.html" rel="nofollow">"Ame ni mo makezu" Notebook,dated November 3, 1931, in the bed of the hospital</a></dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In <a href="../../../a/o/z/Aozora_bunko.html" title="Aozora bunko">Aozora bunko</a>, I searched Miyazawa's works, and he usually used hiragana and kanji when he wrote stories and poems, but this poem written in katakana. It have bit strange feeling. Maybe it was just a memo or diary, or prayer not for publish, or just a draft.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think, Miyazawa usually used hiragana (for children?) because hiragana was soft than katakana. But sometimes he wrote a line by katakana and roman letters for express some odd feelings. He wrote his works for the all the people in his rural area from adult to child, but his writing style was based on hiragana. I can't find arguments or discussions about it on the net.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And, about the line "ku ni mo sarezu"(苦にもされず), "Ku ni suru" means worry about, worry over, cares, feel pain or suffering, be bothered. So, maybe this line will be "not bother someone" or something, but I couldn't find more suitable translation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>offtopic:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Before 1945, Formal texts was <i>Bungotai</i>"written Japanese", mainly by <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kanji.html" title="Kanji">kanji</a>, affected by ancient Chinese official texts(<a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_Chinese_39e7.html" title="Classical Chinese">Classical Chinese</a>). <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katakana.html" title="Katakana">Katakana</a> is an assistant letter of kanji(invented for assistance of reading Chinese text. <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiragana.html" title="Hiragana">hiragana</a> is more independent from kanji, and was unofficial letter), so katakana was more official and important than hiragana. Children were taught katakana first.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Kanji and katakana" texts are not common today ,but was very common both in the informal situation like memos or texts and writings by under-educated people, and in the formal situation. For example, The Criminal code(1907) and The Civil Code(1898) of Japan are still written in katakana and kanji.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><a href="http://www.geocities.co.jp/HeartLand-Icho/3935/ww2/syusen.html" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.co.jp/HeartLand-Icho/3935/ww2/syusen.html" rel="nofollow">This is the famous (or infamous) example of the official text of government in "written Japanese" -</a> <a href="../../../g/y/o/Gyokuon-hoso.html" title="Gyokuon-hoso">Imperial Rescript on Surrender</a>,1945.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nowadays, the official text is "Hiragana and kanji", and based on <i>Kougotai</i>,spoken japanese. Katakana is used only in assistance of hiragana, and is an informal letter. (Recently, a total reformation of the Criminal code and the Civil code is work in progress, new codes will be written by hiragana and kanji.)</dd>

<dd>Thank you, Nopira, that is most interesting (and even somewhat unnerving) to see Miyazawa's actual notebook. And thank you too for the reminder about katakana usage in days gone by. &#160;:) I'd seen some older katakana materials once long ago, but had completely forgotten about them until you mentioned the law codes and the Imperial Rescript.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Given the Buddhist prayers in the notebook, I suspect Miyazawa never intended the poem for publication. Might this poem have been a more private and personal piece of writing than his other works? Could the use of katakana indicate this?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>About 苦にもされず, might this mean "not being bothered (about not being praised)"? I find the use of the passive in this construction to be somewhat confusing.</dd>

<dd>Hi Eirikr, I'm glad you feel interesting about these websites. I'm not sure about relation between his usual writing style and his service for farmers. And the meaning of the style of this poem written in katakana.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>the last page that Miyazawa wrote Lotus sutra again and again and again is very strange (and fearful) for me.&#160;:) ((('Д')))shaking don't stop... ...but his prayer was very important part of his life and serious thing.</dd>
<dd>I gradually think that this katakana text was a personal prayer. And other published works and manuscripts discovered after his death were written in hiragana.(at least, what i found on the net was all written in hiragana.) It's a Subject that more investigation needed, but it's too heavy for me.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>ku ni mo sarezu苦にもされず is difficult, but i think it will mean "I will bother no one". I think It will be pair of "homerare mo sezu", and two line will be independent.</dd>
<dd>these line will mean that Miyazawa didn't want be a object of praise by other people (or community of village/school/circle and so on), and also didn't want be a troublemaker, a person who annoy someone, a object of worry by other people. ("trouble" will be about bad human relations with others, poverty, bad health, and so on...)</dd>
<dd>so, maybe he wanted to be an "invisible" person who just worked for people without attracting someone's attention, or being worried about him (human relations, health, earnings, and so on).</dd>
<dd>The use of the passive of these lines is difficult, but very interesting.</dd>

<p>Hello Monsieurtode --</p>
<p>Thanks for your suggestions, I've taken some on board. Some I reverted though, and thought I'd explain here:</p>
<ul>
<li>決して in kana is spelled けっして, hence "kesshite"</li>
<li>It's generally clearer in rōmaji to separate discrete elements with a space, hence "itsu mo", "waratte iru", and "shite yari".</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm curious if you have any particular reason for changing "okorazu" to "ikarazu"? Both mean the same thing, and according to what I can find in dictionaries, 瞋ラズ can be read either way, so I'm happy to leave it as you've entered. If you have a source showing how Miyazawa Kenji would have pronounced this, please add it to the page. &#160;:-) Cheers, <a href="../../../e/i/r/User%7EEirikr_d43d.html" title="User:Eirikr">Eiríkr Útlendi</a> 15:55, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello Eirikr: Well, I edited it according to the <a href="../../../k/o/u/Koujien.html" title="Koujien">Koujien</a>, which does not have a word "okorasu" but does have a word "ikarasu". Moreover, according to my kanji dictionary 瞋らす is read as いからす. This <a href="http://www3.ocn.ne.jp/~gogouan/Ryokan/kenji.html" class="external text" title="http://www3.ocn.ne.jp/~gogouan/Ryokan/kenji.html" rel="nofollow">page</a> which shows the original notebooks also transliterate it as いからす. It would be good to add this to the external links.</p>
<p>Also according to the Koujien, there are actually two readings for 決して, which are　けして and けっして. Since the original notebooks only read 決して, the actual transliteration is uncertain, so I think we can read it either way.</p>
<p>Finally, it would be good to note that he wrote the title of the Lotus Sutra (南無妙法蓮華経) multiple times over the page. Miyazawa was a very devout Nicheren Buddhist, and it is reflected in the poem.</p>
<p>Thanks! <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonsieurtode_1181.html" title="User:Monsieurtode">Monsieurtode</a> 09:00, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hey there Monsieurtode, thanks for replying! Interesting about the Kojien and 決して; I only have a Shogakukan to hand at the moment, and it only lists けっして as possible pronunciations, and <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwjdic.cgi?1C" class="external text" title="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/cgi-bin/wwwjdic.cgi?1C" rel="nofollow">Jim Breem's online dictionary</a> also only gives this pronunciation, which jives with what I hear on the street in Tokyo and among 日本人 in California. I'll have to dig into that one some. Perhaps it's a dialect variation?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>About <i>okorazu / ikarazu</i>, it's important to note that it's not す on the end, but rather ず, indicating "not doing [whatever the verb is]". <i>Ikarasu</i> would be the causative of <i>ikaru</i>, i.e. "to make someone mad", which would be out of character given the tone of the poem. But thank you for drawing my attention back to it -- given the meaning of 瞋 as "anger", I just arbitrarily chose <i>okoru</i> as the base reading, but in looking back into it, sure enough, <a href="http://www3.ocn.ne.jp/~gogouan/Ryokan/kenji.html" class="external text" title="http://www3.ocn.ne.jp/~gogouan/Ryokan/kenji.html" rel="nofollow">the page you and Nopira both linked to showing Miyazawa's notebook</a> does give the kana reading as いからず. I didn't notice before when Nopira had posted. Doh!</dd>

<dd>The <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenji_Miyazawa_cc8a.html" title="Kenji Miyazawa">Kenji Miyazawa</a> article itself talks about Buddhism and the Lotus Sutra as major influences in his life. Looking again at the pictures of his notebook, it appears that the Sutra comes after the poem rather than on the same pages, and as such I'm not sure if it's intended as part of the same piece of writing. As you suggest, I'll go ahead and add the link to the bottom of the page though, as it's certainly interesting and of value to look at the poem in Miyazawa's own hand. If you feel it's important and relevant enough to write something about it directly on the poem page here, by all means do so. &#160;:-) Cheers, <a href="../../../e/i/r/User%7EEirikr_d43d.html" title="User:Eirikr">Eiríkr Útlendi</a> 17:16, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for swinging by. I noticed you'd taken the "d" out of "shidzuka", but I think the "d" belongs there, as the transliteration is just that -- a transliteration, and not an attempt at "proper" rōmaji spellings. Have a look at the note on the bottom about how the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transliteration.html" title="Transliteration">transliteration</a> is meant to directly show what Miyazawa Kenji wrote. In this case, the spelling <i>shizuka</i> would indicate the kana シズカ, whereas what Miyazawa used was シヅカ, hence <i>shidzuka</i> to indicate a ツ with the <a href="../../../d/a/k/Dakuten.html" title="Dakuten">濁点</a>. I hope this better explains the spellings. Cheers, <a href="../../../e/i/r/User%7EEirikr_d43d.html" title="User:Eirikr">Eiríkr Útlendi</a> 17:09, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
