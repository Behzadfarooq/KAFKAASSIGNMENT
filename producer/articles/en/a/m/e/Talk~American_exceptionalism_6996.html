<p>On February 18th, Stevertigo made a major series of changes to this page that, in my opinion, were completely POV. I reverted the page to before these edits took place but moved back into the article usefull information (not written by Stevertigo) about the Marxist view of this idea.</p>
<p>My problems with the edited page:</p>
<ol>
<li>The title ethnocentrism limited the concept of American exceptionalism to a racial one when it can be seen as social, cultural, and political as well</li>
<li>The use of quotes when describing American exceptionalism ideas throughout the page mocked the idea</li>
<li>The tone and content of the page was distorted to create a strong view against the concept</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd love for you to put back in some of the ideas about race/ethnicity in American exceptionalism - I myself will start that process. However, please respond on the talk page before editing. --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_S_5f20.html" title="User:Alex S">Alex S</a> 17:16, 1 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I didnt see this when it happened. I dont think the above criticisms are right or wrong, nor relevant spefic to the article as it is today, but its not typical that we write in such a passive voice that 'Stalinism' for example might seem perfectly acceptible, as long as it was in context. Thus why would an "exceptionalist" view of another kind be defended with an only self-serving interpretation of NPOV? -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">Ste</a><i><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">vertigo</a> 06:23, 16 Jul 2004 (UTC)</i></dd>

<hr />
<p>When discussing issues such as this that people often feel very strongly about, it can be easy to lose sight of what the purpose of the article should be. In my view, an article on American exceptionalism should discuss the claims of American exceptionalists and present counter-arguments, but the counter-arguments should challenge the idea that America is exceptional, not the idea that the products of the exceptionalism are desirable. The latter properly belongs in <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-American_sentiment_f3d8.html" title="Anti-American sentiment">Anti-American sentiment</a>.</p>
<p><br />
(( Um, I'm not quite sure how to put this, but America *is* exceptional. It's status as sole superpower is unique, it's economy the largest in the world, and it's society is not quite like any other. It may not be apparent why the US deviates from many global norms in so many ways (our disinterest in 'football' is minor but notable), but that it is an exception to many global 'norms' is indisputable.</p>
<p>-Rosignol@nwlink.com ))</p>
<p><br />
For instance, David Monniaux added a bit about how homosexual sex was only recently decriminalized in many U.S. states as a counter-argument to how the American system prevents a "tyranny of the majority". This example, however, actually <i>supports</i> American exceptionalism: It shows that states which held the minority view (on a national scale) that homosexual sex was a social ill were allowed to keep laws that reflected that minority view. An idea behind federalism is that if you don't like the laws in one state, you can go to a state that's more accepting of your opinions. David (and I) happen to think that these laws were prejudicial and were right to have been overturned, but the fact that they still were valid in the 21st century provides ammunition with which to criticize the social values in parts of America, but not with which to debunk American exceptionalism.</p>
<p>It may be a valid criticism of American culture that it has in general a more "backward" view of homosexuality, but it isn't fair to criticize American exceptionalism on the basis of this exogenous factor.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think the current formulation is quite good. I don't quite buy personally the argument that one may move to another state if one disagrees with the policies of one's states. After all, this was somewhat true of a large part of the world save for the closed "Communist" countries. Yet, having to relocate because of abusive, intolerant decisions from the majority is clearly a hardship. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Monniaux_7db1.html" title="User:David.Monniaux">David.Monniaux</a> 17:47, 22 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Unless credit is given to scholars like Seymour Martin Lipset for this concept this article is merely a personal essay. I agree with VeryVerily that this article needs a lot of work (see page history as of now). <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 19:59, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>VV removed a lot of text, which was flawed. However, I don't know if it's utterly unsalvageable. Perhaps someone familiar with the relevant scholarly literature can fix it up and restore it. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=American_exceptionalism&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=4587521" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=American_exceptionalism&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=4587521" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) I'd do it if I did not have to finish a couple of other articles instead. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 20:06, 12 Jul 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have restored it, and will clean it up. VeryVerily's hack job was unjustified, and his comments about it being a "personal essay" are no doubt an attack on me; rather than actually dealing with the material itself, (which apparently doesnt fit his narrow concept of what the article should be about) he has chosen the typically obtuse method of deleting material, rather than actually editing it. One would have hoped that VeryVerily might have become an editor by now. What say you VeryVerily? -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">Ste</a><i><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">vertigo</a> 06:17, 16 Jul 2004 (UTC)</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I never said it was a "personal essay", and it was not an attack on you. As for your attack on me, it just bores me. Here are a few examples from the text which are problematic:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>American exceptionalism, as an ideology, is dissectable into its components of <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_liberty.html" title="Personal liberty">personal liberty</a>, and <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expansionism.html" title="Expansionism">expansionism</a>.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Is it really? How is expansionism part of the ideology of exceptionalism? And what about ethnic nationalism? Democracy? Limited government? This reductionist approach does not look promising.-VV</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><font color="green">Verily Verily is the <a href="../../../j/i/n/Jingoist.html" title="Jingoist">jingoist</a> mascot, I have run across his ditrades in all of the controversial wikipedia pages. He erases a lot of valuable information, and then attacks the authors. Problem is he never actually ADDS anything of value to the articles. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_U.S._foreign_interventions_since_1945_23e5.html" title="List of U.S. foreign interventions since 1945">List of U.S. foreign interventions since 1945</a> (for example) He is better ignored as a troll.</font></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Did I say it was perfect? What else would you add VV, and why didnt you? This notion of "<a href="../../../l/i/m/Limited_government.html" title="Limited government">limited government</a>" is simply a propagandism; if you can write the article, and explain in logical terms how this ideology would have any material effect in the Old World that was equivalent its so-called effect on the US, then there would be something there. As it stands, you cannot extricate "limited government" from the context of "American expansionism," nor even from the alternate interpretations of what the term "limited government" really means. Would you like me to explain that to you too? Try to use less subjective terms to describe this "exceptionally" subjective term. -SV

<dd>Im sorry if the basic truths sort of shake your nuanced and glorfied image of what things are and how they came to be. The fact of the matter remains that the US to this day depends on land division and development to sustain its growing (expansionist) economy. Do you disagree? Perhaps you think it was "good old fashioned American ingenuity" that drove the show? "Victories?" Subjectivity! What does "victories" mean here? The ethnic cleansing of <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_02d7.html" title="Native Americans">Native American</a> populations were considered "victories" at the time; is that what you meat by "victories"? You bring up the role of individual choices in shaping destiny; as much as Im a true believer in the butterfly effect, one cant possibly begin to quantize such nuance, nor can they expect to bundle up all these disordered and separated decisions into a single ideological package, and not be criticised for its POV! Talk about things being temporally distant from each other?-SV

What do you know about my "glorified image" of anything? Anyway, NPOV policies say you are not entitled to use this article as a podium for your personal opinions.
<dl>
<dd>I will not argue with you either. Either you can deal with the citique point by point, or it remains invalid. NPOV does not bound us to keep articles bland, confused, conflicted or even stupid. So, if you want to write a support for the notions expressed in "exceptionalism" please do so; the article can represent both the criticism, and the support. If you support does not match my criticism, well thats no reason to delete the criticism. I agree that criticism/refutation could be separately contained, but you cant possibly be saying that observations and material facts from the last 140 years cant reshape the very way in which the article is presented. I do not intend to mock the notion; I simply intent to show that subjective terms like "personal freedom" are either in quotes, replaced with neutral terms, or put into some context - rather than just being thrown out there, expecting the reader to be Fox-News literate. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">Ste</a><i><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">vertigo</a> 19:32, 18 Jul 2004 (UTC)</i></dd>

In this case, we are dealing with two competing subjective views; "exceptionalism" versus "expansionism" Knowing what you do about human nature, which do you imagine is the more realistic and practical explanation. "Exceptionalism" which is an outdated attempt to unify a whole bunch of ideas as 'catalyzing events' that themselves fall under a general theory, or "expansionism" which simply explains that people tend to gravitate to where less hardship, more space, more food, and more easy living is.

<p>This table is bound to be debatable. It is impossible to compare ancient Egypt with colonial empires, let alone with a twentieth century state. There are no universal criteria to measure the influence of any given nation. Even the longevity itself is problematic: for most countries only the period they were a 'great power' seems to be counted. Or is it the time they felt 'exceptional?' Both criteria are quite arbitrary and need explanation. Even if the table remains in the article, something more should be said about these problems. - <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastinakel_953f.html" title="User:Pastinakel">Djadek</a> 09:41, 24 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I do not see the connection between longevity and the topic of the article. I support the deletion of the table. It is not thoroughly done, anyway, and at best at a draft stage. Robbe007, 17 Nov 2004</p>
<p>All these points are valid. A longevity table is fairly useless. However, a table of other empires that have considered themselves to be exceptional is useful. This table could just happen to list approximate dates during which the empire considered itself to be exceptional. Mat334 07:15, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I disagree. It is part of the concept of a nation that it is exceptional in comparison with other nations. Otherwise there would be no purpose in having any at all. Additionally, the table contains false facts, such as the duration of the "French kingdom" (see <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>). Also, it implies completeness but omits important nations. While interesting by itself, I think that the table does not help understanding the concept of American Exceptionalism. robbe 14:58, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>If what you say is true, that "it is part of the concept of a nation that it is exceptional in comparison with other nations", then this table is useful. The table is relevant to the argument against American exceptionalism. It supports the idea that America is not exceptional by showing that there are other empires that have considered themselves to be exceptional. Because Wikipedia is NPOV we need to include all points of view. This table supports a particular point of view and so we should keep it. Just because has factual inaccuracies or is incomplete does not mean that we should delete it. If that were the case then half of Wikipedia would be deleted. No, instead we need to verify the table and expand it. Therefore keep the table. Mat334 17:02, 21 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I decided to be bold and remove it. After all, it has been months since my first comment on this issue, and most of those who reacted agreed it should be removed.</p>
<p>Mat334: It is not because I disagree with the point the table tries to make that I want it to be removed; on the contrary, personally I agree with you that the United States are not <i>that</i> exceptional. But still, it's a nonsensical table, unfitting for an encyclopedia, for several reasons.</p>
<p>1 It is impossible to compare the influence of old civilizations like Rome and Egypt with European colonial powers or with modern states. Even if you try to do this, it would be very arbitrary and you would need an explanation far too long to put it in a table like this.</p>
<p>2 The same is true for exceptionalism: you can't measure it, so putting it in a table is misleading.</p>
<p>3 Then there is the point of the longevity. One would say this must be measurable - but as others stated above, it is hard to determine the start and the end for an empire. Is the kingdom of the Franks the same nation that conquered Egypt centuries later? I don't think you can say that, but others will disagree. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPastinakel_953f.html" title="User:Pastinakel">Pastinakel</a> 12:07, 9 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>One of the devastating facts about Americans is their denial of the unkind and injust treatment of people that historically EuroAmericans believe inferior. This nation has a black spot on its soul for the genocide and encampment of the surviving Native Americans. The manifest destiny arose long ago because of the ignorance, sinful nature, greed, and lack of conscious of the white man. From generation to generation, the sons gleefully took their inheritances of their fathers, secured by stealing, exploiting, killing, enslaving, and the sweat of people of color. Whites ignored God's commandments they are arrogant and think that their actions are above the sins of other men It is easy for them to justify their actions because of the false belief that they are superior. Indians were human when Columbus stumbled upon the West Indies. Yet, He and his fellowmen were too prejudice and evil to acknowledge it. (The land was occupied by humans whose culture, language, and ethnicity was different. They were human). The barbarians were the Europeans who had no regard for the lives of others, so they massacred, tortured, and stole the resources and land from a gentle people. Man's Christianity was not the Truth, and differed from God's Word or Christian faith. Ironically, the Indians were held as inhuman, but the Church demanded that the Indians convert. Today, the average white man still believes he is superior to people of color. They also still believe that the world evolves around them, rather than accept that they too on earth for a short time along with all other people. They are still ignorant, frightened of men of color, and will still exploit others. What is lacking in their souls is compassion, love, and concern for all humankind. Just live among them as a person of a beautiful golden brown complexion and learn the degree of hate, hostility, and superiority that they possess. They will not accept the faults of their forefathers or apologize for the grave sins of the forefathers. The assets are acceptable but not the liabilities.</p>

<p>lets be concise. Discuss american exceptionalism as an ideal. Next offer the opposing POV which should be that america is NOT , in fact, exceptional by this criteria. History can be offered but not to advance a narrative of america as good or bad. The history should describe what the ideal first was, and what it has evolved to be. Do not lose sight of the topic. Do not lose sight of what the pro and con positions are (re-read first sentences). Keep it in scope.</p>

<dd>If "the white man" was evil (or other generalised sentiments), then I second the reminder that it was the British who abolished slavery first and conduced others to do so (the first time this was done by a major power in world history). Read up on the history of the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Navy_80f7.html" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navys</a> west Africa squadron and the existance of <a href="../../../s/i/e/Sierra_Leone_8171.html" title="Sierra Leone">Sierra Leone</a>.

Read up on the US wages wars in the article on <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Removal_9d32.html" title="Indian Removal">Indian Removal</a>. One of the reasons for the US war of independence was the so-called <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intolerable_Acts_09ce.html" title="Intolerable Acts">Intolerable Acts</a>, including the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Proclamation_of_1763_c917.html" title="Royal Proclamation of 1763">Royal Proclamation of 1763</a> which sought to limit incursions into American Indian territory. "US patriots" were more interested in a land grab than and high ideal principles, the sort that are trumpeted nowadays as the things that make the US special and great. Perhaps if Americans were fed a more balanced and historically accurate version of their own history they would realise that they are no more special than anyone else. The sooner they understand this the better, as it will make their transition from a world power to being the number 2 (or lower order) in the world pecking order (to China, India et al) much easier to swallow as that happens over the next 50 - 100 years. I do not have much hope - you only have to look at the American election system to see that Americans live more by b/s marketing style "facts" over reasoned argument.</dd>

They were put in simply because Britain did not have the resources to fight more wars with the Indians. The reason they were intolerable is because many of the colonists did not have the resources to live without expanding west, whether it was good for the natives or not.</dd>

<p>No, that's more of a Wilsonian thing (a particular variety of American political thought) than an American Exceptionalism thing.</p>
<p>As a clumsy way of illustrating the difference: Wilsonian idealism would inspire Americans to think the middle east needs Democracy... American Exceptionalism is what causes Americans to think the US is capable of establishng that Democracy.</p>
<p>They are related, but not the same thing.</p>

<p>My thesis: American exceptionalism really exists, even today, but probably to a somewhat lesser extent than years ago, although it is hard to tell it at times in the conduct of American foreign policy. There are relatively few Americans today (although they certainly exist) who still attempt to justify slavery, the treatment of Native Americans at the hands of settlers, or even the World War II internment of Japanese-Americans, and it is arguable that all of the above discredit the idea of America being exceptional, but probably not entirely. It still seems that after all of the edit wars that the article is still basically a fairly Marxist POV. While the Marxist critique of American exceptionalism belongs in the article, along with other critiques, this should not provide the underlying framework, but seemingly now it still does. It looks like after all of the sound and fury that everyone gave up, which is unfortunate, as apparently lots of heat got generated, but little light, and Wikipeida is saddled with a long-lasting article that is seriously POV.

<dd>A big reason why the article is currently garbage is because it contains no source citations. Without citations, any controversial topic on Wikipedia turns into an amateurish, opinion piece tug-of-war. Until someone gets serious about enforcing that policy, which is a lot of work, then there's probably little hope for the article.

<p>The word has two related meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li>One meaning is "different" or "unique", obviously derived from "exception".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The other meaning is similar to "excellent".</li>
</ul>
<p>The US is certainly unique in many respects; but I don't think that the US is unique in being unique. All nations have their foibles and follies; the US is no different. &#160;:) Of course, being a superpower causes the pecularities of the US to be magnified and more likely noticed than those of say, Greece.</p>
<p>As far as excellence goes? Depends on to whom you speak; and in what way. The US is obviously a military and economic superpower; its citizens enjoy a rather good standard of living; and many seek to emigrate here. OTOH, there are many things to criticize; some of them are moral outrages which should offend any human being; others are essentially matters of taste (for example, I don't believe the diminished stature of soccer in the US is indicative of anything substantial)</p>
<p>The article, and this discussion, often use the above two meanings in a schizophrenic fashion.<br /></p>
<p>==<br />
Both definitions of the word prove that the idea of exceptionalism is nothing more than the product of an ego-centric worldview. The first meaning of the word applies to any country, and one of the distinghuising parameters (such as size in population or "power") does not augment the other parameters, so the US is in no way more unique than any other country because of its "superpower" status. In the technical sense, where one can define "uniqueness" as the distance between countries in the complete parameter space, there are ones that must be taken as very unique (that are far apart from the mass center of the distribution), because of very specific ethnological and cultural features (for instance some almost vanished african tribes). Most certainly, the US is much closer to many other (mainly called "western") countries in this parameter space and therefore closer to the mass center and hence, less "unique".</p>
<p>The second meaning of the word is dependant on cultural and ideologic background, of what one sees as advantageous or "good things". A strong economy or military power are parameters that are not universally regarded as being "good things". In the kapitalist framework, economy might be imnportant, but there exist other ideologies in which economy is no (or a much less important) parameter. Moreover, one cannot discuss "a good standard of living" without first defining a value system wherein to compare "standards of living". And since the American value system is not universal (seriously!) the whole second meaning of the word 'exceptionalism' is rendered meaningless.</p>

<dd>I have to agree with the idea that exceptional doesn't necessarily mean better than, it just means different. And the US is different from most other developed nations in the world in a whole host of things. If you compare public attitudes in the US and Europe on the role of the state, capitalism, religiosity, etc. the differences are night and day Mattm1138 20:17, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nonsense "differences are night and day". Clearly the person who wrote that comment hasn't travelled much around the world. Political opinion is very varied in North America and in Western Europe. The weightings of the various left/right opinions may be subtly different, and those may be excentuated by different political systems (including the US system which ingrains partisanship). But there is an immense more in common between the peoples of both areas than, say other peoples. Those two areas account for (as a rough guess) a quarter of world population. How about comparing ideals of democracy and human rights that Europeans and Americans broadly share with another quarter of the world population, in the PR China. That might be more worthy of a "night and day" generalisation. But then again, maybe not, because no-one has asked the Chinese for their political opinions of late. I suggest poor generalisations resulting from poor geographical, cultural and factual awareness are taken with a bucketfull of salt.</dd>

<p>This article just talks about American Exceptionalism as if it were just a continuation of Manifest Destiny theory; they're not at all the same. They mean completely different things; this article needs to be rewritten from scratch, and perhaps Manifest Destiny is foreigners' best way of understanding it, which is, perhaps, why it's viewed as a form of ethnocentrism; that's not at all what it is.

<p>Wouldn't this article benefit a lot from a confrontation with other national "exceptionalisms"?

<p>There were a few very good NPOV points made in the otherwise rambling tangential un-neutral POV first section. Deleting it entirely was bad because those points would disappear. Keeping it in as-is was bad too because of its POV, so it just seemed to sit there and stink up the article for a long time. I reworked the neutral points that section made into a (hopefully) much more NPOV section that incorporates other parts of the article. Most of that section was deleted and I justified each deletion in my edit summaries.</p>
<p>The entire article still has problems...like some repetition with for/against arguments in the history section and (more importantly maybe) a lack of expert opinions or references to them, but as long as NPOV is maintained, I hope knowledgeable folks (who can keep in check the axe they want to grind) will come here with their footnotes eventually and make the thing better.

<p>The United States of America is nicknamed by some as the "Land of Opportunity". It has traditionally had less rigid social classes than other nations, and has no system of <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobility.html" title="Nobility">nobility</a>.

<p>A common claim is that the United States is unique in that it has from its founding guaranteed political <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_rights.html" title="Civil rights">civil rights</a> to its citizens – such as <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_speech.html" title="Freedom of speech">freedom of speech</a>, the <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right_to_vote.html" title="Right to vote">right to vote</a>, and the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Presumption_of_innocence.html" title="Presumption of innocence">presumption of innocence</a>, and that respect for these rights is a uniquely strong component of American political culture. Critics of this position argue that these rights mostly came from England and diffused into all countries under English, and later British, influence: they never were distinct to the US - the US merely consolidated these rights into a single source document which highlighted their prominence. Indeed it can be argued that the practical application of certain civil and political rights in the US lagged other western democracies, and it is argued that there is no US constitutional right to vote even today - see <a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffrage_today.html" title="Suffrage today">suffrage today</a>.</p>

<p>The entry states, "The mythology of American culture is inextricably linked to its government because the culture lacks the experience of other governmental forms."</p>
<p>That's simply inaccurate. The fact is that America is comprised of individuals from every country around the globe, who collectively have experience with every form of government that exists. The vast majority of Americans (with exception, of course) are descended from immigrants who chose America. The fact that people around the world continue to pour into America, legally or illegally, shows there is some distinctive quality about America that those people desire above other countries of choice. Every immigrant, current or ancestoral, came to America with their experiences of other forms of government. That collective sharing of why we each came to America continues to shape the way Americans mold their government. America is the first and most experienced country whose government is continually crafted by the people, who bring to the table their collective awareness of what works and does not work best in forms of government.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.223.156.223 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.223.156.223_5fe8.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.223.156.223">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>I've remove that whole section. As noted, it is inaccurate. It is also an argument, not an encyclopediac description of an argument, and to my knowledge it is not frequent/notable argument worth documenting. The <i>nature</i> of American government, that whole "conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal", is an often cited source of national identity and exceptionalism, but that is much different than mere longevity. And as another problem... um, the experience of living under another form of government, namely a monarchal tyranny, was fundamental to the people who wrote, voted for, and adopted the Bill of Rights based on that experience. <a href="../../../1/7/1/User%7E171.159.64.10.html" title="User:171.159.64.10">171.159.64.10</a> 01:37, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is horribly biased in every way. "Some loosely use the term to indicate a moral superiority of Americans, while others use it to refer to the American concept as itself an exceptional ideal, which may or may not always be upheld by the actual people and government of the nation." This is shocking for a site that prides itself on NPOV. In fact, seeing the higher crime rates etc, statistical evidence shows that, in fact, the opposite is far more likely. It also has a horrible redirect. I typed in Americentrism, as in Eurocentrism (the historical practice of seeing the world through Europe) and it directs me to American exceptionalsim. "Some charge that anti-Americanism stems from jealousy" This cannot be father from the truth. True, America has problems as all other countries do, but this article, it's shocking. I assure you, Australia, or, say, Sweden are as, if not more, culturally exceptional as America, as there is no 'norm' that can be referred to. If this article is not rectified soon, I will be nominating it for deletion.<a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECyp43r_feff.html" title="User:Cyp43r">Cyp43r</a> 12:06, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And your nomination will be speedily dismissed. The point is not to say that America is in fact exceptional, by either the definitions of "unique/unusual" or "excellent", but to note that there is a strain in our (i.e. American) tradition that <i>believes</i> we are exceptional (both meanings). Obviously this is not the only way Americans look at ourselves, but it is undeniably part of it and has been since before we were an independent nation. If anything, I think the article should do a better job of noting that the phrase "American exceptionalism" is at times ambivalent or even negative, even when used by Americans among ourselves. It sounds like you have mistaken the point of the article; it isn't biased (much), it is discussing a notable existing bias. <a href="../../../1/7/1/User%7E171.159.64.10.html" title="User:171.159.64.10">171.159.64.10</a> 03:09, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are right, the article definitely needs to cite counter arguments. Actually, there are two issues: 1) there are compelling factual arguments against the assertion that America is in fact exceptional (other than in the sense that many nations have their quirks; Swiss multi-ethnic and -lingual democracy, French fondness for cheese, etc.) 2) there are compelling moral arguments against asserting American exceptionalism. Among the article's external links, <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19960301fareviewessay4193/michael-lind/the-american-creed-does-it-matter-should-it-change.html" class="external text" title="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19960301fareviewessay4193/michael-lind/the-american-creed-does-it-matter-should-it-change.html" rel="nofollow">"The American Creed"</a> is a very good short look at a value-neutral assertion of American exceptionalism and at the same time excellent arguments against it.

He actually holds up a laudable goal to have an American foreign policy with only two modes of operation, "ignore" and "kill".

<p>Late last year, this article included counterarguments and it used to be more NPOV. However, it has never contained referenced statments, so "weasel-words" were required due to a lack of support for the statements made. That meant that anyone could remove statements they didn't like based on weasel-word or lack-of-support issues, and anyone else could include statements they did like based on the fact that the rest of the article was just as unsupported as their contribution. Hopefully, someone who can remain neutral will take the time to rewrite this article <b>based on more sourced material</b>. Until then, some people with agendas will keep altering this article for better, but mostly for worse, and other people with agendas will be here on the talk page being upset about it. I would support some kind of symbolic nomination for deletion if the person proposing the deletion were willing to spend hours (or days) writing a completely new article from scratch that is worthy of an encyclopedia. But the idea that Wikipedia should not have any article on this important topic is just plain wrong. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 12:40, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

"Proponents of American exceptionalism often claim that the "American spirit" or the "American identity" was created at the frontier (following Frederick Jackson Turner's Frontier Thesis), where rugged and untamed conditions gave birth to American national vitality. Other nations that had long frontiers--such as Russia, Canada and Australia, did not allow individualistic pioneers to settle there, and did not experience the same psychological and cultural impact." What exactly is this saying? Russia, Canada, and Australia all had individualistic pioneers, and all of them had profound psychological and cultural impacts on their respective cultural psyches. Russians portray themselves as tough individuals that prevail against the odds, Canadians portray themselves as unique, fightin against the elements and Australians portray themselves as lost in a tough environment. How exactly is this article not biased? <a href="../../../c/y/p/User%7ECyp43r_feff.html" title="User:Cyp43r">Cyp43r</a> 16:15, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have to imagine some weirdo coming to this page and actually thinking "Oh, sure, Canada had pioneers, but those Canadians didn't <b>permit</b> <i>individualistic</i> pioneers like America did!" and then you just have to laugh at that weirdo and remove his garbage if you care enough about it. Personally, I think overt garbage in an article is an indication that the article needs a huge rewrite because it's been so bad for so long that most casual editors have given up. If you are arguing that this article is poor, then I agree. It used to be better. But it was never anywhere close to being good. The cleanup tag is appropriate. However, if you are arguing for Wikipedia to have no article on American Exceptionalism then I disagree. If you care enough about the bias, remove the bias and try to write an NPOV article about this topic. If it's done well with references, people will come here and defend it. If it's not done well or doesn't have references then the article will just get junked up again. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlying_Jazz_a2b8.html" title="User:Flying Jazz">Flying Jazz</a> 02:32, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>American exceptionalism is a term that is widely claimed to have been coined by or used by Alexis de Tocqueville, but I have found no evidence to indicate that de Tocqueville ever used the words in any English translation of Democracy In America. Is there a single sentence that can be reliably sourced in which de Tocqueville used these words? Beyond any doubt, de Tocqueville dealt with the notions that underpin our modern understanding of American exceptionalism, but only rarely did he use the word exceptional and insofar as I can determine, he never used the word exceptionalism. --<a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELooper5920_0b5b.html" title="User:Looper5920">Looper5920</a> 10:53, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>"Americans are far more religious than Europeans, for example, and more likely to actively engage in politics. Repeated surveys also show that Americans are more likely to agree that 'with hard work, one can get ahead'. The concept is thus presented not as expression of ideals, but as a set of measurable political facts."

<p>How can an entire article on American Exceptionalism fail to mention the rebuilding of Europe and Japan after WWII? Contrast with the punitive peace terms imposed by the victorious European powers after WWI, that virtually guaranteed further conflict. America has a history of defeating tyranny and instituting stable democracies in their place. Does history record anyone, other than America, behaving this way?

<dd>The Marshall Plan was important for rebuilding Europe. But it was carried out not only to recover Europe as it was spend only to US-oriented states in Europe and was also given for the reason to (re-)establish Europe as a market for US-Goods.</dd>

<p>The belief in American Exceptionalism is an historical (as well as current) fact... an ideological reality, which is NOT held by those who are "anti-american." Just ask yourself, "Why would anyone who is 'anti-american' claim that we are exceptional?" This is a belief held by Americans since the Puritans and even today, but they have simply changed the terms.</p>

<p>I came across this article in general reading but found parts of the introduction to contain information that doesn't keep to Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy so have removed the following from the introduction: "Most foreigners are not familiar with the uniqueness of the United States and have no sole knowlegde about the contributions of this nation to the world. Clearly, America has won both World Wars, single handedly defeated the Nazi and Soviet regimes and freed hundreds of millions of people from dictatorships. It funds the UN so that it can exist; however, the USA does not receive much in return.". The first statement appears to be a huge generalisation especially when this cannot be backed up by sources. Yes America has made a big impact over the 20th Century but it would be incorrect to say she has "single handedly defeated the Nazi and Soviet regimes" especially when taking into account the roles played by the various nations involved. Maybe if this is a general opionion a group of people hold within America it should be stated as being this later in the article rather than pure fact in the introduction?</p>

<p>When used in an academic social sciences context, any notion of Manifest Destiny is absent. Since Tocqueville was the originator of the phrase, I doubt that he would have considered it in such terms. Still, I don't preclude its use as such. Just please note that the phrase can be used when describing the vast differences the US government has when viewed against the rest of the world, for example.

<p>As I read through this article, it strikes me that there are many moments in which the definitions of American exceptionalism (and there are many attempts to define it throughout) are actually claims about what is exceptional about America. For instance, take the following sentence from the second paragraph:</p>
<p>"American exceptionalism is the idea that the United States and the American people hold a special place in the world, by offering opportunity and hope for humanity, derived from a unique balance of public and private interests governed by constitutional ideals that are focused on personal and economic freedom."</p>
<p>This sentence contains several claims: 1) That America is unique because it offers "opportunity and hope" to humanity, 2) that it is unique because of the way it balances "public and private interests", and 3) because its constitution is based on notions of "personal and economic freedom." So in one sentence we have three different claims about what may be unique about the US. All of these may or may not have been ways in which people in the United States thought that they or their nation were exceptional but none of them are good definitions for "American Exceptionalism."</p>
<p>My goal though is not to take apart all these claims, but to point out that if this entry is going to improve people need to stop trying to link the definition of American Exceptionalism with claims about what they think makes it exceptional.</p>
<p>American Exceptionalism after all is a term invented by contemporary critics and historians to refer to a pattern of claims that have been made over the entire history of the United States about what makes the United States exceptional. First and foremost, then, it is a category of anlaysis of relatively recent invention. I don't believe (but I could be wrong) that Toqueville ever used the precise phrase "American Exceptionalism." Rather, he claimed that America was exceptional for a variety of reasons. His work is therefore probably best seen as one of the earliest and most important works that claims that the U.S. was exceptoinal.</p>
<p>If this article is to be improved I think it needs to be reorganized with the idea that "American Exeptionalism" is a term of art, a category of analysis, that has been used by writers to describe patterns in a voluminous literature claiming that America is unique.</p>
<p>Let me suggest the following definition:</p>
<p>"American Exceptionalism refers to the idea that the United States was unique in comparison with "Old Europe" and that it would pursue a different path in history than the European nations.</p>
<p>This is I believe close to an objective statement. Whether or not you think the idea that the US would pursue a different path is true or good or bad, is irrelevant. The fact is that this is what American Exceptionalism refers to. What do others think? If this is an acceptable definition, why not scrap the existing article and rebuild the entry in the manner of a carefully structure encylopedia like article beginning with this definition? -- Ezmiller77 011:56, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good afternoon. I am writing to express my opnion in the matter of structural layout of this article. It has been brough to my attention that a topic on Socialism in the US should be included in the article. A couple of users have stated that it is "much needed". This has been discussed at length at the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Talk%7ESocialism_66a9.html" title="Talk:Socialism">Socialism talk page</a>. I think the section should mention the fact that Socialism was growing in pouplarity within the US in the late 19th century and abruptly ceased to be a major force in American politics right around the Wilson years. The section could mention the activities and political supression of figures such as Eugene Debs and present existing theories on why socialism never became an influencial movement in the US. How exactly this could be done with neutrality, I am not too sure, but I think it should be discussed. Let me know what you think. -- <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishEfternamn_7051.html" title="User:EnglishEfternamn"><font face="Times New Roman" color="darkblue"><b><i>EnglishEfternamn</i></b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../e/n/g/User_talk%7EEnglishEfternamn_2fa1.html" title="User talk:EnglishEfternamn"><font face="Times New Roman" color="darkblue"><b><i>talk</i></b></font></a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_EnglishEfternamn_01d9.html" title="Special:Contributions/EnglishEfternamn"><font face="Tahoma, helvetica" color="lightblue"><b><i>contribs</i></b></font></a></sub> 20:55, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
