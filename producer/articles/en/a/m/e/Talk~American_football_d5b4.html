<p>What is everyone's opinion on making an article just for positions in football, break it down by offense, defense, and special teams. Also have diagrams and maybe even discuss players that are in the hall of fame for certain positions. --<a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStang281_01b5.html" title="User:Stang281">Stang281</a> 21:58, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>good idea...I long for a good reference to point to any time I hear some barely intelligeble comment from someone about 'such-and-such player needs to blah-blah-blah', like "Roy Williams needs to pick his big ugly head up and learn to play some pass coverage." Last I checked Strong Safety is primarily a hard-hitter focused less on pass coverage than he is on the run defense. But I could be wrong and there is much evidence to suggest that I am. A problem that may arise when defining 'roles' for positions is the fact that said roles will vary depending on the coaches/ coordinators scheme or philosophy. It will also vary depending on the abilities and temperament of the player. Also, a player's "role" may change abrubptly despite a coaches philosophy, say for instance, if another key player is injured. His role might change to fill a gap. Trying to define clearly and relatively simply a certain positions 'role' may in fact end up turing into an endless list of "what-if" suppositions, and what started out as a virtuous endevour will become mired in debate between half-knowledgable super-fans and forgotten ex-varsity heroes. Or maybe it should be a more marginalized description, leaving out the minority exceptions. But such a thing would hardly be worth the effort. Also, who would the experts be to define the positions?--micah</p>
<p><br />
I personally think that this would be a good Idea!! It would give people an extention and learn more in-depth abot this sport, if they wish.</p>

<li>The NFL is one form of American football. College football is another. High school football is another.

<p>Correct, but instead of saying John Smith is a CFL player or a Penn State player or an Eagles player, it's better to say John Smith is an American football player who PLAYS for the CFL's Argonauts. Rules variances or no, it's still American football. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmy_Mac_4255.html" title="User:Jimmy Mac">Jimmy Mac</a> 10:44, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Are you saying that the average Russian wouldn't know who the Argonauts are just from their nickname?&#160;:) However, saying <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Smith_3332.html" title="John Smith">John Smith</a> is an <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a> player with the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia_Eagles_04d3.html" title="Philadelphia Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Football_League_dcce.html" title="National Football League">National Football League</a> might get a bit wordy. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 11:07, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Contemporary football players are larger than their predecessors of only 30 or 40 years ago. It is quite normal, for instance, for all the members of the offensive line of a major college or professional team to weigh more than 300 pounds (136 kg.), whereas in the 1960s linemen who weighed only 270 pounds were common."</p>
<p>If that were the case - Steroids being the cause for size increase - nearly anybody could play football and scouting NFL players wouldn't be a multi-million dollor trade. Players from the previous generations where steroids were legal cannot be considered relevant to players in professional leagues today. Furthermore the knowledge of nutrition was terrible in the 1960's and is no way comparable to the knowledge of nutrition and excersise today. I will request that section to be removed or re-written.</p>

<li>I was going to try, after reading the entire "beyond entertainment and recreation" section all I could do is roll my eyes at all the false and biased information there, when writing pages like this its best to keep in mind that with the growing international interest in football many people who know nothing about the sport will come here to learn, they don't care about the so called debate of academics vs athletics in american colleges, and there is no steroid controversy in football, thats baseball. Wether or not steroids are widely used, or have ever been widely used in the NFL is unknown, speculation. Currently 300+ pound O-linemen and DT's are not gigantic dianabol muscle-men, they are fat, it is their mix of muscle and fat that make them weigh as much as they do, I am 6'0, 230 lbs - i've never touched a steroid. Whoever wrote that section sounds like a 130 pound nerd who's mad that he had to pay to park in highschool so the football team he hated could have equiptment.

<p>An anonymous user from the Netherlands reverted my previous changes, so I thought I would provide my rationale for them here, giving him or her a chance to defend the revert.</p>
<p>1. The sentence:</p>
<p><i>"The ball can be advanced by carrying the ball, throwing it, or a lateral handoff, from one teammate to the other"</i></p>
<p>is gramatically inconsistent. "Carrying" and "throwing" are <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerund.html" title="Gerund">gerunds</a>, so the third thing in the list should be as well.</p>
<p>2 The sentence:</p>
<p><i>"Points can be scored in a variety of ways, including carrying the ball over the goal line, throwing the ball to another player past the goal line (known as a forward pass) or even kicking the ball held by another player on the ground through the goalposts (also known as uprights), which is also called a field goal. The team with more points when time has expired wins."</i></p>
<p>is problematic in several respects. First, a "forward pass" is any pass thrown forward, not just one into the end zone. Secondly, there is no reason for the word "even" there, since it's hardly a surprise. Third, the part of the sentence about kicking is too long and confusing; a link to "placekicking" is preferable. Four, "uprights" are just the sides of the goalposts. Finally, the last sentence should be in the present simple to match the rest of the section.</p>
<p>3. <i>"Outside of the United States, the sport is referred to as American football, ameriball, or sometimes 'Grid-iron' to differentiate it from the more familiar <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_football.html" title="Rugby football">rugby football</a> and the very different game called <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">football</a> which dominates around the rest of the world."</i></p>
<p>Canadians don't call it "American football." (If they needed to differentiate American football from its Canadian counterpart, they would say "NFL football" or "NCAA football" or whatever.) "Ameriball" has only about 120 Google hits. Rugby is only more familiar in countries that play rugby. Finally, soccer does not dominate in the entire rest of the world. It's not that popular in India, for example.</p>
<p>Unless our friend in Holland can argue why my edit is unnecessary, I will unrevert it. <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 19:04, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>'English-speaking countries' is redundant. For one, only in two (I believe) of those countries is it referred to in that way, Australia and New Zealand. Secondly, non-English speaking countries don't call it 'American football' anyway, for example the French call it 'football américain'. It is never called 'grid-iron' in most English-speaking countries, the way you had worded it made it seem otherwise.</p>
<p>As for ameriball, just because YOU haven't heard of it referred to in that way doesn't mean it is 'nonsense'. The simple reason why it doesn't come up with many Google hits is because the type of people who refer to American football in that way are the type of people who don't talk about it often. In my experience, it is fairly well-known.</p>

<dd>I travelled around a bit much in the military and I am an avid football fan. I never once heard it referred to as Grid-Iron - even among the Aussie Navy that I worked with. The Royal British Marines called it "American Football" when being polite, but normally called it "Footican" to be rude. In rare cases, "American Football" was shortened to "Ameriball". However, those who liked to shorten it like that would actually say "merb'l" (like gerbil) as a 1.5 syllabel word, not "A-mer-i-ball". However, I'm sure it is called everything from "yankball" to "that stupid sport they play over in the U.S.", but that doesn't mean we have to include every nickname for the sport in the article. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKainaw_88a4.html" title="User:Kainaw">Kainaw</a> 19:41, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Both edits are good. Far too much of this article is wasted translating measurements. Nobody cares that a yard is three feet when playing football. The point is that you need to move 10 of them to get a first down - regardless of how many feet or meters a yard is. Also, there is an NFL article for NFL rules and strategies. Too much of it gets added to this article. --<a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKainaw_88a4.html" title="User:Kainaw">Kainaw</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../k/a/i/User_talk%7EKainaw_1209.html" title="User talk:Kainaw">(talk)</a></sup></small> 23:25, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why all the references to rugby? I know even less about the sport of rugby than I do football, so to say certain elements are similar to rugby means nothing to me. If you're looking to slim down the article, how about killing the rugby references? While we're at it, you could kill the Canadian football references, too, since the article is about American football. Make a separate article about Canadian football. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 69.134.201.222 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.134.201.222_cac3.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.134.201.222">contribs</a>) 3 January 2006.</small></p>

<ol>
<li>Should we really list some common penalties in the Penalties section? I suppose it would be helpful for people to know about them, but we list them before we even list the positions. Should we put the list in a separate article?</li>
<li>The positions section has gotten really complicated. Do we need to metion the difference between a flanker and split end? Most fans don't even know the difference. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 00:03, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My thoughts:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Yep, definitely. Watch a football game for a quarter, and you're definitely going to see several of the yellow flags. We've got to tell people about them. I wouldn't argue with the section being moved down, though.</li>
<li>I think we should mention the difference. The rarity of knowledge has little correlation with its value. It's an article about American football, and as such we should have a bunch of information about it. Why <i>not</i> make the article as full as it can be? (I know that you're just using that as an example, but so am I.

<p>Yes, it's true. Look up McGill University here on Wikipedia and the article makes a reference to it. Sorry.</p>

<dd>Well, one could argue that Canadian Football is known as Football in Canada and is very similar to American Football. Some of the crucial innovations that distinguish American and Canadian Football from other football codes, like rugby and soccer (both of which were played in North America) were indeed invented at McGill. Some others were invented when Canadians and Americans got together to play each other.</dd>

<dd>I don't think the term "American" necessarily means "from the United States" as it's sometimes thought. North and South America are continents, so the people on them are [North or South] Americans.

<p>Usually Mexico is considered part of latin America, even though technically its North American.

<p>Little is said of referees/umpires/line judges, the distinctions between them, their duties and placement on the field, except occasionally in passing. It would be good to solidify that a bit.

<dd>It's great (and a great idea), with a few issues:
<ul>
<li>You only have five offensive players on the line of scrimmage. The tight end and the wide receiver on the opposite side of the field must be on the line.</li>
<li>The fullback plays in front of the halfback, not behind him.</li>
<li>The tight end usually plays on the right side.</li>
<li>The position of the running backs is a bit strange. I would put them in a straight I formation.</li>
<li>The wide receivers and cornerbacks seem to be a bit close to the middle of the field.</li>
<li>You might want to consider using X's for defense and O's for offense (and a square for the center), which is how plays are typically represented.</li>
<li>It looks like the word "Outside" on the left outside linebacker refers to the left defensive end.</li>

<p>Semantically I have no idea why the "full"back lines up in front of (in the I at least) the "half"back (which may be why the more generic term "running back" was formulated), but tactically it's because the fullback is a blocking back and the halfback is a ball carrier (main functions).--Buckboard 22:16, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not trying to nitpick, the image is a very good idea. It is still an illegal formation however. There are only 6 men on the line of scrimmage. In order to correct this, move the "left" wide reciver onto the line of scrimmage (this makes him the SPLIT END, which is the official name).. the "right" wide reciever is positioned correctly.. (off the line of scrimmage, which makes him a FLANKER, the official name)</p>
<p>I think it's a great idea though, great thinking. Just figured it should be 100% accurate. FYI, the reciever on the tight end side in your formation can be lined up on the line of scrimmage.. HOWEVER, that makes the tight end an ineligable receiver, (and actually makes the left tackle eligible, or LT actually BECOMES the tight end) So you would have on the line of scrimmage from left to right: Split end (WR), Tight End (TE), Left guard(LG), Center (C), Right Guard (RG), Right Tackle (RT), Tight End ineligable (TE) serving as an ADDITIONAL right tackle &lt;---this is a formation that is irregular, but is used particularly in a "trick play" type of situation. Complex and should be avoided obviously for this article, but thought I'd mention it.</p>
<p>To keep it simple in your formation, technically called an "I-split right" ("I" Formation, split recivers, Tight end Right), just move the left wide receiver up on the line of scrimmage (again, making him the split end) making the right wide reciever the flanker.&lt;--- the flanker becomes the wide reciever that can go into motion before the snap if designed Cowboy357 16:29, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Since we're nitpicking, you may want to designate what kind of offense or defense we're looking at. For intance what we see is the "typical" 4-3 defense [which is becoming less and less typical], and the offense is variation of the, once again, "typical" I-formation. As a general diagram for listing the player positions it works great, though it could be noted that positioning or "formations" often do vary somewhat drastically. Or maybe I'm picking too many nits.--micah</p>

<p>Until recently, the article began "American football, known in the United States and Canada simply as 'football'". Some misguided person changed that to just "United States" with the HTML comment viewable in the source that "the word 'football' in Canada means Canadian football", which simply isn't true. I am Canadian, and when my friends and I talk about "football", we usually mean the NFL. We don't qualify it at all. The NFL is more popular than the CFL in Canada. If you don't believe me, refer to the Association for Canadian Studies survey (<a href="http://www.acs-aec.ca/Polls/Poll17.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.acs-aec.ca/Polls/Poll17.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF file</a>). If I were talking about Canadian football it would be clear from context; we don't qualify it either way.

We are tEXANS. We like things bigger and harder, and therefore, yes, we like football more than you. Okay, I can't back that up besides with personal anecdotal info. Lived in more than one state and football is king here. But who cares? It's not factual or even that interesting unless you're from Texas...or if you just moved here and are put off by our fanaticisms. The truth of the matter is [probably] that we don't like football more than anywhere else, only that we like football more than other sports, and therefore place more emphasis on it, whereas a yankee from Arkansas mayhap enjoy baseball, knitting, curling, and football equally. While I, being from Texas, consider him a lesser being, it's not necassarily true that I like football more than he/she.--micah</p>

<dd>I have partially reverted your elimination for now. With the exception of the ever-growing selection of states, there is nothing controversial about the paragraph. It would seem pedantic to cite official attendance figures here. Regarding the part about the impact of football and smalltown culture, this is not something you'll find studied scientifically, but it again is a no-brainer to anyone who has lived in a Midwestern factory town, for example. What should we do -- cite <i><a href="../../../f/r/i/Friday_Night_Lights_b557.html" title="Friday Night Lights">Friday Night Lights</a></i>? I'm a big supporter of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> enforcement, but this is not the kind of thing that, IMO, requires a citation, since it is not really arguable.

<dd>Moving <b>South Carolina</b> there would be stupid as "South Carolina" is never referred to as just "Carolina".

<dd>OK - then it should be Carolinas (South). North and South Carolina are often referred to as the Carolinas. My point is that this move is not being done to make the article easier to find. I'm simply not sure <i>why</i> it is being done. As an American, I type Football in the search and I get a disambiguation page that points me to American Football. If it pointed me to Football (America), that would be confusion. Football (American) would be less confusing, but silly looking - just as silly as Carolinas (South). --<a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKainaw_88a4.html" title="User:Kainaw">Kainaw</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../k/a/i/User_talk%7EKainaw_1209.html" title="User talk:Kainaw">(talk)</a></sup></small> 00:12, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<p><a href="../../../m/c/g/McGill_University_08fe.html" title="McGill University">McGill University</a> athletes, who had learned rugby from the local <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_7e21.html" title="British Army">British Army</a> garrison, introduced the sport to the U.S. with a game against <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> in 1874. The game quickly spread to other <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a> colleges.</p>
<p>Encouraged by <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a>'s Walter Camp, the schools began to adopt rules that would differentiate American football from rugby in the 1880s. The scrimmage was introduced in 1880 and the system of downs in 1882.</p>
<p>By the turn of the 20th century, football had become notoriously dangerous; 18 college players died in 1905 alone. Colleges responded with a series of rule changes to open up the game, most importantly the forward pass.</p>
<p>The game had achieved its modern form by 1912, when the field was changed to its current size, the value of a touchdown increased to 6 points, and a fourth down added to each possession. Originally dominated by the Ivy League, football soon captured the interest of colleges nationwide. By 1916, when the <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rose_Bowl_game_2708.html" title="Rose Bowl game">Rose Bowl game</a> matching eastern and western teams became an annual event, football had developed a national following second only to <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> among team sports.</p>
<p>Professional football developed in the mill towns of <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> and the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Midwest_1df7.html" title="American Midwest">American Midwest</a> in the early years of the 20th century. The NFL was founded in 1920 in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canton%2C_Ohio_6d9b.html" title="Canton, Ohio">Canton, Ohio</a>.</p>
<p>Pro football remained a largely regional sport of secondary importance until after World War II. Television broadcasts greatly enhanced NFL football's national appeal, and the pro game surpassed both college football and baseball in popularity in the 1960s. The first Super Bowl, between the champions of the NFL and the rival American Football League, was played in 1967, and the two leagues merged in 1970.</p>

<p>Have removed the Citation Tag for the sentence regarding the suggestions that it is most similar to war. There is simply a plethora of possible sources for this citation, but it's more of an understood thing and the sources are not military (and as such wouldn't be qualified to make the comparison). Actually, I'm not one to make a deletion before discussion so I'll throw it back up until we talk about it, sorry bout that. However, you can find pretty much ANY announcer, many coaches, many players.. really a TON of people that make the Football/war comparison from a strategic standpoint quite regularly... although admittedly the references are a bit less than they used to be so as not to be insensitive to those who are currently in the military and fighting in an ACTUAL war. It's a metaphorical (sp) comparison, that is made regularly and is generally accepted as strategically similar. When the aspects of teamwork, discipline, deception, overwhelming force, BLITZing lol, Ground attack, Air Attack, causing confusion, exploiting gaps created in frontlines... there are so many comparisons the list could go on forever. It's certainly not literal... and no one would claim it is. Just at a tactical level the comparison is common and accepted by many. Cowboy357 17:06, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This may sound a bit hypodcritical, since I've removed so much "superfluous" stuff from the article. But I think some of what Civil Engineer III removed should be restored, albeit perhaps in a better-written way. He (I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that an engineer who shuns gender-neutral language and likes football is a man) removed a section about down and distance, but I think this is one of the things that confuses foreigners the most. He also removed the penalty example, which may be of use to someone unfamiliar with the game. I'm open to rewording these things if they're poorly written, but I think these topics should be covered in the article.</p>
<p>Also, the "see XXXXX below" items may help readers navigate through the article more easily.</p>

<p>If you think it's absolutely essential to mention NFL playoffs and college/high school, I'm open to suggestions.

<dd>Well, I think the <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tags are a little extreme, but I don't think there is anything wrong with providing footnotes for this. Each of them could benefit from some work. For instance:
<ol>
<li>What does "unofficial holiday" mean - its already a Sunday. Do businesses close? (no, not really) Do we eat a lot of food? (I guess so) Special food? (not really) Send cards? (Definitely not).</li>
<li>"extremely popular" is a weasel phrase. Compared to what? Better to to strike the word "extremely" I think. "Popular" is still relative but looks less POV on its own. The football stadiums are factual so citing them will be easy.</li>

<dd>There is certainly no need for a fact tag on when high school, college and pro games are "normally" played, as every American football fan knows it, and it is easily verifiable by looking at any major newspapers over a weekend. It is also easy to verify that football at all levels is a very traditional sport followed in many places in America. The part about Super Sunday being an unofficial holiday is suspect, not because it's a Sunday (Easter is on Sunday, and Christmas and July 4th and New Year's can be on Sundays also), but because it sounds like overkill hype. It's sufficient to point out that many people host Super Bowl parties (if the article doesn't say that, it should) and it verifiably has a large TV audience. But the line as stated was POV-pushing of a sort. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 01:49, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I added the four biggest college stadiums into the sentence. <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> says that links to internal articles that themselves have sources cited can be treated as a sort of citation. The sentence about High School on Friday, College on Saturday... strikes me still as a sentence we should do something with. If it is easy to verify, then we should verify it for the reader by placing a reference in the article. I'm actually finding it a little hard to verify in terms of finding on succint source that says this. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 14:33, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

Wahkeenah, if you can find 3 sources, as you say, then yes, that should be sufficient. We can make the sentence say "Generally, most high school varsity games are played on Friday,[1] most college games are played on Saturday,[2] and most pro games are played on Sunday.[3] There is also one pro-game on Monday that is given special attention as the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monday_Night_Football_28c4.html" title="Monday Night Football">Monday Night Football</a> game of the week. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex"><b>Johntex</b></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohntex_fdb3.html" title="User talk:Johntex">talk</a></sup> 22:33, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi everyone! I put the fact tags in, and I apologize that I haven't been part of this discussion until now. I was away for the weekend. At any rate, my feeling was just that this didn't qualify as general, assumed knowledge. This is the English Wikipedia, not the US one, as Johntex already said. I'm from the US, and I'm a football fan, and I really don't consider these to be well-known facts that don't require verification. Calling anything "unofficial" CERTAINLY requires some kind of citation to back it up, and I think the assertion that anything is a tradition also requires some kind of source. I don't think citing sources makes us look like amateurs, I think it makes us look like a well-researched encyclopedia. Best, Dan. <a href="../../../d/j/d/User%7EDjdickmutt_a527.html" title="User:Djdickmutt">Djdickmutt</a> 06:05, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Addition</b> Also, to assert that something is an important part of the culture of smalltown America implies a keen understanding of exactly what comprises that culture. I don't want to chafe anyone anymore than I already have . . . but why should I take your word for it on the culture of smalltown America. Those are the reasons that I felt strongly enough about the citations to tag them.

<dd>Well, this isn't my article, and I have the feeling that if I put the fact tag back, it would just be removed again. However, I strongly believe that you either need to review the way in which you make that assertion, or find a way to legitimately back it up. Telling me to turn on my Friday night news sports segment is NOT a valid representation that this is common knowledge. First of all, if I lived outside of the US, American Football wouldn't be mentioned on my TV. Second of all, if I live outside of small-town America, high-school football won't be mentioned on my TV. Third of all, even if I live in small-town America, your assertion that you and everyone else understands the intricacy of my culture without any kind of research would certainly rub me the wrong way. I won't put the fact tag back, because I don't need the headache, but this article will always seem immediately amateurish until you fix it. <a href="../../../d/j/d/User%7EDjdickmutt_a527.html" title="User:Djdickmutt">Djdickmutt</a> 19:02, 8 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I may know little about American football, but I know that your revert is incorrect. There needs to be a citation to back up the claim that American Football is the most popular spectator sport in the US (for example, I'd thought that some motor sport events attract larger crowds), and there needs to be a citation to back up the claims that is the most popular sport in the US (note, NOT America, I doubt if Brazilians, Mexicans etc. have the same favourites as the US). It is incorrect to state that the super bowl gains the highest ratings on American TV, possibly so for US TV. I hope you realise there is a big difference between the continent and a country.

<dd>The problem to me is that this is just not the kind of thing that should be cited. No academic would ever put a footnote after the sentence "American football is the most popular spectator sport in the United States." It would look amateurishly pedantic. Now when it comes to a specific, measurable claim, like saying a certain sport has the highest attendance or TV viewership, it should have a citation. This is what we've done. The general claim is backed up with two cited facts regarding TV viewership and popularity surveys. (Comparing attendance among different sports doesn't really help, since some sports have fewer events and bigger stadiums than others.)</dd>

<dd>Regarding the US/America issue, please note that this has been argued ad infinitum on Wikipedia.

It's not our job to change the English language into something more rational. I'm afraid you'll get a largely negative reaction if you try to push this issue in Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 23:35, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I think we'll have to agree to disagree on whether verifying the claim "American football is the most popular spectator sport in the United States" is pedantic or not. As no one seems able to back this claim up, I'll just just assume it is incorrect and move on. I think I've found out enough about the sport already so I won't loose any sleep over the matter. As a bonus, I've also had an insight into some it's followers as well, maybe it's their over-bearing arrogance that have kept the sport as parochial as it is? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkb_3e6f.html" title="User:Markb">Markb</a> 12:54, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An editor replaced the sentence:</p>

<p>"Not all of these types of players will be on the field for every offensive play. Teams can vary the number of wide receivers, tight ends and running backs on the field before a huddle (or lining up in a no-huddle offense)."</p>
<p>I reverted the change pending discussion here. I think the editor, who said the first sentence made no sense to him, misunderstood the meaning of the word "vary" in this context.

<p>I've already changed this once and it was reverted. Someone please explain to me what this inept use of English is supposed to mean: "Teams can vary the number of wide receivers, tight ends and running backs on the field at one time." I feel that the person who wrote it thinks that it means the offense may be changed once only until a huddle or play begins - which is what I changed it to. However, what it really means is that the offense may be changed once and only once. In fact, it doesn't even mean it may be changed once per game - it means once and only once in the entire history of football. That is completely incorrect. So, please toss out suggestions since my suggestion that "the offense be changed to the official NFL rule of being able to change the offense until a huddle or, in the case of a no-huddle offense, the players line up" was reverted. --<a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKainaw_88a4.html" title="User:Kainaw">Kainaw</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../k/a/i/User_talk%7EKainaw_1209.html" title="User talk:Kainaw">(talk)</a></sup></small> 04:49, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Your diagram may not be a Picasso, but it subtly highlights a point I was trying to make in the writeup about the offense, which you or someone altered. Unless they've changed the rules and I missed it (which is possible) there have to be <i>exactly</i> seven players in the offensive line, no more, no less. Notice that on your offensive line there are the usual center, guards and tackles, along with one tight end and one wide receiver (or split-end in the old-old terminology). The second wide receiver is technically an offensive back, not a lineman, and is positioned a step back from the line, to comply with the rules. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 03:13, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I made sure to put the flanker one yard back. NCAA rule 7-1-3-b-1 (<a href="http://www.ncaa.org/library/rules/2005/2005_football_rules.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncaa.org/library/rules/2005/2005_football_rules.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, p. 90) says <i>at least</i> seven players must be on the line of scrimmage. I suppose the reason you never see eight or more players on the line is because there would be no point -- you'd lose an eligible receiver. One possible objection to my graphic is that the tight end is lined up next to the left tackle rather than the right tackle. Ordinarily, the TE lines up on the right. But sometimes, he lines up on the left. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 00:21, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I've been looking through the American football pages and I get the impression that theres no recognised governing body. (Like <a href="../../../f/i/f/FIFA_a2be.html" title="FIFA">FIFA</a>, the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Rugby_Board_a7f8.html" title="International Rugby Board">IRB</a>, the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Tennis_Federation_80ad.html" title="International Tennis Federation">ITF</a> or the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Cricket_Council_b676.html" title="International Cricket Council">ICC</a>.) Is the sport just a popular American pasttime with a few organised businesses (read 'leagues') that do a good job of making money out of it? I don't mean to be harsh or incendiary, but thats pretty much the impression I'm getting. - <a href="../../../a/h/e/User%7EAheyfromhome_e925.html" title="User:Aheyfromhome">aheyfromhome</a> 01:47, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>American sports generally lack regulatory bodies like FIFA. Every professional league, collegiate association, state high-school athletic association, sandlot league, city youth league, etc., can make its own rules. Same with baseball, basketball and ice hockey. To an American (at least this one), the concept of a "regulatory body" with power over everything from the top professionals to children's leagues seems centralist and undemocratic. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 02:12, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have an excellent source to cite about American Football in the 1800's that mentions gambling and "fixed" games, the rules of the game and includes sketches made at that time about the game. The section on history does a good job of covering the general football topic for the purpose of the football articles so I don't think my information should be added there—anyone have a place where this could be added?
