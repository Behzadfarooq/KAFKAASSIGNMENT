<p>The folk music revival is sometimes said to have begun with <a href="../../../p/e/t/Pete_Seeger_18a1.html" title="Pete Seeger">Pete Seeger</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Weavers_de2a.html" title="The Weavers">The Weavers</a>, formed in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1947.html" title="1947">1947</a> by Seeger, had a big hit in 1949 with Leadbelly's "<a href="../../../g/o/o/Goodnight%2C_Irene_230f.html" title="Goodnight, Irene">Goodnight, Irene</a>". This hit was probably one of the first glimmerings of the folk music revival.</p>
<p>Although carried along by a handful of artists releasing records, the folk-music scene's development was still only as a sort of <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cult</a> phenomenon in <a href="../../../b/o/h/Bohemianism.html" title="Bohemianism">bohemian</a> circles in places like <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> (especially <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenwich_Village_91fa.html" title="Greenwich Village">Greenwich Village</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Beach%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California_27c2.html" title="North Beach, San Francisco, California">North Beach</a>), and in the <a href="../../../c/o/l/College.html" title="College">college</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/University.html" title="University">university</a> districts of cities like <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver%2C_Colorado_0409.html" title="Denver, Colorado">Denver</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago%2C_Illinois_2106.html" title="Chicago, Illinois">Chicago</a> and elsewhere. It was <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hip" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:hip">hip</a>, but not terribly widespread.</p>
<p>In the 1950s and after, acoustic folk-song performance became associated with the <a href="../../../c/o/f/Coffee_house.html" title="Coffee house">coffee houses</a>, private parties, open-air concerts and sing-alongs, and college-campus concerts. It blended, to some degree, with the so-called <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beatnik.html" title="Beatnik">beatnik</a> scene, and dedicated singers of folk songs (as well as folk-influenced original material) traveled through what was called "the coffee-house circuit" across the U.S. and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Kingston_Trio_d463.html" title="The Kingston Trio">The Kingston Trio</a>, while playing at a college club called the Cracked Pot, were discovered by Frank Werber, who became their manager and secured them a deal with <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitol_Records_df10.html" title="Capitol Records">Capitol Records</a>. Their first hit was a catchy rendition of an old-time folk song, "<a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Dooley_%28song%29_5ea0.html" title="Tom Dooley (song)">Tom Dooley</a>", which went <a href="../../../g/o/l/Gold_record.html" title="Gold record">gold</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1958_in_music.html" title="1958 in music">1958</a>. The following year, the group won the first <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammy_Award_0dda.html" title="Grammy Award">Grammy Award</a> for Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording category for the album <i>The Kingston Trio at Large</i>. At one point in the early 1960s, The Kingston Trio had four albums at the same time among the Top 10 selling albums<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, a record unmatched for nearly 40 years.</p>
<p>The contemporary-songwriter and folk-music scene during these times often had a facet of <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social.html" title="Social">social</a> concern. Young singer-songwriter <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, playing <a href="../../../a/c/o/Acoustic_guitar.html" title="Acoustic guitar">acoustic guitar</a> and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmonica.html" title="Harmonica">harmonica</a>, had been signed and recorded for <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbia_Records_0f17.html" title="Columbia Records">Columbia</a> by producer <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hammond_b979.html" title="John Hammond">John Hammond</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961_in_music.html" title="1961 in music">1961</a>. Dylan's record enjoyed some popularity in the Greenwich Village folk-music cult, but he was "discovered" by an immensely larger audience when a <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop-folk.html" title="Pop-folk">pop-folk</a>-music group, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter%2C_Paul_%26_Mary_4090.html" title="Peter, Paul &amp; Mary">Peter, Paul &amp; Mary</a> had a hit with his song "<a href="../../../b/l/o/Blowing_in_the_Wind_cdba.html" title="Blowing in the Wind">Blowing in the Wind</a>". Their songs often shared in the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanitarianism.html" title="Humanitarianism">humanitarianism</a> and social idealism of the Weavers, and a few of the earlier folk-scene notables, and this and other songs by Dylan fitted the bill.</p>
<p>Dylan’s general popularity was soon so great that record companies began to sign, and distribute records for, many new, young, sometimes-scruffy singer/songwriters – <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Ochs_9da7.html" title="Phil Ochs">Phil Ochs</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Paxton_4560.html" title="Tom Paxton">Tom Paxton</a>, <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_von_Schmidt_9c7f.html" title="Eric von Schmidt">Eric von Schmidt</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffy_Saint-Marie_d291.html" title="Buffy Saint-Marie">Buffy Saint-Marie</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/Dave_Van_Ronk_c030.html" title="Dave Van Ronk">Dave Van Ronk</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judy_Collins_b7d3.html" title="Judy Collins">Judy Collins</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Rush_6df2.html" title="Tom Rush">Tom Rush</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Neil_f274.html" title="Fred Neil">Fred Neil</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Lightfoot_f3f9.html" title="Gordon Lightfoot">Gordon Lightfoot</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Denver_1bf9.html" title="John Denver">John Denver</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/l/Arlo_Guthrie_8856.html" title="Arlo Guthrie">Arlo Guthrie</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Hartford_2ac1.html" title="John Hartford">John Hartford</a>, and others, among them. Some of this wave had emerged from family singing and playing traditions, and some had not.</p>

<p>During these same years, the devoted and growing folk-music crowd that had developed in the United States began to want and to buy records by obscure older folk musicians, from the <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appalachian_Mountains_5657.html" title="Appalachian Mountains">Southeastern hill country</a> and from urban inner-cities. LP records made up of collections of 78-rpm records stretching back to the <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> were put on sale. Many smaller record labels such as <a href="../../../y/a/z/Yazoo_Records_0f25.html" title="Yazoo Records">Yazoo Records</a> grew up to distribute older recordings and to make new recordings of these artists. This was how many <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_American_9a10.html" title="White American">white Americans</a> first heard <a href="../../../c/o/u/Country_blues.html" title="Country blues">country blues</a> and especially <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_blues.html" title="Delta blues">Delta blues</a>, that had been recorded by <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mississippi.html" title="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> folk artists 30 or 40 years before.</p>
<p>Artists like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Carter_Family_eb23.html" title="The Carter Family">the Carter Family</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Johnson_cfbb.html" title="Robert Johnson">Robert Johnson</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blind_Lemon_Jefferson_ba34.html" title="Blind Lemon Jefferson">Blind Lemon Jefferson</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarence_Ashley_5c25.html" title="Clarence Ashley">Clarence Ashley</a>, Buell Kazee, <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncle_Dave_Macon_bd6e.html" title="Uncle Dave Macon">Uncle Dave Macon</a>, the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Reverend_Gary_Davis_fe9a.html" title="Reverend Gary Davis">Reverend Gary Davis</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Monroe_573c.html" title="Bill Monroe">Bill Monroe</a>, and <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmie_Rodgers_%28country_singer%29_8a03.html" title="Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)">Jimmie Rodgers</a> came to have something more than a regional or ethnic reputation.

<p>Living representatives of some of the varied regional and ethnic traditions, including younger performers like Southern-tradition singer <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_Ritchie_32a6.html" title="Jean Ritchie">Jean Ritchie</a>, enjoyed popularity through enthusiasts' widening discovery of this music.</p>

<p>After the darling of the young enthusiasts, Bob Dylan, began to record with a rocking rhythm section and electric instruments in <a href="../../../1/9/6/1965_in_music.html" title="1965 in music">1965</a> (see <i><a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_Dylan_controversy_2c11.html" title="Electric Dylan controversy">Electric Dylan controversy</a></i>), many other still-young folk artists followed suit. Meanwhile, bands like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lovin%27_Spoonful_690f.html" title="The Lovin' Spoonful">The Lovin' Spoonful</a> and the <a href="../../../b/y/r/Byrds.html" title="Byrds">Byrds</a>, whose individual members often had a background in the folk-revival coffee-house scene, were getting recording contracts with folk-tinged music played with a rock-band line-up. Before long, the public appetite for the more acoustic music of the folk revival began to wane.</p>
<p>"Crossover" hits ("folk songs" that became rock-music-scene staples) happened now and again. One well-known example is the song "<a href="../../../h/e/y/Hey_Joe_ad76.html" title="Hey Joe">Hey Joe</a>", copyrighted by folk artist <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Roberts_2a2a.html" title="Billy Roberts">Billy Roberts</a>, and recorded by rock singer/guitarist <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimi_Hendrix_a916.html" title="Jimi Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> just as he was about to burst into stardom in 1967. The anthem "<a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodstock_%28song%29.html" title="Woodstock (song)">Woodstock</a>" was written and first sung and accompanied on keyboard by <a href="../../../j/o/n/Joni_Mitchell_0ba3.html" title="Joni Mitchell">Joni Mitchell</a> while her records were still nearly entirely acoustic, and while she was labelled a "folk singer" — receiving big airplay when <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crosby%2C_Stills%2C_Nash_%26_Young_e674.html" title="Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young">Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young</a> recorded a high-energy rock version.</p>

<p>By the late 1960s, the scene had returned to being more of a lower-key, afficianado phenomenon, although sizable annual acoustic-music festivals were established in many parts of North America during this period. The acoustic music coffee-house scene survived at a reduced scale. Through the luminary young singer-songwriters of the 1960s, the American folk-music revival has influenced songwriting and musical styles throughout the world.</p>

<li><b><a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a></b> often performed, and sometimes toured with, <b><a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_Baez_b724.html" title="Joan Baez">Joan Baez</a></b>, a guitarist and soprano singer of mostly traditional songs, who adopted some of Dylan's songs into her repertoire. Baez had had a following on the folk circuit for a few years before Dylan gained recognition; the two had the same manager for a number of years. It is arguable that Dylan eventually became the most popular of the younger folk-music-revival performers.</li>

<p>Although singers such as the Weavers and Joan Baez occasionally included <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish-language.html" title="Spanish-language">Spanish-language</a> material in their repertoires, the folk-music revival in North America (as it existed in the coffee houses, concert halls, and radio and TV) was overwhelmingly an <a href="../../../e/n/g/English-language.html" title="English-language">English-language</a> phenomenon. In that sense, it bypassed a lot of ethnic folk traditions to be found in North America (e.g., <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_American_4105.html" title="Italian American">Italian</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_American_3c30.html" title="French American">French</a>, <a href="../../../l/u/s/Luso_American_4e77.html" title="Luso American">Portuguese</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_American_f845.html" title="German American">German</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish_American_a821.html" title="Polish American">Polish</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_American_9778.html" title="Russian American">Russian</a>) – except in a small proportion of instances where songs’ lyrics had been translated into English.</p>
