<p>Can someone locate and add what the ACLU's funding and membership has been since its founding (maybe in chart or table form)?

<p>I met a man named Ariah Naier at a speakin engagement at my college, Colby College.</p>
<p>As I understand it he was one of the key figures in the Skokie, Illinois debate, and was ejected from the ACLU by the board for his defense of the Nazis' right to free speech.</p>
<p>Can anyone confirm this? I wuold like to make an article about him but I don't remember that much. All I know is the above and that he currently chairs an international human rights organization.</p>
<p>I googled his name, but I fear I have remembered the wrong spelling, and I got no matches.</p>
<p>My essential comment is this:</p>
<p>---&gt;I think it would be fitting to have a reference to him in the ACLU History section. Once we find the correct spelling, of course. --<a href="../../../z/a/o/User%7EZaorish_e981.html" title="User:Zaorish">Zaorish</a> 01:39, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aryeh Neier was indeed a key figure in the Skokie case. He was at that time the ACLU's Executive Director. According to one site, it's not so much that he was "ejected", but rather that the organization's defense of Nazis was very unpopular and caused a drop in membership, prompting Neier's resignation because he " found himself unable to reconcile the organization's activities with available funds". <a href="http://infoshare1.princeton.edu/libraries/firestone/rbsc/finding_aids/aclu/" class="external autonumber" title="http://infoshare1.princeton.edu/libraries/firestone/rbsc/finding_aids/aclu/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> There certainly doesn't seem to be any lingering ill will, given that the ACLU named a fellowship after Neier (<a href="http://www.aclu.org/Jobs/Jobs.cfm?ID=11505&amp;c=215&amp;Type=s&amp;insearch=fellowships" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aclu.org/Jobs/Jobs.cfm?ID=11505&amp;c=215&amp;Type=s&amp;insearch=fellowships" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>). <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 10:06, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">reorg article?</span></h2>
<p>Hi all --</p>
<p>There is a lot of material on controversial ACLU cases, and it is sort of spread around. Is there a better way to organize it? We could organize it by subject, e.g., "pornography and sex", "church and state"? Or by decade? Anyway, just a suggestion to think about. I personally think this is an excellent article, and because of people's work one of the few places to find unbiased information about some of the most controversial cases (which are barely discussed on the ACLU's homepages, and are usually given in distorted form when they come from anti-ACLU sources.) <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 19:44, 14 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">critics wording</span></h2>
<p>An anon IP has been making edits to the page; in particular, s/he wants to remove statements to the effect that the most vocal critics of the ACLU come from the right. This is really not a debatable point, although we do qualify later in the article that some liberals are also critics of the ACLU, in particular over campaign finance and pornography.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is flat out inaccurate to describe critics of the ACLU's 1st amendment policies as "Christian" without qualification. As discussed later in the article, a number of Christian groups, including Jehovah's Witness and the Mormons, have a much more nuanced approach to the ACLU; furthermore, there are a great number of Christian groups (the Quakers, for example) who have been strong supporters of the ACLU's work on church-state issues.</p>
<p>It is necessary that the article draw distinctions and be as accurate as possible. You may feel that all Christians <i>should</i> be critics of the ACLU, but that does not change the fact that many are not. Please discuss here before making further edits in this vein.</p>

<p>Sdedeo,</p>
<p>Yes, there is political bias in the article. You are wrong when you say that Christians need to be qualified, with regard to various ACLU actions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sdedeo, I think the article is okay now, as it says "some Christians" -- it makes clear it's not a blanket inclusion. And, to Sdedeo's unsigned critic, I would suggest you refrain from calling people "wrong" in matters of opinion. IMHO, that's contrary to the consensus-building atmosphere of Wiki. You're entitled to your opinion, as is Sdedeo, but no one person's opinion is more valid than another's. <a href="../../../j/u/a/User%7EJuanOso_fa9b.html" title="User:JuanOso">JuanOso</a> 20:17, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">partial reorg</span></h2>
<p>Hi all -- I have done a partial reorg of the critics section, dividing it into three groups: conservative crits, conservative christian crits, liberal crits. I realize that logically conservative christian crits should be a subset of conservative crits, but actually, it seems to work better this way, since the two both overlap, and differ in emphasis.</p>
<p>Note that I've gone ahead and used the term conservative christian to describe what was previously referred to as just christian. This is semi-controversial, I guess, but if people find significant opposition to the ACLU from more "liberal" christians, then there's an obvious place to add it -- in the liberal section. I have not found any sources that point towards strong resistance to the aclu from more liberal groups (e.g., the episcopalians, unitarians, etc., etc.), or groups whose political POV may vary depending on the person (e.g., Catholics.)</p>
<p>(Of course, the Catholic Church will find itself on the opposite side of the ACLU on legal questions especially abortion questions, but the critics section is not a place to list every single person who disagrees with the ACLU; rather to list groups who specifically and consistently criticize the ACLU on both particular and general grounds.)</p>
<p>(...and again: this is not to say that, e.g., a Catholic person may not criticize the ACLU in many matters; rather that that opposition should not be described as "Catholic" or coming from a Catholic POV, but could rather be better subsumed under, e.g., "conservative crits.)</p>

<p>Mrmiscellanious, I don't understand why your edits to the O'Reilly section are more NPOV, and apparently neither does Sdedeo. I think it's entirely reasonable to mention facist, even if he hasn't used it recently. As for conservative, he is the model of the modern conservative. Beyond not toteing himself as conservative, I'd like some evidence that he claims he's not conservative or someone claims he's not conservative before even adding a note about it to this article.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 17:18, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, not sure about Prosfilaes, but I think it's fair to put O'Reilly's remarks in the general "Conservative" section; whether or not he is a true-blue conservative, it's certaintly the case that the aspects of the ACLU's program he objects to are in the conservative vein. Furthermore, I think it's pretty accurate to say that O'Reilly is commonly regarded by others as being more conservative than liberal. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 00:17, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Court Awarded Damages</span></h2>
<p><i>Sdedeo</i>, Some mention the ACLU's collections of court awarded damages should be added. The ACLU has collected <b>millions in monetary damages from the courts.</b> Specific to this, if the citizens of a town are damaged/violated by a violation of Church and State, the ACLU sues, and wins both correction of the violation and monetary damages, shouldn't the money go to the victims?</p>
<p>I could add it but you're the better author...peace, take care. 68.52.59.234 04:51, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, I have no idea where judgement money goes. Do you have a source talking about it? My guess -- and IANAL! -- is that in many cases, the ACLU gets involved on behalf of a third party; the few cases where it really is "ACLU v. someone", my guess is that damages are not involved. I'm not sure if they collect attorney fees if they do win, though they probably do; further, don't know if anyone has criticized them for taking excessive fees in a case they did. Thanks for the praise, but it should be said the ACLU article is the product of a great deal of work by a very large number of people! <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 05:01, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi 68.52.59.234 -- as you can see, the question of monetary awards is on its way to being established in the article (see the <a href="../../../a/c/l/ACLU_cdbb.html#Funding" title="ACLU">funding</a> section.) If you have specific citations of large monetary awards going to the ACLU as the result of a legal judgment, please add it in. Again, let me just stress that external sources (ideally, e.g., a news report about a specific judgment) are really required here. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 14:44, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it would be valuable to better relate how the ACLU's handling of monetary awards compares to the policies of other non-profit organisations involved in legal advocacy and litgation, and to general standards of lawyers involved in 'pro bono' work overall. Right now, the detailed emphasis on this subject seems to me (despite meritable attempts at remaining NPOV in phrasing) to be playing into the hands of the ongoing right wing smear campaign against the ACLU. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDayv_afc0.html" title="User:Dayv">Dayv</a> 05:20, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi Dayv -- this would indeed be very interesting info. Put very briefly, I think it's most likely true that the ACLU does the same thing with regard to legal fees as any other legal advocacy organization. Do you have any source that states this? A general secondary source would be great, or perhaps just a few links to statements about other groups. I would take it as "self-evident" and just put it in, but I'm wary of doing so because, well, I've learned how little I know about this facet of legal work. (PS: as for coverage, I think we go into "just the right amount" of detail -- of course I would, since I wrote it!)</dd>

<dd>I'm the user that started this section. I have created a section for Court Awarded Damages. The issue of Court Awarded Damages was in the <i>Funding</i> section, which seems humorous, but hardly factual.

<dd>Religious right. They did not make the estimate. They provided 22 cites for CAD for the ACLU. I added up the separate amounts and provided the amount. You type so fast, I didn't know where the 9.5 came from or the repeated reference to the RR group. Honestly, I didn't realize you were adding it over and over. But the addition of the RR is POV and will have to go. The 22 cites stand without the RR and I'll reference each one if need be.

<p>CFRAFC is the group that made the estimate. Either cite them, or remove the information.

<p>Look, it seems very simple to me. Some group takes a selection of cases, adds up the numbers. BTW, I very much doubt they include the CADs in cases where the ACLU was defending the right to religious expression. We should cite that group. I already cited a number: "18% came from court awarded attorney fees" in the case of the NJCLU. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 02:44, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I added up the numbers; They provided the cites.

<p>If you are looking for numbers not specific to cause, I've provided them -- 18% in the case of NJ. Your CADs from the CFRAFC are only for the cases they disagree with and it would be not NPOV to cite them without source.

<p>I've also changed the title of the section.

<dd>Yes, the ACLU receives damages. When the ACLU sues, they for damages, not attorney fees. A lawsuit is an action to redress damages incurred. The amount of the damages, if awarded are determined by a judge. A judge does not base his decision of monetary damages awarded on the amount litigants pay for legal services, including the ACLU. <a href="../../../s/c/r/User%7EScribner_94ed.html" title="User:Scribner">Scribner</a> 05:24, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'll read the source tomorrow. The RR was 22 cited publications, which means the damages are far higher than they reported.

<dd>Injuctive relief wasn't in the section, so having it in the title made no sense, right?

<p>Well, the two lawyers who worked <i>pro bono</i> on Polovchak's (the son's) case are Erika Holzer and her husband, who are both now associated with <a href="../../../f/r/o/FrontPage_Magazine_030e.html" title="FrontPage Magazine">FrontPage Magazine</a>. My guess is that they themselves would regard themselves as taking the conservative side against a "liberal ACLU". The first page of google pulls up <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Senate/1777/aclu.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Senate/1777/aclu.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>, which generally paints the ACLU as a supporter of the Soviet regime. My guess, given both the stuff I and Ken have pulled up, is that it's pretty accurate to say that the ACLU took the most heat from conservatives on this, and that conservatives consider the case an example of the ACLU's hidden political sympathies while liberals are more likely to view the ACLU's taking on of the case in the same way they view, e.g., the ACLU's involvement with NAMBLA. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 22:13, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Here's a quote from Holzer:</p>
<dl>
<dd>It still strikes me as strange. The ACLU has a children's rights project. Their attorneys argue that teenage girls are competent to have an abortion without parental consent, but a teenage boy can't choose the United States over a totalitarian state. The only answer that makes sense is that their decisions aren't based on civil liberties but liberal politics. The ACLU likes abortion, and it likes the Soviet Union.</dd>

<p>That's an odd quote, considering that the "teenage boy" who "can't choose the United States over a totalitarian state" is almost certainly a reference to Elian Gonzales, who was not a teenager when he was returned to Cuba. He was six years old at the time.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why on earth would it be a reference to Gonzales? The comment about the Soviet Union and the teenage boy part makes it pretty clear the comment is about Polovchak.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 00:59, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just read the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polovchak_v._Meese_2e1b.html" title="Polovchak v. Meese">Polovchak v. Meese</a> stub, and it seems to me that the difference between as quoted a teenage girl's decision to have an abortion and a tennage boy's decision to stay in America is the girl's decision is about her body, while the boy's case is about the limits of custody. The quote is very, very right wing. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalse_Prophet_d778.html" title="User:False Prophet">False Prophet</a> 16:44, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It isn't one or the other. It's about both. It's about the *conflict* between custody rights and the right of the minor to control his/her body. In the case of the girl wanting an abortion, the girl wants control over her own body (getting an abortion) and the person with custody doesn't. In Polovchak's case, he wanted control over his body (living in a free society) and the person with custody didn't. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 18:36, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi 68.52.59.234; I've looked over your edit. The problem is that the phrase you want to put in the opening paragraph, "taken the stance of extreme activism beyond the courts" is not neutral. It is fine to include criticism of the ACLU; we include a great deal of it, but it has to appear in the "Critics" section, and when it does appear there, it must be sourced to someone in particular. For example, we include the info that Bill O'Rielly thinks the ACLU is a "fascist organization"; we could not simply put this in the introductory paragraph, which is meant to be purely factual. Please see, for example, other articles about controversial organizations such as the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Rifle_Association_d13c.html" title="National Rifle Association">NRA</a>.

<p>The first sentence is in error. The ACLU does not claim to defend the Bill of Rights, just selected rights.

<dd>It says "We work daily in courts, legislatures and communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to every person in this country by the Constitution and laws of the United States." By definition, that is their stated goal.

<dd>I am trying to answer your question. On the left-hand sidebar of <a href="http://www.aclu.org/about/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aclu.org/about/index.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, it says "We work daily in courts, legislatures and communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed to every person in this country by the Constitution and laws of the United States." That is the text quoted in the intro to this article. The ACLU does claim to defend the Bill of Rights: "Majority power is limited by the Constitution's Bill of Rights, which consists of the original ten amendments ratified in 1791, plus the three post-Civil War amendments (the 13th, 14th and 15th) and the 19th Amendment (women's suffrage), adopted in 1920. The mission of the ACLU is to preserve all of these protections..."</dd>

<dd>I don't know if that's necessary. I think this article already does a good job of explaining the ACLU's stated goals, and then explaining common criticisms of the ACLU, such as the one you brought up. I think it would be POV for us to write that they claim one thing but do another. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 04:30, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would generally agree with Rhobite here, although there are many subtleties. I think we should try to find statistics -- e.g., in how many cases does the ACLU cite the nth amendment? (However, it's important to remember that there are rules to filing amicus briefs; you can only file one if you make a point that is substantially different from points made by others involved in the case. So this will distort some of the statistics.) There's no question that the ACLU differs from the NRA in the interpretation of the second amendment; however, the ACLU does claim that its position on the second amendment is consistent and in keeping with what they believe it to mean.</p>
<p>We cover accusations of "bad faith" -- i.e., that the ACLU leadership "knows" that the 2nd means e.g. unlimited gun rights -- in the conservatives section, and we discuss their stated positions elsewhere. We should be careful to keep POV stuff out of the introductory paragraph. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 05:48, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Its not POV stuff. ACLU supporters are using "The ACLU doesn't claim to defend the entire bill of rights" and citing the ACLU's homepage to back it up. Besides, how one interprets the 2nd amendment is irrelevant here. The ACLU interprets all amendments as broadly as possible and the just so happens to interpret the 2nd amendment narrowly?</p>

<p>The ACLU provides legal assistance in the form of lawyers and legal expertise. I fail to see how the word "expertise" can be construed as biased. Even critics of the ACLU recognize that it provides qualified lawyers. They've been to law school, passed the bar exam, etc. Moreover, they have a particular interest in and knowledge of civil liberties issues. That makes what they provide "expertise", whether or not you agree with their political stance or interpretation of the law.

<p>A current criticism of the ACLU is the hypocrisy it has exhibited in at least two current matters: it has refused to take any position regarding the city of Boston's grant to a Mosque of valuable city property for a fraction of its actual worth, something that would normally have resulted in its disapproval over a church/state matter; and the ACLU's pressuring its directors to not make any public statements critical of the organization, seemingly a clear violation of the principals of free speach the ACLU claims to espouse. If no one else does it soon, I will add both matters to the body of the article.Incorrect</p>

So we have here a Boston City giveaway of public lands for the building of a Mosque, a lawsuit filed over this, the ACLU being aware of this (since this is a big story in Boston even without the horrid right wing news source [bad right wing, bad right wing] but the ACLU failing to take a postition consistent with their decades long campaign against the use of public funds to aid in any fashion the Christian religion. Since I'm now running in the 3rr rule, and will have to wait 24 hours to reedit, any editor with npov perspective will redit this article to add in the Boston issue.Incorrect 13:29, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">standards for including criticism of the ACLU</span></h2>
<p>Hi all -- as the recent appearences of User:Incorrect and User:Butchpenton show, we need to establish some groundrules for what kind of criticism to include here.</p>
<p>The main criteria is, I think, to organize things into common themes (e.g., stance on religion in government), which is what we have now. New criticisms need to either fit themselves into one of these themes, or should establish (with a <i>lot</i> of sources) a new theme. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>There was no mention in this article of the ACLU's tendency of prejudice towards Judeo-Christian religious symbols in public places while turning a blind eye toward public symbols of other religions. I also think there should be at least some mention of the failed ACLU effort to prevent Iowa valedictorian graduate Mathew Reynolds from making any mention of his [Christian] religous faith during his acceptance speech. I would also go on to say that said effort failed when it was found to be a violation of free speech. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 63.85.63.23 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_63.85.63.23_56b9.html" title="Special:Contributions/63.85.63.23">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>ACLU policy is to oppose all violations of separation of church and state. Such violations in the United States overwhelmingly involve Christianity because Christianity is by far the most common religion and because Christianity is evangelical. Can you cite examples of attempts by other religions to impose themselves under public auspices that the ACLU did not oppose? Similarly, can you provide details of the Matthew Reynolds case? Was it merely a "mention" of his Christian faith that the ACLU opposed, or was he trying to use his OFFICIAL role as valedictorian to evangelize or pray? There is a distinction between official and individual roles.<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillposer_1189.html" title="User:Billposer">Bill</a> 15:56, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I did a Google search for "Matthew Reynolds" and "ACLU". I found only one item discussing this case and it does not mention any involvement by the ACLU. It says that the high school principal told him not to thank Jesus Christ for his success in school and that the principal later relented. (Google listed this item because the ACLU was mentioned in another item on the same page.)<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillposer_1189.html" title="User:Billposer">Bill</a> 17:05, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it is also germane to point out the ACLU has multiple test criteria for litigating on a case. These include the presence of an actual plaintiff, the feasibility of a win, the potential costs of litigation, and the importance of the principle at stake. It is convenient for many groups to argue that the ACLU's "inaction" on specific cases is a sign of ____ist bias. In most cases, a closer examination of the cases in question shows that they are fairly hopeless, or are in the process of being settled out of court, or whatever. For example, the NRA frequently accuses the ACLU of not pushing 2nd ammendment cases, when in point of fact SCOTUS has basically refused to hear any such cases since <i>Miller</i>. So it becomes on the one hand a red herring and on the other hand a kind of ownership claim: "I think the ACLU sucks, but I want to be allowed to set their legislative priorities."

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And sometimes, the defendents exercise their choice in who should represent them. I'm aware of a (nominal) "gunowner rights" case where the CLU extended a definite offer to defend on 1st Amendment grounds, but the plaintiff chose to accept the NRA's alternate defense on 2nd Amendment grounds. As it turns out, the plaintiff should have accepted the CLU's help; they lost on 2nd Amendment grounds (but, IMNSHO, would have had a slam-dunk on 1st Amendment grounds). So you have to be careful when trying to prove the ACLU's bias by examing the record of what cases they've participated in.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Minor edits, expanded the (virtual) child pornography defense quote</span></h2>
<p>I applied some minor edits for English usage, punctuation, clarity and recentism. In a separate edit that I did not mark minor, I expanded the quote related to the child pornography case to clarify the core issue: according to the cited letter, the ACLU believes <i>virtual</i> child pornography, where no actual children are involved, is protected by the First Amendment. The critical word in the law that the ACLU opposes is "portrayal," which can include a painting, a drawing, or a computer-generated image (which the ACLU says should be protected) as well as a photo or video involving real children (which the ACLU agrees is not protected by the First Amendment). Without this clarification a reader of this article might miss the distinction and falsely believe the ACLU does not object to actual child pornography involving real children.

<p>In addition to the above edit, tonight I read this article and the talk page and I am really impressed with the tone and content. But there are a few things I thought I could point out to help to make it better. I hope this isn't discussion overkill; I didn't want to just barge in and edit the article without talking about these things first.</p>
<p>I have split my notes into sections and signed each one, in case they spark separate discussions. Here goes. Chester320 07:23, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Criticizing_politicians_or_policies.3F" id="Criticizing_politicians_or_policies.3F"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criticizing politicians or policies?</span></h2>
<p>In the article intro, I tripped over some of the phrasing.</p>
<dl>
<dd>"...though it has been harshly critical of various elected officials..."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Does the ACLU criticize <i>politicians</i> or <i>policies</i>? Perhaps the sentence could read that they are "...critical of the policies of [various politicians]." It's true they also criticize politicians themselves - just today I got ACLU literature in the mail that is (harshly) critical of George W. Bush. But in the intro I wouldn't want to leave the impression that they are only about criticizing <i>people</i>. Chester320 07:23, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Only_two_parties.3F" id="Only_two_parties.3F"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Only two parties?</span></h2>
<p>In the intro, the same sentence cited above goes on to say the ACLU has been critical of officials "of both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party," and later that "its stances have engendered criticism from both sides of the political spectrum." Has the ACLU never been critical of a member from another party - or been criticized by one?</p>
<p>Throughout this article (and many others...) the phrasing is about <b>both</b> Democrats and Republicans, <b>both</b> the left and the right, <b>both</b> ends of the political spectrum. With this phrasing, you'd never know there were more than two parties in the United States, or more than two poles of political thought.</p>
<p>(Aside: the fact that a succession of careful editors can still make it sound like there are only two parties in this country speaks volumes about the success of those parties in controlling American political discussion and even thought, to the exclusion of others. But that's for a different forum.) Chester320 07:23, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I changed "both sides" to "all parts". Personally, I think the wording of that sentence is rather awkward; however, this is a quick fix.</dd>

<p><a name="Not_really_like_public_defenders" id="Not_really_like_public_defenders"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Not really like public defenders</span></h2>
<p>The end of the Positions section compares the ACLU to public defenders, but I don't think the comparison is apt. Public defenders exist mainly to ensure that <i>destitute</i> defendants receive representation, not that <i>unpopular</i> ones do. That's a secondary function at most. Is there another kind of office or department the ACLU could be compared to? Chester320 07:23, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="Turning_down_funding" id="Turning_down_funding"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Turning down funding</span></h2>
<p>In turning down funding that came with the proviso that "none of the money would go to underwriting terrorism or other unacceptable activities," did the ACLU specify that the objectionable part was not "underwriting terrorism" but the other one? That second clause means the donor would get to decide what's acceptable. I ask because without a clarification a reader might think the ACLU wants to be able to underwrite terrorism.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Emotion and editorial in laying out the facts</span></h2>
<p>The paragraph in the "Notable Cases" section about Japanese internment says the West Coast ACLU affiliates "became some of the sharpest critics" of US policy. Does this need a citation - somebody other than the author saying they were among the "sharpest" vs. just being "critics" or even "sharply critical"?</p>
<p>In the same paragraph, can we really characterize the national ACLU position as "dodging" the issue? And why is "cleared" in quotation marks? That's a way for a writer to disparage the terminology or opinions of somebody he doesn't agree with. Chester320 07:23, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a name="General_defensiveness" id="General_defensiveness"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">General defensiveness</span></h2>
<p>I get the sense there is a presumption on the part of the writer that I (the reader) start out with a negative attitude about the ACLU and the author wants to set me straight. That's not a good rhetorical tone for a supporter to take, and it's worse for an encyclopedia entry.</p>
<p>The Japanese internment paragraph in the Structure section is an example. It might have started as an illustration of national vs. local structure, but it seems to have become something about how certain events are "often misunderstood or misrepresented." When you break it down, the section reads like this: "Some have argued A, while others have claimed B, which is hard to square with C. In fact, D." I can't tell whether this is about the ACLU's national/local structure, its reaction to Japanese internment, or misinformation/misunderstanding about the ACLU's positions and actions.</p>
<p>The "court awarded attorney's fees" section is another one that sounds defensive and chaotic to me. The first sentence says some people allege a certain thing, and the second sentence says they're right. If they're right, then this structure makes no sense. Phrases like "It is sometimes asserted" and "while there are restrictions on how fees may be collected" and they have "indeed" received awards make it all sound like an argument in progress, not a collection of facts and information.</p>
<p>Here is another example, a tautology that need not be said at all: "In many cases, whether or not a stance is considered controversial depends on other political views the critic may hold."</p>
<p>I hope this bit of editorial commentary is not taken badly. I like the article, and I would like to see it be more crisp and tight. I'd be happy to try my hand at some of these items myself, but as I said before I didn't want to barge in without a little discussion here first. Chester320 07:23, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, it keeps getting added in because it's a very popular quote with the right-wing -- who always fail to mention what comes next. The discussion went like this:</p>

<li>Baldwin was a communist! Look at this quote.</li>
<li>Well, OK, but Baldwin later wasn't a communist, so for NPOV we have to follow with a counterbalancing quote from later.</li>
<li>OK.</li>
<li>Why don't we explain that Baldwin was a communist, and then explain that he later stopped being a communist, without using inflammatory quotes?</li>

<dd>Who cares about the right wing. The quote is what he wrote. Your cutting it out is like censoring Roger Baldwin himself. I think Roger Baldwin would <b>want</b> people to see that quote. I think he is proud of it. Its removal is definite spin. This is an encyclopedia, not an ACLU mouthpiece. Your answer to Scribner is inadequate as it reflects your own biases and interests. You don't just cut out history because it changes later. I must admit your other edits seems fair -- this one, however, mischaracterizes the whole thing. It's just plain revisionist history to keep people from reading the quote. Do libraries stop people from reading Mein Kompf? And the best place to see this quote is on the ACLU page because Roger Baldwin founded the ACLU and, as he wrote, communism was the goal. Indeed that may have changed later in reality or just for show but you can't wipe away the past as if it never happened.</dd>

<dd>You know what else? Your point #2 is misleading because you say "follow with a counterbalancing quote" but you have removed the quote to be followed.

<dd>I'm putting the quote back. You are just plain wrong to remove it. Saying Hitler was a Nazi is totally different then saying Hitler created the Nazi party on various beliefs.

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The whole think I honestly believe is covered very well by what we currently have:</p>
<dl>
<dd>In 1940, the ACLU formally barred communists from leadership or staff positions, and would take the position that it did not want communists as members either. The board declared that it was "inappropriate for any person to serve on the governing committees of the Union or its staff, who is a member of any political organization which supports totalitarian dictatorship in any country, or who by his public declarations indicates his support of such a principle." [3] [4] The purge, which was led by Baldwin, himself a former supporter of Communism, began with the ouster of Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a member of both the Communist Party of the USA and the IWW [5]. The ACLU has been criticized by some of its later members for this policy, and in the 1960s there was an internal push to remove this prohibition. [6]</dd>
</dl>
<p>We cover that one of the founders was a Communist, and we cover his later actions as well that provide the full picture. BTW, the source of the Baldwin quote is a college yearbook; if you really want a Baldwin quote from the time of the NCLB founding, then I think we should find something more notable.</p>

<dl>
<dd>This wiki stuff is over my head. I'll leave it as is, but I don't agree with you. I say it is misleading to say on a page about an organization that the organization later disallowed communists when the whole truth is that the organization was created to use the legal system to bring communism to the USA in the founders own words and we have those words. Further, the communist purge may have been an intentional showing of the flag just when people started questioning the un-American activities of the ACLU -- and that has not been even addressed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Further, the argument about the yearbook is not persuasive either. If he wrote it, he wrote it. If the source is true and accurate, it's true and accurate. After all, a college thesis is just a college thesis and carries no weight like a college yearbook, right? So why has Hillary Clinton worked as hard as she has to hide her college work if it was not "notable."</dd>

<dd>I don't know what the quote in question is, or what Hitler and Marie Curie have to do with it. But it would seem that the only relevance such a quote would have is if it has become the focus of criticism of the ACLU. Baldwin graduated in, I think, 1907, and spent most of the next decade working with pacifists, anarchists, and the IWW. In 1920, when he founded the ACLU, he had een working most closely with the IWW, which at that point was as strongly identified with anarchism as with communism. All of which is to say that he was a leftist radical, but not wedded to any one group. I would suggest that we enhance the rather small article on his page, rather than bring in what seems like a very extraneous detail to this page. Ethan Mitchell 13:22, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Great quote. If it's legitimate (there is no citation on the linked page) it should definitely go to Baldwin's page, as it is a really explicit statement of belief. It does not, however, mention the ACLU per se, and since Baldwin worked with many different organizations, it would bit of a stretch to say that this quote embodies his vision of what the ACLU was about.

<p>What is the proper way to dispute the relevance or propriety of a citation? The History section ends with a citation about an effort in the 1960's to remove the prohibition on Communists as members. The citation leads to an unsourced 2005 blog entry, not a "reliable source." Is there a Wiki markup tag to say "<i>Better</i> citation needed"?</p>
<p>Also, somebody has added a characterization of the "no Communists" policy as McCarthyite, which strikes me as POV. The same blog cited for the 1960s rollback of that policy makes the case that not all efforts to exclude Communists from something are necessarily McCarthyism. Any discussion on this?

<dd>Done. I fact-tagged the McCarthyite characterization, the bit about "many leftist attorneys" identifying another group as "superior," and the 1960s "push" to change the policy. The first two aren't cited, and the last isn't cited adequately. In a couple of days I'll see what's developed. Chester320 04:28, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">July 8 edits</span></h2>
<p>Today I performed some of the edits I mentioned a few sections back, and others. (See "Introduction of a new editor" above.)</p>
<p>I removed one of the two citations regarding banning Communist members in 1940, since the link doesn't have any information about the period 1939-1949 any more. The deleted link was to <a href="http://www.aclu-mass.org/about/about_history.html" class="external free" title="http://www.aclu-mass.org/about/about_history.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aclu-mass.org/about/about_history.html</a>. I didn't alter the later items in the History section that I fact-tagged just yesterday.</p>
<p>I removed this text:</p>

</dl>
<p>This paragraph presents a fact without any context or conclusion. It may be true and interesting, but it belongs somewhere else in the article and should have more behind it. Perhaps it could go in a section called "ACLU policies deemed by critics to be hypocritical" or something.</p>
<p>I removed the internment text from the Structure section, because it is an argument in progress and doesn't illustrate national/local structure. Here is the deleted text:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The ACLU's involvement in the internment of Japanese in the United States during World War II, which bears on the question of the autonomy of local ACLU chapters, is often misunderstood or misrepresented. There are differing ideas on the role the ACLU took: some have argued that the ACLU remained silent on the issue, while others have claimed that the national branch of the ACLU threatened to revoke the chapter status of the ACLU of Northern California for defending Toyosaburo Korematsu in the Supreme Court in <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korematsu_v._United_States_0a56.html" title="Korematsu v. United States">Korematsu v. United States</a>, <span class="plainlinksneverexpand"><a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=323&amp;page=214" class="external text" title="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=323&amp;page=214" rel="nofollow">323 U.S. 214</a> (1944)</span>. These arguments are hard to square with the fact that the national branch of the ACLU actually filed a brief of amicus curiae with the court on behalf of Mr. Korematsu.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, the ACLU argued that some internments may have been necessary for the security of the nation, but that by interning Americans without giving them a hearing, the military was violating their right to due process. The ACLU argued that the internments should have civilian oversight, instead of military, and that the Japanese in the camps had been interned on the basis of racial discrimination.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I removed the "public defender" paragraph because I think it's not an apt comparison: the ACLU defending unpopular speech does not compare with public defenders, who exist to defend those who can't afford lawyers. If I'm wrong, if somebody can show that a major (secondary) part of a public defender's job is defending those whom nobody else will defend for <i>political</i> reasons (not financial), I'll drop this objection. The text is still wishy-washy, thought ("Some have expressed..."?) Here is the deleted text:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Some have expressed the view that the ACLU sometimes plays a role comparable to that played by <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_defender.html" title="Public defender">public defenders</a>, helping to ensure that even unpopular defendants receive due process.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I added citations for the ACLU's rejection of Ford and Rockefeller Foundation grants, including the NYTimes characterization of the ACLU's reasoning. I didn't find a cite on aclu.org, which would be the best source for anything saying <i>why</i> the ACLU did something.</p>
<p>I removed this stub: "Another key donor is <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_B._Lewis_f36e.html" title="Peter B. Lewis">Peter B. Lewis</a> (an insurance magnate) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/08/national/08aclu.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/08/national/08aclu.html" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>." Why mention this guy?</p>
<p>I tweaked some other sections without deleting anything of substance (I hope). I refrained from adding fact tags to every statement that characterized the position either of the ACLU or of some type of critic, though <b>such statements all should have citations.</b></p>
<p>I removed two links that might find another home in the article. The section is "Religious critics" and the text was "While the ACLU has defended the right of people to practice religion, including Christianity (see, <i>e.g</i>, Refs. <a href="http://www.aclu.org/religion/frb/23445prs20060112.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aclu.org/religion/frb/23445prs20060112.html" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>, <a href="http://www.aclu.org/religion/govtfunding/22354prs20051206.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aclu.org/religion/govtfunding/22354prs20051206.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>), it still has religious critics." That's POV defensiveness talking. I changed the lead to "The ACLU also has religious critics."</p>
<p>I think the sections on critics, especially the ones on liberal and libertarian critics, go into the weeds in a few places, characterizing groups and their attitudes without citations and using too many weasel words like "some" and "many," but all I could bring myself to do tonight is remove the redundant paragraph about the Nazi march in Skokie. That event is covered earlier in the article.</p>

I believe that Positions, Activism and Controversial stances should be grouped together because they explain what the ACLU does and what its stances are. Notable cases should come next because it illustrates the above sections. Funding is the last section about the ACLU itself.

<dd>OK, the activism section will contain pro, con material. As an example, the ACLU attempted to block Judge Samuel Alito from the supreme court.

<p>Try to stay away from "pro/con" opinions, and save them for the "Critics" section; <i>i.e.</i>, I would try to keep things to a history of the stances alone. Also, try to bring in as much historical stuff as you can; much better to have a historically informed section than just a listing of current or recent positions (e.g., I would say that the ACLU's stance on Bork would be much more important than the Alito nom.) <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 19:44, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Religious critics section</span></h2>
<p>This section lists a number of religious (Christian) critics, and also mentions that the ACLU has often defended the rights of minority religious groups. This is true, but (I believe) that it leaves the mistaken impression that the ACLU rarely or never defends the rights of Christians. However, the ACLU has often defended the rights of Christians. See this <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~aasch/ACLUFightsForChristians.htm" class="external text" title="http://home.comcast.net/~aasch/ACLUFightsForChristians.htm" rel="nofollow">website</a> which lists several such cases, and provides links to ACLU press releases or news accounts.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how this could be addressed, if others agree. Perhaps the mention that the ACLU often defends minority religious groups doesn't belong in the "religions critics" section, and could be moved to "notable cases" or "positions" section.Sjrnyc 15:34, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sjrnyc, you're onto something. The ACLU article doesn't have a "criticism section" per se but instead has "Critics of the ACLU" sections. In places the critics are even defamed and the ACLU is defended. A lot of editors don't like criticism sections. Wikipedia is the only encyclopedia that includes criticisms sections to my knowledge, poor format and too problematic.</dd>

<dd>I think I'd make reference to the fact that the ACLU defends all religions, with the inclusion of a couple of Christian cases, instead of moving the references you mention.--<a href="../../../s/c/r/User%7EScribner_94ed.html" title="User:Scribner">Scribner</a> 22:40, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The most vocal critics of the ACLU are religious critics. Separation of church and state issues are and have been the primary function of the ACLU since it's inception, am I correct? To exclude religious Democrats and independents as critics of ACLU activities is POV and is factually incorrect.</p>

This is a large black church in Memphis: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/05/us/05liberty.html?ex=1309752000&amp;en=633335bb68bac96a&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" class="external text" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/05/us/05liberty.html?ex=1309752000&amp;en=633335bb68bac96a&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss" rel="nofollow">the Statue of Liberation Through Christ</a>. <s>I'll change it.</s>--<a href="../../../s/c/r/User%7EScribner_94ed.html" title="User:Scribner">Scribner</a> 05:23, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, I don't think that church and state issues are or have been the primary function. The article says "In the year of its birth, the ACLU was formed to protect aliens threatened with deportation, and U.S. nationals threatened with criminal charges by U.S. Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer for their communist or socialist activities and agendas (see Palmer Raids). It also opposed attacks on the rights of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and other labor unions to meet and organize." As for today, I don't see a single article on religious issues on the front page of the ACLU today.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 05:28, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your right, I'm clearly wrong about the, "'primary function' of the ACLU since it's inception." I do however believe the "most vocal critcs" to be religious. Here's about nineteen <a href="http://www.reclaimamerica.org/Pages/News/news.aspx?story=2859" class="external text" title="http://www.reclaimamerica.org/Pages/News/news.aspx?story=2859" rel="nofollow">links to cases</a>.

<p>I think the debate is not totally useful -- figuring out who is the "most vocal" is pretty tough! So I've altered the sentence to something that I think needs no sourcing: "many critics are conservative." <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 18:06, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
