	    <p>Some Wise Sayings of Prophet Muhammad "Peace be upon him" .</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>To acquire knowledge is binding upon all Muslims, whether male or female.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The ink of the scholar is more holy than the blood of the martyr.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He who travels in the search of knowledge, to him God shows the way of Paradise.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>People from the time of Adam onwards are as equal as the teeth of a comb. Arabs are not superior to non Arabs, nor are Redskinned people better than Blacks. No superiority or virture exists except in terms of Piety.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Hail to those who are so concerned with improving their own faults, that they abstain from preoccupation with the flaws of other believers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He, who is a parasite to others, shall be condemned in the eyes of God, the Almighty.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Quest for knowledge I cherish, superior to God's worship.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The most virtuous from among you are those privileged with scrupulous manners. Likewise, theu associate with others; while they also get along with them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He who indulges in a task without proper knowledge will deteriorate rather than improve the case.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He who betrays the vicious deed of another in public, it is as though he has initiated the evil act himself.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not argue with your brother, nor depress him with sarcastic humor, and do not make a promise so as to fail in fulfilling your covenant.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Whensoever you are presented with a gift, make efforts to return the deed; if it is beyond your ability express your gratitude in words.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not set up to accomplish a virtuous deed pretentiously, However, do not abandon righteousness due to shyness.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Whomsoever intiates a graceful tradition; shall be rewarded as long as that tradition is sustained.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is no good in extravagence, however, there can never be extravagence in good deeds.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Opportunities slide away like clouds.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Victory is gained by resolution and determination.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>During the days of your life, divine breezes will blow, so watch out for them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Establish contact with those who have severed relations with you, and be good to those who have treated you badly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He who covets another's property, his sorrow shall be prolonged.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Whenever a wise and sincere man advises you, take heed and welcome it gladly.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There are two characteristics which cannot be found together in a believer; Avarice and a Vicious temper.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Blessed be those who spend their excess wealth and abstain from excessive talk.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He who calls upon his fellow Believer without their being any need, is destined to be among God's visitors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Whomsoever satisfies the need of a fellow Believer God shall meet his many needs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The most vicious among all men is he who is respected out of fear.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I restrain you from three traits of character: Envy, Avarice and Arrogance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The true Muslim is the one from whose hand and tongue other Muslims are safe.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Excessive requests from people lead to humiliation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Beware of obstinacy; since it begins with foolishness and ends in regret.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Whatever you hate for yourself hate for others, and whatever you like for yourself , like for your brother.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Adopt a cordial attitude towards your relatives and neighbours and with whomever you keep company and associate.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is no worship like Meditation, and there is no support more sure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Beware of too much laughter, since it mortifies the heart.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The love of the world, is the root of all evils.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Appreciate five things before five others: Your Youth before your Old age, Your Health before your illness, Your Wealth before your Poverty, Your Spare Time before your hard work and Your Life before Death.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It is better to associate with a good friendthan to remain in solitude, while being alone is better than dealing with a vicious companion.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Be neither a fault finder, an eulogist, a defamer nor a wrangler.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Social gatherings should be marked by good faith, divulging the secret of a friend is breach of faith.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I restrain you from abandoning your fellow Believers: Though in case you are obliged to do so, it should not last for more than three days.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He who is ina position to administer punishment should all the more be encouraged to forgive.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The best of men is he who refrains from that which does not concern him.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The best attire of man is severity associated with faith.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Take care not to abuse a Muslim, or accuse an honest man of lying.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There is no quicker way to receive punishment than by committing an outrage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Paradise lies at the feet of thy mother.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He who wishes to enter Paradise must please his father and mother.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A man giving in alms one piece of silver in his lifetime is better for him than giving one hundred when about to die.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To meet friends cheerfully and invite them to a feast are charitable acts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To extend consideration towards neighbors and send them presents are charitable acts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Keep yourselves far from envy, because it eats up and takes away good actions, like the fire that eats up and burns wood.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Whoever suppresses his anger, when he has in his power to show it, God will give him a great reward.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>He is not strong and powerful, who throws people down, but he is strong who withholds himself from anger.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Deal gently with a people, and be not harsh; cheer them and condemn not.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Much silence and a good disposition; there are no two works better than these.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The best of friends is he who is best in behavior and character.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One who does not practice modestiy and does not refrain from shameless deeds is not a Muslim.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>No one who keeps his mind focussed entirely upon himself, can grow large, strong and beautiful in character.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Whoever loves to meet God, God loves to meet him.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The five stated prayers erase the sins which have been committed during the intervals between them if they have not been mortal sins.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>God is not merciful to him who is not so to humankind. He who is not kind to God's creation and to his own children, God will not be kind to him.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Whosoever visits a sick person, an angel calls from Heaven: "Be happy in the world and happy be your walking; and take your habitation in Paradise."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Wealth properly employed is a blessing; and a man may lawfully endeavour to increase it by honest means.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Acquire knowledge, because he who acquires it, in the way of the Lord, performs an act of piety; who speaks of it praises the Lord; who seeks it, adores God, who dispenses instruction in it, bestows alms; and who imparts it to its fitting objects, performs an act of devotion to God. Knowledge enables its possessor to distinguish what is forbidden from what is not; lights the way to Heaven; it is our friend in the desert, our companion in solitude, our companion, when bereft of riends; it guides us to happiness; it sustains us in misery; it is our ornament in the company of friends; it serves as an armor against our enemies. With knowledge the creatures of Allah rises to the heights of goodness and to noble position, associates with the sovereigns in this world and attains the perfection of happiness in the next.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>Meditation in God is my Capital. Reason and sound Logic is the rest of my Religion. Love is the Foundationof my existence. Enthusiasm is the Vehicle of my life. Contemplation of God is my companion. Faith is the source of my Power. Sorrow is my friend. Knowledge is my weapon. Patience is my Garb abd Virtue. Submission to the Divine Will, is my Pride. Truth is my Salvation. Worship is my habit. And in Prayer lies the coolness of my Eye and the Peace of Mind.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p>A bedouin came to the holy prophet Muhammad (s) and asked him some questions.</p>
<p>Bedouin: I wish to be the richest person in the world.</p>
<p>Prophet: Be content and you will be the richest person in the world.</p>
<p>Bedouin: I would like to be the most learned of people.</p>
<p>Prophet: Fear Allah and you will be the most learned of people.</p>
<p>Bedouin: I would like to be the most just of people.</p>
<p>Prophet: Desire for others what you would like for yourself and you would be the most just of people.</p>
<p>Bedouin: I would like to be the best of people.</p>
<p>Prophet: Be good to others and you will be the best of people.</p>
<p>Bedouin: I would like to be the most honorable of people.</p>
<p>Prophet: If you do not complain to any fellow humans you will be the most honorable of people.</p>
<p>Bedouin: I wish to be safe from Allah's Wrath on the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>Prophet: If you do not lose your temper with any of your fellow humans, you will be safe from Allah's wrath on the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p>Bedouin: What are the worst evils in the sight of Allah?</p>
<p>Prophet: Hot temper and miserliness (i.e. selfishness with money).</p>
