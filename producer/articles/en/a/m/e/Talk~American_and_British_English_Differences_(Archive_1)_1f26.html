<p>I once had a coworker from Korea and not only couldn't she tell the difference between USA-English and British English, she had trouble telling the difference between different European <i>languages</i>. (Kind of keeps things in perspective, eh?)&#160;:-)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not suprising. While I can easily tell the difference between French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, etc., put me in a room with a Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and a Thai speaker and I probably couldn't tell the difference. (If I saw it written I'd probably have somewhat more luck though.) -- SJK</dd>

<p>Vietnamese has more syllable-final consonants than Japanese, I think you can tell them apart that way, maybe. Is this right? - <a href="../../../j/u/u/User%7EJuuitchan_7720.html" title="User:Juuitchan">Juuitchan</a></p>
<p>Someone suggested: "<a href="../../../h/e/a/Heath_Robinson_c90f.html" title="Heath Robinson">Heath Robinson</a>" and ";<a href="../../../r/u/b/Rube_Goldberg_6866.html" title="Rube Goldberg">Rube Goldberg</a>" as a vocabulary difference. It's certainly an interesting parallel, but I don't think it really belongs here. They were both artists with their own style, and both are known on both sides of the pond although their use as descriptive adjectives is split as suggested. At any rate, they can't quite be considered translations, because as an adjective, "Rube Goldberg" is more specific, describing an overly complex mechanical device or a complex series of interdependent actions; Heath Robinson, in contrast, is more surrealistic or fantasy-oriented. --LDC</p>
<p>As an American, I would like to say that to me a bum is a homeless person as much as the butt, a flat is an apartment, and rubbish certainly is trash. Granted, I agree that a fag is not a cigarette, and underground is not a subway. I may do some actual research, and come back and fiddle with that list. - <a href="../../../e/e/a/User%7EEean_f01f.html" title="User:Eean">Eean</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think Americans certainly <i>understand</i> the use of "bum" for "butt", "rubbish" for "trash", and (to a lesser degree) "flat" for "apartment". But we don't <i>use</i> those terms much. Point to a container for discarded things, and an American will say "that's a trash can"; a Brit will say "that's a <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubbish_bin.html" title="Rubbish bin">rubbish bin</a>". Americans are more likely to use "rubbish" in the sense of "bullshit". --LDC</dd>

<p>I deleted the following pair: "limited (Ltd)" and "<a href="../../../i/n/c/Incorporated.html" title="Incorporated">incorporated</a>", since they actually mean different things. "Incorporated" means a corporation; "limited" means a limited liability corporation (you can also have unlimited liability corporations, and no liability corporations).

<p>I would say 'torch' was much more common than 'pocket lamp' which sounds quite old-fashioned. 'Flashlight' would be more easily recognised than the latter.</p>
<hr />
<p>Yes, I'd call it a "torch", and it would probably be labeled as a "flashlight" in its manufacturer's packaging. IMO, 'torch' is colloquial British English -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a></p>
<p>Oh, so "flashlight" is correct British usage? (My dictionary said [Am.] and the Oxford English Dictionary carried "flashlight" only in the meaning of photography.) Then I'll remove the entry again. --AxelBoldt</p>
<p>No, I disagree, it's only a "torch" in BrE. The term "flashlight" if it occurs is still a striking Americanism, even if a manufacturer calls it that. - <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGritchka_9a6d.html" title="User:Gritchka">Gritchka</a></p>

<p><i>[fanny (UK) = penis (US)? am I right?]</i></p>

<dd>UK "fanny" means "vagina" (as is noted in the UK-to-US section). US "fanny" means "buttocks" (UK "bum"). On top of that, you put that into the US-to-UK section by mistake...&#160;;)</dd>

<dd>You quite possibly may be right. I was simply going on the story of an American exchange student who had spent a year in the UK, and had caused herself extreme embarrassment the first time she referred to the small satchel strapped around her waist as her "fanny pack" (meaning "pack that rides on my butt"). She was told to refer to it as a "bumper pack".

<dd>I believe so as well. Straight "faucet" is more common, at least in the Pacific Northwest, than "tap", but "tap" is still used frequently (the term "tap water" is actually extremely common). I think it should probably be dumped from the page, or at least qualified as something along the lines of "tap alone is usualy understood to reffer to the "tap" of a beer keg, but is not restricted to that". <a href="../../../n/k/n/User%7ENknight_4d92.html" title="User:Nknight">nknight</a> 20:48 Dec 19, 2002 (UTC)</dd>

<p>According to Merriam-Webster OnLine, "stroller" means a pushchair (not a pram, as the article claims). Can someone confirm this? --<a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZundark_7566.html" title="User:Zundark">Zundark</a>, Thursday, June 13, 2002</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Pushchair" seems appropriate. It seems to me that the more usual translation for "pram" (or "perambulator") is "baby buggy" or "baby buggy" or often just simply "buggy". What distinguishes a "stroller" from these is that it is a much lighter object that is used after a child has mastered sitting-up, and has begun to develop his walking skills. A stroller can be collapsed into a carryable object to be brought out when it's time for a nap, or as a threat to a wandering two-year-old's mobility. IMOH there is a trend away from bulky expensive baby-buggies for the pre-ambulatory, and a preference for back-pack and similar arrangements.</dd>
<dd>According to the New Oxford the word "stroller" takes on yet another meaning in South Africa, where it can refer to a young urban vagrant or street child. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology">Eclecticology</a></dd>

<p>On pronunciation, I am puzzled by the claim that AmE collapses the vowels of "all" and "awl", since I don't know of an accent that distinguishes these. They're both [O:l] in BrE and similar accents (such as Australian). - <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGritchka_9a6d.html" title="User:Gritchka">Gritchka</a></p>
<hr />
<p>A couple of points:</p>
<p><i>The "a" of father is used in many British words, especially common ones, in two phonetic situations. Firstly, before three of the four voiceless fricatives, as in path, laugh, chaff, pass, past, though not before sh. Secondly, before some instances of n and another consonant, as in aunt, plant, dance. (Australian does not follow British in this second case.) But by no means all words follow this pattern, e.g. ant is the same as in American.</i></p>
<p>This is far from universal in England, though it is the "received pronunciation". All Northern English accents use the flat "a", as in America.</p>
<p>Secondly, should this page be called "American and English English Differences". The Scottish British is Substantially different, though Welsh English is no more different than regional English usages.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The article begins by describing how Standard British needs to be understood - certain forms of Southern England English. See my remark below on dividing up dialects. There just is no simple name for the non-American variety we're comparing. <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGritchka_9a6d.html" title="User:Gritchka">Gritchka</a></dd>

<p>I have described the british meaning of ass as donkey, burro. My wife (from Texas ) uses burro, but I don't know if this is regional usage or standard AE</p>

<p>Burro is Spanish for donkey. There are a lot of Spanish speakers in Texas so Spanish words are more commonly used by English speakers in Texas than in, say Indiana. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek</a></p>
<hr />
<p>"Ass", "donkey", and "burro" are all standard American English, and should be understood anywhere. Americans generally only use "ass" for its other meanings, and "burro" is more commonly used in Spanish-influenced areas like Texas and California, but they're still all quite common. (As a totally irellevant aside, "burro" is also slang for "buttocks" in Spanish--I'm sure there's an interesting reason for that, but I have no idea what it is.) --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_Daniel_Crocker_4538.html" title="User:Lee Daniel Crocker">LDC</a></p>

<hr />
<p>I would like to add the British/American use of "rubbish" and/or "trash" as a verb, if they have different meanings. In Britain they have two different meanings.</p>
<dl>
<dd>(UK) To rubbish something, is to talk badly about it. He rubbished Fred's house... he said it was useless, run down, untidy etc.</dd>
<dd>(UK) To trash something is to physically destroy it. He trashed Fred's house... he smashed all the windows, broke the furniture etc.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am not sure of the US meanings, are they the same?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>we use "trash" for both. "Rubbish" we (some of us) understand as a noun, but we never use it as a verb. Trash a hotel room, trash a reputation.... This usage does of course call for the occasional clarification. "You mean physically, or he just talked bad about it?" <a href="../../../k/o/y/User%7EKoyaanis_Qatsi_7ab5.html" title="User:Koyaanis Qatsi">--KQ</a></dd>

<p>Chris Q - thanks for fixing the comment on RP - I was just going back to do it - honest!</p>
<p>A comment about the singular "they" - surely this is not solely an aspect of British English - I've heard it used just about everywhere (US, Oz, NZ, that is) as a less cumbersome version of he/she (ditto "their" instead of "his/her"). There's an etymological justice to this: "you" was originally plural only, the singular was "thou", but "thou" died out and got replaced by it's plural. - <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManning_Bartlett_95ec.html" title="User:Manning Bartlett">Manning</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>The statement as it appears in the article is confusing, but I <i>think</i> it's trying to say that the use of singular they is somewhat more acceptable in writen usage in Britain than in the US. I have no idea if this is true. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a></dd>

<p>How about "Oriental" traditionally in British English it refers to the middle-east, but in US English and in modern British English it refers to the east asia area ?</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think we (British) use "Oriental" to refer to the far east, Orientals are what Americans would call Asians. In the US refering to someone as Oriental is non-PC.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>During the Victorian period "Oriental" often meant the Middle-East. By the time of World War II the term meant the Far East. The "East" was often linked with the Silk Route to China and the countries associated with it. The area around Malaysia, Thailand, etc. were referred to as the &amp;quot;South Sea". I think it is just one of those terms that changed its meaning during the Imperial period.</dd>

<p><i>Though most English accents pronounce the T's in words as a distinctive T it is common, particularly in Estuary English? to replace the T with a glottal stop.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Does anyone know the rules for this, for example "I stopped at the pottery on Saturday" would be pronounced as "I s<b>t</b>opped at the po'ery on Sa'urday". Why is the T in stopped pronounced?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would assume only intervocalic T's are realized as glottal stops. In 'stopped' it's part of a consonant cluster rather than sitting between nice comfy vowels where it can sink into the cushions of the mouth and stop in the glottis. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a></dd>

<dd>This is where the idea of "British" English breaks down. Different dialects handle this differently. Some use glottal stops commonly whereas others use them only rarely. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a></dd>

<dd>If anyone can devise a culturally neutral name for picking out the Standard British dialect, I shall be eternally grateful. Essentially the main dialects are Southern British, Northern British, Scottish, American, and Caribbean. The Southern British dialect covers a host of different accents, RP and Estuary and Welsh and Australasian and South African. 'Standard British' is okay to cover RP and Estuary, but we want a term that includes the southern hemisphere accents and is opposed as a whole to American (as a vocabulary source) or to Standard American (rhotic accents only). Any takers? ;-) <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGritchka_9a6d.html" title="User:Gritchka">Gritchka</a></dd>

<dd>On the specific point of glottalling, traditional RP has none and London Cockney (<i>not</i> a form of Standard British) probably only keeps [t] initially and after [s], as in <i>tar, star, dust, dusty</i>, and I'm not even sure about <i>dust</i>. Elsewhere it's [?], as in [wEn?] <i>went</i>, [wIn?a] <i>winter</i> etc. The modern form of RP and full-blown Estuary English are intermediate. An RP speaker these days will probably use [?] before a consonant, in casual speech: [nQ? ri:li] <i>not really</i>. The change to Estuary includes more glottalling, intervocalic and final: [nQ? @ lQ?] <i>not a lot</i>. Estuary seems to be replacing RP as de facto standard, so this tendency will count as, if it does not yet, part of Standard British. <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGritchka_9a6d.html" title="User:Gritchka">Gritchka</a></dd>

<p>I'm an American and "ameba" looks laughably misspelled to me; I was surprised to note that the dictionary I checked listed it as an alternate spelling, as I too have never seen it used. At such it's a poor and misleading example. Perhaps it was more common in the past, or in certain quarters? "Esthetic" seems okay, though. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrion_VIBBER_bae4.html" title="User:Brion VIBBER">Brion</a> 03:03 Dec 21, 2002 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ameba is by no means uncommon, though perhaps less common than "amoeba". Regardless of how it looks or whether it's "correct" or not, lots of Americans indisputably spell it as "ameba", (including some biology texts, incidentally); therefore I have to say I think it's a perfectly valid example. <a href="../../../k/w/e/User%7EKwertii_f6e2.html" title="User:Kwertii">User:kwertii</a></p>

<dd>The British expression "I couldn't care less" is rendered as "I could care less" in the US. To a British English speaker this appears to mean the opposite.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm a native American English speaker, and I think both of these expressions are synonyms meaning "I do not care at all." Any other American types agree? And what is the British meaning of these two?</p>

<dd>No, it is an American idiom. It doesn't make sense but millions of people say it. It has nothing to to with laziness. It means "I don't care."

<dd>Not really. We Americans have both words:
<ul>
<li><i>normality</i> means all the normal things, including chemistry, etc.</li>
<li><i>normalcy</i> means "the usual condition of things, particularly political, social, or economic", as in, "the return to normalcy after the war".</li>

</dd>
<dd>It is popular to consider <i>normalcy</i> an irregular usage, but it is far too common in this single specialized meaning to be disdained. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrtolan88_d8ce.html" title="User:Ortolan88">Ortolan88</a></dd>

<p>In <a href="../../../h/i/b/Hiberno-English_4eb6.html" title="Hiberno-English">Hiberno-English</a> 'ride' is slang for 'sex' or someone who you want to a sex with, as in 'He is a ride'. I am not sure if it exists in British-English. (One one notorious TV moment, a gang of Irish tourists being followed by a TV programme went into hysterics at the sight of an American tour guide in Disneyland, who told them (and couldn't understand why it was producing such merriment) how Disneyland had the biggest 'rides' in America, how she loved 'riding' everywhere around Disneyland, how tourists came from all over the world to 'ride' in Disneyland, and how she had possibly had more 'rides' in Disneyland than anyone else. Result: fifteen Irish people with tears in their eyes from laughing, almost collapsing onto the group, as the woman says "Gee. You Irish! Ok. You wanna ride with me?" Does anyone know if 'ride' has the same sexual meanings in British-English as Hiberno-English? (Obviously, unless the Disneyland Madam didn't know her American-English, 'ride' doesn't have sexual connotations in the US.) <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JTD</a> 21:37 Feb 16, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No. Ride in that context isn't used in British English, except where it might be blatently obvious that you mean a euphemism for sex. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMintguy_d760.html" title="User:Mintguy">Mintguy</a></dd>

<p><i>Yes,</i> Jessie <i>is a slang term meaning camp queen (which on this side of the Atlantic is a camp gay man) or in some areas simply gay. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JTD</a> 02:03 Feb 18, 2003 (UTC)</i></p>
<p>Does 'Randy' not mean . . . well . . . randy (ie, sex-mad or sex-starved and look for sex) in the US? On a totally different point - do we include words that mean the same but in a different context in either the US or UK mean the opposite of what you would presume? For example:</p>
<p>In the US - <b>public school</b> means ordinary school In the UK - <b>public school</b> means fee paying elitist <i>private</i> school. eg, Eton. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JTD</a> 01:18 Feb 17, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In rural southern Ontario Protestant english (I can't speak for other areas or for the minority of people who went through Catholic schools) a <b>public school</b> is the school one goes to before high school (or before Junior High if there happens to be one). It is equivalent to elementary school. --p. stoltzfus</dd>
</dl>
<p>No, <i>randy</i> has no sexual connotation in the US at all. -- <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>Since <i><a href="../../../a/u/s/Austin_Powers_25dc.html" title="Austin Powers">Austin Powers</a></i>, a lot of Americans are at least aware of the meaning as a Britishism, though no one really uses it. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a></dd>

<p>What does <i>camp</i> (as a description of a person) mean in the US? In Britain it refers to an overtly feminate, foppish homosexual male. I get the impression that in the US it is used to describe what we would call a "ham actor". It does not appear to have homosexual connotations. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Q_1529.html" title="User:Chris Q">Chris Q</a> 07:30 Feb 19, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It does have that connotation, I think, but to a much lesser degree. Most Americans would never think of describing a gay man as <i>camp</i>, though many or most would get it if someone else did so. In this sense, the word is simply not used in the US. From a literary POV, on college campuses and the like, <i>camp</i> refers to (I think) movies and plays and such that are not enjoyed on the basis of how good they are, but on the basis of how bad they are due to ham acting and other weaknesses. In spite of this, the term is also used to describe genuinely quality stories like <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show_04d4.html" title="The Rocky Horror Picture Show">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a></i> which is camp because it is flamboyantly sexually ambiguous and does not rely on traditional notions of quality in order to tell its story (still a connection to <i>flaming</i> homosexuals, a much more common term that may be unique to the US). In conclusion, I don't know, though most Americans would never think of referring to an outrageously feminine gay man with <i>camp</i>, even if they understand what it means. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a></dd>

<dd>I may have misinterpeted you. In the US, if the average person sees a flaboyantly gay man on the street, they'd say "wow, that dude is flaming". Nobody would say "wow, that dude is camp". <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a></dd>

<dd>No your explanation is fine. It seems that <i>camp</i> in the US is one of those difficult to pin down concepts.
