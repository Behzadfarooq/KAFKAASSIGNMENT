<p>Perhaps a section documenting common missuages or confusions of terms might be appropriate?

To expand on the topic in this article would detract from its primary purpose. When creating this article, it was intentionally decided to only model it on <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Isles_%28terminology%29_c1f3.html" title="British Isles (terminology)">British Isles (terminology)</a> in title only precisely because of that article's volume and lack of focus/sourcing.

<p>I'd like to suggest that <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas_%28terminology%29.html" title="Americas (terminology)">Americas (terminology)</a> be moved to <a href="../../../a/m/e/America.html" title="America">America</a>.</p>
<p>"America" has historically meant the entire continent (or as some geographers might say, "both continents"). It is not just the country which evolved from the 13 British colonies into "the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States of America</a>". At all times during this evolution, the "USA" consisted of only a small portion and there has been plenty left over.</p>
<p>Geographically, <a href="../../../a/m/e/America_%28continent%29.html" title="America (continent)">America (continent)</a> has been divided (at least in the English speaking world) into <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>. However, socially and culturally there is another significant division: <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-America_aae9.html" title="Anglo-America">Anglo-America</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>.</p>
<p>In the Spanish language, the terms <i>norteamerica</i> and <i>norteamericano</i> do <b>not</b> include <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> or <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_America_93d9.html" title="Central America">Central America</a>. Curiously, in English the terms "North America" and "North American" typically <b>do include</b> them. This causes confusion or irritation to Mexicans and other residents of "the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">Americas</a>".</p>
<ul>
<li>A Mexican will typically say that he is "an American" since the continent he was born on is called <i>America</i> (at least in his own language).</li>
<li>A Mexican will rarely or never refer to himself as a <i>norteamericano</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pimsleur's Spanish (a language course geared toward native speakers of English) cautions students to be aware of the usage of the Spanish term <i>norteamericano</i> and how it relates to the U.S. usage of "American" and "North American". --<a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 17:07, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>At the moment the article <a href="../../../a/m/e/America.html" title="America">America</a> is doing an excellent job of (1) being a disambiguation page for the various meanings and uses of the word <i>America</i> that might prompt a Wikipedia user to enter it into the search field and (2) attracting vandals and the like away from other articles. The article <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas_%28terminology%29.html" title="Americas (terminology)">Americas (terminology)</a>, on the other hand, treats some of the issues you've brought up above. I don't see a reason to move the latter into the space held by the former. At this time, the article <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas_%28terminology%29.html" title="Americas (terminology)">Americas (terminology)</a> does not treat how Spanish-speakers label various areas of the western hemisphere. There is another article (<a href="../../../u/s/e/Use_of_the_word_American_8aee.html" title="Use of the word American">Use of the word American</a>) that does discuss how American is used differently by both Spanish- and English-speakers. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 17:48, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

No one, except U.S. citizens and some Britons and other English-speakers (but not all), refer to the U.S. as America. I personally know people from at least 20 nations in the world (America, Europe, Asia and Oceania) that do not call the United States as "America". The only place you will see foreigners calling the U.S. "America" will be in films and movies made in the U.S. --Cuyaya 12:30, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The problem is the weight of that use. In the U.S., <i>America</i> and <i>American</i> are used to mean the United States in a constant, pervasive, overwhelming way. This use is as likely to cease in the United States as its citizens are to give up English for Mandarin Chinese. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 13:54, 23 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is an international and global resource and thus, if you say "commonly refered to as America", it would incorrectly imply that everyone around the world calls the U.S. 'America'. Reference to the fact that only U.S. citizens do so is imperative in this case to convey what really goes on in the world. If this were "Wikipedia U.S.A", then so be it, but it's Wikipedia English.--Cuyaya 18:12, 23 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"What really goes on in the world" is that <i>America</i> is a common noun and <i>American</i> a common adjective for the United States. Is it illogical? Yes. Is it misguided? Sure. Does it cause translation problems with Spanish. Definitely. But I'm not sure why the Spanish language should disrupt the English Wikipedia. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 20:13, 23 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It is common, but only in the U.S.. And it has nothing to do with Spanish translations or any other language. Also, I deal with Britons all the time at work, and they preffer to use the expresion "The States". If a clear and truthful explanation can be given, why omit it? I won't argue with you the fact that the adjective <i>American</i> IS used worldwide, but that's another issue, which I am not denying. --Cuyaya 12:38, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hawkfly, I don't see the need for your new second paragraph. Will Wikipedia readers find this article excepting treatment of the United States? As you write yourself, no one uses Americas in the plural to refer to the United States.

<p>I agree and have nixed this contribution. First, while not necessarily disagreeable, it is <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">unsourced</a>. Second, the article already clearly delineates various meanings. Third, the syntax and grammar leave much to be desired. Lastly, the usage note is better dealt with elsewhere (e.g., <a href="../../../u/s/e/Use_of_the_word_American_8aee.html" title="Use of the word American">Use of the word American</a>).

<p>I went to a bookstore in New York City yesterday. They had a nice, rolled-up wall map showing North and South America <b>labelled collectively as America</b>.

<p>I daresay "the Americas" is more a term which refers to the several entities called "(blank) America".

<p>There is no use fighting over this, merely because there is a fight over the Use of the term American.

<dd>The physical definition of North America is north of South America. So, in the geophysical section, I think they should fall under North America.

<dl>
<dd>I agree with defusing edit wars, which is the intent of this article and I believe it has held rather well since its creation, but different interpretations are now being interposed without <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">citations</a>: everything in the article (at least previously) was based on this. That's why the status quo (with an alphabetical rearrangement of items) is both correct and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">impartial</a> vis a is a hierarchical one.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Otherwise, I'm unsure what the point of the above and recent edits are. We should not be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">'defining' anything</a>: citations et al. should guide content editions ... and I see little of that above. Plate tectonics is but one aspect of physiography (physical geography). And while I'm a big supporter of the UN geoscheme, we must not place undue weight on it given other definitions cited. Moreover given that the content and maps have prevailed for some time without any changes and are not incorrect (how are they, BTW?), and with proposed changes not indicated or unclear, I see little reason to change them now; . 65.92.173.34 19:08, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
