<h2><span class="mw-headline">Adverbs-: missing 'ly' in American English</span></h2>
<p>Since when have many adverbs lost the ending 'ly' in the US? It has become impossible to distinguish between the adverb and adjective in many cases. E.G: "He'll be here real soon now" (International: really soon now) Sounds very strange to this writer because I think 'real' is an adjective but the US example above treats it as an adverb (modifying the verb 'be') - Clive</p>
<p>Formally speaking, 'real' is an adjective in American English and 'really' is the adverb. However, it is common in informal American speech to drop the -ly where there is no ambiguity, so whether or not that counts as a difference is a matter of interpretation. As an American, if I saw 'real' used as an adverb on wikipedia, I would correct it. - Rob</p>
<p>"Many" adverbs have not lost the -ly suffix. Only a few have. However, as is often the case in irregularities in English dialects, they happen to be more common adverbs <a href="../../../d/o/g/User%7EDogface_68d5.html" title="User:Dogface">Dogface</a> 22:09, 20 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm an American, and my dictionary (Webster's New World Dictionary of American English) says "real" is a colloquial expression for "very". "Really" would be more proper (I don't even recall myself ever using "real" in this sense). --<a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvice_796f.html" title="User:Evice">Evice</a> 16:47, Dec 30, 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>No adverbs that have "-ly" endings have lost them in American English. It's that people sometimes incorrectly use adjectival forms instead of adverbial forms. The adverbs themselves haven't changed. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 20:22, May 21, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Tap vs. faucet in Canadian English</span></h2>
<p>Am I right in thinking that Canadians, perhaps in an attempt to preserve some differences from their southern neighbours, also use <i>tap</i> rather than <i>faucet</i>? <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimfbleak_6698.html" title="User:Jimfbleak">jimfbleak</a></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Tap</i> is much more common in Canada; I believe there's even research on it. I've heard <i>tap</i> all my long life, though, so in that period it wasn't introduced as a deliberate alternative to <i>faucet</i>. <a href="../../../j/f/i/User%7EJfitzg_e6e1.html" title="User:Jfitzg">Jfitzg</a></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Using 'and' in a number</span></h2>
<p>[continued from Tap vs Faucet] I've just thought of one difference. In Europe, we say 'two thousand and three' for 2003 (I to be alkward say 20-0-3!) whereas americans say 'two thousand three' not using the 'and'. Is this widespread or just a phenomenon associated with news anchors? <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JTD</a> 07:52 Feb 19, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's pretty widespread. Here in Canada I even had someone try to "correct" me when I wrote "one hundred and twenty dollars" on a cheque, with the claim that meant $100.20, which I thought was ridiculous. <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagpuss_947b.html" title="User:Bagpuss">Bagpuss</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, I remember being taught in school (in California) not to put an "and" after thousands and hundreds, and I think that's still considered standard usage. --<a href="../../../a/t/e/User%7EAtemperman_2e3f.html" title="User:Atemperman">Atemperman</a> 17:20, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was taught the same thing in 8th grade in Ohio — only use "and" for separating fractional units from whole units — but in common speech I often hear it both ways. I've updated the article to mention this. I am wondering if there is some historical legal reason for it, because it's the way we're supposed(?) to spell out the dollars and cents when writing a check (cheque). I am wondering if at one time, the spelling was enforced by law, or if it has just been a matter of convention that became entrenched somehow. - <a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMjb_eccd.html" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a> 16:07, 31 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>So - What do Americans call "<a href="../../../a/_/s/2001%7E_A_Space_Odyssey_067d.html" title="2001: A Space Odyssey">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>"? I've never heard anyone call it anthing other than "Two thousand <b>and</b> one: A Space Odyssey". I've never heard it called "Twenty oh one: a Space Odyssey".

<dd>I call it "two thousand one," just like I call this year "two thousand five." Never heard anything but "a hundred and one" for the Dalmations, though. Like <a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMjb_eccd.html" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a> I was taught at a young age that "and" was only for introducing the fractional part. This was in Pennsylvania. In practice, though, using "and" after the hundreds or thousands is fairly common in the US. -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConeslayer_540b.html" title="User:Coneslayer">Coneslayer</a> 15:47, 2005 Apr 1 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Two thousand one" here. I'd be surprised if I heard someone say "two thousand and one"! I wouldn't consider it necessary to 'correct' them on it, though. Strangely, I hear "one hundred one" and "one hundred and one" about equally often. - <a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMjb_eccd.html" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a> 19:49, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Newsreaders is an old term from the time when <i>actors</i> rather than journalists 'read' the news, becoming professional news<i>readers</i>. (Kenneth Kendall in the UK and Charles Mitchell in Ireland spring to mind.) By the 1980s, most stations used professional journalists, who to show their journalistic cred insisted on being called news<i>casters</i> to show they weren't mere actors reading someone else's script. Call a newscaster a newsreader is a bit like calling Rev. Jerry Falwell a catholic: you better duck before you get a punch!!! (But the term still is used, to the fury of journalists. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">JTD</a> 08:03 Feb 19, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>The word <b>inflammable</b> is not used in American English. I suspect that many Americans would be highly confused by it. They might guess that it means "fireproof", the opposite of <i>flammable</i>, which is what warning signs in the US say. However, if an American saw <i>inflammable</i> on a warning sign, they could possibly figure the correct meaning out from context. (<i>fireproof</i> would be an advertising claim, not a warning)</p>
<p>According to my dictionary, <i>flammable</i> and <i>inflammable</i> mean the same thing. <i>Flammable</i> is always used on warning signs in the US. The use of <i>inflammable</i>, though technically correct, is considered too confusing.</p>
<p>The terms <i>combustible</i>, <i>flammable</i>, <i>highly flammable</i>, <i>explosive</i> etc., used on warning signs in the US, have precise meanings which depend on characteristics, such as flash point, of the material involved. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluelion_ba19.html" title="User:Bluelion">Bluelion</a> 23:38 Feb 19, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The words 'flammable' and 'flammability' are in effect deliberate coinages. There are very few older citations in the OED. For 'flammable' it has quotes from 1813 and 1867, then the next one is 1959: it's from the BSI (British Standards Institute), suggesting the adoption of the word 'flammable' for safety reasons, in place of 'inflammable'. Likewise, 'flammability' has two sporadic quotations in the seventeenth century, but next appears in 1942, and in 1963 the BSI again call for the word 'flammability' to be adopted in place of its dangerous synonym 'inflammability'. <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGritchka_9a6d.html" title="User:Gritchka">Gritchka</a> 13:26 27 May 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The reason "flammable" and "inflammable" have the same meaning is that children and illiterates get confused by the "in-" and think that "inflammable" means "not combustible" when it means "combustible". -- 65.57.137.165 04:22 Feb 20, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Technically speaking, inflammable and flammable are synonymous in American English. However, 'flammable' seems to be increasingly common on warning signs, probably to avoid confusion. When writing something formal, I would always use 'inflammable,' just because 'flammable' sounds silly to me. - Rob (American)</p>

<p>Mintguy is correct. It is a matter of class. In Ireland too, we called the midday meal dinner, and the evening meal tea, largely because the meal was based around tea. However upper middle class and upper people tend to have a light 'lunch' in the middle of the day, and a large dinner for the evening meal.</p>

<dd>Oh. Well pretty much everyone I've met from the south has lunch and dinner. I'll agree that in the north the posh types will probably use the same, but I'm not sure about the lower classes in the south. <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagpuss_947b.html" title="User:Bagpuss">Bagpuss</a></dd>

<dd>In England they call them <i>dinner ladies</i> in school. Personally I call the two main meals lunch and tea. I think it's pretty rare for <i>tea</i> to be used to mean mid-afternoon, except for the very upper class. For the evening meal, I think tea and dinner are used interchangably, althought the latter would only be used to refer to a meal later in the evening (say, when eating out at 7-8pm).

<dd>I would use <i>tea</i> to refer to a snack taken in the late afternoon or early evening (i.e. after getting home from work but before the main meal, which I call <i>dinner</i>) and I don't think that's rare at all. I think the differences in terminology are down to where you originally had your main meal and I would agree that it's a class thing, not a north/south thing (I've heard the midday meal referred to as both <i>lunch</i> and <i>dinner</i> by different people in all areas of England). Dinner was always the main meal. In the past, working class men tended to work near (or even at) home and came home for their main meal at midday, and so that was their <i>dinner</i>. Middle class men tended to work in offices some distance from their homes (often working in the city centre, and living in the suburbs) and so couldn't go home for a meal at midday. They therefore had a light meal at midday and had their main meal with their family in the evening after they got home from work, hence <i>dinner</i> in the evening. Because the majority of children (obviously) at state schools were working class, we still tend to use <i>dinner</i> for school meals. For middle and upper class people, <i>tea</i> was a light snack served in the mid-afternoon at which ladies (who didn't, of course, go out to work) could entertain their friends. For working class people, however, <i>tea</i> was the light meal they had in the evening to tide them over until the next day. <i>Supper</i>, for all classes, was the light snack you had before going to bed. However, because work patterns changed and many working class people started eating their main meal in the evening too, <i>dinner</i>, <i>tea</i> and <i>supper</i> started to become interchangeable for them. Because many working class families have since become middle class, the terms have become less of a current class thing (if class still exists at all) and more of a system of terminology inherited from grandparents etc, varying from family to family. When I was a kid (Southern England, middle class family, but with working class forebears) we called the midday meal <i>dinner</i> and the evening meal <i>tea</i>, but when I was in my early teens I acquired a new stepfather (from a family that had been solidly middle class for generations) who used <i>lunch</i> and <i>dinner</i>, and that's what I've used ever since. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 00:18, 29 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In American English, to "have tea", is to drink "tea" or another herbal beverage. Whereas in British English, to "have tea" means a meal. In Oregon English (or Chinook English) (West coast USA), we have breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My grandmother on the eastern shore of Maryland (USA), has breakfast, lunch, and supper. Lunch is at noon in both cases. It is not uncommon for households not to have any tea to offer guests, or when they do the tea is of questionable age. Tea is common in countercultural circles and among Asians. Coffee is king on the west coast and snacks with it are only common in coffee houses. It is rare not to have at least poor quality coffee. It is hard to find coffee on the east coast. Superior coffee is only found in French Restaurants in major cities. I had thought elevenses was a Tolkien invention until I receintly went to an english-style tea house 16 years after reading about the concept.

<dd>The Commonwealth forms are recognizable by Americans and are occasionally found in American texts, but their usage may be considered an affectation.

A lounge is usually more comfortable, with soft seating, softer music, carpeted floor, more relaxing. In many ways, a lounge is more feminised, a bar more masculinised, with harder seats, seats at the bar counter, wooden or tiled floor, with Sky sports blaring on a TV (God I hate Sky Sports!).

As is stated in the text, "apartment" has been gradually displacing "flat" in much of the world. My experience is that the generation before mine used the word "flat" instead of the word "apartment". How is the status of the word 'flat' any different in the US than it is in much of the world? <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluelion_ba19.html" title="User:Bluelion">Bluelion</a> 00:25 Mar 17, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, I've heard lots of Americans use the word "flat" to refer to an "apartment' although, admittedly, some were of a generation before mine. It is , perhaps, somewhat regional, but "Flat for Rent" signs are available at many hardware stores in the US. Believe me, that is a fact. I have current sign catalogs to prove it. Such signs are readily available even today in the US. I doubt sign companies would be selling signs using a word that isn't commonly understood. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluelion_ba19.html" title="User:Bluelion">Bluelion</a></p>

<dd>As a fairly young'un on the US west coast, I've never in my life heard "flat" used to describe an apartment except as a Britishism.

<p>I'm not so young and, in my younger days, I heard LOTS of Americans refer to apartments as "flats". In fact, they were pretty disdainful of the word "apartment" - only people "putting on airs" used that word, according to them. That's my experience, growing up in the 'show-me' state of Missouri. And I've seen more "Flat for Rent" signs than I'd care to count. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBluelion_ba19.html" title="User:Bluelion">Bluelion</a> 02:38 Mar 17, 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thats odd because, I consider "flat" to be a city word. I always though of it as British or "preppy". If I heard some one say flat "in Oregon", I'd assume they're trying to sound sophisticated, British, or Castro-district San Franciscan. - Oregonian</dd>
</dl>
<p>Just to add to the confusion, in New Zealand English "apartment" is a fairly specific term while "flat" may mean an apartment but could mean almost any form of rented accomodation including part of a house. "Flatting" used as a varb describes the situation where a group of people who are not a family share any rented accomodation even a whole house.</p>

<dd>I'd have thought that "flat" was more an example of the latter. It's certainly not extinct in the UK. The main reason new buildings contain "apartments" is that "flat" sounds downmarket, due to council flats.

<dd>In Ireland, an apartment is usually a new development, largely middle class. A flat is usually either council owned or a converted part of an older building, which may have been subdivided. Apartments usually are larger, more modern and almost invariably less well built than older buildings that have been converted into flats. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">STÓD/ÉÍRE</a> 20:40 Mar 14, 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Midwest U.S., urban: flat is commonly used to refer to a specific type of apartment located in a smaller building -- either purpose-built or converted from a single-family home -- in which each apartment occupies one full floor of the building, although it is not used without qualification and refers to the containing building rather than the apartment itself (e.g. "I live in a three-flat.") It's used in contrast to 'apartment building' or 'apartment complex'. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpacemanSpork_dc79.html" title="User:SpacemanSpork">SpacemanSpork</a> 23:06, 2005 Feb 22 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article claims that "phi is "fie" to Britons and "fee" to Americans". φβκ in "American" though would seem to be "fie beta kappa" not "fee beta kappa": American dictionaries also seem to give the pronounciation "fi": is φ indeed pronounced as "fee" by most Americans? -- <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeone_else_bc03.html" title="User:Someone else">Someone else</a> 02:25 Mar 22, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it depends greatly on the context. As you say, "fie" appears to be the most common pronunciation when the letter appears as itself, but in a technical or scientific context it is almost invariably "fee" (as in "the oiler fee function" -- i.e., Euler's φ function, with stress on the "fee"). A check of my AHD gives "fie" and only "fie" as a pronunciation for the word <b>phi</b>. <a href="../../../1/8/2E/User%7E18.24.0.120.html" title="User:18.24.0.120">18.24.0.120</a> 03:04, 2 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just to add a tiny bit to 18.24.0.120's point: Outside of scientific and Greek-language contexts (such as in names for fraternities), "fie" is almost always heard. Even scientists and classicists say "fie bayta kappa", though they would say "fee" when talking about the letter in their work. Most utterances of the letter come out as "fee", but most people call the letter "fie" (when they call it anything at all). --<a href="../../../a/t/e/User%7EAtemperman_2e3f.html" title="User:Atemperman">Atemperman</a> 21:47, 29 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>An interesting new twist that I've seen, using US Postal Service-approved mailing software, is the preference for removing all periods in address information (but not names or titles). Such comformance also includes standardized abbreviations for street components and states, and combining two-line street data into a single abbreviate line. Thus, one commonly finds things like:
<dl>
<dd>ACME Corp.</dd>
<dd>1500 N Fairfax Ave Ste 100</dd>
<dd>Mesa, AZ 85211</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>which translates to "1500 North Fairfax Avenue, Suite 100, Mesa, Arizona". Frankly, I've come to like it, especially since the postal clerks seem delighted to take my mail, and it always arrives quickly. I only wish more nations would adopt similar (but country-specific) formal condensations and abbreviations. I find it hard to cram seven lines onto some of my UK mailings! Sometimes bowing to the exigencies of the computer age can have its advantages. (I also learned of the much more logical British use of commas and periods with quotations this way.) ☺ — <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> 08:57, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Totally off this topic, but still, I think, a pertinent question: the difference in pronounciation of "clerk". In the US "clerk" rhymes with "work"; in the UK it sounds like the man's name "Clark" [<a href="http://www.hio.ft.hanze.nl/thar/clerk.rm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hio.ft.hanze.nl/thar/clerk.rm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]. My IPA is rusty; would that be US /klerk/ vs UK /kla:k/&#160;??? (Mac OS X will type/copy/paste unicode IPA but Safari browser mangles it on submit...) Perhaps another addition for the pronunciation guide?</dd>

<dd>I doubt if many addresses in the UK need 7 lines. Mailing software here also simplifies things. All that is required for a unique address is the house number/name and postcode, though the sreet name and post town are often included. People often like to "decorare" their addressses with district names and things that are not in the official address. For Example, an official address of</dd>

<p>changed <i>.... which are likely to be misunderstood by most speakers of British English.</i> to <i>... which could be misunderstood by speakers of British English.</i>. I think that many younger English people have enough exposure to US tv and films to know these terms. There are a lot of people who wouldn't but I would not like to say "most"</p>
<dl>
<dd>Someone who assumes that all British are English, hmmm... Ah, well, Let's see if I can clarify this anyway. Exposure to TV doesn't have anything to with it. I speak from personal experience. I was once the first person (and only) person to attend a car accident in Scotland in which a car had left the road and dropped twenty feet down an embankment before landing on its roof. Luckily the occupant, a Californian, wasn't badly hurt -- a cut on his head -- but when I asked the fuel type (for safety reasons), he told me that it was a gas car. Now I'm well aware that Californians, normally mean petrol when they say gas, but this was a Californian in the UK driving a British car and cars in the UK may use Diesel fuel, petrol, or propane gas as fuel, so perhaps he really did mean gas. Whereas Diesel fuel or petrol are unlikely to explode, a damaged bottled gas tank is an extremely dangerous item for two different reasons. This was one case where it was better to assume that the car really was fuelled by gas rather than petrol and beat a hasty retreat, so we did. I was not going waste time to try and clarify things with someone who was possibly concussed when a possible explosion was looming over us.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The case where a single concept has an American word for it and a different British word, doesn't normally cause confusion. TV and film certainly help there (and most older people have had more exposure than younger people because they've been around longer). The problems arise with words like <i>suspenders</i> or <i>gas</i> where one word can be used for two different concepts. Normally the confusion doesn't matter but merely knowing what is probably meant doesn't mean you know what was actually meant. Sometimes the difference is obvious or unimportant but sometimes you <i>really</i> need to know. -- <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDerek_Ross_f2d2.html" title="User:Derek Ross">Derek Ross</a></dd>

<dd>For the Americans, do you suspect that we are here perpetuating some (possibly British) myth that Americans use colons in the salutation&#160;?
<dl>
<dd>I am American and I was definitely taught in school to use a colon after a salutation in a "formal" letter. However, I'd guess that because we Americans are so formality-averse the colon usage is very uncommon, as we maintain an air of informality even in formal situations. I guess this is because, at least in American culture, being extra formal about things often comes off as rude and/or condescending. But certainly letters addressed "To whom it may concern:" usually take a colon. --<a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 20:24, 2003 Dec 14 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A check of the style guide used when I was in secondary school (<i>Basic English Revisited</i> by Sebranek et al, fifth ed.) says (paragraph 153): "A colon may be used after the salutation of a business letter." Interestingly, I was taught a stronger rule than that; specifically, that a comma should only follow the salutation in informal letters. I have invariably hewed to this rule, but I wouldn't notice if all of my (preprinted form-letter) correspondence suddenly started arriving with commas (assuming it hasn't already). <a href="../../../1/8/2E/User%7E18.24.0.120.html" title="User:18.24.0.120">18.24.0.120</a> 02:59, 2 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, indeed. I agree that <i>while</i> can mean <i>until</i> in some Northern dialects, but I'd think this is largely in speech, and that even speakers of the dialect would have no trouble at all with the written "while". I just don't believe that "this caused a number of fatalities" or that there was good reason to change the equipment instructions, if indeed they were changed. Sounds much more like an urban legend popular because it puts "stupid Northerners" in a poor light; same family as "Irish milk-bottles have <i>Open other end</i> written on the bottom".</p>

<dd>I've got an e-mail back from Michael Quinion scorning the story, so I think we can dump it. He agrees with your points that (a) the signs never said that, and (b) standard 'while' would certainly be understood standardly in context. <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGritchka_9a6d.html" title="User:Gritchka">Gritchka</a> 17:17 28 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks Gritchka. My perception (as a British writer) is that <i>whilst</i> and <i>while</i> are almost interchangeable, although <i>whilst</i> feels slightly more old-fashioned than <i>while</i>. As great efforts have been made in recent years to write signs and official documents in straightforward English, I'd be very surprised if they now "nearly always"" use <i>whilst</i>. As a google of a couple of UK Government departments' sites gives about four times as many hits for <i>while</i> as for <i>whilst</i>, I've rewritten the para. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPauld_f4d3.html" title="User:Pauld">Pauld</a> 00:34 29 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>I changed the supposed reference to <i>while</i> in the story on Northern railway signage to <i>whilst</i>. If whilst was seen as meaning <i>until</i> then the sentence must have been used with <i>whilst</i> not <i>while</i>. If it used <i>while</i> there could have been no confusion. Also - saying that <i>whilst</i> seems slightly old fashioned is POV. Whilst is still widely in many parts of Britain and Ireland and is <i>still</i> widely used in legislation.</p>
<p>BTW re the above comment about the Irish and milk bottles, the Irish <i>don't</i> use milk bottles they use cartons and have done for many many years. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 14:24 29 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's <i>while</i> that is used by Northerners to mean <i>until</i>. (My husband's from Lincolnshire and they say it all the time, eg. "I'll wait while you're ready.") <i>Whilst</i> means something else entirely and would not be used on a sign like that, so I've taken the liberty of changing it back. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a> 21:45 29 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>FearÉIREANN, my point was the the story about level-crossing fatalities is untrue, in the same way the the "Irish milk-bottle" joke is untrue. If the Irish don't in fact have milk-bottles, it's irrelevant -- the story isn't told by Irish people, and (presumably) it's not supposed to be true.</p>
<p>Chris Q, you didn't in fact "fix" the article, because the second para started "because of this" which you made to refer to the fact that official docs use <i>whilst</i>. Also the claim that official docs use <i>whilst</i> "to avoid misunderstanding" is POV, and has the feeling of the level-crossing story about it. I've tried a small re-ordering.</p>
<p>I've also restored <i>aeroplane</i> to the list of spelling differences; 62.64.141.46 took it out (but not the American <i>airplane</i>) as one of a list of otherwise excellent changes.

<dd>I'm not a Briton, but I've lived here (Cambridge) for a little over a year. "Whilst" and "while" seem interchangeable when the word means "even though", but when it means "when" or "during", "whilst" seems more formal than "while". I suspect we're in a state of change on these, and perhaps in 200 years, no one on either side of the Atlantic will say "whilst". --<a href="../../../a/t/e/User%7EAtemperman_2e3f.html" title="User:Atemperman">Atemperman</a> 17:30, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The example in section 6 about double consonants in first syllables, i.e. that the 'a' in <i>parrot</i> is pronounced like the 'a' in <i>sat</i>, is simply not true for most speakers of American English. The vowels in, <i>bad, bed,</i> and <i>bade</i> are all the same before 'r', so for most Americans, the first syllable of <i>parrot</i> sounds like <i>pair</i>.

<p>I agree with Seglea's summary comment - "(oh come on. This pluralisation thing is ridiculous)".</p>
<p>Doing a google on the exact phrases shows: "sports page" - 248,000 occurrences "sport page" - 19,700 occurrences and, in direct contradiction to what is stated, "sport page" appears to be MORE common in America, whereas it's listed as British usage in the article. (The first three occurrences are utexas.edu, USATODAY.com, and the 'Ohio Wrestling Sport Page'.)</p>
<p>For the other phrase, we get: "drug dealer" - 135,000 occurrences "drugs dealer" - 1,290 occurrences I would agree from the google entries that "drugs dealer" is more likely to be British, but there are plenty of British examples of "drug dealer" - including the Guardian, Observer and the BBC. Indeed, James F's assertion that the BBC uses "drugs dealer" is not borne out by checking google counts for site news.bbc.co.uk - the BBC news site uses "drug dealer" 734 times and "drugs dealer" only 66 times.</p>
<p>Given this, the section is factually incorrect for both phrases given and I therefore deleted it. If anyone feels that there ARE noteworthy differences between British and American .. <b>AND</b> they can back it up with evidence (as opposed to just introspective examination of their own usage), the section needs rewriting.</p>

<p>Two examples of books in which this practice occurs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pearson, E. S. and H. O. Hartley, <i>Biometrika Tables for Statisticians: Volume I</i>, Cambridge University Press, Third Edition (1966) reprinted with additions. (Original publication was 1954).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cundy, H. Martyn and A. P. Rollett (1954), <i>Mathematical Models</i>, Oxford: at the Clarendon Press.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is particularly interesting because sections and illustrations numbered with ordinary periods, which are also used in the nomenclature for identifying polyhedra. For example, p. 96 is headed</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>3.7.2. Cuboctahedron.</b> 3.4<sup>2</sup></dd>

<p>So this text uses center dots as decimal points in numeric decimal fractions, but ordinary base-aligned periods in section designations.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's certainly how I was taught (at school in the UK from 1960 - 73); the centre dot was always used for decimals, and the full stop when it doesn't denote a fraction (as in section numbers, and so forth).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I always assumed the use of a full stop as a decimal point was simply because the centre dot is hard to find on computer keyboards, if it exists at all. In much the same way people use the caret (^) to indicate exponentiation, because it's hard to do quickly and easily on a computer. --Scaramouche 17:18, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)

<p>Is it still common in British English to use <i>in</i> when referring to the location of something adjacent to a particular street (e.g., "His shop is in Mumblefrotz street") where an American would use <i>on</i> ("His store is on Mumblefrotz Street")?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Missing/Extra Prepositions?</span></h2>
<p>As an Englishman living in North America, I find one of the most blatant differences is the frequent dropping of prepositions in American English where they would be normal, or even compulsory, in British English. Examples:</p>
<p>"He resigned Tuesday" vs "He resigned <b>on</b> Tuesday"</p>
<p>"They appealed/protested the decision" for "They appealed/protested <b>against</b> the decision" (although the former has started creeping into British use in the last few years)</p>
<p>This doesn't seem to feature in the article - has nobody else noticed it or am I just overlooking it? And does anyone know how linguists classify this kind of usage? For example, in the American example above, is the word "Tuesday" a direct object? <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambyses_caf9.html" title="User:Cambyses">Cambyses</a> 18:39, 12 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, in the sentence "He resigned yesterday," <i>yesterday</i> is acting as an adverb. In cases like "He resigned Tuesday", <i>Tuesday</i> is behaving the same way. I surmise that this usage has crept into normal usage from "headline style" English, which eliminates words not essential to meaning. As an American, the usage "He resigned Tuesday" feels slightly awkward, and I would probably use "on", but I wouldn't think too long about it if I read it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for <i>protest</i>, the OED lists meaning 7b: "To protest against (an action or event); to make the subject of a protest. Chiefly U.S"---so it would seem this usage of protest is indeed mainly American. On the other hand, most of the other meanings of <i>protest</i> don't require a preposition either. To me, the usage "They protested against the decision" seems unnecessarily wordy---if I were editing text and encountered that, I would probably strike out the word "against".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, if you add this phenomenon to the page, don't call them "missing prepositions", because from the American point of view, the British are "adding unnecessary words". <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 19:25, 2004 Mar 12 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's interesting. Now that I check, the OED lists "Tuesday" as a <b>colloquial</b> adverb as well as a noun, although I can't say I've ever heard it used as such by a British speaker. In NA this use seems to be common, even in quite formal writing, but Websters (online) seem to list "Tuesday" only as a noun. Curiouser and curiouser....&#160;:-)</p>
<p>I'm not quite so sure the use of "against" with "protest" is quite as superfluous as you suggest. In England, the <i>direct</i> object of "protest" (when used at at all) is usually the viewpoint being put forward rather than that opposed. For example, one might "protest one's innocence" or "protest <i>against</i> one's criminal conviction". To "protest <i>against</i> one's innocence" would be something else entirely! BTW, I'm aware of the subjectivity of the phrase "missing prepositions" - hence the question mark in the title! <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambyses_caf9.html" title="User:Cambyses">Cambyses</a> 19:43, 12 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I can see how it might be necessary in British English, but this usage of protest, as in "protest one innocence", is pretty rare in the US, and using it likely to cause confusion. For the same reason I guess Americans don't use "against" because there's nothing to disambiguate. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 02:49, 2004 Apr 15 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>That sounds about right. For what it's worth, I think this is one of those rare cases where UK English is definitely more logical! It is clear (and confirmed by the Oxford Etymology) that the word derives from the Latin "pro" (in favour of) and "test" (to witness, assert or declare). So to "protest" something should be to "declare in favour of" it, and the American usage is a rather bizarre reversal! <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambyses_caf9.html" title="User:Cambyses">Cambyses</a> 14:23, 15 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Back on the original topic of missing prepositions--they crop up [or maybe DON'T crop up?] often in spoken language and go from there into writing. As a technical writer and editor, I'm putting them back in all the time because I know that it can make translation harder when these presumably unassuming connective words are missing. I agree that, in my experience, most Americans have trouble recognizing that they're missing in many cases. When I teach engineers "Better Writing", I include a section on prepositions and such. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/f/User_talk%7EElf_54a3.html" title="User talk:Elf">Talk</a> 21:59, 5 May 2004 (UTC) (American English)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When I teach writing, I encourage writers to eliminate words that don't serve a useful function and their absense doesn't change the meaning of a sentence. To do otherwise would be to encourage <a href="../../../p/l/e/Pleonasm.html" title="Pleonasm">pleonasm</a>. Extra <a href="../../../f/u/n/Function_word.html" title="Function word">function words</a> get in the way of valuable content words. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 23:05, 2004 May 5 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>There is a distinction, though, between obtaining a sentence which "has the same meaning" and one which "has no formal meaning but will hopefully be construed in the same way". Very often one can use different prepositions in the same place ("They met on/by/before/after/around/through Tuesday") to obtain quite different meanings. If you drop the preposition entirely, how is the reader to know which meaning is meant? The answer, of course, is that she applies local conventions to pick the most likely meaning ("They met Tuesday" -&gt; "They met <b>on</b> Tuesday"). In places where prepositions are less frequently omitted, there is less familiarity with such conventions, so these sentences can be quite difficult to interpret. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambyses_caf9.html" title="User:Cambyses">Cambyses</a> 15:09, 6 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>In American English, dates may serve as adverbs, a situation which is encountered in British English as well. No one would say, "I'm planning to go to France 'on' this summer"; they would simply say, "I'm planning to go to France this summer". Just as pretty much any noun can function as an adjective, most nouns specifying a date can function as adverbs. --<a href="../../../a/t/e/User%7EAtemperman_2e3f.html" title="User:Atemperman">Atemperman</a> 22:22, 29 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Excerpt:</p>
<dl>
<dd>American English allows do as a substitute for have (the full verb, in the sense of possess); in the past, British English did not allow this, but it is becoming increasingly common. American: 'Have you any food? Yes, I do.' British: 'Have you any food? Yes, I have.' Note that such substitution is not possible for the auxiliary verb have: 'Have you eaten? Yes, I have.' for both American and British English.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The last sentence is not (or is no longer) correct, in that "Have you eaten? Yes, I did." and similar responses are very common in spoken American English, and have been since I was a child 30+ years ago (back when I had the annoying habit of correcting adults' grammar). This may not be considered "proper" for written English, but I doubt many editors would take exception to it — certainly not for written dialog(ue). -- <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> 18:06, 24 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Questions worded as "Have you any food?" are rare in American English; I think most Americans would hear that and "translate" it into "Do you have any food?", to which "Yes, I do." is the proper response. By the way, what is so special about the verb "have"? I hear "do" used to replace <i>any</i> verb, especially in response to a question where "do" is used as an auxillary verb: "Do you skydive? Yes, I do." Is this the same in British English?</dd>

<dd>I also hear "Have you eaten? Yes, I did." and the like in spoken American English, although it seems wrong in that what is meant is "Yes, I have", while the change of tense emphasizes the different meaning of "Yes, I did" (in this case the difference is trivial and silly, but one can imagine analogous examples where the meaning is important). Perhaps this abuse of the language is more common in American English, but I think it is an abuse of the language nonetheless, rather than just a matter of dialect. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyborgTosser_1c56.html" title="User:CyborgTosser">CyborgTosser</a> 21:00, 28 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I spent the first 18 years of my life in California and didn't even know that anyone might pronounce "cot" and "caught" differently until I went away to college in New York.

<dd>In Indiana, we differentiate betwee "cot" and "caught" quite distinctly, therefore putting the lie to the claim that the distinction only appears when colored by sounds such as /r/ or /l/. Therefore, whomsoeover claims that these two words are not distinguished at all in American English tells a lie. My wife is from Massachussetts, on the other hand, and she could not distinguish between the names "Don" and "Dawn". So she kept calling women named "Dawn" by the name "Don".

<dd>I think 'international' is better than 'Commonwealth' in the sense that it is the form of English used internationally; that is, most publications outside of both the Commonwealth and the USA use what one might term as 'Commonwealth English', even if speakers tend to use an American (or quasi-American) accent owing to the influence of films. For example, the European Union publishes all materials in this variety of English, even though, you will agree, it is hardly in the Commonwealth of Nations. It is also the (written) language used in, say, Ireland. In addition, 'Commonwealth English' would include Canadian English, which, it appears, follows many of Noah Webster's reforms (though certainly not all). The term 'international English', I believe, tends not to include Canadian English. On the other hand, the term 'international English' (or sometimes 'world English', though this has other meanings) sometimes refers to the English pure of all regional forms, thus neither British nor American, but that of second-language speakers. Bearing this in mind, I should say, it may indeed be better to use the term 'Commonwealth English'. Or we might as well say 'British English' and state in the introduction that what we mean by that is the English used in the Commonwealth of Nations and most second-language publications.</dd>
<dd>Also, in <a href="../../../h/o/w/How_to_name_numbers_in_English_4bb4.html" title="How to name numbers in English">How to name numbers in English</a>, you have changed one occurrence to 'Commonwealth English' when it in fact referred to this second meaning (in English, the usage of a decimal comma as a radix point symbol is restricted mostly to written pieces for or by non-natives).</dd>

<dd>Europe certainly isn't in the Commonwealth of Nations, but the UK, which is, is the principal English-speaking country in Europe, so it's no surprise that the EU publishes its material in British English. Likewise, most members of the OAS (Organization of American States) are not the United States, but since the principal English-speaking country in that organization speaks American English, the OAS's material is published in American English. American English is also the standard in many international or otherwise non-American academic, especially scientific, publications.</dd>
<dd>West of the Atlantic, not including, to some extent, Canada, American English prevails. East of the Atlantic, not counting Japan, South Korea, and, to my knowledge, the Phillipines, British English prevails. Neither has an overwhelming claim to being <i>the</i> 'international' English. I'll grant you that the combined population of people in countries where the English used is more-or-less British English excedes the combined population of people in countries where the English used is more-or-less American English, but that doesn't lend it more of a qualitative 'international' flavor.</dd>
<dd>For these reasons, and owing to the ambiguity of 'International English' that you mention, I think it's probably better to leave it as American English and either British or Commonwealth English.</dd>
<dd>With regard to Canada, I think the article specifies that it doesn't fit so neatly into either American English or British/Commonwealth English.</dd>

<dd>Whoops, I went ahead and added that to the article without checking here first. When this American English speaker hears "Sir Angus Ogilvy, husband of the Queen’s cousin, Princess Alexandra, is being treated in hospital [<a href="http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=3526608" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=3526608" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>]", I can't figure out if "in hospital" describes "where" or "how". When I hear this on BBC, I think of Russian ex-boss, who always confused by rules of the English (and put "the" where I'd least expect it).</dd>
<dd>When we do use "in hospital" it's always as an abbreviated news headline ("Ex-President Clinton in Hospital for Heart Surgery" [<a href="http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=3888315" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=3888315" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>]). In normal speech, the "the" clues us into the phrase being a preposition and not an adj. How does the rest of the English speaking world parse it?</dd>

<p>Also, I remember being taught that that names of languages should only be capitalized if they are part of a name or title, such as "English 101" class, but not when talking about the english language itself. Again, apparently this is only in American English (or american english)? This seems one of the odd parts of the language, along with capitalizing days of the week (which I do only if it's really darn important and expected) and months (which I do), but not say, the seasons.

We are certainly taught in school (hmmm, well at least I was, way back in mumble), that the "and" is part of the correct way to write out numbers; when speaking, it's often left off, but I think that in writing out numbers, say, on checks, the "and" usually makes an appearance. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/f/User_talk%7EElf_54a3.html" title="User talk:Elf">Talk</a> 03:15, 11 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I was taught in school (that is, in an American school) that "and" was incorrect in saying or writing numbers. The word appears on a check because it separates the integer number of dollars from the following fraction. I'll give three and a half to one odds that the use of "and" in that context is pretty nearly universal. But "Five hundred and six and 07/100" would look really odd on a check. OTOH the teacher who taught us this rule was an awful person and not an authority on anything; so I don't take the rule with much seriousness, merely following it by habit. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDandrake_fb42.html" title="User:Dandrake">Dandrake</a> 04:46, Jul 21, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I strongly agree with your first point. It is exceedingly rare to hear an American not use "and" after the hundreds place in a number. Interestingly enough, I had a geometry teacher of Scotish origins who informed us that one should only use "and" to denote fractional values, as in "one hundred twenty three and six tenths." Most Americans, I believe, would use "and" twice in saying such a number, (although more commonly the fractional part would simply be spoken as "point six"). <a href="../../../a/d/m/User%7EAdmN_03f2.html" title="User:AdmN">AdmN</a> 06:22, 12 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Say <i>what?</i></span></h2>
<p>Well, this is an amazing article! I'm impressed. However, as a speaker of American English and a student of linguistics, I find a number of the points listed to overgeneralize. I would say some of it is "incorrect", except that in most cases I've heard and/or used both constructs:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I apologise for editing 'inside' your writing, but I am sure you will agree it is much clearer to do this in order to address all your points.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>"try to" vs "try and"</i> I've heard and used both. It's definitely grammatical both ways in the trivial case of "Try [to/and] connect to the server." In longer sentences that may not be true...comments?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is a colloquial but idiomatic expression. And yes, it can't be used in other forms of <i>try</i>:
<ul>
<li>He tried to [not and] connect to the server minutes ago.</li>
<li>He tries to [not and] connect to the server every day.</li>
<li>He is trying just now to [not and] connect to the server.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>When I went to primary (public) school, we were taught that "Dear John," (note comma) is correct for informal letters, and "Dear Ms. Public:" is correct for formal letters. This is the usage I see in written correspondence on paper, but in the age of email these rules are losing ground.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I am not sure what you wish to say here. This is what is stated in the article. I have only got two letters from the USA with a salutation ending with a colon; both started with 'To Whom It May Concern:'. Never have I seen anyone, and especially not in the UK, begin with 'Dear Ms Public:'. In fact, even in formal correspondence from the USA, the salutation is usually 'Dear Sir,'. However, in my experience, British English writers nowadays prefer open punctuation, that is, without any punctuation in the salutation or the complimentary closing. 'Dear Sir or Madam' and 'Yours faithfully'.</dd>
<dd>Should we mention that the US practice is not to adhere to 'standard' British English rules for closings? That is, instead of 'Dear Mr Smith' -&gt; 'Yours sincerely' and 'Dear Sirs and Mesdames' -&gt; 'Yours faithfully', they would close both with 'Sincerely' or 'Cordially', I believe.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I have never heard <i>anyone</i> here say "two-hundred <b>and</b> sixty-three". We write it this way on checks (cheques, haha) for historical reasons, but that's about it. Maybe the President would say a number that way for effect, but I would be truly surprised to hear anyone else use it.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The article does say that the 'and' is used in British English, but not in American.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it does, but that's still incorrect. American certainly do write numbers with the 'and' (and not just on checks...or cheques....) and careful speakers say it as well. In any case, this article isn't only about written English; if it were, there wouldn't be this tremendous spelled vs. spelt fight going on below.

<ul>
<li>I do not believe that Americans <i>often</i> say "she resigned Thursday". Indeed, this usage will probably become ungrammatical in the near future as a result of the language favoring ever more complex noun phrases. One <i>could</i> say that, and it would be understood, but it strikes me (and others I have just asked) as a little stilted. In general, prepositions seem to be becoming more important as syntactic markers and as such are becoming more immune to deletion. However, one might read such a phrase in a newspaper, where paper space is limited and style favors brevity. This idea is corroborated by "I'll be here December" which strikes me as almost ungrammatical. This sentence would not occur in a newspaper, whereas "Dr. Public resigned Thursday amid controversy surrounding..." would be expected in a newspaper.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This usage <b>is</b> even now ungrammatical in British English.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"They suggested that he applied for the job" is right out. = ) I can't imagine anyone saying this here, and such a construction is completely alien to my verbal experience.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree – I have only ever heard the standard construction, viz '... that he should apply for the job'. The subjunctive-equivalents, as far as I know them, are should, shall, might and may.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>As for the have/do substitution, I might expand on that with an explanation of what's going on. It's technically incorrect as-is, but this particular alternation in AE is not a strictly syntactic process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Comments on any of that? I have grown up in the southwest US, where the English is alleged to be generic and people think "accents" are cool, so I think the items above reflect the "standard" usages fairly well (to whatever extent language is ever standard).

<dd>The trouble with the internal commenting is that further comments would make it confusing as to who was saying what, so I'll put my comments here in a numbered list. I'm an American in NYC, and my comments refer to American usage as I'm familiar with it.
<ol>
<li><i>try to/try and</i>: I would consider "try and", if having the same meaning as "try to", to be colloquial -- common in speech, not unknown in writing by sloppy writers, to be avoided in formal writing.</li>
<li>Letters: I was taught as Jeeves was. Most of the business letters I've seen used a colon after the salutation and a comma after the "Sincerely" or "Yours truly" or however they chose to end.</li>
<li>Numbers: Unlike Jeeves, I've heard "two hundred and sixty-three" used in the U.S., although "two hundred sixty-three" or even just "two sixty-three" would be more common here.</li>
<li>Prepositions: I don't know how often is "often" but the form "she resigned Thursday" isn't at all uncommon in my experience. It's less common for months unless modified -- I've never heard "she resigned May", but "she resigned last May" wouldn't seem at all jarring.</li>
<li>Subjunctives: I agree with Jeeves that "They suggested that he applied for the job" would be unheard-of and unacceptable as a subjunctive substitute, i.e., if it meant "They suggested that he apply for the job" or "that he should apply for the job." If I read "They suggested that he applied for the job", I would take it as meaning that we weren't sure of the facts of what had happened and they were introducing their view. "The Democrats suggested that Bush ignored intelligence reports" means they're criticizing Bush for actually having done that, not that they're recommending he should do it.</li>
<li><i>have/do</i>: The current text about American usage looks right to me. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 04:44, 19 Jul 2004 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">IPA &amp; SAMPA</span></h2>
<p>Well, apparently my previous edit didn't get the entire 'summary' line through, so I suppose it's best to ask here. Is it really sensible to list both IPA as well as SAMPA here? IPA is, in my opinion at least, much more readable and comprehensible. Certainly it may be somewhat more difficult to type in, but if we're doing it anyway, we may as well drop SAMPA. Or is there a particular reason for including both? —<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinuhe_c6bd.html" title="User:Sinuhe">Sinuhe</a> 11:01, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think that the idea is that though IPA is more readable it may not be supported by as many browsers. Since nearly all modern browsers do seem to support IPA characters, maybe the SAMPA is unimportant. I would be reluctant to remove it though because it might be necessary for some "accessibility" (Braille) browsers and therefore very important to the small number of affected users. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_Q_1529.html" title="User:Chris Q">Chris Q</a> 12:00, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Do you think it would make sense to list only the IPA in the 'miscellaneous pronunciation differences' table and have an additional page with the same table using SAMPA? Or we could simply have the same table twice, once in IPA and once in SAMPA. I think that mainly having two phonetic transcriptions for each brand of English in the same table is what is making it more difficult to understand both in the article and especially in the edit box (the Wiki table code is much more confusing than HTML).</dd>
<dd>Alternatively, it might be sensible to have the Wiki software translate SAMPA into IPA and <i>vice versa</i>; we could have a tag such as &lt;IPA&gt; &lt;/IPA&gt; and &lt;SAMPA&gt; &lt;/SAMPA&gt; in the articles, and the software could convert them to the user preference on-the-fly, much like the dates. Of course it could probably only do X-SAMPA, not any language-specific SAMPA.</dd>
<dd>Still, even text-only browsers such as <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynx_web_browser.html" title="Lynx web browser">Lynx</a> are able to display Unicode properly (at least mine does), and it is a popular browser to use for screen-reading. Do you happen to know in which browser it does not function properly? Why would accessibility browsers have more difficulty representing IPA than SAMPA? Do dictionaries for the blind use SAMPA? Can text-to-speech applications not make use of phonetic transcription? It should be even easier than converting real text! —<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinuhe_c6bd.html" title="User:Sinuhe">Sinuhe</a> 12:45, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Oh, that zero</span></h2>
<p>The section on "Numbers" states that Britons woud sometimes use "oh" for zero, but that "Americans use the term 'zero' almost exclusively...." It previously referred to an exception for the use of "oh" in sports scores ("after the second inning, it was oh-and-two"), but Poccil now edited that our. In my experience, we Americans use "oh" in such cases quite often. In fact, it wouldn't be strictly for sports; someone going through his second unpleasant divorce might report sadly that he was "oh-for-two in the marriage department" (zero successes in two attempts).

<dd>Speaking as an American who's lived for many years in OH (Midwest), TX (Southwest), and VA (Mid-Atlantic/South), I would say that Americans do <i>not</i> use "zero" almost exclusively. In fact, "oh" is quite common:
<ul>
<li>Apartment #302 is usually said "three-oh-two".</li>
<li>Phone number 555-1207 would typically be "one-two-oh-seven" or "twelve-oh-seven".</li>
<li>San Francisco had a major earthquake in "nineteen-oh-six", or "aught-six".</li>
<li>A gas pump attendant charging $12.09 might say "that'll be twelve-oh-nine, sir", but never "twelve-zero-nine".</li>
<li>The CIA calls James Bond "double-oh seven" just like MI6 does, although for wood or ammunition, "00" would more commonly be pronounced "double-aught".</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>In fact, I'd suggest that the primary American uses for "zero" are:
<ul>
<li>Scientific and mathematical speech.</li>
<li>Transmitted speech, especially for transportation and military (e.g., "three-zero-niner").</li>
<li>Emphasis on failure. ("He has zero personality!")</li>
<li>In sports, as in a "15-zero" game. But, extending the sports example above, there are so many other ways that "zero" is avoided: "15-nothing", "15-zip", "15-love", etc.</li>

<p>With regard to telephone numbers, I think that the example of <b>999</b> as an example of the <i>treble-</i> construction is wrong. Certainly in the South East (RP and Estuary), I've only ever heard 999 pronounced <b>Nine nine nine</b>. Similarly for the new directory enquiries services e.g. <b>118 500</b> is pronounced <b>ONE one eight five HUNdred</b>. However, within a longer number the construction <i>is</i> used, e.g. <b>07700 900 333</b> would be pronounced <b>OH double SEVEN double OH, NINE double OH treble THREE</b>.

<dd>Yes, I agree. It's always "nine-nine-nine", never ever "treble nine".

<p>This section needs a little attention: "British speakers are most likely to follow the American model for words ending in <i>-rary</i>, where in careful speech some may feel obliged to distinguish the two r's. Thus <i>secretary</i> would sound /"sEkr@t@rI/ rather than /"sEkr@trI/."</p>
<p>Firstly, my RP pronunciation dictionary does not even mention the American pronunciations of words ending in <i>-rary</i>, and secondly, the word <i>secretary</i> isn't even an example of such a word!

<p>The "silent a" of Comm. Eng. for -ary words appears (somewhat) in some dialects in U.S. New England, particularly among older locals in the area around and to the north of Boston. I don't know the specific history, but some like my grandfather routinely pronounce words like "battery" as e.g. "bat-tree" -- a hard T followed immediately by the R, instead of the "baddery" of the remainder of the country. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<dd>Americans use <i>gotten</i> instead of <i>got</i> as the past participle of <i>to get</i> in the sense of obtaining (but not possessing). 'I have got a toy' (= 'I own a toy') is the same in British as well as American English, but if one wishes to say that one has come to possess a toy, one would say 'I have gotten a toy' in American English. In British English, a more specific verb is usually used in such cases unless the meaning is understood from the context. As mentioned in the article, the expression "ill-gotten gains" retains the archaic form 'gotten' in British English. <a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinuhe_c6bd.html" title="User:Sinuhe">Sinuhe</a> 16:21, 21 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In addition, Americans use <i>get</i> in a sense of <i>become</i>, as in "Let's not get ridiculous", and in some idiomatic expressions. Americans would say: "My old winter coat has gotten pretty threadbare, and I've gotten sick of it, but I haven't gotten around to buying a new one." In formal writing, I would use <i>become</i> instead of the first two instances of <i>gotten</i> in the preceding sentence, but even in formal writing I would use "gotten a toy" and "gotten around to" something. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 04:33, 22 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Got and gotten are both awful words and may be fine in spoken English but should not be used in written English. That is unless used as part of the form 'get' "What did you get in your test?" "I got an A.".</dd>
</dl>
<p>I also can't think of (m)any reasons to use "have got". Have and got is basically repetition, as they are both past tense. eg JamesMLane should say "did not get" as formal written English not "haven't gotten". Not only because it is using two words for the past tense but also because using apostrophes in formal written English (other than to define possessives) is incorrect. - Monjo</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Collective nouns</span></h2>
<p>The article gives this example of different usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>British English: "The Beatles are a well-known band."</li>
<li>American English: "The Beatles is a well-known band."</li>
</ul>
<p>As an American, I think "are" would be much more common here. For example, a book about Beatlemania in America was titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0966264991/104-8221404-4659945?v=glance" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0966264991/104-8221404-4659945?v=glance" rel="nofollow"><i>The Beatles Are Coming</i></a>. Also William F. Buckley, Jr.: "The Beatles are not merely awful. They are so unbelievably horrible, so appallingly unmusical, so dogmatically insensitive to the magic of the art, that they qualify as crowned heads of antimusic." <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/w/williamfb116990.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/w/williamfb116990.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> When the band name is singular in form, though, it can go either way; I wouldn't be surprised to hear either "Korn is awful" or "Korn are awful". Furthermore, many Americans will even use plural forms when talking about a corporation: "Ford is discontinuing that model because it doesn't fit into their plans." I personally consider this usage substandard but it's dismayingly common here. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 14:58, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was the one who added that example. I should have given more examples or clarified. For instance, I wouldn't say "The Beatles are a band", but I would say "The Beatles are awful", but not "Korn are awful". The last sentence "Ford is discontinuing..." wouldn't sound strange at all to me. (I'm an American in New England.)

<p>To some extent, I believe many of us are not recognizing that this isn't a page to discuss the differences in speech patterns and pronounciation throughout the U.S. The article starts off by saying "For the purposes of this article: American English is the language spoken by U.S. government officials, network newscasters...." For instance, the British contributors aren't pointing out differences between <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cockney.html" title="Cockney">Cockney</a> and American English. I think one would be hard pressed to find an example of Peter Jennings or Tom Browkaw saying "The Beatles <i>is</i> a well-known band."</p>
<p>Actually, the suggestion that "U.S. government officials" may be used as a barometer for some sort of "standard" U.S. English is also questionable, (I offer the speech of the current president as example). It seems to me that it is only among our national broadcasters that one can find anything even remotely resembling the British notion of a <a href="../../../r/e/c/Received_pronunciation.html" title="Received pronunciation">received pronunciation</a>. <tt><a href="../../../a/d/m/User%7EAdmN_03f2.html" title="User:AdmN">AdmN</a> 16:16, 27 Aug 2004 (UTC)</tt></p>

<dd>I agree with AdmN that this article can't get into regional differences within the United States, and I'm one of those who needs that reminder. As for the specifics here, I'd expect a national newscaster to say "The Beatles are a well-known band"; I'd be very surprised to hear such a newscaster say "The Beatles is a well-known band"; neither construction as to Korn would surprise me. As for corporations, I believe that the use of "they" to refer to Ford is substandard, and I'd expect a national newscast or a formal government report to avoid it, but it's so common these days that I wouldn't be astounded if it appeared even in one of those sources. To return to the differences that are the subject of the article, I'm not convinced there's any UK-US difference in band references, but maybe the corporations thing should be mentioned, if no Commonwealth speakers would ever employ this usage. (In the U.S. it surfaces with regard to other large institutions, too, like universities or government agencies.) <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 09:32, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In British English, pluralisation of collective nouns denotes the members of the referred unit as opposed to the unit as such. So because Ford is referring to the corporation, the sentence would read, in British English, 'Ford is discontinuing that model because it doesn't fit into its plans.' However, it would, according to Eric Partridge's <i>Usage and Abusage: A Guide to Good English</i>, be acceptable to say 'Ford are discontinuing that model because it doesn't fit into their plans.' (I should suspect that here a certain department and the management and so forth of Ford is what is warranting the plural, not the individual employees.) The mixing of the singular and the plural is nonstandard and, in my experience, not very common in British English. —<a href="../../../s/i/n/User%7ESinuhe_c6bd.html" title="User:Sinuhe">Sinuhe</a> 11:03, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>For those of us who are reading this long after the discussion, I would make two closing points. First, the original example, using a band name containing a plural noun, was unfortunately ambiguous. Someone has since replaced "The Beatles" with "The Clash", which accurately demonstrates the point in the article. Second, to add to the confusion, the Ford example above introduced yet another variable by its use of "their" in a <i>potentially</i> singular context (i.e., when combined with any correct use of "Ford <i>is</i>"). This is <i>not</i>, however, a U.S. vs. UK issue. It is known as the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singular_they.html" title="Singular they">singular they</a>, and has a long history in both England (back at least as far as Shakespeare) and in the United States. Although most of us have probably learned the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prescription_and_description.html" title="Prescription and description">prescriptive</a> formula that "the pronoun <i>they</i> is only used in a plural context", causing many (like myself) to cringe at its use in a singular context, it actually predates the Latinate and occasionally illogical 18th century formalism of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Lowth_26cb.html" title="Robert Lowth">Robert Lowth</a> et al., and is widely accepted in writing and on Wikipedia.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">UK vs. US billion in math &amp; science</span></h2>
<p>The current text of this article states:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Other European languages bar Greek favour the British version. In British English, a billion is the second and a trillion the third power of a million, as the prefixes bi- and tri- respectively would suggest. In American English, a billion is the third, and a trillion the fourth, power of a thousand. For this reason, the British system is prevalent in the natural sciences and mathematics generally, and arithmetic particularly.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>That last sentence may sound logical, given its lead-in, but it doesn't reflect my own experience in primary and secondary education in the U.S., right up through my B.S. in Computer Science with minors in Mathematics, Physics, and Astronomy, nor my Master's level work in Electrical Engineering or CompSci. I've never read any math or science text that used the so-called "long scale" or "European numbering system". To be fair, all my texts were published in the U.S., as far as I recall, but since the U.S. is the source of a not-inconsiderable number of such texts (and of research and papers in these topics), I think the above generalization is far too broad. I can't speak for the "natural" sciences, but I'd say that math and the hard sciences are quite comfortable with the so-called American system. Which is more prevalent worldwide is certainly far from obvious to me. Is the above statement perhaps a reflection of primarily European math and natural science preferences? I must admit ignorance in this area. In any case, I think the text needs a little adjustment, or at least justification. — <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> 07:04, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please forgive my imprecision. I doubt anyone would disagree that the SI system is the recognized standard for scientific measurement, and that scientific notation is much more common in technical writing than terms like "billion" or "milliard". But even in scientific texts, prose often resorts to these words. I grabbed the first two books from my library that struck me as likely to use the word "billion" (or its British equivalent): <i>Astronomy: A Cosmic Journey, 4th edition</i> (by W. Hartmann; Wadsworth Publishing Co., 1982) and <i>Introduction to Stellar Atmospheres and Interiors</i> (by E. Novotny; Oxford University Press, 1973). The first is an entry-level college text; the second is a serious astrophysics text. Both make considerable use of the SI system and of ratios, which are frequently more meaningful that prose terms like "billion". However, the first occurrences I found in each text, randomly jumping around for likely sources of such prose, gave me the American "billion" (not "thousand million") in each case:
<ul>
<li><i>A sunlike star of 1 M<sub>Sun</sub> stays on the main sequence about 9 billion years (9 x 10<sup>9</sup> y)…</i> — <i>Astronomy</i>, Hartmann, p. 380.</li>
<li><i>The stars at the lower end of the main sequence have scarcely evolved from their zero-age structures during the 5 billion years that the Sun has been in existence…</i> — <i>Stellar Interiors</i>, Novotny, p. 299.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>What I meant to point out is that I never recall even once coming across a statement like "the Sun's age is 5 thousand million years" or "the human body has about 50 billiard cells". In fact, from what I read in the article on <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billion.html" title="Billion">Billion</a>, it would seem that only non-English speaking countries still use the <i>échelle longue</i> or "long scale" terms frequently, and they don't call it "the British system". Basically, I believe that there is no basis for making the claim that "the British system is prevalent in the natural sciences and mathematics generally, and arithmetic particularly", and I'm asking for evidence that refutes my belief. Otherwise, that statement should be removed, or, if possible, replaced with a more useful generalization or summation. — <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a> 10:06, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The short-scale billion is generally only used by media, government and big business in Britain. Since it's used by the media, it tends to get into everyday usage, but I suspect (and there is debate about this) that the natural inclination of most Britons, young and old, is still to define it as a million million. I think the comment about older Britons showing conservatism is therefore a little inaccurate. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 15:18, 14 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Everytime I read this article, I see something new that makes no sense.&#160;;-) I have been in numerous office, commerical, and residential (apartments, hotel) buildings throughout the cities of Philadelphia, New York City, Boston, etc., and I cannot <i>ever</i> recall seeing a <i>first</i> floor that was called the "first" floor. They are invariably referred to as the lobby-level, street-level, or ground floor. Perhaps the person who added this bit is referring to somewhere in the western part of the U.S.? If you're talking about someone's 2 or 3 story house, then yes, the first floor is the "first" floor, (it would hardly make sense for a home owner to refer to their "lobby"), but otherwise, <i>buildings</i> in general start their floor numbering on the second floor.

<dd>In my experience, mostly in hotels around the country, it is true that the first floor is often called something else, at least in the elevators. The next floors always begin with 2 or sometimes 3 if the first floor is especially taller than the others. I can't ever recall a building having both a lobby floor AND a first floor. <a href="../../../n/o/h/User%7ENohat_6670.html" title="User:Nohat">Nohat</a> 06:11, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To me (I'm from Boston, Mass.), the ground floor is the first floor. Hotels, apartment buildings, department stores and other public facilities might call it the lobby floor or anything else, but (in my experience) they count beginning with that floor. In other words, the ground floor is floor #1, whether it carries a number or not. The floor above the ground floor is the second floor, and gets the number 2, even if the ground floor is the one that a "Lobby" or "L" button in an elevator designates. Also, people say "first floor"; hotels might designate it "Lobby" to convey additional information to guests. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 06:23, Sep 25, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the last three office buildings I worked at, (including the current one), and in numerous office buildings around Philadelphia, the Ground- Street- Lobby- floor is followed by the "first floor", which is physically the second story. Every day when I go to leave, I press the big "Street" button in the elevator, which is located next to the "1" button. I really think this part of the article is either off-base, or only partially correct for certain kinds of buildings, (perhaps only in certain places). I'm going to attempt to do some research on this on the 'net. <tt><a href="../../../f/u/n/User%7EFunc_268d.html" title="User:Func">func</a><a href="../../../f/u/n/User_talk%7EFunc_0951.html" title="User talk:Func">(talk)</a></tt> 16:36, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is because the ground is not a floor, but a floor must be built <i>over</i> the ground, whatever "over" means. <a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysdexia_bda0.html" title="User:Lysdexia">lysdexia</a> 13:47, 10 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The "ground floor" (first floor) is actually "built over" the ground. Floor joists are laid and the flooring is laid on top of that. Yes, the ground (itself) is not a floor, but you never walk on the ground in a building. Instead you walk on a floor that is at ground level. This floor that is at ground level is the first floor that is laid in construction of the building. Therefore the ground floor is the first floor with the next floor above it being the second floor. I work in a 31 story building and the floor at the ground level is called the first floor, with a "1" on the button in the elevator.</dd>

<dd>Henry Sweet predicted in 1877 that within a century, American English, Australian English and British English would be mutually unintelligible, but it may be the case that increased world-wide communication, <b>first through the Hollywood sound movies from the 1930s, which completely overwhelmed the product of all other countries and were not dubbed into other forms of English (the British craved these films, making 'quota quickies' before the Second World War to escape local criticism and desperately exporting to afford them after the Second World War; when U.S. troops were stationed in England in the Second World War, children knew their voices as 'talking just like cowboys');</b> and later radio and television<b>, which had to be specially recorded and rebroadcast locally to reach the public across the Atlantic Ocean;</b> and more recently the Internet and globalisation have each in turn reduced the tendency to regionalisation.

Examples include hyphens where I would not have bothered beore, using "is" after a collective noun rather than "are" and being told when to use "that" or "which with a comma before it" in a sentence but never which without a comma before it!

You may find that Microsoft Word can mark that a particular language is being used for document content. If you haven't set this correctly in your doc or in your default template, then it's possible that your documents are being marked as "English (U.S.)" [nods to section above about the use of periods] and are being spell-/grammar-checked according to this.

<dd>There seems to have been a time when "connection" was indeed the primary spelling in the U.S. and "connexion" was the primary spelling in the U.K. <i>Merriam-Webster's Unabridged</i> (second edition, 1934, 1944 printing) states, "<i>Connexion</i> is now rare in the United States, but it is frequent in England." Supplement Two to Mencken's <i>The American Language</i> (1948) mentions "<i>connexion</i>, which the English authorities still prefer to <i>connection</i>, though they usually add the latter as an alternative." Even the 1988 <i>Longman Guide to English Usage</i> states of <i>connection</i> and <i>connexion</i> that "[b]oth spellings are permissible in British English; but <i>connection</i> is commoner, and is the only American form."

<dd>1. Words in final <i>-l</i> are usu. treated differently from those ending in most other final consonants in that, in BrE, in inflected forms, the <i>-l</i> is doubled irrespective of the position of the accent. By contrast, in AmE, final <i>-l</i> is usually left undoubled in such circumstances. For details, see <small>DOUBLING OF CONSONANTS WITH SUFFIXES 2</small>. Exceptions: before <i>-ish</i>, <i>-ism</i>, and <i>-ist</i>, final <i>l</i> is not doubled (e.g. <i>devilish</i>, <i>liberalism</i>, <i>naturalist</i>); and before <i>-able</i>, the <i>-l</i> is usually doubled both in BrE and AmE (e.g. <i>annullable</i>, <i>controllable</i>, <i>distillable</i>).</dd>

Businesses that get a large volume of mail are entitled to their own unique postcode, so there could be quite a few. For example, 1 Canada Square in London has 21 postcodes. Even residential buildings are often split up with multiple postcodes if they contain a large number of flats/apartments. <a href="../../../o/w/a/User%7EOwain_2b8c.html" title="User:Owain">Owain</a> 09:11, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Would Britons say 23456 as two thirty four fifty six? What about Americans?</p>
<dl>
<dd>This Brit would say "two-three-four-five-six". Though if the phone number was written as "020-7942-3456", say, some would no doubt double up some of the later digits. The main difference, I thought, was that many Brits would say "oh-two-oh" rather than "zero-two-zero". <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJongarrettuk_f336.html" title="User:Jongarrettuk">jguk</a> 14:45, 11 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think that is actually a difference. People here in Texas, at least, say "oh" for zero in a phone number. In fact, when I did some training for a short-lived (incoming) telemarketing job, they specifically noticed this and had us practice saying "zero" instead of "oh". — Mateo SA | <a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMateo_SA_7201.html" title="User talk:Mateo SA">talk</a> 17:26, Dec 11, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As another Brit, I almost always say "zero" as opposed to "oh" and usually enunciate each digit individually (although I may not when they're doubled). Although whether that's the military radio training coming out I don't know. I would, however, say the phone number 020 4433 1000 as "oh-two-oh double-four double-three one-thousand". For some reason, I usually use "oh" in area codes. I really think this is a matter of individual preference, not national difference. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 15:25, 13 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For 23456, I'd say "two-three-four-five-six". I'm not sure about other Americans, though. For phone numbers, I'd assume each digit is (usually) sounded out, unless there are two zeroes. For example, 800-500-1234 would be "eight hundred-five hundred-one-two-three-four", if I'm not mistaken. --<a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvice_796f.html" title="User:Evice">Evice</a> 17:08, Dec 30, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Offtopic: which way is "on" for British light switches?</span></h2>
<p>Offtopic, but I think I'm likely to get an answer here. In the United States, ordinary household wall-mounted light switches are made and installed so that turning the handle <i>up</i> turns the lights <i>on</i> and turning the handle <i>down</i> turns the lights <i>off.</i></p>
<p>When I visited England in the 1950s the situation was the reverse: down = on, up = off. IIRC this was true in general.</p>
<p>a) Are my memories accurate?</p>
<p>b) If so, is this British/U. S. cultural difference still in effect?</p>

<dd>Some words <b>had</b> to be spelt with the "ise" form even when using "ize" was traditional in British English. So to standardise on one format, the "ise" one was chosen - possibly to differentiate from US English too. The UK and Irish governments use the "ise" forms now, as does the EU - many official publications and the media do too. Despite this, many BE dictionaries don't even list the "ise" forms.</dd>
<dd>It's a bizarre situation, but I think in a couple years it will be plain and simple "ise" only for BE.</dd>

<p>This paragraph needs a rewrite:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../r/e/c/Received_pronunciation.html" title="Received pronunciation">received pronunciation</a> (RP) is not spoken in the south east any more than any other region in England.

<li>The BBC now favours many accents and encourages ones from regions other than the south east which tend to dominate with mild forms of Estuary English.</li>

<p>As a Brit, when I've heard an American saying that they "majored" in something, I've inferred that a University course in the US requires a student to specialise in one subject (their major) whilst studying others to a lesser degree, but this has never being confirmed to me.

<dd>I clarified this a bit yesterday, not having seen this discussion. Yes, you "major in" your primary course of study. So if you're pursuing a degree in physics, you're "majoring in physics." If someone asks you, "What are you majoring in?" you would answer, "Physics." But, in order to be a well-rounded person, you've probably got to take classes in history, English, the arts, and so forth as well. So the question, "What are you studying?" is more ambiguous. If your roommate comes home while you're reading up for history class, and he asks what you're studying, you'd probably say, "History" (still as a physics major). But if you're talking to your aunt while home for Christmas, you'd probably interpret the question as asking your major--it depends on context. Note also that one may also "minor" in a subject, which requires less study than one's major, but is still rather focused. Thus, a graduate might say, "I have a B.S. in physics, with a minor in mathematics." -- <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConeslayer_540b.html" title="User:Coneslayer">Coneslayer</a> 16:22, 2005 Mar 30 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I'm British and 36 and I've often heard it. Many British public schools (including the one I went to) have 'college' as part of their name. So do many state schools - grammar and comprehensive (including the one I would have gone to had I not gone to the aforementioned school). In my experience, college in Britain is not generally used to refer to universities (although I have sometimes heard it from people who have not been to one).

As Georgia guy said, the title implies that the article is talking about two different languages, that "American" is a language. Moreover, the "English language" appears nowhere in the title. "American" and "English" used in this way are nationalities, adjectives for places. There's nothing about which language this article covers in the title. Just yucky all around.

<p>Let's get this straight before we move this article back again to its regular title. Are you saying that you believe that "American" is the name of a language? Violations of community norms - moving article titles without consensus, refusing to discuss and debate with others - is a surefire way to get blocked from posting on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 23:36, May 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I want to lay out some reasons why it makes no sense to rename this article <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_and_English_linguistic_differences_b061.html" title="American and English linguistic differences">American and English linguistic differences</a>, as a new user is attempting repeatedly to do. I know some of the literally dozens of people who have worked on this page or shown an interest in it will return during the week and will wonder what was going on here. Here are some reasons why that new title makes no sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>"American" is not a language. To say that "American" has linguistic differences with "English" is to imply that there is (a) a language called American; and (b) that such a language is separate from English.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>More than one language is spoken in both the United States and in Britain. There is no American linguistic standard in and of itself. You can talk about the variety of English people in the U.S. speak. You can talk about the kind of Spanish or Spanglish that people in the U.S. speak, or Chinese or Italian or whatever. (I'm not just saying this to be P.C. or contrary; I'm saying it because it's a fact. Since American isn't a language, it isn't clear what language in the U.S. you're referring to). Divorced from some indication of what language this article is describing in the U.S., it makes no sense. This article is about the differences between American English and British (or, if you prefer, English) English.</li>
</ul>
<p>I understand that the user changing this article (I'm not trying to avoid saying his or her name; I just can't remember it right now because he/she doesn't sign his/her posts) has a strong POV, I'm assuming, about the supermacy or "correctness" of the English spoken in England, or Britain (well, one kind of it at least - I guess the spelling conventions, since the spoken English of Britain is hardly uniform). We all have POVs of one kind of another. The whole beauty of Wikipedia, though, is to work together and build consensus. We have a successful process in place to do just that. Changing the name of this article, repeatedly, refusing to comment before doing so, is in violation of that process. Since there is no majority opinion anywhere that would classify "American" as a language, changing the name of this article to such a title seems to reflect a certain POVness that is unfortunate to a serious encyclopedia like Wikipedia should aim to become. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMoncrief_22d6.html" title="User:Moncrief">Moncrief</a> 00:15, May 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Can I correct a misconception? "English English" is not more commonly used in Britain than "British English". Rather the reverse. I see there's even an article about "English English" (attached to a link saying British English). But while it may be true, as the article says, that this is a term used in academic writing, in general speech, as distinct from technical academic writing, "British English" (unsatisfactory term that it is) seems to me to be far more widely used. Just to add a personal viewpoint: it seems to me that one of the achievements of the Blair governments since 1997 has been to make it acceptable for the English to speak the name of their nationality. Certainly since the second world war and probably since the height of the British Empire, the English (or at least the educated ones) would almost always speak of themselves as British. (Never mind that other languages usually did it the other way round and used the equivalent of English when they meant British.) In earlier days this was a signal of nationalistic pride in the British Empire; when the British Empire was disappearing it was a signal to the Scots and the Welsh of inclusion and acceptance. (The Scots and the Welsh often had and have quite different sentiments!) But Blair introduced the Scottish Parliament so that the Scots could part-govern themselves and the Welsh Assembly so that the Welsh could sort of govern themselves in one or two areas. The response in England was to think, "What about us? What about the English?" One of the results, it seems to me, is that since Blair's reforms, for the first time in 100 years or more, the English flag, (never, ever, seen for most of the 20th century) has become commonplace and more frequently used than the Union flag, which now appears quite rarely. Look at pictures of celebrations at the end of the Second World War: the flags are all the British Union Flags. Now, the flags flown in England are usually the red cross of St George; now, the English have regained the confidence, when asked, to say they are English. Revived nationalism, after a long period of hibernation, can surface in all sorts of areas. Perhaps it's in play here, too. But I'd suggest, nonetheless, that, thus far, the form of English used in Britain is most generally referred to as British English except perhaps in recent academic writing. That may be changing, as the attitude to use of the word "English" is changing generally in England.</p>
<p>But in any case, perhaps the generalisations implied by the existing title have the potential to cause confusion or irritation. "Differences between forms of English spoken in the US (North America?) and Britain (western Europe?)" is probably too long but perhaps this is what the shorthand title is aiming at, or something like it. <a href="../../../a/d/r/User%7EAdrian_Robson_f616.html" title="User:Adrian Robson">Adrian Robson</a> 10:36, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Apostrophe in words ending in S</span></h2>
<p>I was taught at school (in the UK) that when making a possessive, singular nouns take "apostrophe S" whereas plural nouns take just an apostrophe. Thus I would write "the cat's basket" (single cat) or "the cats' basket" (more than one cat) and "Chris's pen" (one Chris!). I can't remember what I was taught if there is a plural possessive ending in s but I would probably use "'s" (Chris P and Chris Q share a room; it is the Chris's room).</p>
<p>My wife was taught in a US school to use apostrophe only in any noun ending is s, singular or plural, so she would write the cat's basket" (single cat) or "the cats' basket" (more than one cat) and "Chris' pen" (one Chris!).</p>
<p>Is this a UK/US difference or did we just learn alternative rules?</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the U.S., practice varies. One of our leading guides, <i>The Elements of Style</i> by Strunk and White, has a section specifically stating that it should be "Chris's pen" (I think their actual example is "Charles's tonsils"). You can read several comments about this issue at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia_talk%7EManual_of_Style_archive_%28punctuation%29_467c.html#Possessives_of_words_ending_in_.27s.27" title="Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style archive (punctuation)">Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style archive (punctuation)#Possessives of words ending in 's'</a>; I don't think the discussion there shows any U.S./U.K. difference.

<dd>As for Chris' vs Chris's when in singular. The general rule is to use s's except when dealing with historical (really old old historic) or religious names.

<p>I (as a Brit) have always used the "separable verb" <i>to have in</i>, meaning to contain, as in "this mug has coffee in". Admittedly I wouldn't use it in formal writing, but I would consider that as a stylistic point rather than a grammatical one.</p>
<p>When I went to America, I was very soon told this was "bad grammar" and should be "this mug has coffee in it". Is this true? —<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlotwell_e987.html" title="User:Blotwell">Blotwell</a> 09:44, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well technically you should never end a sentence with a <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preposition.html#English_prescriptive_guidelines" title="Preposition">preposition</a>, but for Americans to criticise a Brit when they are responsible for the split infinitive (eg "to boldly go") seems a trifle rude. It is also very pedantic when we're talking about spoken English. You could say "There is coffee in the mug." and I would suggest that "this mug has coffee in it" is also incorrect as the <i>pre</i>position needs to come <i>before</i> the object.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Grammar: I am Going</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>As a speaker of Oregonian English (or Chinook English), I would say formally, "I am going to go upstairs and take a bath" or "I am going upstairs to take a bath". The difference between Oregonian and British English is not in the grammar of "I am going", but in the use of "take" vs "have". Otherwise formal Oregonian is no different than the British.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>However, it is more likely that I would say, informally "I'm gonna' go upstairs to take a bath" or "I'm goin' upstairs to take a bath".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I am unaware of the dropping the "to" as in the so-called "American English" or of the use the "American" "and taking", or the British "to have". Both the "American" and the British sentences sound foreign to me. The American sounds contrived, the British sounds British. Perhaps it is a regional variation?</li>
<li>Here is the original paragraph for comparison: <i>Where a statement of intention involves two separate activities, it is acceptable for speakers of American English to use the simple continuous form "I am going". Speakers of British English are more likely to use the form "I am going to". So where a speaker of American English might say "I am going upstairs and taking a bath", British English speakers would say "I am going to go upstairs and have a bath", or "I am going upstairs to have a bath", which has a slightly different meaning.</i></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>There is certainly a difference between American and British usage, but the paragraph you quote does indeed represent it completely inaccurately and I've changed it: do let me know whether you now find it more believable. Incidentally, in Britain we can say "I went and had a bath" meaning "I went to have a bath" but also implying I succeeded: is there any American equivalent of this? (Both <i>I went have a bath</i> and <i>I went had a bath</i>, the logically analogous constructions, sound hopelessly ungrammatical to my poor British ear.)—<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlotwell_e987.html" title="User:Blotwell">Blotwell</a> 29 June 2005 11:07 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I would say, "I took a bath" (successfully). "I went to take a bath . . ." (suggesting an interruption). A mother might ask, "Have you taken a bath today?" or "When was the last time you took a bath?"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>However, the use of "had" is formal but never with the use of "and". Formally, a mother would ask, "Have you had a bath today?" or "When was the last time you had a bath?". However, "I had a bath" sounds too formal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Also, "and" is used but extremely informally. I realise that sometimes I use it in this manner, "I went and took a bath". However, this is _approaching_ a form of "redneck" slang that has a severe social taboo. Only African-American English is more controversial. I would never write that sentence in a work of nonfiction without properly introducing it in a colloquial context. Suffice it to say, it is the antithesis of Academic American English. See my notes below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I also realise that "had" with the informal "and" is practiced in the U.S. However it is informal and also approaching social taboo, at least in the West. It may be common in sections of the South and East.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The "redneck" accent can be further developed such as, "I went and took a bath", "I'm gonna' go and take a bath". In this instance it is similar to the British, except for the use of the informal "take".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>This should probably be changed to "Grammer: Take vs. Had". I am assuming British English never uses "take" to mean "had". How about, "I took a philosophy class last term"? The sentence, "I had a philosophy class last term" would seem too formal for casual conversation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Does the American use of "take" seem agressive? In light of Lakoff and Johnson's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conceptual_metaphor.html" title="Conceptual metaphor">metaphor theory</a>, I imagine it is. Perhaps its perceived as if we are "storming the castle". Such that when we say, "I am going to take a bath" you imagine some one in a campaign of war against the bath tub?</li>

<ul>
<li>"American English is the form of English used by the U.S. government, business, mass media, and education system." It should be noted that "American English" is academic Western (this includes California and the Northwest) not the language of the Midwest. The language of Leave it to Beaver and Archie Comics is not American English as practiced by Hollywood, Business, and the education system today. Midwestern language sounds hokey, not professional, _to Westerners_. This is not meant as an insult, it is just a common perspective. Newscasters are more diverse in language, they speak Californian, Midwestern, and occassionally accented American English. Accented speakers are typically Latinos who speak Spanish English (Southwestern English). This is only common on public broadcasting.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>It should also be noted the socio-economic differences in speech spoken in regional areas. In rural Oregon, we speak "Oregon English" also known as "Chinook English" and "Cascadian English". However, at least one variant type of speech can be detected. This is the speech of a segment of the working class poor, my friends (who are woodworkers and do not speak it) call it simply "redneck". This language has a "country twang" and a drawl. The drawl is common in Eastern Oregon. However, self-identifying "rednecks" do not speak it as a whole. Nor do self-identified "hillbillies" or "mountain men". I grew up in the back woods learning to speak "Lumberjack Jargon" (see List of lumberjack jargon), but never aquired this speech. Every region has its own variation of this. In some areas of the south, this speech crosses the economic barrier. George Bush Jr. speaks a Texas businessman variation.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Also, my grandmother says wash as /wɔɹʃ and /ˈwɔrʃ.ɪŋ.tən/ for Washington. According to wikipedia and anecdotal information, this is how some of the older generations in Missouri pronounce these words. My grandmother is third generation Northwesterner. She grew up in Washington in company towns living amongst Norwegian-American and other Scandinavian-American populations, most of who came to Washington via the Midwest. I have encountered other elderly Northwesterners who retained this unique pronounciation. &lt;Posted by Cemendur, the Oregonian&gt;</li>

<p>Please supply evidence that "will go and X" is "stigmatized" in GA! This is very common (informal) usage; "will go X" is equally common in the future, formal or informal; "will go to X" is quite formal. In the present (formal or not), "going and X'ing" sounds strange to me; "going X" impossible; "going X'ing" only in "activity" usages like "going fishing"; "going to X" normal. In the past (formal or not), "went and X'ed" implies something that actually happened, "went to X" implies intention, "went X'ing" only with activities like "fishing", "went X" is impossible. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenwing_4140.html" title="User:Benwing">Benwing</a> 02:57, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
