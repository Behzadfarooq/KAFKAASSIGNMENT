<dd>The original entry stated the image was "by <a href="../../../f/a/a/FAA_42fa.html" title="FAA">FAA</a>" However it got tagged as unsourced. This image is by the Federal Aviation Agency, a U.S. government agency. I have included a URL. I hope this addresses the issue. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmericasroof_3ff1.html" title="User:Americasroof">Americasroof</a> 01:27, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't find this image. I searched for "Montauk" which gave 3 PDFs. I skimmed through them and couldn't find it. Could you put some directions on how to find this diagram from the page you linked please? I do believe this to be a FAA drawing, I hope you do understand that I at least needed the URL you provided, as many people put "From XXX government agency" which isn't enough to claim that it's public domain. Thank you for working with me on getting the source problem figured out. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecu_ba9a.html" title="User:Mecu"><font color="#CEBE70"><b>MECU</b></font></a>â‰ˆ<small><a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecu_1c42.html" title="User talk:Mecu">talk</a></small> 01:39, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>With regards to your follow up question. The FAA website is counterintuitive. You can't link directly to an image because it expires. You have to click on the instructions information in blue below the red lettered warning that tells you to link to that page ONLY. That takes you to a map and entry form. I clicked New York and then searched by city for Montauk. The image is a pdf with other data but I jus cropped the diagram. The link: <a href="http://www.naco.faa.gov/index.asp?xml=naco/online/d_tpp" class="external free" title="http://www.naco.faa.gov/index.asp?xml=naco/online/d_tpp" rel="nofollow">http://www.naco.faa.gov/index.asp?xml=naco/online/d_tpp</a> The link to the Montauk diagram (for today only as it will expire) is <a href="http://www.naco.faa.gov/pdfs/ne_161_18JAN2007.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.naco.faa.gov/pdfs/ne_161_18JAN2007.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.naco.faa.gov/pdfs/ne_161_18JAN2007.pdf</a> Hope this addresses the issue. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmericasroof_3ff1.html" title="User:Americasroof">Americasroof</a> 01:48, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Awesome. Thanks. That's all I needed. I've removed the nosource tag from the image. I made a comment (with a typo in the edit summary) that it's impossible to directly link to the image per the FAA website. That should help in the future if you have problems (not likely). Lastly, to link to an image without displaying it, you just put a&#160;: in front of Image:, like this: [[:Image:NAME.JPG]] and it won't display.

<p>Roger,</p>
<p>I reverted your last rewrite as it ... well, it created more problems than it solved IMO. Could you have at least followed common practice and put all your concerns on the talk page first, especially given that the article is hardly neglected? The article looks (to me) a lot worse now. I really don't see why, if you complained (correctly) that much of the material was unsourced (although I made a fairly game effort to try to put a bunch in a few months back), you didn't just tag the unsourced assertions and work to find sourcing for them (not easy, I admit, given the limitations of the <i>Record''</i>s online archives and the <i>Poughkeepsie Journal</i> not having much online to search. But there are libraries around here, after all).</p>
<p>In fact, I'm going to revert everything you did so we can start on the talk page and justify every change you want to make (For example, taking the bit about the space shuttle out as "p.r. fluff" is essentially a POV edit. Perhaps it can land at every airport (having seen the main runway in Florida and being told how important it was that it was so long, I'm not sure about that and I'd like to see a source). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 02:15, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Oh, another thing ... re the infobox image, see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Airports_Infobox_7883.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Airports/Infobox">this</a> about what goes in the infobox image argument:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>A link to a photograph of the aiport, or an image of the airport logo</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I had the airport diagram where it was to illustrate the section describing the airport itself. That other people have put the FAA diagram in that argument shows that they're lazy and don't read guidelines. (Also, "privatization problems" may seem less POV but the facts are that privatization didn't work out (Jim Wright said as much). A public authority buying a lease held by a private company for a public asset is, any way you slice it, an end to the privatization)</p>
<p>Yes, I know it needed work (It's in my backyard more than geographically: I covered the privatization when I was a reporter (There's a lot there that might source to articles I had written myself! But I've been trying to depend on the <i>Record</i>)</p>
<p>If I go back to what was there before, all the changes you made that are good are still in the history and we can take what we need from them. If you make a list of problems (and there are problems), I'll make a to-do list so other people can fix them as need be.</p>
<p>I don't want a revert war either. They happen when people insist on "my version, all or nothing" and refuse to discuss it on the talk page (Yes, there have been articles I've wanted to do major rewrites on. I usually see how active an interest people take in the page first before I decide what to do). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 02:26, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
OK, I have reverted to your last version so <i>I</i> can start cleaning it up (For one thing, why did you chop the opening grafs into little bits? The two tight grafs were in keeping with <a href="../../../l/e/a/WP%7ELEAD_4179.html" title="WP:LEAD">WP:LEAD</a>. Articles with that kind of scattered look never get featured status. You can see that complaint all the time on <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a>).</p>
<p>Actually, you didn't change as much as I thought you had. But some things ... "grassroots rebellion" is, well, we need something a little drier to describe that, like whatever it was that I had (Believe me, I had some section heds and lively writing I really liked at <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Coke_ee64.html" title="New Coke">New Coke</a> drained by others in the interest of keeping them encyclopedic. So I've learned the hard way). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 03:47, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Alright, I've cleaned it up. As I said, you didn't change as much as I thought. But do take in consideration that prose like this, if it came from your rewrite:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>many barracks and other buildings were built on the base with many of buildings still standing</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>is not going to impress me, or FA reviewers, or any readers. Also, in the history section you eliminated that riff about Rockefeller building all his grandiose projects. Fine, but since there are later references to Stewart being hoped for as an SST airport during that time it needed some explaining, so I had to put something back in.</p>
<p>You probably did streamline it some. But I do take pride in my prose, as I think anyone who has made a living on their writing skills does, and it at first looked to me like the article had been "dumbed down" and made more like too much else here.</p>
<p>Hope we're over this now. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 03:47, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The above comments reflected several edits. Dan and I have exchanged comments on each other's pages. Some of my edits were restored and some were nuked.

<dd>Since that is not a flag of a government, nation, or a military, and is not a royal, regal, nor historical flag, it is considered under copyright by the organization. Please upload a PNG version of that flag, orphan the JPEG version of this, and then mark the JPEG image with {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-author_8ff7.html" title="Template:Db-author">Db-author</a>}}. JPEG compression is inappropriate for this kind of image. If you use Windows, download the GIF version, open it up in Microsoft Paint, and then save it as a PNG. The GIF file format is disallowed on Wikipedia unless you are uploading an animated GIF, because of some old patent issues that have expired, and because PNG compression usually takes up less space on disk than GIF does. Then upload the PNG version to Wikipedia, mark it as a fair use logo, and include a <a href="../../../i/m/a/Help%7EImage_page_09d1.html#Fair_use_rationale" title="Help:Image page">fair use rationale</a> explaining why this image, which would be disallowed in most other circumstances because it is a copyrighted image, must be used in that article. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesse_Viviano_b409.html" title="User:Jesse Viviano">Jesse Viviano</a> 04:49, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I can recall no records for other landings on the mainland between those of Davis and Cooper, by the way the landing of Davis is documented and I see no reasons to question it; the wiki article cites no sources of possible doubts (so that remark should actually be withdrawn); I would be interested to see such sources if any. There is a <a href="http://www.du.edu/~ttyler/ploughboy/boninchol.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.du.edu/~ttyler/ploughboy/boninchol.htm" rel="nofollow">web reference</a> to 'S. Peter's rock' in Bonin Islands, mentioned in connection with another wreckage. The islands were used by the Americans and the British as a whaling base in the early 19th century; as they were later annexed by Japan, the early European names for the individual islands became possibly superceded by Japanese names. Pribilof Islands are highly improbable; I don't think they were even visited by Japanese at that time, and indeed they were Russian islands and by no means "northern Japanese islands". <a href="../../../a/p/c/User%7EApcbg_98b9.html" title="User:Apcbg">Apcbg</a> 22:58, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I saw your request on Meta. The suite101.com site is blacklisted. Suite101.com editors were financially motivated by the company to link to Wikipedia to build traffic and ad revenues, so we ended up with several hundred links. Some of their stuff is good, some is awful (there's not much editorial oversight).</p>
<p>I took the http out of your link, disabling it. Readers can still see it, but neither Wikipedia's software nor their broswers will recognize it as a hyperlink.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. --<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A. B.</a> <a href="../../../a/2E/_/User_talk%7EA._B._1d00.html" title="User talk:A. B."><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 05:01, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Pony Express is the only council that has Mic-o-Say only but Geiger is not the only camp. HOA has their camps divided so that Camp Naish is Order of the Arrow and Camp Bartle is Mic-O-Say.
