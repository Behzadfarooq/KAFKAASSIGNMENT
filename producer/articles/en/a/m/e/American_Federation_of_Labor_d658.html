	    <p>The <b>American Federation of Labor</b> (AFL) was one of the first federations of <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_unions_in_the_United_States_5048.html" title="Labor unions in the United States">labor unions</a> in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. It was founded in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbus%2C_Ohio_64f3.html" title="Columbus, Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1886.html" title="1886">1886</a> by <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Gompers_b64b.html" title="Samuel Gompers">Samuel Gompers</a> as a reorganization of its predecessor, the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federation_of_Organized_Trades_and_Labor_Unions_2aa2.html" title="Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions">Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions</a>. Gompers was the president of the AFL until his death in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1924.html" title="1924">1924</a>.</p>
<p>The AFL was the largest union grouping in the United States for the first half of the twentieth century, even after the creation of the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_of_Industrial_Organizations_8d33.html" title="Congress of Industrial Organizations">Congress of Industrial Organizations</a> (CIO) by unions that left the AFL in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1938.html" title="1938">1938</a> over its opposition to organizing mass production industries. While the union was founded and dominated by <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craft_unionism.html" title="Craft unionism">craft unions</a> throughout the first fifty years of its existence, many of its craft union affiliates turned to organizing on an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_unionism.html" title="Industrial unionism">industrial</a> basis to meet the challenge from the CIO in the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1940s.html" title="1940s">1940s</a>.</p>
<p>The AFL represented a conservative "pure and simple unionism" that stressed foremost the concern with working conditions, pay and control over jobs, relegating political goals to a minor role.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Unlike the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Party_6b46.html" title="Socialist Party">Socialist Party</a> or the even more radical <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World_366b.html" title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the World</a>, it saw the capitalist system as the path to betterment of labor. The AFL's "business unionism" favored pursuit of workers' immediate demands, rather than challenging the rights of owners under <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>, and took a pragmatic, and often pessimistic, view of politics that favored tactical support for particular politicians over formation of a party devoted to workers' interests.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Federation_of_Labor_d658.html" title="Edit section: Early years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early years</span></h2>
<p>The AFL was formed in large part because of the dissatisfaction of many trade union leaders with the <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knights_of_Labor_4b95.html" title="Knights of Labor">Knights of Labor</a>, an organization that contained many trade unions and which had played a leading role in some of the largest <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strike_action.html" title="Strike action">strikes</a> of the era, but whose leadership had supported several rival unions that had <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collective_bargaining.html" title="Collective bargaining">bargained</a> for lower wages and provided strikebreakers during other unions' strikes. The new AFL distinguished itself from the Knights by emphasizing the autonomy of each trade union affiliated with it and limiting membership to workers and organizations made up of workers, unlike the Knights, who also admitted employers as members.</p>
<p>The AFL grew steadily in the late nineteenth century while the Knights were broken by a series of failed strikes. Although Gompers at first advocated something like industrial unionism, he retreated from that in the face of opposition from the craft unions that made up most of the AFL. That emphasis on craft unionism also made it difficult for the AFL to put its egalitarian principles into practice: while the AFL did not exclude workers on the basis of their race or nationality, and refused to grant charters to those unions that formally excluded <a href="../../../a/f/r/African-American_b405.html" title="African-American">African-Americans</a>, its emphasis on representing skilled workers excluded most blacks.</p>
<p>However, in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1895.html" title="1895">1895</a>, that policy of egalitarianism also gave way when the AFL admitted the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Association_of_Machinists_and_Aerospace_Workers_76db.html" title="International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers">International Association of Machinists</a>, a merger of one organization which the AFL had previously refused to admit and the rival union it had chartered (even though the new union also discriminated against black workers). The AFL sanctioned creation of segregated locals within its affiliates, particularly in the construction and railroad industries, actively excluded black workers altogether from both union membership and employment in the industries they had organized.</p>
<p>The AFL also actively supported legislation, such as literacy tests, that would reduce unskilled immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a>, the AFL lobbied Congress to reauthorize the <a href="../../../1/8/8/1882.html" title="1882">1882</a> <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinese_Exclusion_Act_%28United_States%29_714b.html" title="Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)">Chinese Exclusion Act</a> in a pamphlet entitled "Some reasons for Chinese exclusion. Which shall survive?" The AFL also began one of the first organized labor <a href="../../../b/o/y/Boycott.html" title="Boycott">boycotts</a> when they began putting white stickers on the cigars made by unionized, white cigar rollers to discourage consumers from purchasing cigars rolled by Chinese workers.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Federation_of_Labor_d658.html" title="Edit section: Expansion and competition">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Expansion and competition</span></h2>
<p>The AFL was left as the only major national union body after the demise of the Knights of Labor in the <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890s.html" title="1890s">1890s</a>. It subsequently brought in a number of unions formed on industrial union lines, including the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Mine_Workers_b5de.html" title="United Mine Workers">United Mine Workers</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Ladies%27_Garment_Workers%27_Union_e0f4.html" title="International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union">International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union</a> and the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Union_of_United_Brewery%2C_Flour%2C_Cereal%2C_Soft_Drink_and_Distillery_Workers_536e.html" title="International Union of United Brewery, Flour, Cereal, Soft Drink and Distillery Workers">United Brewery Workers|Brewery Workers</a>. Even so, the craft unions within the AFL maintained power within the Federation.</p>
<p>The AFL made efforts in its early years to assist its affiliates in organizing: it advanced funds or provided organizers or, in some cases, such as the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Brotherhood_of_Electrical_Workers_a92d.html" title="International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers">International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers</a>, the <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teamsters.html" title="Teamsters">Teamsters</a> and the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Federation_of_Musicians_eb53.html" title="American Federation of Musicians">American Federation of Musicians</a>, helped form the union. The AFL also used its influence (including refusal of charters or expulsion) to heal splits within affiliated unions, to force separate unions seeking to represent the same or closely related jurisdictions to merge, or to mediate disputes between rival factions where both sides claimed to represent the leadership of an affiliated union or one seeking affiliation. The AFL also chartered "<a href="../../../d/i/r/Directly_Affiliated_Local_Union_07cd.html" title="Directly Affiliated Local Union">federal unions</a>"—local unions not affiliated with any international union—in those fields in which no affiliate claimed jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The AFL faced its first major reversal when employers launched an <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_shop.html" title="Open shop">open shop</a> movement in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1903.html" title="1903">1903</a> designed to drive unions out of construction, mining, longshore and other industries. At the same time, employers discovered the efficacy of <a href="../../../i/n/j/Injunction.html" title="Injunction">labor injunctions</a>, first used with great effect by the <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grover_Cleveland_70d2.html" title="Grover Cleveland">Cleveland</a> administration during the <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pullman_strike.html" title="Pullman strike">Pullman strike</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1894.html" title="1894">1894</a>. While the AFL sought to outlaw "<a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow-dog_contract.html" title="Yellow-dog contract">yellow-dog contracts</a>," to limit the courts' power to impose "government by injunction" and to obtain exemption from the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antitrust.html" title="Antitrust">antitrust</a> laws that were being used to criminalize labor organizing, the courts reversed what few legislative successes the labor movement won.</p>
<p>While the AFL together with its offspring, the <a href="../../../a/f/l/AFL-CIO_f5ff.html" title="AFL-CIO">AFL-CIO</a> have comprised the longest lasting and most influential labor federation in the United States, there have been <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_federation_competition_in_the_U.S._65dd.html" title="Labor federation competition in the U.S.">other entities which offered competition</a>. Sometimes the competition has been subsumed through mergers or evolution, other times the actions of government have played a significant role. Competition has come from organizations large and small, but some of the most notable organizations have included the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Federation_of_Miners_ca7d.html" title="Western Federation of Miners">Western Federation of Miners</a> (WFM); the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Labor_Union_6a05.html" title="Western Labor Union">Western Labor Union</a> (WLU), which was later renamed the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Labor_Union_dbeb.html" title="American Labor Union">American Labor Union</a> (ALU); the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_Workers_of_the_World_366b.html" title="Industrial Workers of the World">Industrial Workers of the World</a> (IWW); the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress_of_Industrial_Organizations_8d33.html" title="Congress of Industrial Organizations">CIO</a>; and, after the AFL merged with the CIO, the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Change_to_Win_Federation_49b8.html" title="Change to Win Federation">Change to Win Federation</a>.</p>

<div class="noprint"><i>Main article: <a href="../../../b/u/i/Building_and_Construction_Trades_Department%2C_AFL-CIO_7086.html" title="Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO">Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO</a></i></div>

<p>From the outset, unions affiliated with the AFL found themselves in conflict when both unions claimed jurisdiction over the same groups of workers: both the Brewers and Teamsters claimed to represent beer truck drivers, both the Machinists and the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Typographical_Union_b3ff.html" title="International Typographical Union">International Typographical Union</a> claimed to represent certain printroom employees, and the Machinists and a fledgling union known as the "Carriage, Wagon and Automobile Workers Union" sought to organize the same employees — even though neither union had made any effort to organize or bargain for those employees. In some cases the AFL mediated the dispute, usually favoring the larger or more influential union. The AFL often reversed its jurisdictional rulings over time, as the continuing jurisdictional battles between the Brewers and the Teamsters showed. In other cases the AFL expelled the offending union, as it did in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a> in the case of the Carriage, Wagon and Automobile Workers Union (which quickly disappeared).</p>
<p>These jurisdictional disputes were most frequent in the building trades, where a number of different unions might claim the right to have work assigned to their members. The craft unions in this industry organized their own department within the AFL in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a>, despite the reservations of Gompers and other leaders about creation of a separate body within the AFL that might function as a federation within a federation. While those fears were partly borne out in practice, as the Building Trades Department did acquire a great deal of practical power gained through resolving jurisdictional disputes between affiliates, the danger that it might serve as the basis for schism never materialized.</p>
<p>Affiliates within the AFL formed "departments" to help resolve these jurisdictional conflicts and to provide a more effective voice for member unions in given industries. The <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Trades_Department%2C_AFL-CIO_39b6.html" title="Metal Trades Department, AFL-CIO">Metal Trades Department</a> engaged in some organizing of its own, primarily in shipbuilding, where unions such as the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Association_e079.html" title="United Association">Pipefitters</a>, Machinists and <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Association_of_Bridge%2C_Structural%2C_Ornamental_and_Reinforcing_Iron_Workers_5226.html" title="International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers">Iron Workers</a> joined together through local metal workers' councils to represent a diverse group of workers. The Railway Employees Department dealt with both jurisdictional disputes between affiliates and pursued a common legislative agenda for all of them. Even that sort of structure did not prevent AFL unions from finding themselves in conflict on political issues. For example, the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Seamen%27s_Union_2238.html" title="International Seamen's Union">International Seamen's Union</a> opposed passage of a law applying to workers engaged in interstate transport that railway unions supported. The AFL bridged these differences on an ad hoc basis.</p>
<p>The AFL also encouraged the formation of local labor bodies (known as central labor councils) in major metropolitan areas in which all of the affiliates could participate. These local labor councils acquired a great deal of influence in some cases. For example, the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago_Federation_of_Labor_c0ea.html" title="Chicago Federation of Labor">Chicago Federation of Labor</a> spearheaded efforts to organize <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meat_packing_industry.html" title="Meat packing industry">packinghouse</a> and steel workers during and immediately after World War I. Local building trades councils also became powerful in some areas. In <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_a4a4.html" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>, the local Building Trades Council, led by Carpenters official <a href="../../../p/2E/_/P._H._McCarthy_d61e.html" title="P. H. McCarthy">P. H. McCarthy</a>, not only dominated the local labor council but helped elect McCarthy mayor of San Francisco in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a>. In a very few cases early in the AFL's history, state and local bodies defied AFL policy or chose to disaffiliate over policy disputes.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Federation_of_Labor_d658.html" title="Edit section: Political activities">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Political activities</span></h2>
<p>While the organization was founded by <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialists</a> such as Gompers and <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_J._McGuire_23fc.html" title="Peter J. McGuire">Peter J. McGuire</a>, it quickly became more conservative. The AFL adopted a philosophy of "business unionism" that emphasized unions' contribution to businesses' profits and national economic growth. The business unionist approach also focused on skilled workers' immediate job-related interests, while ignoring larger political issues.</p>
<p>The AFL showed no interest in supporting a labor party and found itself in conflict with the socialist organizations of the day. It resolved in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1894.html" title="1894">1894</a> not to affiliate itself with any political party, and distanced itself from the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Labor_Party_d74a.html" title="Socialist Labor Party">Socialist Labor Party</a> headed by <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_De_Leon_6e37.html" title="Daniel De Leon">Daniel De Leon</a>.</p>
<p>In some respects the AFL leadership took a pragmatic view toward politicians, following Gompers' slogan to "reward your friends and punish your enemies" without regard to party affiliation. Over time, after repeated disappointments with the failure of labor's legislative efforts to protect workers' rights, which the courts had struck down as unconstitutional, Gompers became almost anti-political, opposing some forms of protective legislation, such as limitations on working hours, because they would detract from the efforts of unions to obtain those same benefits through <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collective_bargaining.html" title="Collective bargaining">collective bargaining</a>.</p>
<p>The AFL concentrated its political efforts during the last decades of the Gompers administration on securing freedom from state control of unions — in particular an end to the court's use of labor injunctions to block the right to organize or strike and the application of the anti-trust laws to criminalize labor's use of <a href="../../../p/i/c/Picketing.html" title="Picketing">pickets</a>, boycotts and strikes. The AFL thought that it had achieved the latter with the passage of the <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clayton_Antitrust_Act_339b.html" title="Clayton Antitrust Act">Clayton Antitrust Act</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a> — which Gompers referred to as "Labor's <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magna_Carta_56fc.html" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a>". But in <i>Duplex Printing Press Co. v. Deering</i>, <a href="../../../c/a/s/Case_citation.html" title="Case citation">254 U.S. 443</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a>), the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Supreme_Court_e75f.html" title="United States Supreme Court">United States Supreme Court</a> narrowly read the Act and codified the federal courts' existing power to issue injunctions rather than limit it. The court read the phrase "between an employer and employees" (contained in the first paragraph of the Act) to refer only to cases involving an employer and its own employees, leaving the courts free to punish unions for engaging in <a href="../../../s/y/m/Sympathy_strike.html" title="Sympathy strike">sympathy strikes</a> or secondary boycotts.</p>
<p>The AFL's pessimistic attitude towards politics did not, on the other hand, prevent affiliated unions from pursuing their own agendas. Construction unions supported legislation that governed entry of contractors into the industry and protected workers' rights to pay, rail and mass production industries sought workplace safety legislation, and unions generally agitated for the passage of <a href="../../../w/o/r/Workers%27_compensation.html" title="Workers' compensation">workers' compensation</a> statutes.</p>
<p>Unions, including the AFL itself, also welcomed governmental intervention in favor of collective bargaining during World War I. Unions in the packinghouse industry were able to form due to governmental pressure on the largest employers to recognize the unions rather than face a strike. The AFL endorsed the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_Party_%28United_States%2C_1924%29_4dba.html" title="Progressive Party (United States, 1924)">1924 Presidential campaign</a> of <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_M._La_Follette%2C_Sr._7880.html" title="Robert M. La Follette, Sr.">Robert M. La Follette, Sr.</a>, and the railroad unions' <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conference_for_Progressive_Political_Action_df24.html" title="Conference for Progressive Political Action">Conference for Progressive Political Action</a> supported the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Party_of_America_c2a9.html" title="Socialist Party of America">Socialist Party</a>. The campaign failed to establish a permanent Progressive Party, and thereafter the Federation embraced the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Democratic_Party_b5cb.html" title="United States Democratic Party">Democratic Party</a> even though many union leaders remained <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Republican_Party_faa7.html" title="United States Republican Party">Republicans</a>.</p>
<p>Some unions within the AFL also helped form and participated in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Civic_Federation_00bc.html" title="National Civic Federation">National Civic Federation</a>. The National Civic Federation was formed by several progressive employers who sought to avoid labor disputes by fostering collective bargaining and "responsible" unionism. Labor's participation in this federation, at first tentative, created internal division within the AFL. Socialists, who believed the only way to help workers was to destroy capitalism, denounced any cooperation with capitalists in the National Civic Federation. The AFL nonetheless continued its association with the group, even after the National Civic Federation became much less important after <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a>.</p>
<p>The AFL relaxed its rigid stand against legislation after the death of Gompers. Even so, it remained cautious. Its proposals for unemployment benefits (made in the late <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920s.html" title="1920s">1920s</a>) were too modest to have practical value, as the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> soon showed. The impetus for the major federal labor laws of the <a href="../../../1/9/3/1930s.html" title="1930s">1930s</a> came from the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Deal_1f5e.html" title="New Deal">New Deal</a>. The enormous growth in union membership came after Congress passed the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Industrial_Recovery_Act_8221.html" title="National Industrial Recovery Act">National Industrial Recovery Act</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Labor_Relations_Act_b6c7.html" title="National Labor Relations Act">National Labor Relations Act</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a>. The AFL refused to sanction or participate in the mass strikes led by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_L._Lewis_45a5.html" title="John L. Lewis">John L.
