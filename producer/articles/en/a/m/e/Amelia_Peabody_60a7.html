<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/Amelia_Peabody_60a7.html" title="Edit section: Biographical sketch">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Biographical sketch</span></h2>
<p>Amelia Peabody is first introduced in the novel <i><a href="../../../c/r/o/Crocodile_on_the_Sandbank_6b81.html" title="Crocodile on the Sandbank">Crocodile on the Sandbank</a></i>, set in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1884.html" title="1884">1884</a>. She is the spinster daughter of a reclusive scholar, who left her to deal with practical issues such as shopping and administering the household while he spent time in his office. He nurtured her scholarly interest, while the rest of her immediate family dismissed them both. Following his death, Peabody's devotion to her father is rewarded with her being named sole beneficiary of his substantial fortune of over £500,000 (over £30 million in 2006 values). Partly in order to escape the attention of numerous would-be suitors and relatives begging for money, she embarks on a tour of classical sites, beginning in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> and moving on to Egypt with the eventual aim of visiting <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palestine.html" title="Palestine">Palestine</a>. While in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>, she meets her future friend and companion, Evelyn Barton-Forbes (later also to become her sister-in-law). In Egypt, the pair encounters the Emerson brothers, Radcliffe and Walter. Evelyn later marries Walter, and Amelia marries Radcliffe, accepting his proposal by teasing that it was the only way that she could engage in <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptology.html" title="Egyptology">Egyptology</a> without causing a scandal.</p>
<p>Radcliffe is known by his surname, "Emerson", as he hates his first name, which was his mother's maiden name (as he also has no fond feelings for his mother). He refers to Amelia by her first name only when he is annoyed with her.</p>
<p>Peabody's first (and only) child, Walter, was born in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1887.html" title="1887">1887</a>. Although it is stated that she was medically unable to have more children, the cause is never fully explained. Walter quickly became known as "Ramses", after Emerson remarked that he was "swarthy as an Egyptian and arrogant as a pharaoh."</p>
<p><a name="Personality" id="Personality"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/Amelia_Peabody_60a7.html" title="Edit section: Personality">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personality</span></h2>
<p>Amelia's favorite ruin to explore is a pyramid. She usually carries one of her collection of parasols, which she uses as discreet, or not so discreet, weapons (including a sword-parasol). Her other famous accessory is her belt, later partially replaced with a vest with many pockets. It contains: "Pistol and knife, canteen, bottle of brandy, candle and matches in a waterproof box, notebook and pencil, needle and thread, compass, scissors, first-aid kit and a coil of stout cord (useful for tying up captured enemies)." (<i><a href="../../../h/e/_/He_Shall_Thunder_in_the_Sky_4897.html" title="He Shall Thunder in the Sky">He Shall Thunder in the Sky</a></i>, Chapter 2) Though she carries a small pistol, she is a terrible shot and rarely makes an effort to improve her skill, laughing off Emerson’s suggestions that she could do more harm than good. Unfortunately, on more than one occasion she has come close to harming a member of the family while wielding the pistol, rarely blaming herself for the near miss (e.g. her shooting at Ramses and an assailant in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ape_Who_Guards_the_Balance_ecf0.html" title="The Ape Who Guards the Balance">The Ape Who Guards the Balance</a></i>).</p>
<p>She is extraordinarily stubborn, utterly convinced she is right, addicted to romance (although she denies it vehemently), and much more sentimental than she admits to. She is also deeply in love with her husband, and he with her, to the point that the Victorian "typographical euphemism" of three asterisks is used quite frequently to indicate that they had sex. A favourite expression of hers is "Another shirt ruined..." because Emerson regularly bursts out of his shirt, either in the course of an adventure or in the throes of passion. The relationship between Amelia and Emerson may best be described as 'Brontean'; the story of the handsome but rough-mannered hero tamed by the right woman plays out according to classic Romantic formula. She extends this view to her family and acquaintances, often imagining relationships that are not there, while totally missing those that are, until she is shocked by the revelation of who has proposed to whom.</p>
<p>Because her family is frequently involved in stopping criminal activity, and she has successfully deduced facts of numerous cases, she views herself as an expert in such matters, to the point of denigrating truly competent law enforcement officers. And because some of the plots they have uncovered were in fact complex, she tends to make all solutions, even those not involving crime, complex and even outlandish while missing the obvious. Joined with her stubbornness, this tendency to over-analyze a problem frequently leads to her holding an incorrect belief far longer than is safe for her or her family.</p>
<p>Another feature of the novels is the egalitarian theme, with Amelia and her family being very close to the family of their original Egyptian <i>reis</i> (foreman) Abdullah, to the extent that there is a marriage between Amelia's niece and Abdullah's grandson. Following Abdullah's death, Amelia begins to see him in dreams, where he gives her warnings and advice, further illustrating how close they were. Amelia is a proponent of equality between the sexes, and brings up her adopted daughter, <a href="../../../n/e/f/Nefret_Emerson_66c0.html" title="Nefret Emerson">Nefret Emerson</a>, accordingly. This of course does not prevent her from routinely criticizing Nefret or other young women for acting as rashly as she herself regularly does. Peabody never seems to notice her inconsistency.</p>
<p>Her name among the Egyptians is "Sitt Hakim", or Lady Doctor. This was given her when, soon after her initial arrival in Egypt, she showed such care for the Egyptians she encountered, particularly in treating a number of eye diseases that were so common at the time. Her love for Egypt and its people is as deep and true as her lover for Emerson. It is a genuine love that often reveals itself in her distaste for Europeans that view Egyptians with either condescension or disgust.</p>
<p>Perhaps her greatest personal conflict is her long term love-hate relationship with <a href="../../../s/e/t/Sethos_%28Peabody_mysteries%29_9365.html" title="Sethos (Peabody mysteries)">Sethos</a>. From the first encounter with him as the “Master Criminal”, she has seen him behind many of the plots they encounter, even when it is clear to everyone else that he is not involved. Yet she is strangely drawn to him and feels that there is something about him that fills her with emotions that are otherwise restricted to Emerson. She becomes convinced that she alone has brought about his reformation, even though it is a number of years after that “reformation” that Sethos is actually rehabilitated.</p>
<p>Amelia has no patience with "helpless" women who play on their femininity to manipulate others into doing their will; i.e., "swooning, weak-minded females", according to Emerson. When home in England, she is occasionally involved in the Suffragette Movement. She is a proponent of <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victorian_dress_reform.html" title="Victorian dress reform">rational dress</a>, and often refuses to wear a <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corset.html" title="Corset">corset</a>. (See <i><a href="../../../d/e/e/Deeds_of_the_Disturber_7e1b.html" title="Deeds of the Disturber">Deeds of the Disturber</a></i> for a notable exception.) Yet she is vain enough to go to great lengths to cover her graying hair and hide her efforts particularly from Emerson.</p>
<p>While certainly being far more open minded than many Victorians, she is still a product of her age. Her personal struggle over David (Abdullah’s grandson) proposing to Lia (Walter’s oldest daughter) was far deeper than Emerson’s. Her conviction in British superiority in most everything is third, only behind her own self confidence and that Emerson is the “greatest Egyptologist of this or any age.” And who can argue with that?</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/Amelia_Peabody_60a7.html" title="Edit section: Amelia's age">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Amelia's age</span></h2>
<p>Amelia's age is initially given as 32 in <i><a href="../../../c/r/o/Crocodile_on_the_Sandbank_6b81.html" title="Crocodile on the Sandbank">Crocodile on the Sandbank</a></i>. In a 1994 article, Elizabeth Peters discussed the obstacle this presented:</p>
<p><i>"If I had intended</i> Crocodile <i>to be the first in a series, I probably wouldn't have been as specific about dates. Not only did Amelia inform the reader of her age (curse her!), but historical events mentioned in the book tied it to a particular year. As the series continued, there was no way I could get around this, or fudge the date of Ramses' birth, or keep him and his parents from aging a year every twelve months."</i>²</p>
<p>According to this timeline, Amelia would be seventy years old in the eighteenth book, <i><a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomb_of_the_Golden_Bird_450c.html" title="Tomb of the Golden Bird">Tomb of the Golden Bird</a>.</i> In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hippopotamus_Pool_3cd2.html" title="The Hippopotamus Pool">The Hippopotamus Pool</a></i>, however, the Introduction contains what is supposed to be an excerpt from "<i>The National Autobiographical Dictionary</i> (45th edition)", in which Amelia herself states that she was her late twenties at the time of her first visit to Egypt. The statement is footnoted, and the footnote provides specific instructions not to question the discrepancy (pp. xii and xvi.). In <i><a href="../../../s/e/e/Seeing_a_Large_Cat_bb92.html" title="Seeing a Large Cat">Seeing a Large Cat</a></i>, Emerson's age at the time they married is given as 29.</p>
<p>The latest chronological mention of Amelia is in the compendium <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/Amelia_Peabody%27s_Egypt_ce4c.html" title="Amelia Peabody's Egypt">Amelia Peabody's Egypt</a></i>, which mentions her taking a souvenir from her visit to Egypt in 1939, as war is looming and she was uncertain that she would ever return. Her age is given as 87, which would be correct according to the original timeline.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/Amelia_Peabody_60a7.html" title="Edit section: Pronunciation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pronunciation</span></h2>
<p>In an interview with Diane Rehm, Peters discussed the correct pronunciation of "Peabody," which she had intended to be pronounced "pea-buh-dee," not "pea-body."¹ By contrast, in the audio versions of the books—including those recorded by voice actress Barbara Rosenblat, whom Peters has praised for her accurate pronunciation—Amelia's surname is pronounced "pea-body."</p>
<p>The difference in nationality between the Emersons and their creator is sometimes revealed through the use of American terms like "railroad", spelling differences, etc.</p>
