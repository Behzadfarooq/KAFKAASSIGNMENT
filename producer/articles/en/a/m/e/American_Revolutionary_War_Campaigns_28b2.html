The British garrison reacted promptly to this threat. On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_17.html" title="June 17">17 June</a>, 2,200 troops under Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Howe_c515.html" title="William Howe">William Howe</a> were ferried across to the isthmus and stormed the American positions on Breed's Hill. In the ensuing battle, incorrectly named after <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bunker_Hill_ba2b.html" title="Bunker Hill">Bunker Hill</a> which stands nearby, the British drove the Colonials from the isthmus after three assaults, but at a cost of about 1,000 in killed and wounded as compared with American losses of approximately 400 killed and wounded. Some 3,030 patriots took part in the fighting at one time or another. This proved to be the only major engagement of the prolonged siege of Boston. Gen. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> took formal command of the besieging army on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_3.html" title="July 3">3 July</a> <a href="../../../1/7/7/1775.html" title="1775">1775</a> and devoted the next several months to building up the American force and trying to solve its severe logistical difficulties. By March 1776 Washington had an army of 14,000 men. On <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_4.html" title="March 4">4 March</a>, he moved suddenly to install artillery on <a href="../../../d/o/r/Dorchester_Heights_1a00.html" title="Dorchester Heights">Dorchester Heights</a> and, a short time later, on Nook's Hill, positions that dominated Boston from the south.

Consequently, a two-pronged invasion of Canada was launched in the early fall of 1775. Col. <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedict_Arnold_6b5d.html" title="Benedict Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a>, starting from <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge%2C_Massachusetts_da41.html" title="Cambridge, Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>, with about 1,100 men, went by water and land through the <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine.html" title="Maine">Maine</a> wilderness on an epic march up the <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennebec_River_8fa7.html" title="Kennebec River">Kennebec River</a> and down the Chaudiere River, arriving before Quebec on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_8.html" title="November 8">8 November</a> with only 650 men. There he had to await the arrival of Brig. Gen. <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Montgomery_7346.html" title="Richard Montgomery">Richard Montgomery</a>, who had taken over command of a force of about 2,000 men organized at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Ticonderoga_2308.html" title="Fort Ticonderoga">Fort Ticonderoga</a> by Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Schuyler_74da.html" title="Philip Schuyler">Philip Schuyler</a> for an advance up the historic <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Champlain_5cc6.html" title="Lake Champlain">Lake Champlain</a>-<a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Lawrence_River_2b38.html" title="St. Lawrence River">St. Lawrence River</a> route. Beginning on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_17.html" title="September 17">17 September</a>, Montgomery laid siege to the British fort at St. Johns, which fell on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_2.html" title="November 2">2 November</a>, opening up the way to American occupation of Montreal on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_13.html" title="November 13">13 November</a>. Finally, Montgomery joined Arnold near Quebec on <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_3.html" title="December 3">3 December</a>, but with only 300 men, the rest of his force staying behind to garrison St. Johns and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal%2C_Quebec_80c4.html" title="Montreal, Quebec">Montreal, Quebec</a>. With enlistments of most of the volunteer troops expiring at the end of the year', the two commanders decided to undertake a desperate night attack on Quebec on 30-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">31 December</a> <a href="../../../1/7/7/1775.html" title="1775">1775</a>. A composite British garrison repelled the assault, killing or wounding about 100 Americans and taking over 400 prisoners. Montgomery was among those killed. In spite of these severe losses, the Americans continued to besiege the city until the spring of 1776, when the reinforced British garrison drove the Colonials, who had already begun a retreat, back to the head of Lake Champlain.</p>

During July and August 1776, General Howe, supported by a British fleet under his brother, Adm. <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Howe%2C_1st_Earl_Howe_2214.html" title="Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe">Lord Howe</a>, landed an army of 32,000 British and Hessian regulars unopposed on <a href="../../../s/t/a/Staten_Island_60b0.html" title="Staten Island">Staten Island</a>. But by late August, Washington had assembled a force of over 20,000 virtually untrained Continentals and militia, and built a system of defenses on and around <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan_Island_db06.html" title="Manhattan Island">Manhattan Island</a>. About half of these Colonial troops were disposed in fortifications on <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooklyn_Heights%2C_Brooklyn_60ba.html" title="Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn">Brooklyn Heights</a> and forward positions at the western end of Long Island under command of Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Putnam_4842.html" title="Israel Putnam">Israel Putnam</a>. From 22 - <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_25.html" title="August 25">25 August</a>, General Howe landed about 20,000 men on <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Island_ec1e.html" title="Long Island">Long Island</a> and, in the evening of the 26th, directed a wide flanking movement around the American left, commanded by Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Sullivan_09d8.html" title="John Sullivan">John Sullivan</a>. On the morning of the 27th, Howe fell upon the rear of Sullivan's forces and, despite a valiant defense by the Continentals on the right under Brig. Gen. <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Alexander_2712.html" title="William Alexander">William Alexander</a>, the whole American front crumpled. Remnants of the forward American forces fled back to entrenchments on Brooklyn Heights and two nights later were evacuated to Manhattan in a skillful withdrawal unobserved by the British. Estimates place American losses at 300-400 killed and wounded and 700-1,200 taken prisoners. General Howe listed his losses as 367.</p>

When <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Washington_21ef.html" title="Fort Washington">Fort Washington</a> and <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Lee%2C_New_Jersey_a604.html" title="Fort Lee, New Jersey">Fort Lee</a> on opposing sides of the Hudson above Manhattan were lost in mid-November 1776, Washington retreated across New Jersey with General Howe in close pursuit, escaping finally over the Delaware into Pennsylvania with about 3,000 men. Howe then went into winter quarters in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>, leaving garrisons at Newport, R. I., and in several New Jersey towns. In December 1776, Washington determined to make a surprise attack on the British garrison in Trenton, a 1,400-man Hessian force, in the hope that a striking victory would lift the badly flagging American morale. Reinforcements had raised Washington's army to about 7,000 and on Christmas night (25-<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_26.html" title="December 26">26 December</a>) he ferried about 2,400 men of this force across the ice-choked <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delaware_River_6e02.html" title="Delaware River">Delaware River</a>. At 0800 hours, they converged on <a href="../../../t/r/e/Trenton%2C_New_Jersey_d2cd.html" title="Trenton, New Jersey">Trenton, New Jersey</a> in two columns, achieving complete surprise. After only an hour and a half of fighting, the <a href="../../../h/e/s/Hessians.html" title="Hessians">Hessians</a> surrendered. Some 400 of the garrison escaped southward to <a href="../../../b/o/r/Bordentown%2C_New_Jersey_acf7.html" title="Bordentown, New Jersey">Bordentown, New Jersey</a>, when two other American columns failed to get across the Delaware in time to intercept them.

But he reoccupied Trenton on 30 - <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">31 December</a> <a href="../../../1/7/7/1776.html" title="1776">1776</a>, and collected there a force of 5,200 men, about half militia. Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Charles Cornwallis, British commander in New Jersey, who was in New York at the time of the attack on Trenton, returned gathering troops as he came. He entered Trenton with some 6,000 British regulars on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_2.html" title="January 2">2 January</a> and faced Washington's forces, which had withdrawn southward behind Assunpink Creek. The Americans were in a most precarious position with their backs to the Delaware. Fortunately, Cornwallis delayed his attack until the following morning. This gave Washington's men an opportunity to steal off quietly by a side road during the night of 2 - <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_3.html" title="January 3">3 January</a>, leaving their campfires burning brightly. They slipped southward and eastward undetected around the enemy's flank and by morning of the 3rd had arrived at Princeton, where they encountered a column of British regulars led by Col. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Mawhood_5223.html" title="Charles Mawhood">Charles Mawhood</a> just leaving the town to join Cornwallis. Mahwood's force consisted of only single battalion of aroung 400 men. But despite being heavily outnumbered, Mahwood routed two American brigades in succession, and was only driven from the field when Washington arrived to rally the panicking Americans bringing up a fresh brigade, and giving the Americans, with 4,600 men, an 11 to 1 numerical advantage. Mawhood's force retired in good order toward Trenton and New Brunswick, having lost some 86 men in the unequal fight, while Washington moved on north, having taken 40-50 casualties, to <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morristown%2C_New_Jersey_0b6a.html" title="Morristown, New Jersey">Morristown, New Jersey</a>, where thickly wooded hills provided protection against a British attack.

<p><b>Saratoga, <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_30.html" title="July 30">30 July</a> - <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_17.html" title="October 17">17 October</a> <a href="../../../1/7/7/1777.html" title="1777">1777</a>.</b> British over-all strategy in 1777 had two major objectives: (1) to split <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_30a7.html" title="New England">New England</a> from the rest of the American states by a drive from Canada down the Hudson to Albany that would link up with another British force advancing north from New York City; and (2) to seize Philadelphia, seat of the Revolutionary government. The campaign in upper New York began in June 1777 with a two-pronged British drive from Canada. Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Burgoyne_e506.html" title="John Burgoyne">John Burgoyne</a>'s force of about 7,500, accompanied by some 400 Indians, pushed down <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Champlain_5cc6.html" title="Lake Champlain">Lake Champlain</a> and compelled 2,500 Continentals and militia under Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_St._Clair_11c7.html" title="Arthur St. Clair">Arthur St. Clair</a> to evacuate Ticonderoga on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_27.html" title="June 27">27 June</a>. Other American forces in the area under the over-all command of General Schuyler retired southward, but were able to slow the progress of the heavily laden British in the rugged terrain. The other prong of the British invading force consisted of some 700 regulars and Tories, and a band of 1,000 Indians, under command of Col. <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barry_St._Leger_6618.html" title="Barry St. Leger">Barry St. Leger</a>. This force moved east from <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Oswego_0a40.html" title="Fort Oswego">Fort Oswego</a> on <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Ontario_d812.html" title="Lake Ontario">Lake Ontario</a> into the <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohawk_Valley_5f94.html" title="Mohawk Valley">Mohawk Valley</a> with the objective of joining with Burgoyne at Albany. Leger laid siege to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Stanwix_0770.html" title="Fort Stanwix">Fort Stanwix</a> guarding the head of the Mohawk Valley on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_2.html" title="August 2">2 August</a>, but had to give up his campaign in mid-August when a relief force of 950 Continentals under Arnold scattered his Indian allies by means of a clever ruse. Meanwhile, Burgoyne continued his advance toward Albany, although his force was further weakened by the near annihilation on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_17.html" title="August 17">17 August</a> of a foraging detachment dispatched to capture stores at Bennington, Vt., protected by 2,600 militia under Brig. Gen. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Stark_f67c.html" title="John Stark">John Stark</a>. On 13 - <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_14.html" title="September 14">14 September</a> Burgoyne crossed the Hudson at Saratoga (now <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schuylerville%2C_New_York_b9d1.html" title="Schuylerville, New York">Schuylerville, New York</a>) and faced an American force of about 7,000 under Maj.

On <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_19.html" title="September 19">19 September</a>, Burgoyne, determined to reach Albany by winter, moved to attack Bemis Heights, where Gates' force barred the route southward in strongly entrenched positions. A major engagement occurred at Freeman's Farm, just forward of the main positions. The Americans yielded the field but inflicted twice as many casualties (600) as they suffered and held on to the Heights. For more than two weeks Burgoyne remained inactive while Maj. Gen. Sir <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Clinton_%28American_War_of_Independence%29_fb75.html" title="Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)">Henry Clinton</a>, now commanding troops in New York City, made an ineffectual effort to send relief forces up the Hudson. Finally, on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_7.html" title="October 7">7 October</a>, Burgoyne ventured out of his lines toward the American left with 1,650 troops and was repulsed in a sharp fight known as the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Bemis_Heights_b597.html" title="Battle of Bemis Heights">Battle of Bemis Heights</a>. On <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_9.html" title="October 9">9 October</a>, he retired to a position near Saratoga, where he was soon virtually surrounded by an American force now grown to nearly 15,000 men. Here, on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_17.html" title="October 17">17 October</a>, Burgoyne surrendered his entire army of about 5,000 men and large military stores.</p>

Some 15,000 troops under Howe's command sailed from New York on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_23.html" title="July 23">23 July</a> and landed at Head of Elk (now <a href="../../../e/l/k/Elkton%2C_Maryland_4d26.html" title="Elkton, Maryland">Elkton</a>), Maryland, a month later (<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_25.html" title="August 25">25 August</a>).

Maj. Gen. <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathanael_Greene_97aa.html" title="Nathanael Greene">Nathanael Greene</a>'s troops staved off Cornwallis' threatened envelopment of Washington's whole force, and the Americans fell back to <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chester%2C_Pennsylvania_fe05.html" title="Chester, Pennsylvania">Chester, Pennsylvania</a> in a hard-pressed but orderly retreat.

Howe established his main encampment in nearby <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germantown%2C_Pennsylvania_72c9.html" title="Germantown, Pennsylvania">Germantown</a>, stationing some 9,000 men there. Washington promptly attempted a coordinated attack against this garrison on the night of 3 - <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_4.html" title="October 4">4 October</a>. Columns were to move into Germantown from four different directions and begin the assault at dawn. Two of the columns, both made up of militia, never appeared to take part in the attack, but in the early phases of the fighting the columns under Greene and Divan achieved considerable success. However, a dense early morning fog which resulted in some American troops firing on each other while it permitted the better disciplined British to re-form for a counterattack, and a shortage of ammunition contributed to the still not fully explained retreat of the Americans, beginning about 0900. Howe pursued the Colonials a few miles as they fell back in disorder, but he did not exploit his victory. American losses were 673 killed and wounded and about 400 taken prisoner. British losses were approximately 521 killed and wounded.</p>

General Clinton, who relieved Howe as British commander in America on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_8.html" title="May 8">8 May</a> <a href="../../../1/7/7/1778.html" title="1778">1778</a>, decided to shift the main body of his troops from Philadelphia to a point nearer the coast where it would be easier to maintain close communications with the British Fleet. Consequently, he ordered evacuation of the 10,000-man garrison in Philadelphia on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_18.html" title="June 18">18 June</a>. As these troops set out through New Jersey toward New York, Washington broke camp at his winter headquarters in <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valley_Forge%2C_Pennsylvania_a31e.html" title="Valley Forge, Pennsylvania">Valley Forge, Pennsylvania</a>, and began pursuit of Clinton with an army of about 13,500 men.

For reasons not entirely clear Lee did not follow up early advantages gained, and when British reinforcements arrived on the scene he ordered a retreat. This encouraged Clinton to attack with his main force. Washington relieved Lee and assumed personal direction of the battle, which continued until dark without either side retiring from the field.

By 1781 they were convinced that this could not be accomplished while Virginia continued to serve as a base for American military operations. Hence, in January 1781, Clinton sent the American turncoat, Benedict Arnold, with 1,600 British troops to raid up the James River. By late May, the British had accumulated about 7,200 men in Virginia, including the remnants (1,500) of Cornwallis' force, which had come up from <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilmington%2C_North_Carolina_0392.html" title="Wilmington, North Carolina">Wilmington, North Carolina</a>. Cornwallis was given over-all command of British forces in Virginia and in late May and early June led them on raids deep into the state. At first, he was opposed only by a numerically greatly inferior force under the Marquis de Lafayette, but in mid-June the latter was reinforced by troops under Brig. Gen. <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Wayne_e568.html" title="Anthony Wayne">Anthony Wayne</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron_von_Steuben_7278.html" title="Baron von Steuben">Baron von Steuben</a>, drillmaster and inspector general of the Continental Army. Cornwallis then turned back to the coast to establish a base at Yorktown from which he could maintain sea communications with Clinton in New York.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Washington was tentatively preparing his northern army, recently reinforced by about 4,800 French troops under Lt. Gen. <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Baptiste_Donatien_de_Vimeur%2C_comte_de_Rochambeau_a192.html" title="Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau">Jean B. de Rochambeau</a>, for an attack on New York. However, he received confirmation on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_14.html" title="August 14">14 August</a> that Adm. <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fran%C3%A7ois_Joseph_Paul%2C_marquis_de_Grasetilly%2C_comte_de_Grasse_6ab9.html" title="François Joseph Paul, marquis de Grasetilly, comte de Grasse">Francois de Grasse</a>'s fleet had departed the French <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Indies_8d74.html" title="West Indies">West Indies</a> with 3,000 troops aboard and would be available for operations in the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chesapeake_Bay_70ed.html" title="Chesapeake Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> area until mid-October. He therefore finally determined to go to <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> with a substantial part of his army, including the French regulars under Rochambeau. He crossed the Hudson (20-<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_26.html" title="August 26">26 August</a>), made a feint in the direction of New York to hold Clinton in the city, and then struck southward across New Jersey and Pennsylvania to Maryland. In the meantime, De Grasse's fleet arrived off Yorktown on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_30.html" title="August 30">30 August</a>, debarked 3,000 French regulars to reinforce Lafayette, and on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_5.html" title="September 5">5 September</a> fought an indecisive naval engagement off the Virginia capes with a British fleet under Adm. Thomas Graves. After several days of maneuvering at sea, Graves retired temporarily to <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> for repairs, leaving the French fleet in control of Chesapeake Bay. This permitted Washington and Rochambeau to embark their forces in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> and sail via the Chesapeake and the <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_River_a894.html" title="James River">James River</a> to a point near Williamsburg (14-<a href="../../../s/e/p/September_24.html" title="September 24">24 September</a>).

Finally, after a night attack on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_16.html" title="October 16">16 October</a> failed to recapture key defense points, Cornwallis requested an armistice (<a href="../../../o/c/t/October_17.html" title="October 17">17 October</a>).</p>

<p>Cornwallis surrendered his entire command—about 8,000 men—on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_19.html" title="October 19">19 October</a>. In the siege the British lost 156 killed and 326 wounded; the Americans, 20 killed and 56 wounded; and the French, 52 killed and 134 wounded.

Lord North's ministry fell in March 1782 and the new cabinet opened direct negotiations with the American peace commissioners in Europe that resulted ultimately in ending the war.</p>
