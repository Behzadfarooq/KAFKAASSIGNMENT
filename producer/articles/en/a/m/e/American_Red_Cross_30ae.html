<p>The <b>American Red Cross</b> (chartered as the <b>American National Red Cross</b>) is a humanitarian organization that provides emergency assistance, disaster relief and education inside the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, as part of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement_9f28.html" title="International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement">International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies</a>.</p>
<p>Today, in addition to domestic <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disaster_relief.html" title="Disaster relief">disaster relief</a>, the American Red Cross offers compassionate services in five other areas: community services that help the needy; support and comfort for <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military.html" title="Military">military</a> members and their families; the collection, processing and distribution of lifesaving <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood.html" title="Blood">blood</a> and blood products; educational programs that promote health and safety; and international relief and development programs.</p>
<p>Governed by <a href="../../../v/o/l/Volunteers.html" title="Volunteers">volunteers</a> and supported by community <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donations.html" title="Donations">donations</a>, the American Red Cross is a nationwide network of more than 800 chapters and Blood Services regions, now broken up into divisions, dedicated to saving lives and helping people prevent, prepare for and respond to <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_emergency.html" title="Medical emergency">emergencies</a>. More than a million Red Cross volunteers and 30,000 employees annually mobilize relief to families affected by more than 67,000 disasters, train almost 12 million people in lifesaving skills and exchange more than a million emergency messages for U.S. military service personnel and their families. The Red Cross is also the largest supplier of blood and blood products to more than 3,000 hospitals across the nation and also assists victims of international disasters and conflicts at locations worldwide.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Red_Cross_30ae.html" title="Edit section: Clara Barton">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Clara Barton</span></h3>
<p><a href="../../../c/l/a/Clara_Barton_73ff.html" title="Clara Barton">Clara Barton</a> (1821-1912) had already had a career as a teacher and federal bureaucrat when the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> broke out. (She started teaching around the age of 15 or 16.) After working tirelessly on <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanitarian.html" title="Humanitarian">humanitarian</a> work during and after the conflict, on advice of her doctors, in 1869, she went to Europe for a restful vacation. There, she saw and became involved in the work of the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Red_Cross_694b.html" title="International Red Cross">International Red Cross</a> during the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franco-Prussian_War_94d8.html" title="Franco-Prussian War">Franco-Prussian War</a>, and determined to bring the organization home with her to America.</p>
<p>When Clara Barton began the organizing work in the U.S. in 1873, no one thought the country would ever again face an experience like the Civil War. However, Barton was not one to lose hope in the face of the bureaucracy, and she finally succeeded during the administration of President <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chester_A._Arthur_0aeb.html" title="Chester A. Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a> on the basis that the new American Red Cross organization could also be available to respond to other types of crisis.</p>
<p>As Barton expanded the original concept of the Red Cross to include assisting in any great national disaster, this service brought the United States the "Good Samaritan of Nations" label in the International Red Cross. Barton naturally became President of the American branch of the society, known officially as the American National Red Cross. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_D._Rockefeller_a11c.html" title="John D. Rockefeller">John D. Rockefeller</a> gave money to create a national headquarters in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_DC_48ce.html" title="Washington, DC">Washington, DC</a>, located one block from the <a href="../../../w/h/i/White_House_2f44.html" title="White House">White House</a>.</p>
<p>Clara Barton led one of the group's first major relief efforts, a response to the Great Fire of 1881 (<a href="../../../t/h/u/Thumb_Fire_fa2e.html" title="Thumb Fire">Thumb Fire</a>) in the Thumb region of Michigan, which occurred on Sept 4-6, 1881. Over 5000 were left homeless. The next major disaster dealt with was the <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnstown_Flood_a67e.html" title="Johnstown Flood">Johnstown Flood</a> which occurred on <a href="../../../m/a/y/May_31.html" title="May 31">May 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a>.

<p>For more than twenty years, the American Red Cross provided <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allograft.html" title="Allograft">allograft</a> tissue for <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transplant.html" title="Transplant">transplant</a> through its Tissue Services Program. It cared for thousands of donor families who gave the gift of tissue donation and helped more than 1 million transplant recipients in need of this life saving or life-enhancing gift of tissue. At the end of January 2005, the American Red Cross ended its Tissue Services program in order to focus on its primary missions of Disaster Relief and Blood Services.</p>

<p>A leader in the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blood_plasma.html" title="Blood plasma">plasma</a> industry, the Red Cross provides more than one quarter of the nation's plasma products.

<p>In February <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a>, the Red Cross completed its "Transformation," a $287 million program that: re-engineered Red Cross Blood Services' processing, testing and distribution system; and established a new management structure.</p>

<p>One technique the Red Cross has identified strong potential for treating people in new ways is through cellular therapies. This new method of treatment involves collecting and treating blood cells from a patient or other blood donor. The treated cells are then introduced into a patient to help revive normal cell function; replace cells that are lost as a result of disease, accidents or aging; or used to prevent illnesses from appearing.</p>
<p>Cellular therapy may prove to be particularly helpful for patients who are being treated for illnesses such as <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a>, where the treated cells may help battle cancerous cells.</p>

<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) took court action against the American Red Cross in response to deficiencies in their tracking and procedures for ensuring the safety of the blood supply.

<p>Although the American Red Cross is not a <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government.html" title="Government">government</a> agency, its authority to provide disaster relief was formalized when, in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1905.html" title="1905">1905</a>, the Red Cross was chartered by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congress.html" title="Congress">Congress</a> to "carry on a system of national and international relief in time of peace and apply the same in mitigating the sufferings caused by pestilence, famine, fire, floods, and other great national calamities, and to devise and carry on measures for preventing the same." The Charter is not only a grant of power, but also an imposition of duties and obligations to the nation, to disaster victims, and to the people who support its work with their donations.</p>
<p>American Red Cross disaster relief focuses on meeting people's immediate emergency disaster-caused needs. When a disaster threatens or strikes, the Red Cross provides <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shelter.html" title="Shelter">shelter</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food.html" title="Food">food</a>, and <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health.html" title="Health">health</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mental_health.html" title="Mental health">mental health</a> services to address basic human needs. In addition to these services, the core of Red Cross disaster relief is the assistance given to individuals and families affected by disaster to enable them to resume their normal daily activities independently.</p>
<p>The Red Cross also feeds emergency workers of other agencies, handles inquiries from concerned family members outside the disaster area, provides blood and blood products to disaster victims, and helps those affected by disaster to access other available resources. It is a member of the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD) and works closely with other agencies such as the <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salvation_Army_4c99.html" title="Salvation Army">Salvation Army</a> and the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_Radio_Emergency_Service_6875.html" title="Amateur Radio Emergency Service">Amateur Radio Emergency Service</a> with whom it has Memorandums of Understanding.</p>
<p>The American Red Cross also works hard to encourage preparedness by providing important literature on readiness. Many chapters also offer free classes to the general public.</p>
<p>A major misconception by the general public is that the American Red Cross provides medical facilities, engages in search and rescue operations or deploys ambulances to disaster areas. As an emergency support agency, the American Red Cross does not engage in these first responder activities; instead, these first responder roles are left to local, state or federal agencies as dictated by the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Response_Plan_2b0d.html" title="National Response Plan">National Response Plan</a>. The confusion arises since other Red Cross societies across the globe may provide these functions; for example, the Cruz Roja Mexicana (Mexican Red Cross) runs a national ambulance service. Furthermore, American Red Cross Emergency Response Vehicles (ERVs) look similar to ambulances. These ERVs instead are designed for bulk distribution of relief supplies, such as hot meals, drinks or other relief supplies. Although American Red Cross shelters usually have a nurse assigned to the facility, they are not equipped to provide medical care beyond emergency first aid.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, the Red Cross, like many charitable organizations, solicited funds and blood donations for Red Cross activities for the victims of the attacks. <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernadine_Healy_523b.html" title="Bernadine Healy">Dr. Bernadine Healy</a>, the president of the American Red Cross, appeared on telethons urging individuals to give generously. However, according to America's Blood Centers, the nonprofit consortium that provides the other 50% of the United States blood supply, no national blood drive was needed, since localized blood drives in the affected areas would be sufficient to meet the demand. The American Red Cross felt that the terrorist attacks were a sign of increased instability and urged people to donate blood, even though it wasn't needed at that time. In the end, some blood was destroyed unused.</p>
<p>Also, the American Red Cross created the <i>Liberty Fund</i> that was ostensibly designed for relief for victims of the terrorist attacks. However, when the fund was closed in October, after reaching the goals of donations, only 30% of the $547 million received was spent. Dr. Healy announced that the majority of the remainder of the money would be used to increase blood supply, improve telecommunications, and prepare for terror attacks in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>In February 2002, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Yorker_6fe2.html" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i> magazine reported that American Red Cross representatives were visiting upscale apartment buildings in wealthy Manhattan neighborhoods and distributing donated money (up to three months' rent or mortgage payments) to New Yorkers who had been "displaced, traumatized, or merely inconvenienced" by the terrorist attacks, without any regard to whether the recipients were actually in financial need<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/?020218ta_talk_paumgarten" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/?020218ta_talk_paumgarten" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>.</p>
<p>Many donors felt that they had donated specifically to the victims of the September 11 attacks and objected to Healy's official plan for the diversion of funds. Survivors complained of the bureaucratic process involved in requesting funds and the slow delivery of the checks to meet immediate needs. Congressional hearings were called and New York State Attorney General <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eliot_Spitzer_3963.html" title="Eliot Spitzer">Eliot Spitzer</a> investigated the Red Cross. In the end, the American Red Cross appointed former U.S. senator <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_J._Mitchell_dd32.html" title="George J. Mitchell">George Mitchell</a> to handle distribution of the funds. Dr. Healy was forced to resign for her role in the situation, and the Red Cross pledged that all funds would go to directly benefit the victims of the September 11 attacks. <a href="http://philanthropy.com/free/update/2001/10/2001102601.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://philanthropy.com/free/update/2001/10/2001102601.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> Healy received a severance payment of $1,569,630 <a href="http://www.give.org/reports/arc.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.give.org/reports/arc.asp" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. In the end, out of the $961 million received, 71% went as cash assistance to those directly affected, 15% went for long term mental care and hospital care for the victims and people in the affected region, and 10% went for immediate disaster relief like shelters, food, and health care. The remaining 4% went for administration. <a href="http://www.redcross.org/press/disaster/ds_pr/pdfs/libertyfund013103.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.redcross.org/press/disaster/ds_pr/pdfs/libertyfund013103.pdf" rel="nofollow">[10]</a></p>
<p>Significant changes to Red Cross fundraising collection and policy have since been implemented after the Liberty Fund debacle. Numerous watchdog organizations, such as Charity Navigator, have since given high praise to the improved system of honoring donor's intent and minimizing administration costs.</p>

<p>The 2005 Hurricane Season proved to be the most challenging disaster response the American Red Cross had ever seen in its history. Forecasting a major disaster before the landfall of <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>, the organization enlisted 2,000 volunteers throughout the nation to be on a "stand by" deployment list.</p>
<p>During and after the Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma and Rita, the American Red Cross had opened 1,470 different shelters across and registered 3.8 million overnight stays. A total of 244,000 Red Cross workers (95% of whom were non-paid volunteers) were utilized to provide sheltering, casework, communication and assessment services throughout these three hurricanes. In addition, 346,980 comfort kits (which contain hygiene essentials such as toothpaste, soap, washclothes and toys for children) and 205,360 clean up kits (containing brooms, mops and bleach) were distributed. For mass care, the organization served 68 million snacks and meals to victims of the disasters and to rescue workers. The Red Cross also had their Disaster Health services meet 596,810 contacts, and Disaster Mental Health services met 826,590 contacts. Red Cross emergency financial assistance was provided to 1.4 million families, which encompassed a total of 4 million people. Hurricane Katrina was the first natural disaster in the United States that the American Red Cross utilized their "Safe and Well" family location website. <a href="http://www.redcross.org/images/pdfs/Katrina_OneYearReport.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.redcross.org/images/pdfs/Katrina_OneYearReport.pdf" rel="nofollow">[11]</a><a href="http://www.redcross.org/news/ds/hurricanes/2005/facts.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.redcross.org/news/ds/hurricanes/2005/facts.html" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>
<p>On February 3rd 2006, 5 months after Katrina's landfall, the American Red Cross announced that it had met its fundraising goals, and would no longer engage in new 2005 Hurricane relief fundraising. The National organization urged the public to help other charities engaged in hurricane relief work, or to donate to their local Red Cross chapters. An American Red Cross statement was issued saying that 91 cents of every dollar donated specifically for the Hurricane Katrina disaster will go directly to disaster relief. This overhead is considered low for such a large organization.</p>

<p>The American Red Cross, as part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and its nearly 100 million volunteers, educates and mobilizes communities to overcome life-threatening vulnerabilities. The core focus areas of the American Red Cross International Services Department are global health, disaster preparedness and response, and Restoring Family Links and International Humanitarian Law dissemination. The American Red Cross is involved with many international projects, such as the Measles Initiative, malaria programs in Africa, disaster responses worldwide, and relief efforts in response to the 2004 South Asia tsunami.</p>
<p>American Red Cross international disaster response and preparedness programs provide relief and development assistance to millions of people annually who suffer as a result of natural and human-made disasters around the world. To respond quickly and effectively, the American Red Cross has pre-positioned emergency relief supplies in two warehouses managed by the International Federation in Dubai and Panama, which are used to respond to disasters such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami disaster, the 2005 Pakistan/South Asia earthquake, ongoing crises in Africa and hurricanes in the Caribbean and the Americas. An Emergency Response Unit (ERU) is another method with which the American Red Cross responds to international emergencies. An ERU is made up of trained personnel and pre-packaged technical equipment that is crucial in responding to sudden, large-scale disasters and emergencies in remote locations.</p>
<p>American Red Cross International Services global health initiatives focus on reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, and combating infectious diseases. Through cost-effective, community-based health interventions, the American Red Cross targets large numbers of people in need and focuses on accessibility and equity of care, community participation, and integration with other community development initiatives, such as water and sanitation projects and food and nutrition programs. An example of its health programming is the Measles Initiative, launched in 2001, as a partnership committed to reducing measles deaths globally, with the goal of cutting measles deaths by 90% by 2010 compared to 2000. Leading these efforts are the American Red Cross, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United Nations Foundation, UNICEF and the World Health Organization. During its first five years (2001-2005), the Initiative supported the vaccination of more than 217 million children in Africa, saving 1.2 million lives. Through these efforts, measles cases and deaths have dropped by 48% worldwide and by 60% in Africa, where measles deaths and disability are highest. Building on its success in Africa, the Initiative has expanded into Asia. The Initiative increasingly provides additional complementary life-saving health interventions in its campaigns, including vitamin A, de-worming medicine and insecticide-treated bed nets for malaria prevention. The Measles Initiative has mobilized more than $308 million to support campaigns in more than 43 countries in Africa and Asia.

<p>In December 2006, the American Red Cross joined as a founding partner of the Malaria No More campaign, which was formed by leading non-governmental organizations to inspire individuals, institutions and organizations in the private sector to support a comprehensive approach to end malaria, a devastating but preventable disease The American Red Cross role in Malaria No More is to support local Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers in Africa who are educating families and communities about malaria prevention and treatment, such as proper and consistent use of insecticide-treated bed nets. The American Red Cross provides technical assistance and capacity-building support to its partners to fight malaria in even the most difficult-to-reach communities.

<p>The American Red Cross handles international tracing requests and searches for families who have been separated by war or natural or man-made disaster and are trying to locate relatives worldwide. This is not a genealogical service but one that attempts to re-establish contact between family members separated at a time of war or disaster. Restoring Family Links services also provide the exchange of hand-written Red Cross Messages between individuals and their relatives who may be refugees or prisoners of war. At any given time, the American Red Cross Restoring Family Links program is handling the aftermath of 20-30 wars and conflicts. The world-wide structure of Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross make this service possible. When new information from many former Soviet Union archives became available in that 1990s, a special unit, named the Holocaust and War Victims Tracing Center, was created to handle World War II and Holocaust tracing services.

<p>As part of its mission, American Red Cross International Services has a mandate to educate the American public about the guiding principles of international humanitarian law (IHL) for conduct in warfare as set forth by the Geneva Conventions of 1949. In doing so, American Red Cross International Services provides support to American Red Cross chapters nationwide in their IHL dissemination efforts, offering IHL courses and providing training opportunities for IHL instructors. It is also working toward the implementation of the Exploring Humanitarian Law (EHL) program in the United States.</p>

<p>Although not a government agency, the American Red Cross provides important services to the United States military. The most notable service is emergency family communications, where families can contact the Red Cross to send important family messages (e.g. death in the family, or new birth). In such , the Red Cross can also act as a verifying agency of the situation. The American Red Cross works closely with other military societies, such as the Veteran's Administration, to provide other services to soldiers and their families. The American Red Cross is not involved with <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoners_of_war.html" title="Prisoners of war">prisoners of war</a>; rather, these are monitored by the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross_44fe.html" title="International Committee of the Red Cross">International Committee of the Red Cross</a>, an international rather than national body.</p>
<p>A persistent comment by many veterans of World War II is their memory of the American Red Cross selling "comfort items" such as toothpaste and cigarettes to the troops. The American Red Cross acknowledges that they did indeed sell such items, and the unfortunate repercussions have marred the agency's name for many years. In response to such allegations, the American Red Cross responds with these facts, indicating that the organization did not initially want to charge for such products<a href="http://www.atlantaredcross.org/atf/cf/%7B9C0A352A-B40E-4F7A-AB89-B7D20FF7F10B%7D/WWII%20letter.pdf#search=%22At%20the%20request%20of%20the%20Secretary%20of%20War%2C%20the%20American%20Red%20Cross%20charged%20a%20nominal%20fee%20for%20coffee%20and%20doughnuts%2C%20as%20well%20as%20for%20lodging%2C%20barber%20and%20valet%20services%2C%20in%20stationary%20military%20installations%20overseas.%20It%20did%20not%20charge%20in%20mobile%20facilities%20such%20as%20Clubmobiles.%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.atlantaredcross.org/atf/cf/%7B9C0A352A-B40E-4F7A-AB89-B7D20FF7F10B%7D/WWII%20letter.pdf#search=%22At%20the%20request%20of%20the%20Secretary%20of%20War%2C%20the%20American%20Red%20Cross%20charged%20a%20nominal%20fee%20for%20coffee%20and%20doughnuts%2C%20as%20well%20as%20for%20lodging%2C%20barber%20and%20valet%20services%2C%20in%20stationary%20military%20installations%20overseas.%20It%20did%20not%20charge%20in%20mobile%20facilities%20such%20as%20Clubmobiles.%22" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the request of the Secretary of War, the American Red Cross charged a nominal fee for coffee and doughnuts, as well as for lodging, barber and valet services, in stationary military installations overseas. It did not charge in mobile facilities such as Clubmobiles.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This request was made because other agencies working overseas were compelled to charge for similar items. Giving these items free to U.S. service members would, it was feared, demoralize Allied troops.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The official War Department recommendation was made in a letter dated May 20, 1942, written by Mr. Stimson, Secretary of War, and addressed to the Chairman of The American National Red Cross.</li>
