<p><i>For example, there is a widely held belief in Australia that "American spellings" are a modern intrusion.

<dd>Americanisation is a word used by non-Americans. Both s and z spellings are valid in British English though some countries prefer one over the other with the s being predominant. Hence I think this should instead be spelt using the spelling that people who use the word would use: Americanisation. --Kuan 02:00, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p><i>Americanisation is the a term used for the perceived influence America has on the culture of other countries, substituing local culture with something of an American culture.</i></p>
<p>I removed "perceived" from the above sentence, as it implies that the idea of this influence is not grounded in reality. I think it's quite obvious that US culture has an enormous impact on the world. The debatable issues are 1) does the United States actively persue Americanization, or is it embraced, and 2) is it a bad thing? --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Gilbert_b934.html" title="User:Stephen Gilbert">Stephen Gilbert</a></p>
<p>I think "percieved" should be re-added. There is no confusion. It means what it says. Simply that there may or may not be an influence. Not that it is not grounded in reality. It is hard to define what Americanized means. Such as in negative circumstances like Britain's increasing love for fast food is often mentioned Americanization. But this could be debated. So even more reason to add the word back in. No doubt it has had an anormous impact on the world, but isn't it meaning more "in the present" rather than things like medicine. Because not only America has medicine and sanitation. I think it's more about general culture. (this is also in reply to crazytalk below) Papa leaf 05:52, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I object to the sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"It [Americanization] is often used in a negative context."</dd>

<p>What about people using cell phones, automobiles and Smallpox vaccinations? People using those items are not known to curse America for making their life better (I have no idea who discovered Smallpox vaccines, but you get my jist). Also, the term "<i>often</i>", if used, should be backed up by sources. I replaced the sentence with:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"When encountered unwillingly or perforce, it has a negative connotation; when sought voluntarily, it has a positive connotation."</dd>
</dl>
<p>To me, that sentence lets the world have the good with the bad, although it still seems a bit dark. (I did use "perforce" - one word - on purpose, rather than the two-worded "per force".) Before reverting the change, please debate here first. I know it is not a popular stance to take in this day and age, so forgive me for defending my country's honor. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrazyTalk_c937.html" title="User:CrazyTalk">CrazyTalk</a> 01:34, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's a tad ironic that the three items you mention, mobile phones, cars and the smallpox vaccine, were not invented/developed in the USA. The car was invented in Germany, smallpox vaccine in the UK and mobile phones were not invented by any country on their own.

<p>Well, it's clear that you are desperately trying to defend your countries honour. But step back for a minute and look to see if it is insulting. We all know that when we say Americanisation we do not mean things such as inventions. Papa leaf 05:52, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>100% agree with you there. This page is not about the good things which the U.S. does in the world. No one calls those things Americanisation. When the term Americanisation is used it is used negatively most of the time. This article should be written by non-Americans as they are not the ones which use the term. --Kuan 01:55, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Wouldnt it be less ambiguous to call it "US culture" than "american culture"? The term american is ambiguous as it also refers to the other people of the continent besides the US residents. If theres no opposing it, I suggest that it be changed for clarifying purposes.<a href="../../../l/t/d/User%7ELtDoc_16d4.html" title="User:LtDoc">LtDoc</a> 01:56, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This debate has been done to death. In the English language, "American" is the proper adjective for things from the U.S. It's unfortunate and potentially confusing, but so are a lot of things in English, and it's not for an NPOV encyclopedia to try to change usage. Best, <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 13:48, July 29, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aside from "unfortunate" and "potentially confusing", you forgot "culturally imperialistic" and "offensive". I could thorw in "appopriation" and some the very Americanization of the Latin America (by a huge pressure applied by the US) to the causes of it. Besides that, "US culture" is a term which causes no confusion whatsoever, isnt offensive to anybody, and more than adequately substitutes the term "american". Also, I <i>do</i> believe that is due to a NPOV encyclopedia to minimize its bias in the articles. If it is not for a encyclopedia to do so, whom should do it??? So far we have a pro-change of 2-1.<a href="../../../l/t/d/User%7ELtDoc_16d4.html" title="User:LtDoc">LtDoc</a> 22:14, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>LtDoc, I think the article would be much the worse if it did not reflect worldwide ussage. However, the association of the word "America" for the US is perhaps one of the prime examples of Americanization and the article should probably call attention to that. In any case as, unfortunate word ussages go, I think many uses of the term cultural imperialism ranks up there (along with the afforementioned use of America) in the worst of list do to its ambiguity and appropriation (i.e. it means other things than the cultural component of the historical practice of imperialism).<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESammydirectproduct_4f90.html" title="User:Sammydirectproduct">Sammydirectproduct</a> 15:25, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well I am British too and don't like the suggested use of "US culture", but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be changed. This is not a British Encyclopedia and it doesn't need to be done our way, it should be done in a way that it is factual and makes sense to everyone. America does after all include North,South and Central America.. HOWEVER, I don't feel it needs to be changed because it states in the first line "the influence of the UNITED STATES of America" on other countries. Perhaps a bit could be added about the influence the US has on other parts of America? Like the Americanisation of Latin America that has been mentioned.</p>

<p>The entire "Media" section talks about changing material for the American culture, while both definitions at the top define Americanization as changing culture itself to become more American. Neither the American culture nor the American audience, can become Americanized. Neither can the culture which provided the material that's changed. The BBC wouldn't have been Americanized if NOVA had changed "maize" to "corn". And if the BBC isn't forced to change, then there's no Americanization occurring, according to the two definitions provided.</p>
<p>Is the answer to this contradiction to add a new definition which means making something from another culture palatable to American audiences or consumers? The disambig argument gets stronger, if that's done. 198.49.180.40 19:37, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I had hoped for far more from this article: sample questions from U.S. citizenship exams, statistics on United States novels in foreign translation, or a survey of U.S. television shows in international syndication. Quite frankly <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Price_is_Right_around_the_world_eb0d.html" title="The Price is Right around the world">this page</a> says far more about the spread of American culture than what I read here - and the few assertions about United States media are unsourced and dubious. One could dispute the claims by noting how the United States is one of the few countries where the standard method of screening foreign language films is with subtitles rather than dubbing, or by tracking the influence that international box office receipts have had in de-Americanizing American motion pictures, or by contesting that Hollywood remakes certain foreign language pictures for economic rather than cultural reasons: the United States is the only country whose domestic market is large enough to finance the highest level of production values. Having read that section with gritted teeth, I scrolled down in search of something better and found nothing. Surely this article could improve. 72.199.30.31 10:27, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'm somewhat of a Wikipedia noob, and I've never merged an article or anything, but I guess I'll attempt it now or in the near future...or should I wait for a response...? Ah, whatever I'm just going to leave this comment and if nothing happens for a few days I'll probably just try merging them myself. I'm not even sure if I wrote my signature properly&#160;:( -- <a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnesh_5043.html" title="User:Arnesh">Arnesh</a> 02:43 16 November 2006</p>

<dd>I think it would be better to make disambiguation page as it has more than one meaning. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeoW_4cd0.html" title="User:GeoW">GeoW</a> 10:30, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
