<p>I am in the process of disamming America. I'm getting there. I'm about halfway through the list.

<dd>Wow, it's sure taking a long time to get through the other half, eh? Or are new undisambiguated links added on a more-or-less daily basis? The fact that 99% of the links to this page intend to reference its United States meaning should clearly indicate to everyone that America should redirect to the United States page. Anything else is a purely political argument that does nothing to help the readers of this encycolpedia. So can we agree that if in another year there still exists a significant number (can we agree to more than 100?) of links to this disambiguation page then we'll move this page to America (disambiguation), redirect America to United States, and end this argument? <a href="../../../e/w/l/User%7EEwlyahoocom_d1b9.html" title="User:Ewlyahoocom">Ewlyahoocom</a> 17:21, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I deleted the entry complaining about living in America. If you feel this is censorship then feel free to put it back.

Please do <b>not</b> remove other's comments from talk pages. That is not acceptable. I posed a question, and rather than answer it, you deleted my entire comment and accused me of vandalism. If you cannot answer my question, perhaps you should not have involved yourself at all. Wikipedia is not a forum for pushing for the supremacy of anti-US views. Wikipedia should give accurate information, and that means the most common use of terms should be presented first.</p>

<p>My point is still valid. Online English dictionaries also place the United States as the first meaning. That is the most common meaning in English.</p>

<p>Also, "The Americas" are two continents, and it is therefore still incorrect to refer to them as a single continent. -- <a href="../../../d/p/a/User%7EDpark_3481.html" title="User:Dpark">Dpark</a> 05:44, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with Dpark, and I am not an American, but in the English language (and this is the English wiki) the word America is an appropriate and totally correct name for the United States of America. In most English-speaking countries the term America is rarely used to refer to two continents South and North America together, as is the case in many other languages. --Harald84.153.10.66 17:16, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've re-removed the comment about the "correctness" of "America" meaning "USA". I'm aware that there are legitimate reasons not to use America to mean the USA, but the fact is that this is a common name for the country, widely used all over the world. It's been like that for a very long time; thus "America" simply <b>is</b> another name for the USA. With naming issues such as these, common usage makes it so, and it's not Wikipedia's job to prescribe "correct" usage of popular names for places. Instead, I'm going to link to <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_words_for_American_4bc3.html" title="Alternative words for American">Alternative words for American</a>, which describes this conflict better. <a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdc_936f.html" title="User:Cdc"><small>CDC</small></a> <a href="../../../c/d/c/User_talk%7ECdc_878d.html" title="User talk:Cdc"><small>(talk)</small></a> 17:48, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well firstly, I think removing entries in talk pages is wrong on principle. Ho else are we supposed to communicate?? This is only a good way to get people mad at you and start a battle. If starting battles is your goal LEAVE! that said I also think dating (if not signing) your comments is essencial for clarity. Now on to America. As it pertains to continents, it is the name of a region containing two continents and not in any way a single one. (I'm fixing this). I like the way the USA is currently refferenced (although it's slightly misleading, I'm fixing this too), although it is true that in english it is the most common use, it is incorrectly used this way. <a href="../../../o/l/l/User%7EOlleicua_887d.html" title="User:Olleicua">Olleicua</a> 23:28, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Obviously the word <i>America</i> has many different meanings or Wikipedia would not need a disambiguation page for it. Indeed, the two principal uses of the word (as labels for either the lands of the western hemisphere collectively or for the United States of America specifically) are deeply disputed, with some users on both sides insulted by the use on the opposite side. Sadly this debate is unlikely to end soon. Many residents of the United States will live their entire lives unaware of the dispute, using the narrow sense of the word routinely, emphatically, patriotically, even solemnly. This page serves to direct Wikipedia users to the correct name of the article they seek. On Wikipedia, the article on America in the broad sense is <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">Americas</a>. This is how the link should appear on this page. Since titles and vehicle names require a formatted appearance, they are piped to appear correctly. Geographical terms and other names are not piped. If one wishes to change the name of any article, do so at the article but not the disambiguation page. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 04:26, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is part of why I stopped being active with Wikipedia for so long. I'm not willing to sit on top of articles and wait to push the revert button. It's too much hassle to constantly watch articles just to remove others' biases. The US is no longer listed first, even though we already had that discussion. I got tired of moving it back. I've changed "America" back to "The Americas", because it's what's consistent, both with Wikipedia internally and with general English-language use. But I'm sure someone will change it again soon enough. Agh. -- <a href="../../../d/p/a/User%7EDpark_3481.html" title="User:Dpark">Dpark</a> 13:54, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is no need to vote if we can establish which is more frequently used.

<dd>Arguably, there is a need. First: you have not established <i>why</i> and have proceeded to wilfully insinuate edits of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">dubious reliability and poor quality</a> and this <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">preference/position</a> with weasel words like "seems". Can you cite anything to back up claims of prevailing usage in the countries you indicate ... which seems to change by the minute? I've at least indicated ordering and simpler renditions above (as one will find in dictionaries) that contrast with this. More to point: this is a <i>disambig</i> page, not an <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28disambiguation_pages%29_cc35.html#Individual_entries" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (disambiguation pages)">'exploratory' article (as per guidelines)</a> where <a href="../../../u/s/e/Use_of_the_word_American_8aee.html" title="Use of the word American">details can be (and are) better elaborated elsewhere</a>. Moreover, I haven't been alone in restoring the <i>status quo</i> and, despite your POV otherwise, a vote may be <i>required</i> to nail this down. Lastly, you recently introduced retaliatory editing without prior discussion/rationale here (as above) or a consensus and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=America&amp;diff=38258544&amp;oldid=38257583" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=America&amp;diff=38258544&amp;oldid=38257583" rel="nofollow">by passing off your editorial preference merely as "Copyedit"</a>.</dd>

But the result would be the same in any case. There is no question of the result here and a vote among few people would only encourage the anti-American contingent to make a decision based on bias rather than actual usage of the word. It doesn't take any research to know that this is the most-common meaning of the word, I only did so because you seemed not to want to believe it because of your biases. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUris_074e.html" title="User:Uris">Uris</a> 13:52, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

What we should be doing is citing the most-common meaning of the word to our mutual satisfaction, not inviting like-minded thinkers into a "vote" of the most-common meaning when it can be easily verified by citations and sources. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUris_074e.html" title="User:Uris">Uris</a> 14:32, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not agree ... more appropriately, assertions regarding usage have not been substantiated sufficiently. And Wp is <i>based</i> on constructive discourse no matter what one's stripe. And a vote will encourage like- <i>and</i> unlike-minded thinkers to weigh in based on available information. If a groundswell does not support a vote or if a consensus believes otherwise, I'll defer ... but I don't see it. Until then ...

<dd>So, what you are saying is that you don't believe that the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSDAB_2469.html#Order_of_entries" title="WP:MOSDAB">most-common meaning of the term</a> (which Wikipedia's guidelines demand we use to decide ordering on this page) is as important as what the "voting public" you will personally call into action think it should be. Or, are you saying it is impossible for us to find the most-common meaning? For what reason do you feel that my citation was faulty? You seem to be saying that the English-speaking world is biased in its usage of the term, and that we should alter this usage with a vote. And if Wp is based on constructive discourse, why do you continually call an end to the discussion here? <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUris_074e.html" title="User:Uris">Uris</a> 14:40, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This began when I made edits citing "frequency of use" as Wikipedia's guidelines tell us to do, and you would revert without providing any reasoning to that end.

<dd>When you made your initial "Copyedit", contrary to the <i>status quo</i> and asserting an unsourced position without discussion (unlike my earlier comments in the prior section), that necessitated my response and actions afterward. Remember, you precipitated this recent round: if you feel that I've been incivil in response, I apologise.

However, they aren't the same dictionaries so it is possible that the ones you cite continue to order them in that way. It would be useful to this discussion if someone out there has a current version of the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> since they don't allow free access to it online.</dd>

<dd>This would not establish the greater land mass as the most-common usage, but would at least establish it as a legitimate contender. I think looking at the whole picture, it may be difficult to overcome the fact that each of the 100 most recent news stories about "America", all from different sources, all reference the country and not the land mass. Yet, I am willing to live with either result since there is at least one source out there disagreeing. <a href="../../../u/r/i/User%7EUris_074e.html" title="User:Uris">Uris</a> 16:28, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I don't have current editions of these dictionaries (and I'll take a peek once I'm out next), I doubt they would reveal anything different. That would also imply that usage (or at least the orderings stated) have overwhelmingly shifted in only a few years; as with other cites above, it may also just reflect (opining aside) editorial license for a particular publication. This might be more of an issue if the volumes were, say, ten years old or if the topic of note dealt with nascent/contemporary terms. This isn't the case here.</dd>

<p>The very fact that the anon editor used the word "Americentric" in refering to me as a person with a bias favoring the United States only further proves my point that in the English language it is much more common for the word "America" to refer to the United States.--<a href="../../../r/w/r/User%7ERWR8189_3944.html" title="User:RWR8189">RWR8189</a> 09:10, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

You make a good point here, a very good one. But I must say that the need to recognze the pervasive usage of the word America to refer to the US, does not in anyway supersede the necessity - as an encyclopedia, and therefore an educational tool - to point out clearly the fact that the usage is, if not flat-out wrong, at the very least erroneous. The simple fact that a large group of people use a term a certain way, does not make that usage correct, IMHO. And this also has an impact on the usage of the term "American" A little earlier, someone talked about the fact that no state/country actually use the word "America" in their official names. In history that has not always been true (<a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Provinces_of_Central_America_d8dc.html" title="United Provinces of Central America">United Provinces of Central America</a>), and Costa Rica and Nicaragua still have the words <i>America Central</i> on their flags. But even if that were true, and more importantly, there is the OAS, which is the <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organization_of_American_States_a97a.html" title="Organization of American States">Organization of American States</a>, or PAHO (<a href="../../../p/a/n/Pan_American_Health_Organization_4558.html" title="Pan American Health Organization">Pan American Health Organization</a>), two organizations that span North, Central and South America. The USA is part of both the OAS and PAHO, thus directly admitting that there are more people entitled to be called "Americans" than just US citizens. Finally the language argument I saw a little earlier, seems phony to me, no offense. Arguing that it is okay to redirect America to the USA because of its common usage in English is phony, because I am convinced that people who make the argument would reject the fact that in Spanish for example, all over Latin America, the term "Americano" which translates to "American" means from the American continent(s); idem for "America". All in all, I believe that America must redirect to an "America (disambiguation)" page, and that it is the fairest solution to all grievances: It recognizes the fact that the US is quite often refered to as America, and recognizes the fact that this is not a universal thing. P.S: In Africa, we have the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_African_Republic_87d3.html" title="Central African Republic">Central African Republic</a>, and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> (different from <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Africa_7a65.html" title="Southern Africa">Southern Africa</a>). We don't have this naming issue, because the countries new governments knew better than to completely appropriate the name of the continent as their own. IMHO, the controversy starts with the issue of a complex of "manifest destiny", and <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linguistic_imperialism.html" title="Linguistic imperialism">linguistic imperialism</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThemalau_4101.html" title="User:Themalau">Themalau</a> 21:47, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am aware. It is obviously required we start from scratch. If there is an unimpeachable RS that says that "In the English language when referring to America in the singular tense, it is most common for this word to refer to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States of America</a>," then my mind is made up.

<p>The problem is, even if the common usage is indeed a reference to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States of America</a>, it is in my opinion almost impossible to find a definitive source that proves that true, or false for that matter. Every possible RS I've seen, so far, never goes as far as to state that the more common usage is one or the other. The closest I have come to finding a definitive statement have been dictionary listings for America, which have cases going both ways on the issue. With this in mind I will cease to revert this article, barring of course me, or someone else, being able to find a RS, that is not easily canceled out by another to the contray, for the Word refering to the United States in common usage. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWildnox_f5f1.html" title="User:Wildnox">Wildnox</a> 22:21, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Objectively, it is easy to demonstrate that the most common meaning of "America" by a long, long way is "United States of America". (Just as an American is someone from the USA.) I'm happy to demonstrate this with sources if people say what sources they will accept (there are plenty of usage and style guides that encourage the use of the word "American" to mean of or pertaining to the USA - such as that of <i>The Times</i>). Based on commonality, one might expect that meaning to appear first - however, I do not seek to argue that, but instead that we should aid the reader by making the most common meaning clear by adding the phrase "or more commonly" before the second bullet point.</p>
<p>I'd add that I am surprised by Wildnox's comment that adding "more commonly" is POV (or in English is expressing an opinion rather than a fact). I don't believe it is - as it is clearly not arguing that either meaning ought to be more prevalent, it is merely stating that one meaning is far, far more prevalent than another (which can easily be demonstrated), <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 17:01, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Those don't count since they're indivisible. Only certain adjectives designate that the word America refers to the landmass rather than the country, including North, South, and Latin. In fact, I can't think of any other word in the English Language that does so. These three adjectives change the meaning of word from a political region to a geographic one, and it's hardly the only occasion. Is Inner Mongolia part of Mongolia? Is Equatorial Guinea part of Guinea? Is Northern Ireland part of Ireland? (Actually, let's not start that last debate again.) I believe these terms are used in Spanish as well; the nouns, however, by themselves, almost always refer to the political regions. I'll grant that "America" is used to refer to the Americas on occasion, especially by native speakers of Spanish (note the grammar of the majority of the more heated arguments for "America" as the landmass) or Portuguese, and significantly often by native speakers. However, every time I pick up almost anything British, especially The Economist, I marvel at the frequency with which they use "America" to mean the United States, compared to American publications, which tend to avoid the word entirely. I have no hard data, though; I'm not sure where I'd get them.

<dd>I especially like the part where it says <b>any indentation system is acceptable.</b> Since my post was underneath Acjelen's to keep things in chronological order, and was off-set from that post to show that I wasn't responding to it but to one above, and since that was clear enough that you knew that I was talking to you, I'd say I followed the guidelines pretty well. So where do you get off talking about "indenting correctly," then? You know what, don't answer that; this discussion is already too asinine and off-topic.

<p>Firstly, there is no reason to bold the word <i>America</i> in the entry for the U.S. on this page. Secondly, if the landmass of the western hemisphere is divided into more than one continents by geographers (and it is), it is divided into two: North America and South America. Obviously what many call "Central America" and "the Caribbean" must be on one continent or the other. Generally they are considered part of North America. Not listing Central American and the Caribbean in the first entry of this page is not to dismiss them anymore than it is to dismiss The Great Plains by not listing it. The point is that the slightest division of the Americas is into two parts. -21:08, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wrong. In the whole of Latin America (i.e.: <i>most of America</i>), <b>Central America</b> is listed as a third subcontinent or landmass, next to the North and South ones. This is what is told in school in the whole of South America and parts of Mexico. I think this should be addressed.--<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamifb_b460.html" title="User:Damifb">Damifb</a> 06:31, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think part of the problem may be translation. In English, listing North America, Central America, and South America is similar to listing arm, elbow, torso or dogs, beagles, cats. Beagles are dogs. The elbow is part of the arm. If Central America is worthy of being listed separately, why not other regions with unique identities like The Great Plains, Alaska, or Greenland. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 14:52, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Can you logically tell me that Central America is named Central America by historical accident, when it just happens to be smack between North and South America?

<dd>Hi again. Thank you all for your participation. My conclusion: 1) Yes, it's about translation: Central America is northamerican in English, and it is NOT in Spanish. 2) WilyD said: "Central America is part of North America - it's just the definition of terms. We could have defined these terms dfferently - (well nnot us, but people at the time)". He is showing ignorance in this, because, as I said before, ask ANY southamerican and he/she would tell you that he/she learned in school that Central America is not part of North America. Now, if Wily had said "this is it in the English-speaking world", I would tell him he's may be right.--<a href="../../../d/a/m/User%7EDamifb_b460.html" title="User:Damifb">Damifb</a> 12:57, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think you're missing the point entirely. The issue has <i>nothing</i> to do with geography - it's simply a matter of linguistics and word meanings. What <i>similar, but non-identical</i> words mean in Spanish is irrelevent. The debate about whether Central America is part of North America literally <i>cannot</i> exist in Spanish, because neither <i>North America</i> nor <i>Central America</i> are part of Spanish - they're just English words. Just like it makes no sense to ask <i>Is jogging a kind of walking?</i> to try to answer <i>Is "Pulsar" a kind of "Faire une promenade"?</i> - this second question is about the meaning of French words - the meaning of English words is irrelevent. It is abundantly apparent that <i>América Central</i> is not part of <i>Norteamérica</i> while <i>Central America</i> is part of <i>North America</i> - I'm not sure why this is so hard to understand. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:35, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Not really. Because <i>Central America</i> is very different from <i>central America</i> grammatically, they follow different grammatical rules as to meaning. Thus people who keep trying to use the way to interpret the first on the second get an error. Of course, the fact that they mistakenly end up with Costa Rica as <i>central America</i> when they should end up with Nebraska or such is a seperate point (though the two are being confused a lot) <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 15:34, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Uh, no <i>Central America</i> is the proper name <i>Central America</i>. <i>central America</i> is the proper name <i>America</i> modified by the adjective <i>central</i>. Capitalisation contains meaning. <i>Red Johnson</i> is a guy who's given name is <i>Red</i> and who's family name is <i>Johnson</i>. <i>red Johnson</i> is a guy who's name is <i>Johnson</i>, and who is somehow <i>red</i>.

<p>The lack of Central and Latin America was glaring, and extraordinary given this is about America, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 14:34, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually this page isn't "about" America, but about helping WP users find the right article. How am I flying to Chicago, that's American Airlines. What was Johnny Cash's last record label, that's American Recordings. For the most part, however, people probably use this page to get either to the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> article or the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">Americas</a> article. Since editors are unlikely to come here looking for the Central America or Latin America articles, they aren't listed. North and South America are given as an added explanation for "the Americas". -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 14:11, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone has reverted my edit under the banner of vandalism which it was not. "America" commonly refers to either the US or the entire Western Hemisphere of which the US is a part. North, Central, South, and Latin America are also commonly used terms, but they are rarely referred to as "America." Therefore, I have put the two most common used concepts associated with the word on top. I put the US in bold, because in the everyday language "I'm from America" means that I am from the US, not "I am from the Western Hemisphere" - that statement is almost unheard of.</p>
<p>Once again, this is not vandalism, it is motivated by valid reason and its purpose is to ease the navigation on Wikipedia pages. If you disagree, please give your opinions before editing.

<dd>The <b>bolding</b> for emphasis like that makes the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html" title="WP:MOS">Manual of Style</a> unhappy. Bolding is used in the intro to highlight the name of the subject, it's not appropriate for a disambig page. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:16, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Welcome to editing this page, LonghornJohnny. I hope you stay and help out. We need as much of it as we can get as this page is heavily vandalized. Most of this vandalism takes the form of replacing the page's content with things such as "America is poopy" or "America is full of fat people". At times the page is also disrupted by edit wars over the order of the first two entries. This is a kind of vandalism as well. The order of the first two elements is not based on an oversight. It has been stable in this order for some time. I like to think of the order as broader, narrower, but other long-term editors may have their own reasons why it is so stable. I would like to mention bolding. Editors on WP use bolding for different reasons and often disagree about what is overuse of bolding. I don't think the entry for the United States needs anymore emphasis than it already gets. -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 14:26, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It looks fine to me and the vandalsim call was clearly a bad one, see <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> which I think applies here. I also agree that latinos do not generally think of themselves as "American", nor of course is the word America included in the name of any country other than the US, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 19:57, 18 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You might be confusing Latinos with Latin Americans... and of course, nor is there another continent with the full name of "America". <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeepstratagem_27fb.html" title="User:Deepstratagem">Deepstratagem</a> 15:46, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That's a fairly easy claim to make, given that there is <b>no</b> continent with the name <i>America</i> at all... <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 15:49, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I use Latino and Latin American as synonymous terms. It may be they mean something different in the US, <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 15:53, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Readers in the United States are likely to assume that <i>Latino</i> or <i>Black</i> without another country qualifier mean Latinos or Blacks in the United States as that is how they are used in the United States -<a href="../../../a/c/j/User%7EAcjelen_acd8.html" title="User:Acjelen">Acjelen</a> 16:49, 19 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That's incorrect. The terms are only used like that in the US in the <i>context</i> of the US; non-US Latinos or blacks are still called Latinos or blacks. If anyone assumed SqeakBox was talking about Latinos in the US based on the lack of a qualifier, they'd be assuming incorrectly. But saying "latino" in this case is confusing (there are plenty of Hispanics in the US, and they consider themselves US-Americans); I think what Squeak meant to suggest is that folks in Latin America don't consider themselves (pan-)Americans. I don't think this matters- the word "America" has multiple uses, and that's that. Though I think it's silly that the primary use isn't on top, it's not worth fighting over.--<a href="../../../c/u/c/User%7ECuchullain_f14f.html" title="User:Cuchullain">Cúchullain</a> <a href="../../../c/u/c/User_talk%7ECuchullain_0f10.html" title="User talk:Cuchullain"><sup>t</sup></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cuchullain_2c21.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cuchullain"><small>c</small></a> 04:16, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not so sure it's the primary use. You had almost convinced me. See recent discussion in <b>use of the word American</b>. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeepstratagem_27fb.html" title="User:Deepstratagem">Deepstratagem</a> 04:20, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
