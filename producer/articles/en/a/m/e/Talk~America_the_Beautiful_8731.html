<p>&gt;There was a movement during the John F. Kennedy administration to legally make "America the Beautiful" legal status &gt;as a national anthem</p>
<p>How could this be when God is mentioned so many times in the lyrics? It would never pass legal muster. Is this entry verified?</p>

<li>I can't verify this piece of history myself, but I doubt that practically the First Amendment would be a major issue. There is already "<a href="../../../i/n/_/In_God_We_Trust_52d9.html" title="In God We Trust">In God We Trust</a>" on the coinage, which actually derives from one of the later usually-unsung verses of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Star-Spangled_Banner_2d02.html" title="The Star-Spangled Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 21:34, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Methinks the questioner here betrays their bias/lack of knowledge. There is a move afoot from some quarters these days to eliminate the word "God" from every aspect of American life, and our gentle questioner appears to display that line of thought. It would be good to research how much the Christian faith (and thus the Christian God and Jesus Christ) has shaped Americans in decades and centuries past. The world as it now appears to be has not always been. Believe it or not, the predominant line of thinking before folks like our gentle questioner was born (or shortly before, depending on our questioner's exact age) was much more in line with Christian influences than one may realize.</dd>

<dd>As far as Kennedy goes, I remember that part on a personal level foggily. I remember this same sentiment more during the later 1960s when LBJ was in office and youth rebelled against the Vietnam war. I've personally lived through this kind of sentiment (but no Internet citation to go with it for now).

<dd>The article's reference to the JFK administration sits there with a big question mark, as far as I'm concerned. Whoever wrote it did not get into specifics, and I'm skeptical there was any "special" move during those years vs. any other time. But I don't know for sure. More research could be needed. As to the religious question... whether we Americans are any less spiritual nowadays, with our constant emphasis on acquisition of money and "toys", and meddling in the affairs of other countries that turn to attack us when we cast pearls before them, than we were in the good old days when our citizens were slaughtering Indians, beating slaves, subjugating women, and fomenting expansionist wars, is a matter of some debate. Regardless, we would have done well to adhere to the old saying: "In God we trust... all others pay cash!" <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 15:41, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, Wahkeenah. . . you make me laugh when you say that old saying! (tee hee) Seriously, the JFK reference has been sitting there for months. I don't think it was ever sourced. If you would like, I suppose maybe the thing to do is delete it and replace it with the source I dug up this morning re: "Every so often a movement is started. . .". If it can ever be sourced, we can always reinsert it again (with source, of course).</dd>

<dd>You do raise a good point on the spiritual nature of Americans of the past vs. those of today. In doing a bit of digging on this topic, I found a statement which said Miss Bates recognized through the words of her poem that America (the United States) was "a work in progress." I quite agree. To quote Wahkeenah: <i>A constant emphasis on money and "toys", and meddling in the affairs of other countries that turn to attack us when we cast pearls before them. . . slaughtering Indians, beating slaves, subjugating women, and formenting expansionist wars</i> are at the very least matters of some certain debate, and I'd go as far to say that many of these characteristics mentioned are what the Christian Bible would call falling short of God's perfect nature; that is to say, <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin.html" title="Sin">sinful</a>. But the nation of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a> (as related in the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Testament_79e6.html" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>) was like us in that same way. . . always falling short, yet God chose to use them. I think this same realization - falling short of (the Christian God's) holiness and purity, yet receiving unmerited favor - <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irresistible_grace.html" title="Irresistible grace">grace</a> - from this same God. . .with one result being that God might deign to use them was central to Miss Bates' thought processes when she was writing her famous poem in that Antlers Hotel room now long gone. I don't think she was saying Americans were any more special than citizens from other countries, except in this one respect: a sizable number of Americans (in general) have had a history of continually (through thick and thin) listening to, trusting in and obeying the Christian God. Not all citizens by any means, but enough to have made - and hopefully will continue to make - a difference for the good. Something worth pondering at some length. --<a href="../../../a/v/n/User%7EAvnative_3f2e.html" title="User:Avnative">avnative</a> 00:10, September 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I consider myself liberal, but true liberals and true conservatives have told me I'm really not all that liberal, so maybe libertarian is closer to it. I think this country has had, from Day 1, the notion that we are "God's chosen people", and this attitude gets us into lots of trouble. Washington advised future Americans to "avoid foreign entanglements", and pretty much every President since then has ignored his advice, often with painful results. Yet, would we be the mighty nation we are, had we remained isolationist? But how far do we go with this? I find myself agreeing with Pat Buchanan (!) more and more... that we are spreading ourselves too thin around the world. I recall after that horrible day of 9/11/01, and how irritated I was at characters like Falwell or Robertson or whoever that used that event to push their political agenda, saying we were being punished by God for being "too liberal". No, you fascist morons, we were being "punished" <i>for meddling in other countries' affairs</i> and for our lackadaisical attitude toward security ("it costs too much"), no more, no less. Ya know, the "Star-Spangled Banner" sprang from a war that we helped to foment, and the British burning of D.C. and their attempt to take Baltimore were in <i>retalation</i> for us having burned Toronto, but historical apologists tend to downplay that part. That slanted view of history is why I regard the carping by right-wingers on this subject as essentially marketing hype. It's nothing new, we were saying 100 or more years ago that it was our "manifest destiny" to exert our will around the world. The only thing different now than then is that we have more voices willing to openly question that policy. Those people are invariably charged with being "unpatriotic" and "Godless liberals" or some such. Ironically, it was liberals who got us into Vietnam. So, as I get older, I tend to distrust <i>all</i> politicians, but especially the ones who try to bundle religion in with flag to push their "Christian Taliban" agenda. In 2004, I looked at the candidates and said, "Is this really the best we can do? A Texas moron vs. a Massachusetts intellectual elitist?" I keep going back to the Paul Simon song, "American Tune", written in the Vietnam era, and which was running through my head in the days following 9/11/01: "It's all right, it's all right, you can't be forever blessed; still, tomorrow's gonna be another working day, and I'm trying to get some rest; that's all, I'm trying to get some rest". Good night, and good luck. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 01:55, 9 September 2005 (UTC) P.S. Whatever I might say about my country, if some "furrener" starts badmouthing the U.S.A. and hyping his own country, I'm inclined to verbally slap them upside the head. I guess that makes me an "America firster"... like my parents and grandparents before me.&#160;:)</dd>

<p>I can accept "hymn" since it mentions "God" several times, but I see nothing specifically Christian in it. Can anyone offer evidence that Bates thought of it as Christian?<br />

<dd>Let's consider this evidence: She was, according to author Lynn Sherr, the daughter of a Congregationalist (Christian Protestant denomination) minister. Some further digging around I've done shows she was also the daughter of a mother who attended (Christian) seminary studies. Her famous poem was first published in 1895 in a Congregationalist publication. According to Amazon.com reviewer Jon Hunt (of Lynn Sherr's book on America the Beautiful, <i>America the Beautiful: The Stirring True Story Behind Our Nation's Favorite Song</i>) (Hardcover) "And if it hadn't been for a conscientious (Christian) clergyman from Rochester New York, the words and music might never have been paired."

<dd>What Miss Bates thought of the poem is not the critical issue here. What matters more is how it was received by the public of her day. According to another author with a decidedly different perspective than Lynn Sherr, William J. Federer, Bates' composition almost became the US National Anthem in 1920. Source: Federer, William J. <i>America's God and Country Encylopedia of Quotations.</i> Coppell, TX: FAME Publishing, 1994 (also available through an easy Google search - the page is on a secure server.) Why was it well recieved by the public? Why was it continually included in Christian hymnals (over many decades, I might add)? Why was it sung in Christian worship services - and is sung in such services even today?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A careful look at the lyrics and a Christian <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> might, I humbly submit, yield some answers.</dd>
<dd>(Scripture citations below are from the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_International_Version_2847.html" title="New International Version">New International Version</a> of the Bible)</dd>

<ul>
<li>"God Shed His Grace on Thee:" Romans 5:15 says "But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!" Obviously the writer here, the apostle Paul, wasn't thinking of America specifically. Yet the grace of God remains for even lowly citizens of the United States (as well as any other country), according to the passage just cited. The "shed" refers to the death of Jesus Christ for sinful humanity (the many) so that by accepting Jesus' sacrifice one may be reconciled to God - standard evangelical Christian theology.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"And Crowned Thy Good with Brotherhood:" Psalms 133:1 says "How good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in unity!" Pretty self-explanatory.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"O Beautiful for Pilgrims Feet:" Psalms 84:5 says "Blessed are those whose strength is in you, who have set their hearts on pilgrimage." This Psalm begins with "how lovely is your dwelling place, O LORD Almighty! My soul yearns, even faints for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God." Evangelical Christian theology would state this Psalm shows how temporal (temporary) a Christian's life on earth is. A pilgrim, in the Christian sense, is one who is not set on the things of this earth, but is looking for what is eternal, what is of God and will last forever. A thoughtful read on the original folks we call today the Pilgrims who came to Massachussetts Bay in 1620 will show they shared this same outlook - one of valuing their walk with the living God more than pleasing a temporal King (with whom they had sharp differences with, of course).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"God Mend Thy Every Flaw:" Isaiah 1:18 says "'Come now, let us reason together,' says the LORD. 'Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.'" I think you may see the similarities here fairly clearly.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Confirm Thy Soul in Self-Control/Thy Liberty in Law!:" Galatians 5:22-24 says "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law. Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires." Galatians is a well known book of the New Testament dealing with Christian liberty - read it sometime and see. In the passage just cited Paul makes the case that with true liberty in Christ - being in tune with God's Holy Spirit - one has proper self-control and may thus have freedom - liberty - to "love God and do what you please" to quote another Christian theologian. This is the fairly obvious spirit of this part of the poem, IMHO.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Who More Than Self Their Country Loved, And Mercy More Than Life!:" John 15:13 says "Greater love has no one more than this, that he (Jesus) lay down his life for his friends." A famous quote used by <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_W._Smith_dd4b.html" title="Michael W. Smith">Michael W. Smith</a> after the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbine_High_School_Massacre_1fb4.html" title="Columbine High School Massacre">Columbine High School Massacre</a>, among other recent times in US history. I think the meaning is rather clear - sacrificing one's life for another.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"May God Thy Gold Refine/Till All Success Be Nobleness/And Every Gain Divine!:" 1 Peter 1:7 says "These (trials) have come so that your faith - of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire - may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed." Lofty words like Miss Bates' own. Fairly clear from an evangelical Christian theological standpoint this part of the poem is speaking of being more like God Himself.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>"Thine Alabaster Cities Gleam Undimmed by Human Tears!:" alabaster according to my Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary means white and translucent, as in gypsum. The Book of Revelation speaks of the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, in Revelation 21:1-3: "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, 'Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.'" Perhaps Bates' "cities" refer to temporal United States cities, which with devotion to God might reflect the New Jerusalem Revelation speaks of - just my considered humble thought. As far as the "undimmed by human tears," Revelation 21:4 says "He (God) will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away." Pretty self explanatory, I think.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>Could the lyrics found in Miss Bates' poem possibly be related to her Christian parental influence and Christian church association and -ahem- possible Bible reading at the time of her writing? The evidence submitted here seems to indicate as much. Looking at the above evidence, it becomes (IMHO) easier to understand how such a poem set to music became included in Christian hymnals, and became a beloved hymn people love to sing in worship services even today - the themes of the lyrics are indeed quite in tune with what Scripture from the Bible teaches.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While I quite understand the reticence of folks such as our gentle editor <a href="../../../t/u/a/User%7ETualha_bd83.html" title="User:Tualha">Tualha</a> might have about what they regard as merely a United States patriotic song being (from their viewpoint) appropriated as a Christian hymn and thus a POV edit, I would submit the evidence would point out the contrary: America the Beautiful has been and remains a hymn of devotion to God and Country for US citizens of the Christian persuasion. If I were at Colorado College like I was in my undergraduate days I would be searching for even more evidence from <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado_College_3120.html" title="Colorado College">Colorado College</a>'s Tutt Library (a fascinating place) for even more sources relating to this issue. But I don't want to be seen as "piling it on." Notice how I worded the edit: I didn't say America the Beautiful was a Christian hymn: I merely stated it was found in Christian hymnals and sung in Christian churches in worship to God. I hope no one refutes <i>these statements.</i> Thanks for your kind consideration.

<dd>Excellent analysis. It's important for skeptics to realize that in Kate Bates' day, Christianity was the predominant religion in American (as it is now, although perhaps a lower percentage than then) and any reference to "God" was likely just "understood" to be the <i>Christian</i> God, or Judeo-Christian God, if you will. It's also interesting to realize that while she was <i>inspired</i> by various sights she encountered on her trip, such as the "white city" at the 1893 Exposition, the wording of the poem goes to a much more universal theme... and reveals the depth of her knowledge on matters religious, political and artistic. She didn't get to be a professor at Wellesley by accident. It would also be <i>very</i> interesting for someone to find out why it did <i>not</i> become the national anthem in 1920. That was just after WWI, and people were kind of sick of war, so it would have been the right time for such a popular choice. However, I would guess that the <i>Star-Spangled Banner</i> eventually won out because of its aggressive nature. In choosing between these songs as "our" song, the voting public ultimately chose the hawk over the dove. <a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahkeenah_f642.html" title="User:Wahkeenah">Wahkeenah</a> 18:14, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Today I added this section, and while the name of Rush Limbaugh may be controversial to some, the intent of this addition is illustrate a popular usage of a recognizable portion of this hymn. While I'm certain that there are those who may be put off by the presence of his name, the daily use of the words "across the fruited plain" is a factual thing. With that, I invite others to contribute other usages of phrases, such as a recognizable place where one might hear or see words like "God shed His grace on thee" or some other segment, to this section. I opted to create this as a new section because it is neither idiomatic, nor satirical, the foci of the sections immediately prior to and subsequent to this section where I placed it. <a href="../../../f/w/g/User%7EFwgoebel_07f8.html" title="User:Fwgoebel">Fwgoebel</a> 23:48, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The takeoff section includes the parodies; of note is the bastardization of the lyrics by George Carlin, an atheist. Note that this article is categorized under WikiProject Christianity, and Limbaugh is a Christian, not making foul use of the lyrics. I would still defend Carlin's tenor, given that it does illustrate through satire some environmental concerns.
