<p>Is getting a bit out of hand. Here's my problem. I don't want the season 5 article.&#160;:) That thing is messy and honestly, has way way too many early auditioners/Hollywood people listed. And I just want to avoid that. What makes someone notable who is a gas attendant and sings? I mean. I can see the Castro look-a-like. He was unusual looking. But just someone who sings? Not sure how that's notable. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">Woohoo!</a></sup> 09:50, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe we need to make a separate list of all the people who auditioned so that people won't add them all here. I also think that would work for the Season 5 article. <b><a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETennis_Dynamite_41b4.html" title="User:Tennis Dynamite"><font color="red">T</font><font color="green">ennis</font></a> <a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETennis_Dynamite_160a.html" title="User talk:Tennis Dynamite"><font color="green">Dy</font><font color="red">N</font><font color="green">ami</font><font color="red">T</font><font color="green">e</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETennis_Dynamite_My_Autograph_Book_4daf.html" title="User:Tennis Dynamite/My Autograph Book">sign here</a>)</sup> 22:04, 3 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The problem with that is that would be almost impossible to maintain without guidelines. I mean, if we included everyone who auditioned, it'd take one hell of a big page.&#160;:) About 100,000 people auditioned. If you just do those that were shown on tv, it could be done. But does just being on tv make them notable enough to be in a list? --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">Woohoo!</a></sup> 17:59, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Tennis Dynamite, I'm not sure why you continue to remove Chris Sligh from the notable passed contestants list. He is in the local band "Half Past Forever," has won songwriting competitions in the past, and has been noted in prominent places like <a href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20010337,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20010337,00.html" rel="nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a> as a "reasonable top 12 bet." He was given much airtime in the Birmingham episode. His singing and personality are just as notable as a "Fidel Castro look-alike" or "best friends forever," etc. Wikiedit2006sc 04:34, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In that case he can go back into the article. Before, all that his paragraph said was stuff like Paula saying, "I like you very much," and him wanting, "to make David Hasselhoff cry." These things are not notable at all. As long as you include the songwriting competitions and the link I don't see why he couldn't stay. <b><a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETennis_Dynamite_41b4.html" title="User:Tennis Dynamite"><font color="red">T</font><font color="green">ennis</font></a> <a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETennis_Dynamite_160a.html" title="User talk:Tennis Dynamite"><font color="green">Dy</font><font color="red">N</font><font color="green">ami</font><font color="red">T</font><font color="green">e</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETennis_Dynamite_My_Autograph_Book_4daf.html" title="User:Tennis Dynamite/My Autograph Book">sign here</a>)</sup> 15:08, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Exactly. Not only do they have to be notable but you have to say why they are notable. It's just like our <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability guidelines</a>. Exact same thing. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">Woohoo!</a></sup> 17:40, 10 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay, I've added the citation to Chris Sligh's information. One thing I'm curious about is if they have to be notable, why are Amanda Coluccio and Antonella Barba, Anna Kearns, Phil Stacey, Porcelana Patino, Rudy Cardenas, and Sean Michel in this article, for instance? Their respective sections don't seem particularly notable: being best friends, being tall, having your baby born the day of your audition, training physically for the audition, being from Venezuela and disliked by Simon, and being a Fidel Castro look-alike. Being a Wikipedia novice, I'll defer to you and not delete them for now, but I'm just curious how either of you would defend their notability. That is why I didn't see any more reason to remove Chris Sligh than these and perhaps others (before adding the Chris Sligh citation).Wikiedit2006sc 22:23, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm going to keep reverting lists of the top 24 finalists until it's either reported by a major news source or the shows themselves air.

<p>In response to above: You sent me a message about that. I only changed the orders so the colors would alternate evenly: blue, pink, blue, pink, blue, pink. I didn't change the numbers (13-16, 17-20, etc.). Sure you meant to send that message to me? InternetFreakGal 04:44, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For the week of 2/22, I changed the order of elimination to (from bottom) "Paul Kim; Amy Krebs; Nicole Tranquillo; Rudy Cardenas" as that was the order in which they were sent home on the episode. I just thought it would make more sense to order it that way on the chart. I did the same thing for the week of 3/8, as it was the same case. I don't believe I ever changed the actual rankings though. Also, this was all before I created my account. MarkMc1990 20:13, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I'm removing the current list too. The list that was just put it up was just a list of people going to Hollywood. The problem with that is that the show is notorious for not showing at least 4 or 5 of the people who make it to the semi-finals and well more than half of the people who make it to Hollywood (example - 10 people were listed for New York. 35 from New York made it to Hollywood). So we can't really know yet who is and isn't notable at this point. And these people listed aren't all notable. It's not even all of the people going to Hollywood. I agree with Tennis.

<p>I originally removed the Bottom 3 chart. But. I think it's a good idea. Not as a permanent addition but as a way of keeping track who was in the bottom 3.

<dd>Actually, season 5 shouldn't even have a bottom 3 chart. I think it's only useful during the season. After the season, it's completely redundant. In fact, it might be better to create some sort of chart that tracks number of times someone is in the bottom 3. Or maybe not. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">Woohoo!</a></sup> 11:43, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The way the elimination chart was set up is wrong. Normally, the names of the semi-finalists/finalists are listed first (usually in alphabetical order), then the placement order is filled in. When somebody is eliminated, the person's name goes to the bottom of the list. I am going to set up this season's chart in that way. The bottom 3 chart would thus be redundant.

<p>Why was the order of competing contestants in the elimination chart changed again? Ordering or grouping by top 3, middle 3, et cetera, shows a bias of popularity, because only viewer votes determine positioning. At first glance it may not look biased, but it is. For certain shows like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Amazing_Race_11_d1fd.html" title="The Amazing Race 11">The Amazing Race 11</a>, ordering by placement is acceptable because that program was pre-taped and viewers cannot determine final future outcomes. In this program, this is an ongoing competition and any ordering that is not strictly based on names is either haphazard or creates a bias toward a certain outcome. On the next show, what if the producers decide not to say who is in the top 2, middle 3, whatever? Then what would happen with the chart? <a href="../../../t/i/n/User%7ETinlinkin_3891.html" title="User:Tinlinkin">Tinlinkin</a> 17:07, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I still think the order should remain alphabetical. It doesn't really make sense to order them by placement going only by one week's results, especially since the voting order can change drastically from week to week (none of the eliminated contestants were ever in the bottom three before, for example). Besides, couldn't ordering them by bias be considered original research (especially because we don't know the order of the top 3 and middle 3, and in some cases, the bottom 3)? MarkMc1990 17:37, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed. I have no idea who changed it to order by placement, (but I do recall some note somewhere that said that they ordered it by placement, then alphabetically) and alphabetical order by last name makes a lot more sense.

<dd>I personally don't care, but I think the show wanted us to observe the supposed "top" and "middle" groups as fact. I think that info is encyclopedic enough. I would leave it in the chart, and then maybe put something about the April 4th results in the controversy section. Another idea would be to put a superscript (<sup>1</sup>) next to "4/4" and then explain it at the bottom of the chart (see the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Idol_%28season_4%29_dedc.html" title="American Idol (season 4)">American Idol (season 4)</a> chart for Mario Vasquez's withdrawl to see what I'm talking about).

<dd>I wasn't going to originally put the Top/Middle information because he never said the women were the top 3, but when he got to the guys, he said something to the tune of "So, if these are not your top 3..." which I would think implies that they are the middle three. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMissMJ_39df.html" title="User:MissMJ">MissMJ</a> 01:09, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yep it does. But I say. Let's not include it all. For one thing, the note that's in there is a bit too long for a note.

As for putting it as a controversy, I have yet to see it reported in the media, in which case you are probably not going to find a source on it.

<dd>I think it's best just not to include it at all as well because it's not clear WHAT Seacrest meant by what he said. And I don't think it's essential to include middle/top anyway. Yes it's included in Season 5's chart but in that case, there were just 6 left and Seacrest made it clear that this was the top 2. I think that the 3 girls were the top 3, but Seacrest never actually said that. So let's just be safe on it and not include it. Just stick with bottom 3 like we always have. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">Woohoo!</a></sup> 02:07, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't care what you do with the article ... but Seacrest clearly stated that the contestants were separated into top, middle, and bottom groups, and then clearly told the three guys on the left they were not the top group, which meant the three women on the right were. There's nothing controversial, conspiratorial, or message boardy about it. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 02:12, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think you misunderstood me. Personally I agree. It's not controversial. And the message boardy thing is people thinking that this is some sort of conspiracy. And yes. The women were the top 3. Guys the middle and the bottom 3 were the bottom 3. But on the other hand, since people keep putting the information back in and obviously some believe that Seacrest wasn't clear enough, I think it might be best to just not include any of it. This article is incredibly hard to patrol anyway. Just not sure we need more to try to stop. I seem to spend way too much time a day removing unsourced stuff from this article. We don't need one more thing people don't agree on. --<a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty"><i>Woohookitty</i></a><sup><a href="../../../w/o/o/User_talk%7EWoohookitty_9ae9.html" title="User talk:Woohookitty">Woohoo!</a></sup> 02:18, 9 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
