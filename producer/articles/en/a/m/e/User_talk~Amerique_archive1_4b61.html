<p>Hi, I'm sure I'm speaking on behalf of most people when I say that I appreciate your work on the UCR article. However, it's pretty evident to me that UCRGrad has no real intention of bringing the article up to featured status. Rather, he's just attempting to find as many negative facts as possible about the school and throw them in there. I'm suggesting that maybe you don't waste your effort in a lost cause, as he's always going to be there to counter whatever positive changes you make to it. Perhaps just let him have the article for the time being, and start making real advances to it once he grows tired of playing Wikipedia editor? Just my thoughts. <a href="../../../w/h/s/User%7EWHS_187f.html" title="User:WHS">WHS</a> 21:27, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi. Sorry, I've been a little busy, but I'll add a statement to the page as soon as I have some free time on my hands. Thanks again for your work. <a href="../../../w/h/s/User%7EWHS_187f.html" title="User:WHS">WHS</a> 19:37, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for taking leadership in filing the RfA about UCRGrad. After my own experiences with him, I watched your attempts at negotiation and compromise over the last month or so and it was like watching a slow motion car wreck. It was fascinating in a macabre sort of way but the outcome was ineveitable.</p>
<p>Please let me know if there is anything I can do to further support or strengthen our claims in the RfA. "Working with" UCRGrad and InsertBellTower was the most frustrating experience I've had on Wikipedia and I'd surely love for something constructive to be done so we can improve the UCR article. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 21:03, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for your willingness to bite the bullet and file the long overdue UCRGrad RFAr.

<p>It's funny you ask me to do that because I was about ready to do it on my own. It was a little disappointing to see that he had rejected it, but I'll go ahead and try to gather up what I can anyway. Perhaps more information from "Unwillingness to reach agreement" section of your UCRGarb page?

<p><b>Discuss with third parties</b></p>
<ul>
<li>"I've been asked to come back and clarify my third opinion. As DtEW says, the burden of proof lies with the editor that wants the edits to stand. UCRGrad has provided sources for some of their assertations, but not for others - for instance, the nickname, 'University of California, Rejects', undoubtedly exists, but those sources do not show that it is because of the admission critera - this is speculation or original research at best. On a related note, be careful that sources show what you are claiming that they do - the MDapplicants.com one doesn't say anything about the relative merits of the university; you need to do a certain amount of research to figure that out, so it's unacceptable (or at least, that page of it is). --Scott Wilson 13:17, 29 March 2006 (UTC)" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:University_of_California%2C_Riverside/Archive_1#Intellectual_dishonesty_and_creative_reinterpretation_of_the_Third_Opinion.3F.21" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:University_of_California%2C_Riverside/Archive_1#Intellectual_dishonesty_and_creative_reinterpretation_of_the_Third_Opinion.3F.21" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></li>
<li>"Insert-Belltower, please do not revert to the version with the disputed assertions. The burden of proof is on the editor who wishes the edits to stand, and more evidence is still needed. --Scott Wilson 14:07, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>^^^This has been taken out of context. Scott later apologizes and the course of the discussion changes. The situation is resolved.<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsert-Belltower_b83a.html" title="User:Insert-Belltower">Insert-Belltower</a> 13:35, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, he and I came to a mutual reconciliation on this matter of the reverts and the sockpuppet comment that he made. I would ask you to please go back and look at the entire conversation for full details and I you will find that he and I are completely civil and respectful to each other. This isolated statement the requires a context for full understanding of its meaning. One could take anybody's words and spin them with the own interpretation. <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsert-Belltower_b83a.html" title="User:Insert-Belltower">Insert-Belltower</a> 19:46, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The same goes for you, too UCRGrad - reverting it umpteen different times won't make them any more acceptable to WP:V.

<p>It seems to me that, despite our best efforts, the good guys have lost and RFARB has failed. It seems to me that not going through prior dispute resolution steps may have been the primary factor in costing us this case, apart from the beligerent actions of those on our side. Later today I will copy the RFARB text and save it in a sub-page for future users to consider in any further actions against UCRG or IB.</p>
<p>As for the article, it seems to me that I can approach this in either 1 of 2 ways. Cease work on it entirely or else continue working on it according to my original intention of developing it to feature status, not only for that purpose, but in order to force contact between UCRG/IB and other Admins. It seems to me that a likely outcome of that would be more material for another RFARB or other steps in dispute resolution, and though I myself am not particularly interested in further contact with these two characters, I don't believe the UCR article as a whole is far from where it has to be to qualify for such a nomination, despite the biased elements. In any case, the article itself is setting new standards for objectivity.</p>
<p>But there are other articles I'd like to work on also. So I will think about this over the next few days.

<dd>Per the Arbitration policy, I've requested <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFred_Bauder_722b.html" title="User talk:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimonP_8a6d.html" title="User talk:SimonP">SimonP</a>, the two arbitrators who voted "Reject" and did not provide a rationale, to provide a rationale. It's part of the process, it may be instructive or useful, and it's a perfectly reasonable request.</dd>
<dd>As stated a few months ago on the UCR Talk page, I don't care to work on that article with UCRGrad and InsertBelltower maintaining de facto ownership of it and veto power over any changes. It's simply not worth the effort as it's too frustrating and a waste of time and energy. I have no investement in UCR, either the article or the institution, so I don't care to waste my time and energy on the article when there are so many other articles with cooperative and collegial editors who know how to work with others and play nicely.</dd>

<p>So I've been following various TALK pages (including this and others) and I just want to say that I admire the level of effort and enthusiasm you guys have expended in trying to silence my contributions. Perhaps if you all had taken that same amount of energy and directed it towards actually improving the article (instead of harrassing one of the editors), the text would be that much better right now.</p>
<p>But what confuses me is in light of FOUR independent arbitrators reviewing my contributions as well as the article, and NONE of them agreeing with your accusations, you people STILL don't let it go.</p>
<p>This leads me to believe that there is a discrepancy between PERCEPTION and REALITY. For instance:</p>
<p><br />
Perception: The article is biased.</p>
<p>Reality: MANY people have this perception at first glance and several have tried to explain why they believe so. NOBODY has been able to rationally provide a good argument as to why. When logic fails (or does not pass simple scrutiny), it usually is because perception (the "gut impression" that the article is biased) does not translate to reality (the article really is biased). The fact the article is NOT biased is further substantianted by the review of FOUR WP arbitrators, one of whom even said that I had a valid viewpoint, and another stated that this was a pretty good college article!</p>
<p><br />
Perception: UCRGrad is unreasonable and difficult to work with.</p>
<p>Reality: I have always made a strong effort to justify my edits and respond to any and all objections people have raised. On the other hand, not everyone has provided valid justications or ones that survive simple scrutiny. In fact, this has happened quite often. Just because individuals "insist" they are correct or wish/hope/pray that this were the case (and convince themselves of such) it doesn't mean things will pan out in REALITY. If people cannot provide valid reasons or logical justification for their objections, how should an editor, like myself, respond?? I certainly should not "give in" just because an individual strenuously objects, especially if his reasoning for doing so is flawed. Some people have perceived this as being "stubborn" or "difficult to worth with." The reality is, I am a perfectly reasonable person, and people have become frustrated when I challenge their arguments and explain why their objections are not valid.</p>
<p><br />
Perception: UCRGrad is trying to make UCR look bad.</p>
<p>Reality: Absolutely untrue. As I have repeatedly stated, I have considerable knowledge of the campus, and I'm in a position to convey comprehensive and useful informationn about the university. If UCR does not accel in certain areas, it is not because of me - I merely present the facts, and I believe that I do so objectively.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I'm glad UCRGrad has become aware of a distinction between perception and reality. I encourage him to further explore this distinction with regards to his own point of view, however "simple" the method or the substance might be. Although UCR might not have deserved UCRGrad, UCRGrad surely seems to have deserved Riverside. He earned his right to be there, in "reality" and on Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 19:44, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You can choose to ignore everything I wrote and dunk your head into the sand like the proverbial ostrich - but the preponderance of evidence against you (and the absence of evidence in your support) speaks mouthfulls. Your fancy rhetoric and subtle ad hominems (all of which fail to directly address anything I've written) only further compromise the validity of your viewpoint. Again, there's perception, and there's reality. Yours are not in agreement. <a href="../../../u/c/r/User%7EUCRGrad_9144.html" title="User:UCRGrad">UCRGrad</a> 03:14, 27 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Evidence against me? I'm not sure what you are referring to. Apart from calling you a clown that one time, over a patently insignificant issue, (which, by the way, I sincerely apologise for) I'm not aware of much "evidence" against me. However, the RFARB failed not for any lack of evidence against you, but for a failure to follow prior dispute resolution steps. Should I decide to edit the article again, I have no doubt these steps will have to be taken, but the question for me is whether I care enough about the article or your activities there to initiate them. The article seems to mean more to you than it does to me, maybe, after all, you deserve it.

<p>I put some work into the RFC against UCRGrad - check it out and let me know how it looks. I tried to explain the various examples of violations so the mediators wouldn't have to guess at our meaning. During that process, I removed a few which were erroneous (one was actually one of IB's sockpuppets, not UCRGrad's) and where I couldn't make any reasonable connection between what was alleged and the proffered evidence. Feel free to add more, correct what I've done, whatever.</p>
<p>Can someone provide a link to the IB RFC so I can take a look at that, too? --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 05:02, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hmmm, Maybe we should just take on UCRGrad for now. I have a feeling he is the main problem you all have.

<p>So far it looks good. I have made a few minor formating changes, I'm going to reword the second paragraph a little and redo the attempts to solve this issue.

Why not try to request Mediation again (Formal or Informal through the mediation Cabal up to you). In this case however it would only involve the two of you (WHS, UCRGrad et all would not be involved). That way you could discuss the issues you have with each other with out outside influence on either side with a Neutral Party over seeing it. It could help to keep this issue from going higher and might even start to help with the other issues. How do the two of you feel about this?

<p>Thanks for offering your opinion on the Highlander thing. Contrary to what you said though, I think you'd be just as objective as any of us in the article since afterall, it's not you that's unilaterally trying to push a POV on the article, but I guess that's neither here nor there.

<dd>Hey. I did some editing of the RfC last night to throw in a few more current (as in the past few weeks) violations, so I don't think that part of the process will be a problem. I think I'll hold off on it for a little bit longer before I decide that an RfArb would be absolutely necessary. And besides, the longer we hold off, the more evidence against him I suppose. --<small><a href="../../../w/h/s/User%7EWHS_187f.html" title="User:WHS"><font color="SlateGray">WHS</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/s/User_talk%7EWHS_9e99.html" title="User talk:WHS">Talk</a></small> 22:37, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Amerique. I noticed the exact same thing you did regarding how the Highlander seems to be taking a pro vs. negative stance on the article. I figured that when answering their questions, I could clarify that it's not a pro vs. negative thing, but rather a POV vs. NPOV debate. As far as the RfArb goes, I'll attempt to solicit more third opinions and leave the mediation option again. I'm still going to hold off on it for a bit though, since I've been bit by the jury duty bug. --<small><a href="../../../w/h/s/User%7EWHS_187f.html" title="User:WHS"><font color="SlateGray">WHS</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/s/User_talk%7EWHS_9e99.html" title="User talk:WHS">Talk</a></small> 02:08, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey. If UCRGrad and I-B once again reject the request for mediation, then I agree that we should move forward in DR. Regarding the publication of the story however, I don't think it'll have too large of an effect on the article, especially now that it's protected. I'm still sort of weary about going back to the ArbCom (and also of whether or not DR actually works here), so I want to make sure all the non-POV editors approve before it's done. --<small><a href="../../../w/h/s/User%7EWHS_187f.html" title="User:WHS"><font color="SlateGray">WHS</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/s/User_talk%7EWHS_9e99.html" title="User talk:WHS">Talk</a></small> 00:14, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't know whether you can do this, but I seem to be the anti-UCRGrad editor making the most edits. It would be easier for me to simply revert back to them (after they are reverted) if other anti-UCRGrad/anti-Insert-Belltower editors edited my work (latest starkt entry in the history section) instead of the article itself.

<p>I think as far as data collection goes, we're pretty well off. People have been adding policy violations to UCRGrad's RfC as he has committed them, so the list is fairly well updated. Personally, I felt the last one failed due in part to a lack of following other items on WP:DR, but also because the admins weren't bothered enough to thoroughly check through the history of the dispute (although you can't really blame them since I'm sure they have to deal with tons of these a day). Regardless, I think filing another one is more than justified now, and I'll work to prepare a statement as well. We should probably post an announcement or something of the sort on the UCR talk page so other editors are aware that one is in process. Honestly, I pretty much agree with Starkt's assessment of the article. I'm tired of beating around the bush. It's clear that UCRGrad has no intention to genuinely make an effort to improve both his behavior and the article, and it's time to do something about it. And as for Insert-Belltower, he really hasn't done anything aside from support UCRGrad, so "silencing" (haha) (Actually, I shouldn't joke about that. He'll undoubtedly cite it as evidence of a conspiracy against him) him will be like cutting the problem off at the head. --<small><a href="../../../w/h/s/User%7EWHS_187f.html" title="User:WHS"><font color="SlateGray">WHS</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/s/User_talk%7EWHS_9e99.html" title="User talk:WHS">Talk</a></small> 00:29, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Before filing another RFAr, I think we should try an article RFC, the only step in <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> we haven't tried, save for mediation. UCRG hasn't been around for a couple of days now, so I hold out some dim hope he could come around and agree to mediation after all. After all, multiple editors have been trying to convince him to accept it. It's best if we can show we've exhausted every possible option. <a href="../../../s/z/y/User%7ESzyslak_7117.html" title="User:Szyslak"><font color="green">szyslak</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/z/y/User_talk%7ESzyslak_c549.html" title="User talk:Szyslak">t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Szyslak_7616.html" title="Special:Contributions/Szyslak">c</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a>)</small> 09:18, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>We may not necessarily need an "evidence" section, as we used on the first attempted RFAr. What really matters is the evidence presented in the open case. However, we should provide some diffs for evidence, preferably in the introduction and our statements, like "UCRG/I-B engages in personal attacks [diff] and incivility [diff].

<p>Well personally, I want to stop screwing around and get this dispute settled since this has already been dragged out far too long, but how do you feel about the article RfC Szyslak has proposed? I kinda think that it's an unnecessary formality because it's pretty much certain that we'll just end back up where we are now, but Szyslak does make a good point when he says that it'll show we've exhausted every possible option. --<small><a href="../../../w/h/s/User%7EWHS_187f.html" title="User:WHS"><font color="SlateGray">WHS</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/s/User_talk%7EWHS_9e99.html" title="User talk:WHS">Talk</a></small> 02:55, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't object to another article content RFC, however I don't think the issue of whether we do one or not has any bearing on the second RFARB, which will be entirely focused on user conduct violations and not article content disputes.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 04:53, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey, Amerique. I'll probably be able to get my statement up on your subpage prior to monday, depending on how busy I am IRL.

<p>Hi. I was wondering if you guys could intervene and instruct Starkt that his recent comments are inappropriate. On the TALK he stated that "reverting my edits will be met with a reversion in turn." I don't think this is a fair policy for obvious reasons, and I don't think that he will listen to me.</p>
<p>I look forward to further cooporation. <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsert-Belltower_b83a.html" title="User:Insert-Belltower">Insert-Belltower</a> 18:37, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, I've gotten the format of the next RFARB mostly ready to go with minimal further editing necessary. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_RFARB2.0_819e.html" title="User:Amerique/RFARB2.0">User:Amerique/RFARB2.0</a> I would like to open the question of whether we should file this week to further discussion on this page, as UCRGrad himself seems to have suddenly become absent. I for one am ready to go to the ARBCOM now, but would like UCRGrad to have the opportunity to defend himself. UCRGrad or Insert-Belltower can also comment here on this if they want to.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 02:19, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't think it would do any good to file an RfArb against an editor who is not present and has not present for about a week. If he shows up again and continues his activities then let's press ahead. But right now, without UCRGrad's presence in Wikipedia, the issue is moot. The article is finally moving in a positive direction and into compliance with Wikipedia policies and that's the important thing, right? --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 02:29, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>After reading criticisms of my attempts to remove (and keep out) POV material in the article by various editors (ElKevbo, GeorgeLouis, Szyslak and Danny Lilithborne), I've decided to no longer participate in any complaints against UCRGrad and Insert-Belltower. You can see my reasons in the UCR article discussion page ("Overall NPOV Status" and "Article Un-Protected"). starkt 05:30, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
