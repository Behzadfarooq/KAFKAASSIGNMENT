<p>We have a real problem with this wiki article.</p>
<p>The American Hunters and Shooters Association is run by a group of well-known anti-firearms rights advocates purporting themselves to be "gun owners". <b>Stating this is not a "neutrality" issue</b>. It is a matter of the facts, which have been elaborated upon time and time again in the previous wiki article with names, external sources, etc. While we all have opinions on the issue of gun rights, the most opposition I am seeing to the presentation of this factual information about the AHSA is coming from a "Liberal Arts" college student and an anon IP address that just so happens to be located in the beltway (where the AHSA is based).</p>
<p>If one were to start a group called "Americans Against Racial Discontent", headed by two Skinheads and a Ku Klux Klan member, would the wiki article for this group be nothing more than the groups "mission statement", without allowing the factual details regarding its true motives to be added? Of course not.</p>
<p><b>I am perfectly willing to find a middle ground here regarding the presentation of factual information about the AHSA'</b><i>, unfortunately, the "mission statement" of the AHSA by itself does&#160;:not qualify as such. I believe part of the problem here is indeed one of "neutrality", however, it isn't the "neutrality" of the article, but rather the "neutrality" of certain administrators who, by virtue of their own opinions on this issue, are allowing only one side to be presented.</i></p>
<hr />
<ol>
<li>Who is "we", as in "We have a real problem with this article"?</li>
<li>Why not add factual information to THIS article, and see what happens. (No, I'm not a college student, and no, I have absolutely no relationship to the AHSA or anyone involved with it.)</li>
<li>Is there really <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> information that those who "run" the group don't even OWN guns?</li>
<li>What's the <i>previous wiki article</i> you refer to?</li>

<li>I don't think he was even talking to you, John. I'm pretty sure that the admin "Neutrality"- who has a long standing pattern of deleting anything that is unflattering to Democrats or Democratic causes- was the person in question. Unless, of course, you're him. "We" would probably be anyone who understands the truth about this AHSA group. I am one such person. The AHSA is much like the admin "neutrality". Their name says one thing, their actions and positions say the exact opposite.</li>
<li>The facts are this. The group is run by people who have a long standing history of anti-gun crusading, in spite of their seemingly "pro gun" name. Furthermore, their position mirrors that of The Brady Campaign, the largest anti-gun organization group in the country. This would be like the KKK changing their name to “The Coalition For Racial Harmony”, saying they aren't racist, but rather for "responsible" management of racial issues, then hiring a bunch of black separatists to head the organization. The AHSA is a total and complete swindle, deeply linked to the democratic party who will be using this group for "endorsements" of otherwise anti-gun candidates in upcoming elections.</li>
<li>The entire point is that they support a position that is in favor of limiting gun rights for a huge number of Americans. Owning a firearm doesn't give someone a free pass from being "anti-gun" when their entire efforts are predicated on banning firearms that happen to be different from their own. I don't care of John Rosenthal owns a .22 rifle. The fact that he has made a career trying to take my guns away needs to be told. It is the true story behind this group.</li>
<li>The previous wiki article was deleted by "neutrality".</li>

<li>No, I'm not Neutrality. Admins can lose their adminship if they set up sock puppet accounts. I'm me. I still don't understand why an article about a GROUP could be so non-NPOV as to justify deleting entirely. I've never seen that done elsewhere on wikipedia (but I've only been around for a year or so).</li>
<li>I'd still welcome FACTUAL additions to the article - documented examples of what you call (entirely non-NPOVish, by the way) "anti-gun crusading" by leaders of the group.</li>
<li>If you're saying that it's okay to say someone is NOT a "gun owner" because "gun owner" means (to you) someone who supports gun rights (as you define them), then I think you're wrong - no one has a right to refine a term to mean what they want. "Gun owner" means "owning a gun". Again, adding FACTS (as opposed to uniquely-defined labels) to the article would be appreciated.</li>
<li>I was hoping to get a URL that would point to the deleted article, to better understand the problem. I suppose I could drop a dime to Neutrality, if all else fails.</li>

<li>The point of contention had to do with "Neutrality"</li>
<li>AHSA leader John Rosenthal was the president of the Massachusetts based "Coalition To Stop Handgun Violence", which is about as stridently an anti-gun org as you can think of. The facts are out there. You too can find them, if you dare to look.</li>
<li>I am saying that there are people who might own a firearm as a matter of happenstance but do not support gun rights. There are people who own firearms and do support gun rights. The AHSA represents the "fuddgun mentality" as was earlier referenced.</li>
<li>I don't know how to access that.</li>

<dl>
<dd>In the vernacular of firearms rights proponents, there exists a phrase called the “Fuddgun Mentality” (referring to the Cartoon Character <a href="../../../e/l/m/Elmer_Fudd_035e.html" title="Elmer Fudd">Elmer Fudd</a>) which addresses technical ‘gun owners’ who might hunt or shoot <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sporting_clays.html" title="Sporting clays">sporting clays</a>, but don’t believe in firearms rights beyond that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Technically speaking, these individuals can legitimately call themselves “gun owners” by virtue of their owning a firearm or supporting a limited scope of firearms use, while still retaining a position in favor of limiting gun rights. “Fudd-Gunners” are usually opposed to firearms use for self defense and often times don’t believe in the recreational use of firearms that exhibit certain cosmetic features. With the Gun Control issue having become a pariah in the realm of Democrat politics due to its impact in certain states during national elections, the strategic focus has shifted from a sweeping concept of firearms bans and regulations, to a more muted version, promoting the “Fuddgun” mentality. Political proponents of the Fuddgun Mentality are afforded a degree of deniability regarding their stance on the gun control issue when confronted with otherwise pro-gun rights crowds.</dd>

<dd>And I put it back again... Quite to the contrary, John, Wikipedia is almost entirely predicated on "original writing". Your assumption that I wrote that section is incorrect. If you were able to comprehend the rules as they're written, you would have understood that what is forbidden is "original research". And high-horsing over a typographical error is about as petty as you can get. Some things in this world are not quantifiable with numbers or on a spread-sheet. When addressing the philosophical precepts of an organization, a philosophical discussion will ensue. Anyway, back it goes, and back it will continue to go ad-infinitum as it is spot-on.

<dd>Have it your way. What is forbidden is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">orginal research</a>. And here's the definition: <i>Original research is a term used on Wikipedia to refer to material placed into articles by Wikipedia editors that has not been previously published by a reliable source. It includes unpublished theories, data, statements, concepts, arguments, and ideas; or any new interpretation, analysis, or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts, or arguments ...</i>. You did NOT cite a source (reliable or otherwise). Until you do, the presumption is that there IS NO SOURCE, the material is original research, and it should be kept OUT.</dd>

<p>Yesterday I deleted a large blog entry that had been copied verbatim into the article (WITHOUT a link to the blog itself!) because (a) blogs are specifically listed in the wikipedia policy on <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliability_cfb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliability">reliability</a> as generally not acceptable as sources) and (b) the posting was as long as the rest of the article combined (wikipedia isn't the place to duplicate the content of the Web) and (c) copying this much material verbatim is quite possibly a copyright violation.</p>
<p>Since the issue has come appeared in several places, and I don't want to get into arguments that I'm censoring critics of AHSA, I just added a (small) section to the article. It has the gist of the blog entry (with a link to the blog) plus a link to another (more mainstream - part of a magazine) blog that provides some countervailing information, plus two more links I found. Let the reader decide. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> 14:15, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're way out of line on this one, John, and there is absolutely, positively no question that you are either on a campaign to suppress extremely relevant information about this fraudulent group, motivated by your own political leanings (as clearly evidenced on your own user page) or simply on a lame "wiki-crusade". It's people like you that are the reason the wiki concept is roundly derided in many legitimate academic circles. Monkeys with Keyboards, as they say... The link you cite in your is is going back, and will continue to go back. Unless you, John Broughton, can cite a reason why you are qualified to delete the opinions of Dr. John Lott, you are without footing in doing so. If we have to bring Wikipedia administrators into this, I’ll be more than happy to. FactsAnHonesty</dd>

<dd>Apologies for citing the wrong policy: it was <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">wikipedia:Verifiability</a>. Here's the relevant text: <i>... self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources. Exceptions may be when a well-known, professional researcher in a relevant field, or a well-known professional journalist, has produced self-published material. In some cases, these may be acceptable as sources, so long as their work has been previously published by credible, third-party publications. However, exercise caution: if the information on the professional researcher's blog is really worth reporting, someone else will have done so.</i> And, in this case, I don't believe any reputable news source has done so.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You don't seem to want to give me credit for having IMPROVED on what you posted, by my substituting a much shorter section called "Location" that links to Dr. Lott's blog entry and cites the gist of his argument, while providing a BALANCE by citing evidence to the contrary, all with links for verification.</dd>

You pick. I believe I have bent over backwards to be objective: I was the one who added the section on the NRA position on the AHSA, and I haven't argued for deleting Lott's conspiracy theory entirely, as bizarre as I consider it. You, on the other hand, have repeatedly ignored valid objections to your postings, and your <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appeal_to_authority.html" title="Appeal to authority">appeal to authority</a> ignores the fact that Lott has his [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lott#Criticism" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lott#Criticism" rel="nofollow">share of critics</a>].<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> 20:57, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is a typical “Wiki” debate, where the individual in the affirmative finds himself on the defensive while the individual in the negative is making an endless stream of charges using completely abstract an mildly bizarre interpretations of Wikipedias rules (which themselves are written like the traffic code, where the cop can always “interpret” a reason to pull you over- the Wikipedia rules are sufficiently open-ended in their verbiage that almost any act of editing can be rationalize)</dd>

<dd>As your claims and desperate, far-out hypothesis are shot own on individual merit, you simply change the premise, or cite another “rule” that you loosely interprets to apply to the posting in question. The most amusing thing here is that you have twice now, cited completely incorrect rules as being the basis for your crusade, only to later say it was a “mistake” and try again with a new angle.</dd>

<dd>A) Blogs are “generally” not acceptable as sources, but in this case, it clearly meets the criteria for submission, given the nature of the topic and the author of the Blog in question.

<dd>Really, John, this dialogue with you is so entirely pointless. You delete and rationalize, without having any cogent, prevailing philosophy to support your actions. Again, I will reiterate. This is precisely the problem with the Wikipedia model. A doctor is forced to engage in long-wined arguments with a Lock Smith on heart surgery. A highly partisan leftist or Right-Winger can rationalize the actions of their respective parties in an endless stream of editing, adding, deleting and rationalizing, which is precisely what you’re doing here.

I've apologized in the past when I've been wrong; I expect to learn from my mistakes and make fewer (or at least different) mistakes in the future: and I like to work with people who feel the same way. I've yet to see any indication of anything other than your being totally smitten by your own words.

<dd>There is a right an wrong answer to every question, this one is no different. Often times, the truth lies somewhere between the partisans, but sometimes, it doesn’t. Often times, one is right an the other is just wrong. That’s what we have here. The information posted about the AHSA is entirely relevant, wholly pertinent and completely factual. Just because you don’t like said facts, you attempt to cloak yourself in the safety of “opinion” while running the dialogue in circles, in order to distract away from the facts. It’s classic Liberalism 101; a pathetic style that borers on being a personality disorder.</dd>

What we have here isn’t two people trying to “resolve” a dispute. We have one person who is wrong and another who is right.

<ul>
<li>As a passing neutral party I'll jump in. Here is how I see it:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The length added to the article by the inclusion of the text really has no bearing so it would be best to ignore this as an argument in itself, however:
<ol>
<li>Since this is an article on the American Hunters and Shooters Association and not on Dr John Lott and the American Hunters and Shooters Association, it is inappropriate to give disproportionate space to the views of one person (see <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>)</li>
<li>Stylistically it looks poor and does nothing to aid readability of the article</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> does discourage the use of blogs as sources and is a policy not a guideline. As stated above: <i>Exceptions may be when a well-known, professional researcher in a relevant field, or a well-known professional journalist, has produced self-published material. In some cases, these may be acceptable as sources, so long as their work has been previously published by credible, third-party publications.</i>. If Dr John Lott falls into this category there is no reason why his work should not be quoted, but the onus is on the editor to prove that.</li>
<li>There is no reason to reproduce verbatim an article that is referenced within the Wikipedia article itself. Wikipedia is not a soapbox. That said, if Dr Lott's comments are relevant and reliable they should be covered in sufficient depth to elucidate the reader of the facts of his arguments.</li>
<li>The summary of the argument proposed by John Broughton also shows evidence of POV editing - the heading of <b>Location</b> is rather disingenuous, suggesting that the section deals with the organization's address rather than controversies over fake organisations and the inclusion of other organisations that share the same building is irrelevant and original research (citing a third party that had noted this as a counter argument would be fine).</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>I would suggest that you work to rewrite a summary of Lott's arguments, referenced by his site, appropriately titled, and with counter arguments from other reputable sources. Hope this helps. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 14:05, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have changed the title of the section to be more NPOV (I believe), and appreciate other specific editing suggestions.

<ul>
<li>Since I've offered to mediate at the MC, I'll add my two cents here. It is not too dissimilar to what Yomangani said above.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>I think that we should not simply enter the blog post, as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Hunters_and_Shooters_Association&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67069285" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Hunters_and_Shooters_Association&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67069285" rel="nofollow">this diff</a>. It was formatted pretty badly to begin with, but the main reason for not including it verbatim is that it makes absolutely <i>no sense</i> to include the contents of a blog post verbatim instead of linking to it. A quote or two is fine, but the whole post is overkill.</li>
<li>What would be much more appropriate, IMHO, is if a summary of the contents of this blog post were written up, and then sourced (presumably one can find more reliable sources in the news for these claims)</li>
<li>As a short summary, the information contained in this blog post seems appropriate to stay in the article, but a direct cut-and-paste is probably not. -- <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 22:56, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have no objection to adding arguments or information from the Lott blog post to this article. I note that I did read the blog post, and added a new section with what I considered to be the gist of the argument. And I added a link to the blog post. If what I added was too brief, or missed points, then sure, I'd be happy to see those added. To the extent that parts of the blog post talked about gun rights in general, without reference to the AHSA, I remain of the opinion that those parts belong elsewhere in wikipedia, in in wikipedia at all. An article on a single organization is not, in my opinion, the place to have such philosophical arguments.</dd>

My suggestion would be there be a new case if need be, so this one should be closed. [Perhaps ironically, the section of the article that involved the mediation has been <i>deleted</i> by other users, and I didn't care enough (one way or the other) to argue that it be put back.

<p>The "Criticisms" section was deleted. I have reverted that change, and I invite further explanation and discussion here.</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to point out that the article was reviewed by a third party editors (mediators), as discussed above, neither of which had any problem whatsoever with the section that you removed.

<dd>AHSA wrote and complained. I agree with them.

<dl>
<dd>I certainly agree about undue weight - if you look at the discussion section, you'll see that I've had two extensive discussions that resulted in removal of large amounts of anti-ASHA text from the article. But I think the answer is to lengthen the article in other ways, because the policy you cite says <i>The views of critics should be represented if their views are relevant to the enterprise's notability and are based on reliable sources</i>. There is no question in my mind that AHSA is notable because of NRA and similar attacks on it.</dd>

<dd>I'm going to shorten the "Controversies" section. But I can't agree that <i>The NRA's views on the AHSA and the many other organizations they dislike belong on the NRA page, not here</i>, because if that were doine, there would be no way that a reader coming to this page would see the controversy, and the controversy IS relevant. Further, if the information on location is removed, then essentially there is no rebuttal to attacks on the AHSA regarding this point that are made in the blogisphere.</dd>

<p>Don't revert me again on that without providing a reliable source. The section is a copy-paste of the blog's author allegation, which in any case can't be used as a source to anything else but itself. Get that source and when you do, find a title that isn't so obviously devious.

<dd>Okay, take a deep breath, please. Let's walk through the first (main) paragraph that you are proposing to delete.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(0) You're welcome to change the title of the section to something that you like more. As for POV, that title was changed based on a MEDIATOR's suggestion - see above.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(1) <i>In 2005, when the internet domain for AHSA was registered by DCS, an internet consulting firm, critics noted that the listed address was 600 Pennsylvania Ave SE, Washington, D.C., where the the Democratic Leadership Council is located.</i> Note that this sentence is about what CRITICS say. The point of the entire paragraph is to discuss something that (if you look above) was the point of a large controversy. The paragraph was approved by a independent MEDIATOR as being NPOV - again, please see the talk section. The person who got into a fight because he insisted that the entire blog entry should NOT be inserted into this article was ME. So I'm quite aware of the rule against cut-and-paste of blog allegations.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia policy DOES allow criticism if the critic is notable, as is the case here, with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lott_5238.html" title="John Lott">John Lott</a>. Policy also says to not cite critics excessively - and I have not.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The first sentence is the ONLY one that could remotely be described as "cut-and-paste" (and it's not, exactly, I believe - I think the blog entry was fairly rambling). It's the ONLY sentence that cites the blog.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(2) <i>DCS does work on Democratic and not Republican campaigns</i> - this cites the organization's website (a link NOT in the blog).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(3) <i>but other residents of the building include the College Republicans and Republicans Abroad International</i> - this cites a (very reputable) <i>Washington Monthly</i> blog; neither the text nor the cite was in the John Lott article; it is essentially a rebuttal.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(4) <i>as well as the American Shipbuilding Association ... and the American Association of Political Consultants</i>: two more cites to organizational websites; neither text nor cites are in the John Lott blog.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You may be under the impression that I'm anti-AHSA. May I suggest reading the entire page above, as well as looking at the history of the article, if this is so. And I'd appreciate not being accused of doing original research.</dd>

<dd>The issue at end here is that links are made which aren't backed up by any reliable sources. Weither those are factually correct or notable are not relevant as the section is an argument tricking the group into guilt by association. You're welcome to introduce the location of their headquarter into the lead paragraph if you want, but when an author make a link between fact A and B to introduce guilt by association C it's original research -&gt; "It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source"</dd>

<dd>Rewording the section appears silly to me, but I really don't mind and you know more about the subject that I care to learn. "<a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Lott_5238.html" title="John Lott">John Lott</a> posted an e-mail he received from an unnamed source on his blog under the title "Democrats set up fake organizations to support gun control policies. The e-mail argue that DHC is a front group for the Democratic Party because it was located in the same building as the Democratic Leadership Council. bla bla bla." We can't "critic the critic" with other "factually correct" information such as notable Republican organizations also sharing the building, because it also tries to make an argument "e.g.:this critic is bogus" without citing any source for the argumentation. <a href="../../../j/e/a/User%7EJean-Philippe_9cba.html" title="User:Jean-Philippe">Jean-Philippe</a> 19:59, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the criticism as it is remain unsourced. Basicly emails Lott received, which he doesn't comment upon, altough the title are obvious and his position on gun control is well known. Blogs aren't notorious for their editorial oversight, particularly a blog like his which apparently (correct me if I'm wrong) doesn't allow for readers comment. Specificly I ask you what do you think of my assesment of the source, not the criticism itself. <a href="../../../j/e/a/User%7EJean-Philippe_9cba.html" title="User:Jean-Philippe">Jean-Philippe</a> 21:48, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The criticism by Lott is stupid, boarding on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a>, but I don't think it's good policy for wikipedia editors to evaluate the quality of the criticism. Rather, the issue, I think, is the notability of the critic. My guess (it's late, I'm lazy) is that Lott's post got a fair amount of play in the blogosphere; certainly it got enough to get someone (not me) to argue a great deal about why not only it, but the entire blog post, deserved to be in the article.</dd>

<dd>I'd like to remind editors that while John Lott is notable and his blog potentially reliable, he never comments on the value of the emails he received. My question is, looking at the source, can we say beyond the shadow of a doubt that John Lott support the finding of the emails he received? Can we give notability to the emails solely because John Lott posted them on this blog? John Lott didn't made the criticism here, only reported on them. One would think, that's just me, that if the criticism was serious John Lott would have reported it outside of his blog. <a href="../../../j/e/a/User%7EJean-Philippe_9cba.html" title="User:Jean-Philippe">Jean-Philippe</a> 23:22, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I won't repeat my comments above, but I will note that the tiny amount of text left in the section leaves the reader asking "and so?". Is there a relationship?

<p>It's not our job (or allowed) to connect the dots for readers with anything that might be original research--Wikipedia cannot be built as a primary source.

<p>Maybe we should have a section detailing the situation here. The NRA's opinions on a gun-related group are relevant, certainly. On the other hand, we can't let the article turn into "here's two sentences about the group and 4 pages about criticism of it." However, we should not gloss over the fact that this group is <i>widely</i> considered a bogus gun-rights group by other gun rights groups. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 15:51, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>We can mention it, with appropriate weight to the article. But it should not be an anti-AHSA article, nor pro. Based on the current weight of the article/size, a sentence or two is fine for the Criticism section. · <font color="#0518A7"><b>XP</b></font> · 16:37, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There seems to be some confusion here. The John Lott (location of AHSA controversy) was in fact based on a blog (but from a notable source; it's quotable as criticism, not proof of anything except the criticism itself). The NRA stuff, however, is <b>posted by the NRA lobbying arm</b>. It is NOT a blog. It is as reliable a source as one can find of the NRA's position vis-a-vis the AHSA. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Broughton_26e4.html" title="User talk:John Broughton">Talk</a> 16:48, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>The extra information in the Leadership section is getting a bit unrelated to merely listing the owners/leaders of the AHSA, and a lot of it is somewhat editorial (i.e. it seems to be included to color the individual in a certain light). Perhaps the additional information can be moved to another section?</p>
<p>For example:&#160;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ray Schoenke, founding president [2] A former football player for the Washington Redskins, Schoenke ran for Governor of Maryland as <b>a Democrat and has given "millions" to Democrat politicians and causes according to a January 19, 1998 Washington Post article.</b>[1] <i>Among the groups that Schoenke has donated to are two that actively lobby to ban firearms: Handgun Control, Inc. and America Coming Together</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I propose moving the italicized information to the "Criticisms" section and just deleting the bold section. The fact that he ran as a Democrat and has donated to those causes, while interesting in a bio of Schoenke, is not relevant to this article. I understand that many Democrats may be against gun rights, but that is not the point of this article.</p>
<p>His other gun-law related activities, though, might be relevant in the criticisms section. If no one has a serious objection, I plan to move the editorial info for the Leadership section accordingly <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIzaakb_e0a3.html" title="User:Izaakb">Izaakb</a> 15:28, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
