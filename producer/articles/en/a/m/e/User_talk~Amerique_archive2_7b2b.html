<p>Hi, I'd like you to be my advocate. Here is an overview of the dispute</p>
<p>1) The section was created with the message that the Al-Aqsa Mosque is not a holy site in Islam, but was considered a 3rd holy site only to aid the political intentions of the muslim world, and it was only called the 3rd holiest site after 1930.</p>
<p>2) The editor(s) claim that this is a 'very highly disputed issue' for muslims (which it is not), and after I told him about the mentioning of the mosque in the Quran (1400 year old document), I had posted the english translation of the name of the mosque "The Farthest Mosque", and he replied saying the "The Farthest Mosque" (Direct translation of the arabic phrase Masjid Al-Aqsa into english, where masjid means mosque is disputed and it could be the mosque in Madina, not the Al-Aqsa Mosque. This clearly shows that the editor(s) has no detailed information on the subject, and is acting on a false article which he came across on some website (First it was a blog, then it was some israeli website). Here are his actual words&#160;:</p>
<p>"if you're saying it's mentioned in the quran then you must have a different version"</p>
<p>"Where does it mention it&#160;? Your quote doesn't mention any of the sort. The question of the farthest quote location is highly disputed and many see that actually as Medina"</p>
<p><br />
3) The editor(s) then go on with a pointless addition of "Alternative third holiest sites", The structures mentioned (with exception of the Imam Ali mosque, but the imam ali mosque is considered holy by the Shia sect of Muslims, and the Shias themselves consider it to the be the fourth holiest site), were constructed 1000 years after the advent of Islam, and therefore have no religious significance comparable to the Al-Aqsa Mosque.</p>
<p><br />
There are many more problems to list, but I think this will do for now. Someone posted more of an opinion, and it can be proved to be completely false, so if thats the case, I don't think it should be there in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThestick_44db.html" title="User:Thestick">Thestick</a> 16:44, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for responding my request.I dont seem to have any 'personal' problems with the editors with whom I have differences about <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum_district.html" title="Belgaum district">Belgaum_district</a> articles.Fortuntely Indian user Aksi_Great and sunder have intervened and solved the problem in a considerable way.We seem to have cooled off but I shall still request u to keep a look on these article as I am extremely concerned about POV of Border dispute sub-sectiom.Since u have no information about it,u r most likely to be neutral and 'understand' where POV is being disrupted.The other users contesting for these article are expert in wiki's policies and they take me to a ride by wisely framing lingo in their favor(using citations which are from their state's media) and throwing some warnings every now and then.I shall also like to confess that I have been uncivil few times and due to my poor English and my ignorance towards wiki's procedures,i perhaps I broke few rules.But now I have fully understood the citation language which those understand. I urge u to watch those topics for NPOV in Border dispute section.</p>
<p>About dispute-Indian states of Maharashtra and Karnataka have been fighting for Belgaum and adjoining areas which are currently with Karnataka,but its(Belgaum's) majority of people are Maharashtrians.(which is not agreed by K'taka).Maharashtra state is formed for the Marathi language speakers and hence Belgaum-residents want to join Maharashtra.but K'taka was awarded those regions by an commission during late 50's on the grounds of administrative ease befor the creation of Maharashtra state. The case has been transferred to Supreme court after decades of struggle.I am from Maharashtra and want Karnataka wikipedians to keep NPOV intact.</p>

<p>Personal information: I am married and have two wonderful stepchildren – both in scientific disciplines. Raised eating in the old Indian way, I have tried to maintain those healthy habits. My husband and I try to walk at least 25 miles a week. I collect Indian art and particularly love Indian (especially Cahuilla) baskets. Photography and racquet sports are old passions that now get put off “until I have a little more time.”</p>

<p>A user, Ryulong, is insisting on reverting my edits, even on the Hawaiian language page where I am serving as Wikipedia's expert on the subject, and I am the major contributor. I made contributions to the WikiProject Hawaii Manual of Style, but Ryulong again reverted my contributions, falsely calling my contributions "vandalism". I believe that Ryulong should be blocked, and prevented from editing the Hawaii-related articles to which I contribute.</p>
<p>I have near-native fluency in Hawaiian language, and a PhD in Linguistics. I've lived in Hawaii for about 50 years. This guy Ryulong does not know diddly squat about Hawaiian language. And he blatantly lies about things relating to editing on Wikipedia. I'm willing to go through whatever process is necessary in order for Wikipedia to stop this Ryulong from making trouble.</p>
<p>Please don't agree to help me with this, unless you can effectively deal with the uncooperative user who lies about me and lies about Wikipedia. But if you really can help, then please do. Thanks. Agent X 03:15, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Right or wrong, this is a personal attack. I asked you to stop this before Agent X. Now you are blocked for 24 hours. Instead of accusing people of lying, go work on something else constructive. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 03:54, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think I need ur support.On the <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaum.html" title="Belgaum">Belgaum</a> article,it is almost proved that Belgaon Municipal corporation uses Marathi as an official language too.I have gave enough citations/sources to prove that.(see Belgaum:Talk )This has agreed by our unofficial mediator(aksi_great) and perhaps a admin(nichalp) too. But a user is deliberately editing out the Marathi name on that article without any citations,instead swearing at me and at my state.

Infact both are categorical in stating that they arent yet convinced either with his citations nor with even the need to have the Marathi transliteration there in the first place. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 22:58, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Over and above that, mahawiki's behaviour and language has been provocative and ugly to say the least. His various indiscretions include blanking out official warnings placed on his talk page by other editors, slapping me with sundry and irrelevant warning templates including npa6 and test6!! He defiantly continues to use derogatory slangs like 'kannadi' to refer to <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kannadigas.html" title="Kannadigas">Kannadigas</a> inspite of being requested and warned(officially and unofficially) by other editors to refrain from using that slang. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 22:58, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I recognize that there has been no assumption of good faith in this matter, and that personal attacks have been made. That is what is making the content issue difficult to determine. I have advised Mahawiki to discontinue direct contact with you and have encouraged him to consider designing a survey to attempt to locate where community consensus lies with regards to his concerns. I do not support any of the personal attacks that have been made, but I think the content issue can potentially be worked out to the satisfaction of all parties involved.

<p>Thanks for ur concern!I have not understood ur suggestion of survey though.I have proved ample citations to prove my point and basically the other user is freaking out unnecessarily just to provoke me!What exactly should I do by 'phrasing' the survey?</p>

Thanks for ur reply.I dont mind any survey but the point to be considered is whether it shall bring out the truth?What if members of a certain community vote in their favour and thus blank out the facts.If these Kannad fanatics are busy 'Kannadising' other articles including 'Belgaum' and even Tamil_language,Marathi_language,Kaveri dispute,Rajkumar etc.. i dont think they are capable of any good faith.Survey would be a good idea if only NEUTRAL and RESPONSIBLE(not the general users) are allowed to vote.</p>
<p>In fact if I have given enough citations to prove my point,why shall one ask for other's opinion.Not that I am against it,but if u see Belgaum talk page,I have been citing enough sources continuously but a particular user is only avoiding them and bragging.What I want is watch of NEUTRAL and RESPONSIBLE(perhaps admins) on that article which is prone to vandalism.<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 05:14, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I hope it shall work and not disrupt my cause(which I have proved but that user is purposely avoiding it)!<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 05:44, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Amerique, These guys are taking u for a ride by discussing the issues which are not related to what the controversy is.Belgaum city,unlike Solapur,uses Marathi and Kannada (BOTH languages) as official.Plz see the following link to read complete summary of evidences I provided. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Nichalp#Please_do_something_about_Belgaum_article" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Nichalp#Please_do_something_about_Belgaum_article" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Nichalp#Please_do_something_about_Belgaum_article</a></p>

The board itself <a href="http://www.pudhari.com/Static/Features/Belgaon_border_issue/f_belgaon154.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.pudhari.com/Static/Features/Belgaon_border_issue/f_belgaon154.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pudhari.com/Static/Features/Belgaon_border_issue/f_belgaon154.htm</a> and the link <a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/051126/48/618nr.html" class="external free" title="http://in.news.yahoo.com/051126/48/618nr.html" rel="nofollow">http://in.news.yahoo.com/051126/48/618nr.html</a> is enough to prove it.Belgaon had Marathi majority in past and is has it still.mahajan commission which was biased against Maharashtra and Kerala state,gave illogical reasons like (administrative ease) for transfer of Belgaum to K'taka.The user contesting that the language board is not Marathi should prove that its in Hindi too.It is significant that a main board outside Belgaon municipal corporation displays Marathi transliteration.Its the enough reason to prove that Marathi is an official language.</p>
<p>I do confess the reverts at Solapur page which was long before I got to know about Wiki's policies.But I still dont understand why is need of 'Kannadisation' of that article when Solapur has miniscule Kannada ppl. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 03:54, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dont compare Belgaum with other American counterparts.In India,factors like religion,caste,language (we have atleast 22 national languages) are far more important than in US.What I want to tell u is,I have cited a pic which shows Belgaon corporation uses Marathi and also a link which confirms it (see above post).This is ample proof that civic body uses Marathi as an official language.Nicalp,Aksi_great has confirmed that the language on the board is Marathi.This user sarvagnya is confusing u and others by changing the focus after he has failed to prove that the language on the board is not Marathi.<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 05:18, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Amerique,</p>
<p>While you and other editors are working towards reaching a consensus in the Belgaum article, it is imperative that all the editors co-operate and discuss about the current issue only. As you have been repeatedly requesting the editors, assuming good faith among other editors is one of the most important parameters of reaching consensus. But, inspite of your efforts, please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABelgaum&amp;diff=73880967&amp;oldid=73880795" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABelgaum&amp;diff=73880967&amp;oldid=73880795" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>. If the discussion in talk page goes like this, will we ever reach a consensus? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABelgaum&amp;diff=73880967&amp;oldid=73880795" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABelgaum&amp;diff=73880967&amp;oldid=73880795" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ABelgaum&amp;diff=73880967&amp;oldid=73880795</a></p>
<p>Continuing being part of a healthy discussion becomes extremely difficult when someone makes seriously offensive statements against a community, people, and state. I request your attention in this matter.

<p>KNM is just busy saving his face.Note that these ppl are conviniently ignoring the citationa and facts which I have established long back.Anyways coming to the point,I have added a survey to get consensus if the script displayed on that board is Marathi or Hindi.I think we should let all know about it.How do I do that?Respondents should be having knowledge of Hindi. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 16:02, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Sarvagnya is not only having unnecessary debate over Marathi transliteration,but he also wants <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangla.html" title="Bangla">Bangla</a>,<a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> or/and <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindi.html" title="Hindi">Hindi</a> transliteration removed from <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jana_Gana_Mana_84d3.html" title="Jana Gana Mana">Jana_Gana_Mana</a>, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vande_mataram.html" title="Vande mataram">Vande_mataram</a> and note his vandalism at Hindi page, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hindi&amp;diff=73968761&amp;oldid=73662164" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hindi&amp;diff=73968761&amp;oldid=73662164" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hindi&amp;diff=73968761&amp;oldid=73662164</a> This shows his disrespect for other languages and tendency of pushing his Kannadi POV everywhere.</p>
<p>Pl. see the opinions of Hindi speakers about 'ळ' in Hindi on Hindi talk page.I think this shall end any confusions u might have if that board is in Marathi.<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 05:13, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dear Amerique, Its very unfortunate that u r backing off from the article.U are an non-indian and still u understood that the script is indeed in Marathi,but see the other user who i think very well knows it,but is just debating for the sake of it.To be very frank,those guys have crossed every limit and whats more they are deliberately ignoring my citations. I would prefer that article is locked.I request u to keep watching this article.Important is that the truth should be out.Plz advice me about what furthur steps 'I' should take after all this. Believe me,its frustrating when u produce so many citations and still few arrogants keep on having petty fights! <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 04:16, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
