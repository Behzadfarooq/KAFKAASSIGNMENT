<p>i don't understand the first two sentences under the paragraph 'politics and civil rights'. --<i>The German Jews were primarily Republicans. However the Yiddish speakers were either Socialists (especially if they were connected with the garment industry), or nonpolitical until the 1930s.</i> firstly there doesn't seem to be a reference to these statements, and secondly: what does this paragraph want to say? to me it seems to be redundant to project a current debate (i.e. the polarized debate about dems vs. repubs) to a whole different era. it seems to overemphasize the role of ethnicity in its relation to politics.</p>

<p>I would use "Jewish Americans". That designation implies Americans of Jewish background, not Jews who happen to live in America. I think it's appropriate for the noun to be "Americans" rather than "Jews". I've changed the title of this article several times, only to have it changed back each time. I'd be interested to know how others feel about this.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Consistency would lead one to favor "Jewish Americans" as that is parallel with other types of ethnic identity in the US: Asian American, African American, Polish America, European American. Also, this usage makes "Jewish" an adjective modifying the noun "American," which is thereby presented as the main identity. An article that focused on the Jewish diaspora might, on the other hand, use "American Jews" since the focus would be on Judaism with national identity being an adjectival add-on.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>One thing, though, is that the term "Jewish American" is much less common than the other ethnic terms mentioned in the previous paragraph, even less common than "European American." People usually just say, and write, "Jew" or "Jewish," with the "American" part being unstated and understood. However, given that Wikipedia is neither a conversation nor a formal piece of writing whose intended audience is exclusively American, it makes sense to be consistent and use the rather artifical term "Jewish American." <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua">Interlingua</a> 16:20, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't object to the term "Jewish American", then to reverse the term to "American Jewish" would make some people content on the issue. They are American citizens, born or raised in the U.S. and you can include those who immigrated here. However, if you want to discuss Jews or Jewish people in America, the term "American Jews" is an excellent choice on the article. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_D_26_ad8d.html" title="User:Mike D 26">Mike D 26</a> 09:34, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Without getting into a revert war, I'd like to replace "extremely religious" as being a loaded, POV term. Ttownfeen's point in reverting from my "extremely zealous" edit is well taken -- it <i>is</i> somewhat loaded -- but to characterise the Haredim as the most <i>religious</i> Jews simply because they have the most <i>restrictive</i> take on proper Jewish behaviour seems unconscionable POV. What would be a fair term to use? "Extremely Orthodox" seems prejudiced against a Modern Orthodox perspective (which is why "Haredi" is to be preferred to "Ultra-Orthodox"). In the absence of a consensus on the issue, I'm just going to delete "extremely religious" as I think it's prejudice outweighs its informative value. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavant1984_d31f.html" title="User:Savant1984">Savant1984</a> 06:40, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please don't take my feelings or ego into account. I know next to nothing about the various sects of Judaism (which is why I was perusing articles on Judaism and the Jewish race/people/nation/err...thing). I just thought the word "zealous" gave the connotation that the group in question's religious conservatism was a negative thing. So, what about using the word "conservative"? <a href="../../../t/t/o/User%7ETtownfeen_1fa5.html" title="User:Ttownfeen">Ttownfeen</a> 22:37, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No problem Ttownfeen, and I'd be happy to talk about Judaism/Israel with you.&#160;:) There're two problems with "extremely conservative" as I see it, though: 1) "Conservative" is also the name of a non-Orthodox Jewish movement. 2) Haredi Judaism is arguably reactionary in its approach to Jewish law and observance, and some groups (especially among the Chasidim) are radical philosophically. Nevertheless, it seems to me that there IS a spectrum on which the Haredim are at one end and Secular Jews at another, and that it's appropriate for the beginning of this article to note that. I just can't figure out an NPOV term. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavant1984_d31f.html" title="User:Savant1984">Savant1984</a> 23:17, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To say Jews are a "race" or ethnicity is controversial, but be in mind the Jewish people constitute a religion that one can convert or withdraw from. Also to point out American Jews are of multiple ethnic and national origins, as well a small portion of non-Jews have a Jewish ancestor. For one to identity as being Jewish has to do with personal bonds to Judaism or their background. American Jews have been widely accepted, has enjoyed a high degree of <a href="../../../i/n/t/Integration.html" title="Integration">integration</a> and freedom of religion has provided them with safety and security than most parts of the world. However, the forces of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assimilation.html" title="Assimilation">assimilation</a> has impacted Jewish identity when it comes in contact with the larger mainstream culture. But, an American Jew can preserve and practice the main core of the Jewish religion that won't interfere with their sense of being a part of American society. This is an example of diversity and <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multi-culturalism.html" title="Multi-culturalism">multi-culturalism</a> in America, where one is free to decide his ethnic heritage and religious observance. The "race" issue of whether Jews after thousands of years as a separate entity is not pity, but there is a range of some inter-marriage and waves of conversion to Christianity in the case of Spanish <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conversos.html" title="Conversos">Conversos</a> in the 1400s. Today, the majority of American Jews have a non-Jewish spouse and many families are of mixed-faith, but this hasn't yet made the Jewish faith disappear at all. Surely the pressure to fit in has affected Judaism in the U.S, then for one to self-identify with Judaism or any ethnic ties remains the same. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_D_26_ad8d.html" title="User:Mike D 26">Mike D 26</a> 09:42, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Race has a biological basis. The saying that there is more genetic variance within races than between them and therefore there is 'no such thing as race' is a misunderstanding of majority scientific opinion. There are genetic groupings of homo sapiens that generally fall along cultural definitions of race (which, like genetics, are to some degree based on geographic history), and they contain measurable phenotypic differences. For example, in the medical domain, Caucasians and Asians have higher rates of osteoporosis, Jews: Tay-Sachs, West-Africans: sickle-cell anemia. This genetic difference may even produce phenotypic difference measurable at the cognitive and behavioral level (see <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_intelligence.html" title="Race and intelligence">race and intelligence</a>). Jews have largely been genetically isolated from other populations for most of their history.<a href="http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4032638" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4032638" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>--<a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENectarflowed_3ba7.html" title="User:Nectarflowed">Nectarflowed</a> <a href="../../../n/e/c/User_talk%7ENectarflowed_7dd9.html" title="User talk:Nectarflowed"><sup>T</sup></a> 00:26, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First, Jews are not a race, they are an ethnic group, a nation, and a religion, please see <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a>. Second, any scientific basis for race is dubious, and it certainly is not mainstream scientific thought, please provide some sources proving otherwise. Finally, the issue of potential intelligence differences among different ethnic groups remains extremely controversal and unproven -- any article covering it should cover both sides of the argument, as the New York Tomes article does. Just as we do not include coverage of dubious theories like those of Kevin McDonald in the main article about American Jews, there seems no compelling reason to include this latest battle in the war about how "different" Jews are from other populations. Feel free to create a Jews and Genetics article, and include it as a related article, but otherwise opening this can of worms seems unneeded in a tangential article - are you going to post it to Jews in France, Jews in Canada, as well? --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 02:44, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Regarding the biological basis of race, yes, the racial categorization scheme only "rougly approximates," as one report (published in the peer-reviewed journal <a href="http://www.publichealthreports.org/general.cfm" class="external text" title="http://www.publichealthreports.org/general.cfm" rel="nofollow">Public Health Reports</a>, puts it, "a classification that would be optimally useful for purposes of public health related to gene-environment interaction in specific populations."<a href="http://www.publichealthreports.org/userfiles/117_5/117421.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.publichealthreports.org/userfiles/117_5/117421.pdf" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> The journal is by the U.S. Public Health Service, published (2002) by the Association of Schools of Public Health(ASPH). The big picture in human population genetics, according to the report, is that for most of our genes, there has been little direct selection pressure since the origin of the human species. This is why, for the big structural features of the human genome, racial differences do not exist and race is "not of any biological significance.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The report goes on, though, that "for a particular subset of genes, <b>many with important biomedical function and significance, average allele frequence differences are in fact observed between populations originating in different geographic areas,</b> or with different exposures, diets, or other factors. In many (but by no means all) of these cases, the allele frequency differences segregate with alleles that are responsibile for the surface chracteristics historically used to define race." These racial differences in subsets of genes are responsible for the phenotypic differences we're familiar with, such as lactose-tolerance in adults being found more in Europeans than other races.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My point is that racial genetics is <b>a complex field that can't be reduced only to "not of any biological significance,"</b> and I think this point is supported, btw, by the title of this report, which is <i>the Racial Genetics Paradox in Biomedical Research and Public Health.</i> Medicine, which is a field that actually has to do hands on work with the genetic differences between humans, would be impeded if it operated under the principle that ethnic background is not of any biological signifance.</dd>

<dd>Regarding the "Natural history of Ashkenazi intelligence," I think we probably agree <b>evolutionary anthropology theories regarding the unusual success of Jews is relevant,</b> and in some cases maybe appropriate, for inclusion in summaries of that topic. Similarly, the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldness.html" title="Baldness">baldness</a> page includes a section for evolutionary theories regarding that topic. The paper is controversial, but Stephen Pinker defends it, noting the extreme controversiality of any research dealing with cognitive difference among ethnicities. This paper provides an argument against the theory <b>most people are familiar with</b> for the unique diseases among Ashkenazi: a genetic bottleneck in the population's history, combined with taboo against marriage outside the population.<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=14722586" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=14722586" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> The new paper is a big deal,<a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&amp;url=ashkenazi" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&amp;url=ashkenazi" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>(<a href="http://www.technorati.com/about/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.technorati.com/about/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>) and future studies are expected to test its hypotheses.</dd>

<dd>The public health report paper you cite (which is an opinion column and not a paper, by the way) starts off by saying that genetics cannot shed any light on issues of race. It then talks about the fact that certain genetic diseases show up in certain groups that don't correspond to race -- sickle cell anemia among Greeks and Italians, etc -- and says that there are three "racial" groups, which would not seem to include Jews. Certainly some groups have higher frequencies of genetic diseases, like Ashkenaz Jews or the Amish, but this is different from saying that they have different genetic levels of intelligence, which is what the paper proposes. In any case, the point is that Jews are not a race in any biological sense, and you have provided no evidence that they are, or even that race is actually a generally used concept in a way that would include Jews as a seperate grouop.</dd>

<dd>On the new paper, just because a paper is generating buzz in the press does not mean that it is a big deal in a scientific sense -- its hypotheses have not been tested, and there seem to be many reasons given by population geneticists about why it is flawed (for example, from the New York Times article: "The authors "make pretty much all of the classic mistakes in interpreting heritability," said Dr. Andrew Clark, a population geneticist at Cornell University, and the argument that the sphingolipid gene variants are associated with intelligence, he said, is "far-fetched.""). If we include links to unproven hypotheses about Jews, we open it to people like Kevin McDonald as well, who makes an anti-semitic pseudo-biological argument. Lets wait until this paper is actually tested scientifically before posting it everywhere, unlike baldness, this is highly controversal, and we are not listing the objections as well.</dd>

<dd>So there's evidence on Jews (but Americans of European background) are smarter than "gentiles" or non-Jews? I don't buy it completely, but there is a large representation of American Jews in colleges, universities and business schools. There may be cultural explanations or if the tradition of intellectual or academic success is found in American Jewish families. Not just the Jews, but WASPs, Asian-Americans and Arabs are seen as "gifted" or had an ability to enter top-level colleges or universities than Christian American whites. I believe class and economic status had more to do with the ability to pay for and enter a top-level college or ivy league school. Religion, race and gender are measured to explain why or how come more Jews than catholics, but less Blacks or more Asians, and more women than men are enrolled in the top 100 colleges? There is no "smarter" or "less smart" group of people based on race, ethnicity and religious denomination. The high representation of Ashkenazi Jews than other groups in fields of science, political thought and economic theory are well noted: <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Einstein_8441.html" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigmund_Freud_d2be.html" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonas_Salk_5af0.html" title="Jonas Salk">Jonas Salk</a> are indeed Jews and Ashkenazi.

<dd>A common quip is that American Jews live like Episcopalians but vote like Puerto Ricans. For those not familiar with US society and politics. Episcopalians are the American version of Anglicans (Church of England) and are generally understood to be the highest-income religious group here. Stereotypically, they vote Republican. When this joke became common in the 1950s, Puerto Ricans were the most recent group of immigrants to New York (although they came as US citizens) and tended to be both poor and Democratic.

<dd>As an Iranian, the offical language of Iran is Persian. That is what the Iranian government has declared as the language for all of the world to use. Farsi is a term used by the speakers of Persian to refer to their own language. Most Indians use the term Parsi to denote Persian and the speakers of Persian. Neither Farsi nor Parsi is a name that is typically accepted by other countries or authorites as the offically correct word. I think the correct usage would be the one the government is providing. <a href="../../../m/g/h/User%7EMghassem_4a9e.html" title="User:Mghassem">Marzyeh</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the Persian/Farsi discussion board, there has been a long exchange on this. Persian is the term that has been most common in English for centuries. However, those who favor Farsi point out that "Persian" is confusing as it is easily understood to refer to ancient Peria and its language/culture. In the case of several other cultures, there are pairs of terms the former of which is often associated with older forms of the language or culture, and the latter of which is associated with newer forms: Norse/Norwegian, Israelite/Israeli, Grecian/Greek.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Those who favor "Persian" argue that using "Farsi" is like saying "français." With more commonly studied foreign languages (French, German, Russian, Chinese, Arabic, etc), there has been virtually no debate about what to call them; we use the established English words and not français, Deutsch, Ruski, Putonghua or arabi, respectively. With less commonly studied foreign languages, there has often been a debate about what term to use, with the terms most often being around older terms used in English and newer ones that are closer to the word of the language in the langauge itself. In the Americas, this has often been been a question largely of orthography: Quiché or K'iche', Tsotojil or Tz'tujil. In other cases, completely different terms have been favored: Inuit not Eskimo, Purépecha not Tarascan, Runa Simi not Quechua. Similar debates exist elsewhere: is the language Swahili or kiSwahili, Bahasa Indonesia or Indonesian.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Because of these issues, it's not surprising to find that there are disagreements among official sources on what term to use. The CIA uses Persian. Harvard and most universities in the US use Farsi in their course catalogues. UNESCO uses both. Iranian Embassies seem to use the term "Modern Persian" on their English websites, but some also use "Farsi." <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInterlingua_47a8.html" title="User:Interlingua">Interlingua</a> 16:48, 19 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Persian, Farsi or Iranian Jews...it depends on whoever felt which one is a culturally sensitive term. Wikipedia policy usually describe language and ethnicity not the same, but some exceptions like French and <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French language</a>, Cherokee and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherokee_language.html" title="Cherokee language">Cherokee language</a> and Korean and <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_language.html" title="Korean language">Korean language</a>.

<p>The definition of "Jewish" in Iran and the Middle east is stricter than in Europe and America, sometimes a Jewish person don't adhere to every part of his/her religion still can say he/she is Jewish. The Iranian Jews had closely guarded Judaism in a more conservative society that emphasized a whole traditional set of religious mores and family values.</p>
<p>I don't want to stray away from the subject, but I'm of French paternal and part-Cherokee maternal ancestry, but does it mean I'm French enough to become a dual citizen of France? No. Am I native American enough to join their tribe? No. I have to enlist and proof my national and tribal family records, but have the right to say I'm half-french and had some Amerindian blood. I may as well call myself an American, but a "heinz 57" mix.</p>
<p>Back to my point, for one to be "Jewish" in halakhic law is conversion. But to many in the American Jewish community, it's not always necessary. It's different for Jews in membership rolls to Orthodox, Conservative, Reform or Reconstruction sects...but some Jews may occassionally attend sabbatical services (not every week) or took part in rites on Jewish holidays that follow custom or observance. In other words, a Jew is one who worships and practice any traits associated with Judaism. Same goes to Christians like myself who never went to church, but accepted most important dogmas of my faith, or I won't call myself a Christian.</p>
<p>But the Iranians always strictly use religion for identify those who are Muslim, Christian and Zoroastrian. To be Jewish, but Iranian does not get a separate label. If they speak/read Persian, hold Iranian citizenship and perform its' duties: are they Iranians, including those who believe in Judaism? Yes. But, political crises and religious persecution against them has nearly put an end to Jewish life in Iran. I hope things improve for them under these conditions. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_D_26_ad8d.html" title="User:Mike D 26">Mike D 26</a> 11:17, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not so far, the difficulty of categorizing a language of Iran is harder than categorizing a group of Jews from Iran. According to <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a> article, the Iranian Jews speak Iranian (the official term), also called Farsi and Persian by some without being wrong. Let's go by "Iranian" language for now, but there are several other languages in the country. Farsi and Persian are similar terms, then "Iranian" is what's official in the eyes of the Iranian government. I did discuss the lack of clear identity terms and phrases for all peoples of Iran, especially Jews who long described themselves Iranian and the religious grouping wasn't drastically used, then the recent wave of anti-Israel politics placed a heavy burden on what is a Jew in Iran? --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_D_26_ad8d.html" title="User:Mike D 26">Mike D 26</a> 21:32, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good question, there are Jewish communities worldwide and some are large, others are generally small. There's a constant issue alike what the Jewish Americans deal with: race/ethnic identity. Hispanics or Latinos in the U.S. have the same enigma on racial classification, but most Census demographers say Latinos aren't a race, but a culture based on language, national origin and the Spanish legacy in Latin America. The majority of Hispanics are of European-American Indian-African descent, though some Asian (Sinitic or Malay) and Moroccan Arab genes in the historic Spanish empire. Now the Jewish imprint in Mexico and Latin America is a part of the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polyglot.html" title="Polyglot">polyglot</a> diversity of ethnic origins in these countries. Each national Jewish group has a somewhat different history and their cultures aren't entirely uniform. It's been said the American Jewish community had good relations with Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans in the U.S. and in Florida, the Cuban refugees. However, there is considerable friction between Jewish and Hispanic communities does not get well publicized in the media. Some of these stereotypical claims of American Jews are "Liberal, Multi-cultural, urbanite, third world allies" that aid and defend African-Americans (i.e the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Defamation_League_5083.html" title="Anti-Defamation League">Anti-Defamation League</a> and the B'Nai Brith), Women's rights or feminist groups, and the P.C. left activism of homosexual/gay rights "have many Jewish members" are exaggerations of American Jews wanted to ignite rebellion among minorities. Is it because those claims come from the fact Jewish Americans are self-defensive or at one time, Jewish people in most countries except for Israel, are political minorities? --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_D_26_ad8d.html" title="User:Mike D 26">Mike D 26</a> 09:56, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It seems that is a standard since is that really the MOST defining attribute of the individual? Jewish decent/parents is fine to mention further into the article but I would like comment. I have edited a few famous Jewish Bios and would like to hear more on the subject. The few articles that do use the term in the first line seem to have been started that way.

<p><i>However, it is much more common for intermarried families to raise their children as Jewish in areas with high Jewish populations, like New York City/Long Island/New Jersey/Westchester County, New York, Los Angeles, Detroit, Philadelphia, Baltimore-Washington, Chicago, and Cleveland (which has the highest Jewish-American population per capita for smaller, major U.S. cities). Detroit stands out in particular, because the Jewish population is particularly concentrated in suburban Oakland County.</i></p>
<p>What exactly makes Detroit different in this regard? Are the Jewish populations of the other metropolitan areas more dispersed? Are intermarried families in the Detroit area particularly likely to raise their kids as Jewish?</p>

<dd>Isn't it "off topic" as well? Again, we're discussing the Jewish people, their religion and their communities, especially in the United States. The majority of world "Jewry" (sometimes a term can be used, but it's archaic and not P.C. to some) are white or European, because the major concentration of Jews and Judaism was in Europe for 2,000 years. Then the Jews of Arabia, Iran and Africa became a different ethnic group and the historical pattern is not alike European Jews. There are Jews across the middle east longer than the diaspora in Europe and in Israel, the European Jewish residents used to view them a different "race" or not the same culture. Don't forget one convert to Judaism has mainly a different ethnic background, then the term "Jewish" will apply to all persons whom practice the Jewish faith, no matter what race or color they are. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_D_26_ad8d.html" title="User:Mike D 26">Mike D 26</a> 21:37, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the United States, "white" does not necessarily mean "European." The U.S. Census Bureau definites people of "white or Caucasian" ancestry as descending from the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East or North Africa. Being of (ancient) Middle Eastern descent, Americans of Jewish ancestry are therefore white. 24.192.17.34 23:03, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, it's quite likely that the US <i>does</i> have more people who are halakhically Jewish than does Israel, but the vast majority who aren't counted in the guesstimates for the US Jewish population, don't really care whether they're counted or not, whether they're Jewish or not, what country has the most Jews, etc...while in Israel, politically and religiously, it's a really big deal to know which country has the most Jews, when Israel reaches/d that point, and even more importantly, when Israel will become home to over ½ the world's Jews. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 17:12, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It was once stated the Soviet Union (the historic area before the country ceased to exist in 1991) had the world's largest Jewish population. So far, only a million Jews live in Russia and 550,000 in former Soviet republics. Israel has a more centralized version of Judaism than in the U.S. and the Israeli Jews are more a nationality, but the Israel census said to be a Jew carried ethnic and religious meaning. Was there a law passed in the 1990's said the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Census_2131.html" title="U.S. Census">U.S. Census</a> cannot use religion for demographic purposes?

The U.S. Census does not keep historic census files on religious membership, as much they don't on political affiliation and sexual orientation under legal and ethical grounds. Most demographers may look at religion as a social and cultural phenomenon, but won't care less on if he/she is Jewish, Muslim, Catholic, Buddhist, Baptist or Atheist. That's not what matters, but the numbers in growth or decline may have demographic implications for society and any "new religion" may bring forth cultural change in America. --<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_D_26_ad8d.html" title="User:Mike D 26">Mike D 26</a> 08:39, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems like it is difficult to estimate the Jewish American population. According to this <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-09-10-jewish-study_x.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-09-10-jewish-study_x.htm" rel="nofollow">USA Today</a> article the Jewish American population is 5.2 million, which makes it the second largest. I think it would be fair to say that the Jewish populations in both countries are currently of comparable sizes. In any case the statement in the intro that the Jewish American population is larger than the Israeli by 1 million seems unreasonable. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmirig_ada6.html" title="User:Amirig">Amirig</a> 02:42, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, there are similar paragraphs in <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filipino_American_3604.html" title="Filipino American">Filipino American</a>, for example, and in similar pages on X-Americans (i.e. noting some of the most prominant members of the X-American group). I think it's useful to note the most important American Jews in each field (as the lists cover everyone). And really, what more can you say in the entertainment/pop culture section? There isn't a particular "Jewish acting style" that's specific to all Jewish actors. Of course, that section can be expanded - i.e. Jewish American comedy (which probably merits its own article). Also, I'm not sure if we need to say that Monroe was a convert. All that matters is that she was Jewish (how her Jewishness came about isn't that important or relevant, or else we should also say that Kirk Douglas' parents were Beluarsian Jews, while Natalie Portman was born in Israel to an Israeli Jewish father and American Jewish mother, etc., etc.). If we had a section on converts to Judaism in the article, she could or should be mentioned there.

<p>I don't understand this. That's like putting Irish Catholic and Irish Protestant categories. I am of the mind that religion transcends ethnicity, even in Jewish cases (Barry Goldwater &amp; Madeleine Albright were/are both of Ashkenazi/German Jewish origins, but became Episcopalians/English Protestant Christians). Israeli hyphenations should be the only categories (Natalie Portman is a good example), otherwise I think this is some sort of Jewish identification thing for paranoid anti-Semites to look up and confirm their suspicions or something. I think it would be ridiculous to have categories for Christians and Muslims (or any non-Abrahamic faith) as well, even if <a href="../../../n/n/d/NNDB_3de0.html" title="NNDB">NNDB</a> does it. I think that the religious component belongs merely with the biographic articles, in detailing the religious orientation of individuals. BTW, I am religious and not trying to secularize this or anything. I'm a Christian Gentile and recall the New Testament says there is no difference between Jew or Gentile in Christ. Obviously, that was about Judeans/Israelites/Hebrews (Semites, as contrasted with Greek or Roman Japhetites) and not about Jews or Judaism as a religious community in this day and age or as it has been from the Expulsion to the creation of Israel. I think it is patently unfair to Jews to have them scrutinized with categorizes like this. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHasbro_8e7b.html" title="User:Hasbro">Hasbro</a> 11:09, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh great, so let's delete the Jewish categories but keep the African, Irish and Italian-American ones (and by the way, we have categories for every other religion, too). Jewish ethnicity/culture is just as category-worthy as the African, Italian, etc. ones (especially in the increasingly secular world of 2006). It's not their fault that no one came up with separate words for the Jewish religion and the Jewish ethnicity, and personally it always annoys me when people say that the Jewish religion and ethnicity are inseparable.

<p>There is a difference between a Judean/Israeli/Hebrew and Jewish person, the former being ethnic and the latter spiritual. I can choose to convert to Judaism, but that does not make me an ethnic Israelite. Scarlett Johanssen is Danish and Polish, not Israeli (or Judean). To apply it otherwise is anachronistic.

<dd>I really have zero to no interest in getting into this discussion, although the term "Jewish" unquestionably refers to both an ethnic people and a religion, at least in mainstream academia, and as such just as worth categorizing as African-Americans (who haven't been in their "nation" for centuries as well).

<p>I could be Hindu, but that would not make me Indian. I could acculturate to Americanization, but that does not make me American (though I am). You are disinterested, so leave it alone. Ashkenazim means Germans in Hebrew. Johanssen is not Semitic like Saddam Hussein. This Judaic duality is just an example of cultural appropriation.

<p>In order to bring this article in line with the Wikipedia norm, this article should be promptly renamed "Jewish Americans" rather than "American Jews" -- we NEVER speak of the "American French," or the "American Mexicans," or "American Africans," we would always say "French Americans," "Mexican Americans," or "African Americans," and this is the same with the Jews (except in this article); it's obvious that this article's title should be "Jewish Americans." You <i>could</i> make a case for "American Indians," but the default phrase is now "Native Americans." Again, ALL of the other American ethnic/religious group articles on Wikipedia begin with the specific ethno-national prefix (Norwegian, Japanese, Russian, etc.) followed by "American," as in "Norwegian American," "Japanese American," etc. Why is this article's title different from all the rest? There is absolutely no reason that it should be, so I call for a prompt redirect to what the article's name should be, with the very slightly revised head-sentence to reflect the article name change: "<i>Jewish Americans</i>, also commonly <i>American Jews</i>, are Americans who maintain an active connection to the Jewish community in the United States or abroad..." [italics mine; these are the only phrases that need switching]. I know it seems like I'm splitting hairs here, but it's quite obvious that this article's title should be brought in line with the titles of the other articles dealing with ethnic and/or religious groups in the U.S. per Wikipedia norms. Need further proof? There is no "Category:American Jews" -- but there is a "Category:Jewish Americans." --172.135.146.35 13:49, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Where is this "Wikipedia norm" written down? The first sentence must conform with the title, and American Jew is more common than Jewish American. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 14:32, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Most would beg to differ that "American Jew" is 'more common' than "Jewish American." 'More common' where? Amongst whom? In what time(s)? Anyhow, just a quick glance at "Category:European Americans" or "Category:Ethnic groups in the United States" will show you that, per Wikipedia norms/policy, that the ethnic (and/or religious) prefix comes BEFORE the stated nationality or ethnic group, i.e. "African American" rather than "American African." I already went over this in my above comment, and you know exactly what I mean. Here's a simple comparison if you <i>still</i> do not understand what I am saying:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_Americans_7296.html" title="Iranian Americans">Iranian Americans</a>, not American Iranians</li>
<li><a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_Americans_fbee.html" title="Italian Americans">Italian Americans</a>, not American Italians</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Americans_95f7.html" title="German Americans">German Americans</a>, not American Germans</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/u/s/Russian_American_9778.html" title="Russian American">Russian Americans</a>, not American Russians</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/f/r/African_Americans_0672.html" title="African Americans">African Americans</a>, not <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Africans_76aa.html" title="American Africans">American Africans</a>
<ul>
<li>One could easily subdivide this further, i.e. it would be <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigerian_American_5551.html" title="Nigerian American">Nigerian Americans</a>, not American Nigerians</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consequently, in line with ALL of the rest, it should obviously be <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_American_e82f.html" title="Jewish American">Jewish Americans</a>, not American Jews</li>
</ul>
<p>Like I said, just browse "Category:European Americans" or "Category:Middle Eastern Americans" and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. I have a feeling that you already do. Why so stubborn? Not to mention that all of the article titles included on the page <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_Americans_450a.html" title="List of Jewish Americans">List of Jewish Americans</a> are "Jewish American," not "American Jews" such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_American_poets_c9ff.html" title="List of Jewish American poets">List of Jewish American poets</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_American_athletes_e24a.html" title="List of Jewish American athletes">List of Jewish American athletes</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_American_economists_78fa.html" title="List of Jewish American economists">List of Jewish American economists</a>, and so forth. We have no article entitled List of American Jewish poets, now do we?</p>
<p>This should be no different for Jewish Americans, though for some reason it currently is with this article. We also speak of <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_American_literature_a3f1.html" title="Jewish American literature">Jewish American literature</a>, not "American Jewish literature," and so on and so forth. I am just pointing out this glaring error in the hopes that someone will change this article's title to reflect overall Wikipedia article naming norms/policy. If I remember correctly, "Category:American Jews" was even deleted in favor of "Category:Jewish Americans" (per norms/policy, to bring it in line with the other categories), so I'm not sure why this article remains incorrectly titled as it is. Come on now: this is a silly argument 'cause you know I'm right on this! &#160;;) --172.135.146.35 15:15, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not at all -- ethnicity IS still often tied up with national origin, but this is not often the same with Jews because they have failed to ethnically assimilate in whatever societies they have lived in. For instance, Albert Einstein was a German Jew (he was a citizen of Germany that was not an 'ethnic German' but was ethnically Jewish) that eventually became a Swiss citizen and later an American citizen (and almost an Israeli) -- this would have made him a Jewish-German-Swiss-American. Jewish regards his <i>ethnicity</i>; German and Swiss refers to his national origin(s); and American refers to his eventual national origin. For a Gentile it is much simpler; for instance, the German scientist Wernher von Braun was born in Germany; thus, in the modern world, his ethnicity AND national origin (nationality) are regarded as simply German. Von Braun's nationality later changed to "German-American" when he went to the U.S., but his ethnicity (German) did not. --172.162.34.129 00:10, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are either totally clueless or this was a simple and honest mistake -- you are forgetting about the 'S' at the end of the phrases!</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For instance, if you search for "American JewS" (with the S) you do indeed get around 900,000 hits on Google. But if you search for "American Jew" (sans the S) you only get 263,000. However, if you search for "Jewish American" (sans the S) you get about 980,000 hits, which is more than your 900,000. Searching for "Jewish AmericanS" (with the S) you get about 225,000, as you say. So there is no "4 times as common" like you claim when you take in to account the singular PLUS the plural, both of which surely deserve to be counted.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Thus, according to your (flawed) 'Google formula,' if you add up both singular and plural versions, the "Jewish American" duo (singular + plural) has more hits than your "American Jew" duo (singular + plural). Plus, many of the sites that use the "American Jew" duo are highly unofficial and entirely colloquial (many of them are antisemitic as well, since 'Jew' rather than 'Jewish' is more common usage amongst antisemites). The most common, official, academic, and prominent sources almost always use "Jewish Americans" (or "Jewish American") rather than "American Jews" (or "American Jew"). Plus, these search results numbers are constantly fluctuating, they change day to day; but when you add it up, if you are counting both singular and plural versions of the phrase "Jewish American," it has more search results and is the more official usage.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, no one can tell me, if "American Jews" is indeed more proper than "Jewish Americans," why do we have "Category:Jewish Americans" rather than "Category:American Jews," and why are virtually all of the lists located at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_American_Jews_106c.html" title="Lists of American Jews">Lists of American Jews</a> (formerly <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_Americans_450a.html" title="List of Jewish Americans">List of Jewish Americans</a>) entitled "List of Jewish American WHATEVER," not "List of American Jewish WHATEVER"? Also, shouldn't this article's title be streamlined with all of the other ethnic/national groups found all over Wikipedia as mentioned above? This is my main reason for asking for the change to be implemented. --172.162.34.129 00:10, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It looks to me like the overall usages (singular + plural) are fairly similar, then, at least according to the Google search.

<dd>I don't need a 'wider audience,' I need you administrators to bring this article's title in line with Wikipedia norms as it should be.

Again, this article's title was only recently changed, "Jewish American(s)" is the preferred usage amongst scholars and in the mainstream, and it should be streamlined with all of the other articles representing various ethnicities, religions, and nationalities (which is "WHATEVER American," not "American WHATEVER"). --172.161.39.71 23:17, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>It should most certainly be Jewish Americans over American Jews -- if you look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_American_Jews_106c.html" title="Lists of American Jews">Lists of Jewish Americans</a> nearly ALL of those articles remain from when "Jewish American" the the accepted usage here on Wikipedia, i.e. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_American_poets_c9ff.html" title="List of Jewish American poets">List of Jewish American poets</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_American_authors_3694.html" title="List of Jewish American authors">List of Jewish American authors</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_American_composers_dcd5.html" title="List of Jewish American composers">List of Jewish American composers</a>, and so forth: again, this is nearly ALL of them. Also, "Category:American Jews" was deleted in favour of "Category:Jewish Americans," so why the difference in article title vs. category? I'm not sure how this was changed, because it seems that "Jewish American(s)" was correctly the norm until about 1.5 years ago, when it was abruptly changed to "American Jews." However, the people that changed it didn't bother to go back and change all of the references to "Jewish Americans" found everywhere else throughout Wikipedia, including in <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Americans_024b.html" title="Jewish Americans">the actual article itself</a>! --<a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWassermannNYC_d58e.html" title="User:WassermannNYC">WassermannNYC</a> 13:44, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are actually good reasons why the adjectives applied to individuals are different from the collective name for the group. It makes most sense to talk about American Jews <i>as a group</i> in terms of the Jewish diaspora, but for the great majority of Jewish Americans it makes most sense to speak of them in the national context.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 20:58, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Seems to me that there is no need in <i>this</i> article to address this controversy, or even to define "American Jews," whose meaning is just the intersection of the meanings of "American" and "Jew."

<dd>I agree. It's obviously not sourced, and its validity depends on your definition of "ethnic group" (does German background count?) A fact tag, as someone suggested, is an inadequate substitute for verifiable sources. I'm sure this list was created with the best of intentions, but it seems kind of ominous to me like someone is keeping track of Jewish penetration into the higher ed system. Either way it comes off as either unfriendly ethnic boasting, or as antisemitic surveillance.

<p>I've noticed on the right hand corner the recent jewish-american box that's been added. what is your opininon of this? the box format is mainly used on wiki, when dealing with specific ethnic groups in america i.e black,asian,irish. I don't beleive any other american religious group has this (although if considering jews to be an ethnic group its somewhat understandable). do you think the religion section of the box seems confusing? when it lists "jewish religions" muslim ,hindu ,budhism etc. by having the box here it seems to be making the statement that american jews are as much a pure ethnic group as a religion, is that a fair assesment? <a href="../../../d/u/h/User%7EDuhon_c0b1.html" title="User:Duhon">Duhon</a> 06:20, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Jews as a whole are an ethnic group, but in my opinion <i>American Jews</i> are not, and the same goes for most other hyphenated American groups. The reason is that they don't really have a specific culture of their own; they're just defined as all people of X ethnicity living in a country. I don't think groups like that should have an ethnic infobox. Of course, some American groups <i>do</i> have a specific culture: African Americans, Cajuns, Native American groups, etc.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 08:39, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good catch. There are those who think that whose crotch the doctor rips you out of makes you Jewish or non-Jewish, end of story. I'm going to remove the field from the box, hopefully so the edit warring stays confined to <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Who is a Jew?</a>, and we can keep the box which makes the page nicer to look at and more informative.

<dd>Well, there is a New York-centric Yiddish-derived culture that many American Jews are identified with — but this is not a definition of <i>American Jews</i> and very many Jews in the US have different origins. Interestingly, there seems to be a common term for this cultural milieu in French, "juif new-yorkais", but not in English.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 21:24, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For the same reason I think most other hyphenated American groups don't really have a specific culture — because the definition of the group is not cultural <i>per se</i>, it's geographic. A new immigrant to the US can be fully considered to belong to the category <i>American Jews</i>, without having any broader connection to specific Jewish traditions in the country. I realize of course this is sort of a broad point applicable to many articles, that many shades of gray in definition exist, and indeed that this discussion really belongs on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Ethnic_groups_221f.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Ethnic groups">Wikipedia:WikiProject Ethnic groups</a>. Still, it does seem very strange to me to see Americans Jews and similar groups with ethnic group infoboxes, when they're not really about "an ethnic group", but about an ethnic group in a particular geography.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 23:37, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You don't have to worry because the infobox doesn't actually say that American Jews are an "ethnic group". This can still be a nice article without worrying about all these questions. <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHaber_f4d1.html" title="User:Haber">Haber</a> 00:03, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please balance the photo collage by gender, representing men and women equally (2 men &amp; 2 women). Also, make sure to alphabetize the pictures by last name in order to avoid undue preference and bias. FInally, while Einstein was technically a Jewish-American, wouldn't it be better to pic a Jew who was/is American-born?
