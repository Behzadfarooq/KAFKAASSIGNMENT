<p>The <b>American Old West</b> is comprised of the myths, legends, stories, and beliefs, many of which are true, that collected around the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_United_States_afd6.html" title="Western United States">Western United States</a> from 1865 to 1890.</p>
<p>As the setting for numerous works of <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fiction.html" title="Fiction">fiction</a>, the period and region quickly became so popular that it now defines its own <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genre.html" title="Genre">genre</a>, the "<a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_%28genre%29.html" title="Western (genre)">Western</a>." These works often put forth a romanticized portrayal of the era characterized by isolated outbreaks of violence, but they have also promoted interest in its true <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">history</a>. <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_revisionism.html" title="Historical revisionism">Historical revisionism</a> has noted that certain interests (notably cowboys, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States_7838.html" title="Native Americans in the United States">Indians</a>, businessmen, and the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_government_6d14.html" title="United States government">United States government</a>) repeatedly clashed in these conflicts, and a few accounts refer to them as a "western civil war of incorporation" that established United States authority over the region. Though the Old West is often seen as being unusually violent, some argue that the Old West was "a far more civilized, more peaceful and safer place than American society today."<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>While the <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_United_States_f22b.html" title="Eastern United States">Eastern United States</a> was beginning to experience the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Industrial_Revolution_0522.html" title="Second Industrial Revolution">Second Industrial Revolution</a> (which started around 1871), the frontier was beginning to fill up with people. In the early days of the wild west, a great deal of the land was in the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_domain_%28land%29.html" title="Public domain (land)">public domain</a>, open both to <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livestock.html" title="Livestock">livestock</a> raising as <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_range.html" title="Open range">open range</a> and to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homesteading.html" title="Homesteading">homesteading</a>. Throughout much of the Old West, there was little to no local law enforcement, and the military had only concentrated presence at specific locations. <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Bison_0196.html" title="American Bison">Buffalo</a> hunters, railroad workers, drifters and soldiers scrapped and fought, leading to the shootings where men died "with their boots on."</p>
<p>In the towns, state houses, dance halls and saloons catered to the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> cattle drive trade. The historic <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chisholm_Trail_a98b.html" title="Chisholm Trail">Chisholm Trail</a> was used for cattle drives. The trail ran for 800 miles (1,290 km) from south Texas to <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abilene%2C_Kansas_9a61.html" title="Abilene, Kansas">Abilene, Kansas</a>, and was used from 1867 to 1887 to drive cattle northward to the railhead of the Kansas Pacific Railway, where they were shipped eastward. <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cattle_rustling.html" title="Cattle rustling">Cattle rustling</a> was a sometimes serious offense and was always a hazard for the expeditions. It could result in the rustler's lynching by vigilantes (but most stories of this type are fictional). <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexican</a> rustlers were a major issue during the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, with the Mexican government being accused of supporting the habit.

<p>Fort Dodge, <a href="../../../k/a/n/Kansas.html" title="Kansas">Kansas</a>, was established in 1859 and opened in 1865 on the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Fe_Trail_357c.html" title="Santa Fe Trail">Santa Fe Trail</a> near the present site of <a href="../../../d/o/d/Dodge_City%2C_Kansas_24f1.html" title="Dodge City, Kansas">Dodge City, Kansas</a> (which was established in June 1872). The fort offered some protection to wagon trains and the U.S. mail service, and it served as a supply base for troops engaged in the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_Wars_328a.html" title="Indian Wars">Indian Wars</a>. By the end of 1872, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad crossed Kansas. Dodge City acquired its infamous legacy of lawlessness and gun-slinging and its infamous burial place — <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boot_Hill_04bd.html" title="Boot Hill">Boot Hill Cemetery</a>. It was used until 1878. Dodge City was the buffalo capital until mass slaughter destroyed the huge herds and left the prairie littered with decaying carcasses. Law and order came into Dodge City with such law officers as <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bat_Masterson_1d4a.html" title="Bat Masterson">W. B. 'Bat' Masterson</a>, Ed Masterson, <a href="../../../w/y/a/Wyatt_Earp_5f3f.html" title="Wyatt Earp">Wyatt Earp</a>, Bill Tilghman, H. B. 'Ham' Bell and Charlie Bassett. The city passed an ordinance that guns could not be worn or carried north of the "deadline," which was the railroad tracks. The south side was not as well regulated. Fort Dodge was closed in 1882 and a January 1886 blizzard ended the cattle drives there.</p>

<p>After the Civil War, <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_Bill_Hickok_a293.html" title="Wild Bill Hickok">Wild Bill Hickok</a> became an army scout and a professional gambler. Hickok's killing of Whistler the Peacemaker with a long range rifle shot had influence in preventing the <a href="../../../s/i/o/Sioux.html" title="Sioux">Sioux</a> from uniting to resist the settler incursions into the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Hills_3670.html" title="Black Hills">Black Hills</a>. In 1876, <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calamity_Jane_b3af.html" title="Calamity Jane">Calamity Jane</a> settled in the area of <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deadwood%2C_South_Dakota_cb28.html" title="Deadwood, South Dakota">Deadwood, South Dakota</a>, in the Black Hills region where she was close friends with Wild Bill Hickok and Charlie Utter, all having traveled in Utter's wagon train. Jane later claimed to have been married to Hickok and that Hickok was the father of her child; however, this story is viewed with skepticism.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_2.html" title="August 2">August 2</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/7/1876.html" title="1876">1876</a>, while playing poker in Deadwood (then part of the Dakota Territory but on Indian land), Hickok could not find an empty seat in the corner where he always sat in order to protect himself against sneak attacks from behind, and he instead sat with his back to the door; unfortunately, his previous caution proved wise, since he was shot in the back of the head with a double-action .45 caliber revolver by Jack McCall. The motive for the killing is still debated. It is claimed that, at the time of his death, Hickok held a pair of aces and a pair of eights, with all cards black; this has since been called a "<a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_man%27s_hand.html" title="Dead man's hand">dead man's hand</a>".</p>
<p>In 1876, Jane nursed the victims of a <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallpox.html" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a> epidemic in the Deadwood area. She married Clinton Burke in 1891 after the couple had been living together several years.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_County_War_63c3.html" title="Lincoln County War">Lincoln County War</a> (1877) was a conflict between two entrenched factions in the Old West. The "war" was between a faction led by wealthy ranchers and another faction led by the wealthy owners of the monopolistic general store in <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_County%2C_New_Mexico_d8d1.html" title="Lincoln County, New Mexico">Lincoln County, New Mexico</a>.</p>
<p>A notable combatant on the side of the ranchers was <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_the_Kid_ccc3.html" title="Billy the Kid">Billy the Kid</a>, the infamous 19th century American frontier outlaw and murderer. The Kid is reputed to have killed 21 men, one for each year of his life, but the figure is probably closer to nine (four on his own and five with the help of others).</p>

<p>The criminal <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesse_James_%28outlaw%29_ce42.html" title="Jesse James (outlaw)">Jesse James</a> was infamous for his activities in the Old West, though he was often cast by the sensationalist media of the time as a contemporary <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Hood_a190.html" title="Robin Hood">Robin Hood</a>. James and his compatriots robbed their way across the Western frontier targeting banks, trains, stagecoaches, and stores from <a href="../../../i/o/w/Iowa.html" title="Iowa">Iowa</a> to Texas. Eluding even the <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinkerton_National_Detective_Agency_cc8a.html" title="Pinkerton National Detective Agency">Pinkerton National Detective Agency</a>, the gang took thousands of dollars.

While James did harass railroad executives who unjustly seized private land for the railways, modern biographers note that he did so for personal gain — his humanitarian acts were more fiction than fact.</p>

After threats from the cowboy's friends, Baca took refuge in the house of Geronimo Armijo. A standoff with the cowboys ensued, and a gang of 80 cowhands attacked the house.</p>
<p>The story has it that the cowboys fired more than 4,000 rounds into the house; not one of the rounds hit Baca. During the siege Baca killed four of the attackers and wounded eight others. After 36 hours, the attack ended when the cowboys ran out of ammunition. Baca walked out of the house unharmed. In May 1885, Baca was charged with the murder of one of the cowboys who had attacked the cabin, and he was jailed until his trial for murder. In August 1885, he was acquitted after the door of Armijo’s house was entered as evidence. It had over 400 bullet holes in it.</p>

<p>While the Western has been popular throughout the history of movies, it has begun to diminish in importance as the United States progresses farther away from the period depicted. The western film genre often portrays idealized themes, such as the conquest of the wilderness and the subordination of nature (usually in the name of civilization) or the confiscation of the territorial rights of Native Americans.</p>

<p>A sub-genre of Western film, referred to as <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spaghetti_western.html" title="Spaghetti western">Spaghetti westerns</a>, emerged in the mid-1960s. Spaghetti Westerns are so named because most of them were made in Europe, especially Italy. The Spaghetti Western removed many conventions of earlier Western films because of cultural differences and generally lower budgets. Typically, the cast and crew of Spaghetti Westerns hailed from the countries that were producing the film (such as Italy or Spain). Because of this, when Spaghetti Westerns were shown in the United States, they required large voice-overs for much of the cast. Poor lip-synching became synonymous of Spaghetti Westerns. However, American actors often took the lead roles in these films in order to boost publicity. Some well known actors who appeared in Spaghetti Westerns include <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clint_Eastwood_469b.html" title="Clint Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Fonda_b169.html" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>, <a href="../../../y/u/l/Yul_Brynner_657f.html" title="Yul Brynner">Yul Brynner</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Coburn_2a2a.html" title="James Coburn">James Coburn</a>, and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Bronson_60a3.html" title="Charles Bronson">Charles Bronson</a>.</p>
<p>Western movie locations usually form the backdrop that identifies the genre. <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Mix_5136.html" title="Tom Mix">Tom Mix</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hopalong_Cassidy_e652.html" title="Hopalong Cassidy">Hopalong Cassidy</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Autry_ed56.html" title="Gene Autry">Gene Autry</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lone_Ranger_44e9.html" title="The Lone Ranger">The Lone Ranger</a> films were usually shot near <a href="../../../l/o/n/Lone_Pine%2C_California_394e.html" title="Lone Pine, California">Lone Pine, California</a>, where since the early 1920s, over 300 movies have been filmed.

<p>While many Westerns were filmed in California and Arizona, most of them depicted Texas. This was done consistently, despite the fact that the landscapes of Arizona and California have distinguishing traits that make them very different from Texas. For example, the famous Saguaro cactus, with its characteristic "arms", is found only in the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonoran_Desert_48c2.html" title="Sonoran Desert">Sonoran Desert</a> of southern Arizona and Mexico. Also, many westerns set in Texas show landscapes with <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joshua_tree.html" title="Joshua tree">Joshua trees</a> in the background. Joshua trees only grow in California and Arizona.</p>
<p>Western films, until recent times, were loaded with anachronisms, especially in such things as firearms, with <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winchester_rifle.html" title="Winchester rifle">Winchester</a> 1892-model rifles being used in movies set in the 1870s. One reason for this was that many actors portraying cowboys in cheaply-made, early films were hired with their own horses and gear. The Model 92 was far more popular in the early 20th century than were earlier repeating and single-shot rifles which would have been more appropriate, and this is what they brought to the set. A few moviemakers preferred accuracy and realism, but until audiences began to demand this in the late 1960s, the Winchester 92 was the rifle of choice in <a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinema_of_the_United_States_4fa8.html" title="Cinema of the United States">Hollywood</a>, and the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colt%27s_Manufacturing_Company_2a31.html" title="Colt's Manufacturing Company">Colt</a> Single Action Army-type revolver is known worldwide as the "cowboy pistol," despite the fact that the vast majority of revolvers carried in the Old West were of the cap-and-ball type.

These include <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television_series.html" title="Television series">television series</a> <i><a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefly_%28TV_series%29_5a5c.html" title="Firefly (TV series)">Firefly</a></i> and its movie sequel <i><a href="../../../s/e/r/Serenity_%28film%29.html" title="Serenity (film)">Serenity</a></i>, along with the <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serenity_%28role-playing_game%29.html" title="Serenity (role-playing game)">role-playing game</a> <i><a href="../../../d/e/a/Deadlands.html" title="Deadlands">Deadlands</a></i>, the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Tower_f3cc.html" title="Dark Tower">Dark Tower</a> fiction series by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_King_bf4f.html" title="Stephen King">Stephen King</a>, and the video game series <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_Arms_f31b.html" title="Wild Arms">Wild Arms</a>. However, because the definition of a "<i>Western</i>" is somewhat ambiguous, it can be difficult to define what does and does not include western elements. Some works, such as <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a> television series <i><a href="../../../c/o/w/Cowboy_Bebop_0f4a.html" title="Cowboy Bebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></i>, and <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">role-playing game</a> <i><a href="../../../d/e/a/Deadlands.html" title="Deadlands">Deadlands</a></i> have been noted by fans as having elements similar to those in Westerns, though such claims have generally not been substantiated by their creators.</p>
<p>It is a common misconception that <a href="../../../a/k/i/Akira_Kurosawa_899a.html" title="Akira Kurosawa">Akira Kurosawa's</a> film <i><a href="../../../y/o/j/Yojimbo_%28film%29.html" title="Yojimbo (film)">Yojimbo</a></i> was influenced by certain spaghetti westerns, though quite the reverse is true. <i>Yojimbo</i> is influenced most directly by the works of <a href="../../../d/a/s/Dashiell_Hammett_c287.html" title="Dashiell Hammett">Dashiell Hammett</a>. <i><a href="../../../a/_/f/A_Fistful_of_Dollars_5e3a.html" title="A Fistful of Dollars">A Fistful of Dollars</a></i>, starring <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clint_Eastwood_469b.html" title="Clint Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>, was a remake of <i>Yojimbo</i> in a western setting; this was not credited until Kurosawa sued the filmmakers. Similarly, Kurosawa's <i><a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Samurai_5852.html" title="Seven Samurai">Seven Samurai</a>,</i> became <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Magnificent_Seven_70d0.html" title="The Magnificent Seven">The Magnificent Seven</a>.</i></p>
<p>In a mix of Western and modern societies, the 1950s radio and television series <i><a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky_King_40bb.html" title="Sky King">Sky King</a></i> covered the exploits of "America's favorite flying cowboy." Skyler King, who owned the Flying Crown Ranch, his niece Penny, nephew Clipper, and various townspeople of Grover City, Arizona, lived in the post-<a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> transitional period of the American West, and dressed in the appropriate Western garb of the time. In some episodes, Sky was shown using his airplane, <i>Songbird,</i> to perform some ranch chore. Sky generally did not wear a pistol but kept one in his plane, and when needed would take a long gun from the rack near the door to his home. The series plots were generally some form of the classic Western theme of "making the wrong things right."</p>
<p>Some "Westerns" are not set in the West at all (such as most of those involving riverboats, which were rare west of the Missouri River), or even in North America. The 1990 film <i>Quigley Down Under</i> is the tale of a cowboy who goes to <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. Though not set in the American West, <a href="../../../m/g/m/MGM_7545.html" title="MGM">MGM</a> includes this in their "Western Legends" line of videos.</p>
