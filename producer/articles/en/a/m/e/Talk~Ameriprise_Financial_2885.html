<p>Hello. It seems that there's a struggle between two POVs here. You all should be discussing things here on the article's talk page, but the above commentary borders on a violation of the <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">No Personal Attacks</a> policy. Keep things civil and try to reach a consensus that everyone can be satisfied with instead of just edit warring.

<p>I removed the sentence that was referenced with that source. The URL listed led to a search page. When you click on search you're brought to this <a href="http://pdpi.nasdr.com/PDPI/" class="external text" title="http://pdpi.nasdr.com/PDPI/" rel="nofollow">Terms and Conditions page</a> that says:</p>

<p>The information provided through the NASD BrokerCheck shall be used ONLY for your own personal or professional use, and in accordance with all other terms and conditions of this Agreement:</p>

<li>to assist you, your clients or your organization in determining whether to conduct or continue to conduct securities or commodities business with NASD member firms or their associated persons;</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose the third point <i>might</i> be applied to use on Wikipedia, but I'm not sure about it.</p>
<p>Once you accept the agreement, and then search for Ameriprise, you're brought to a page where you can click on a link where you have to fill out your full contact information (name &amp; street address required in addition to email), and they say they <i><b>maybe</b></i> will mail you something in a couple of business days.</p>
<p>To me, it seems like way too much to go through for one tiny sentence that adds very little to the article. That sentence needs to be left out until a better citation can be found. —<a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElipongo_843a.html" title="User:Elipongo">Elipongo</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EElipongo_d80a.html" title="User talk:Elipongo">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Elipongo_25d6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Elipongo">contribs</a>)</sup> 19:42, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The word "maybe" is directly from the website and is their own emphasis, I did not add it. Look on the left column of the page before you click the envelope at the top of the page. Also, I have a problem with giving them my full name, address, etc. while I could arguably be violating their terms &amp; conditions by using the information for other than my personal use. The argument could be made that use on Wikipedia could be justified by the third point, <i>"for non-commercial purposes consistent with the promotion of just and equitable principles of trade and the protection of investors and the public interest."</i>, however my opinion is that since under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> Wikipedia material <b>can</b> be re-used for commercial purposes we wouldn't be in adherence with that clause. I don't mind going to look something up in a library, if you can't find an online reference, however this one is too much for too little, in my humble opinion. As for your accusation of my ignorance, I suggest that you read the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> policy. Also, please sign your posts by using four tildes {~~~~) so people can know with whom they are conversing.

<p>You are wrong. The 'maybe' refers to disclosure events - that 'maybe' the firm has disclosure events. Not that 'maybe' you will receive a report. Did you click on 'maybe'? If you do you will see that you are taken to a page that explains "Disclosure Events Disclosure information MAY exist for this brokerage firm."</p>
<p>That YOU don't want to give your name and address to NASD is meaningless in this context. I would hope Wikipedia is not based on your personal opinions. Or are you Jimbo Wales? The bottom line is that the material is highly relevant to Ameriprise and the material is verifiable and from a highly reliable source.</p>
<p>Again, please do the right thing and put back what you have deleted.</p>
<p>And again, if you think that having 36 regulatory actions against a firm is not important, then you have no understanding of what is happening in the investment industry and the importance of checking into firms before using them.

<dl>
<dd>You are correct about the maybe, however it is indeed poorly phrased on the page; but of course these are stock regulators, not English majors.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would like to hear your rational in terms of the licensing issue. My opinion is that it would be a violation of the NASD's terms and conditions to use the material here on Wikipedia. It's obviously not for our own personal or business use, and the third clause's "non-commercial" language conflicts with Wikipedia's GFDL licensing— articles from Wikipedia can be, and very often are, reproduced for commercial purposes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you have a reliable secondary source, as preferred per <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">Wikipedia:Attribution</a>, I would be happy to cite it and include the material.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the issue of personal attacks, you could very easily have gotten your point across by writing, <i>"People need to understand what is happening in the investment industry and the importance of checking into firms before using them."</i>, rather than aiming the statement specifically at me. That does indeed make it a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, but don't worry— I'm not angry. You should, however, be more careful in the future because other editors are not so patient as myself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, my response to the statement about checking into companies is that I most certainly agree. But I would add that anyone who makes investment decisions based upon an encyclopedia article pretty much deserves whatever they get.<a href="../../../s/f/r/Image%7ESFriendly.gif_0945.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/5/58/SFriendly.gif/19px-SFriendly.gif" alt="" width="19" height="19" longdesc="../../../s/f/r/Image%7ESFriendly.gif_0945.html" /></a></dd>

<dd>Licensing: NASD obviously considers the information <i>itself</i> to be proprietary because they make you agree to terms and conditions before you can even search for it, their website won't positively admit whether or not there even <i>are</i> disclosure events for any individual company (only that there maybe disclosure events and that you can get them emailed to you if there are any), and they send the results only to registered users via private email rather than making the results available on their website. They're going through a lot of effort to see that the information itself is not generally available. That's the way it seems to me, but I could be wrong. If you like, I could get a third party to comment, but I'd rather not escalate this if we can settle it amicably here.</dd>

My thoughts are that you should replace what you deleted.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.245.109.64 (<a href="../../../6/6/2E/User_talk%7E66.245.109.64.html" title="User talk:66.245.109.64">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.245.109.64_add5.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.245.109.64">contribs</a>) 04:38, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<dd>Call it what you will, it has nothing whatsoever to do with this article anyway, lets move on and address the issue. I placed a modified statement about NASD usercheck at the foot of the section, are you telling me that it is inadequate? It addresses the point you brought up that people need to check on a company before they invest. My opinion is that the actual number is not only something that will quickly date, but it is also meaningless without context. Without knowing how many actions there are against other companies, having Thirty-six could actually be interpreted as a good thing by some people because it's a relatively low number. Most people do not know what the NASD is or what it does and may interpret regulatory actions in terms of something they understand, like lawsuits, which any company of size has hundreds going on at any time. This, plus the fact the information is difficult to obtain, difficult to cite properly (how do you cite a private email?), and questionable legally to use make too much for too little, in my opinion.</dd>

<dd>Tell you what though, I'm going to change the language of that last edit to the article to make it a little more specific towards Ameriprise. I'm trying to work with you here, okay?</dd>
