<li>It seems that internet listings of the lyrics of the song are split between whether or not it it says "Columbine" or "Popeye." Listening to the song myself, I initially thought it was Columbine.

<dd>Juvenile, envious, hypocritical, America-hating bigots like to pretend this song makes a complete mockery of everything and anything US (e.g., "Taco Bell makes fun of the US' 'lack of original culture'"--whatever that means). Anyone who has the ability to think critically beyond their counterproductive dogma can see it's a hilarious but semi-serious take on the fact that the United States, for all its faults, is about the only country in the world that has the courage and wherewithal to confront violent tyrants and fascists--even if it requires violence in return. Maybe enough people throughout the rest of the free world will wake up and get with the program some day so that the US won't have to keep carrying the burden of being the world's only responsible 'parent'. Imagine your world under Taliban hegemony, take a listen to this song, then and ask yourself who exactly it is you're rooting for.</dd>

<p>More Commentary from User MKelly1993 moved from article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Here's my commentary: What does "Lack of original culture" mean (or much of the rest of your entry)? Is this a valid encyclopedia entry? If so, by all means, replace my message. If not, what is it doing here?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Before writing this entry for the very serious topic of discussing "America, Fuck Yeah", did you consult the authors of the song? If so, did they agree with your "intellectual analysis" of their song? If not, why are you replacing my "commentary" with your commentary and then directing me to use the "commentary" page?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't like people who parade under the facade of intellectualism to promote primitive bigotry. Is your "encyclopedia entry" nothing more than a screed against the United States of America? Unlike the song "America, Fuck Yeah", it seems to be little more than that. Until I get the sense that you're actually interested in fact over slanted op/ed articles, why should I respect the so-called rules for posting "commentary" under one designated section, while you monopolize the official "encyclopedia" area for your ridiculous and arrogant (not to mention bigoted) commentary?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If this area is reserved for fact-based entries, please point to me what facts reside in your last paragraph (let alone the rest of your article).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Please reserve commentary for the talk page. Thank you. <a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECabiria_de3d.html" title="User:Cabiria">Cabiria</a> 07:55, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey Cabiria,</p>
<p>Perhaps this poster has not seen the movie, wherein the rest of the world (including FAG) align themelves with assholes whose only purpose in life is to shit over everything, while ignoring the arrogant, pompous dicks who not only fuck pussies but also said assholes. Anyone else see the movie? "We're dicks." Readily admitted. But the rest of the world are pussies, who'd rather let assholes shit all over everything that get fucked by dicks. It's a tough choice, but really--look at those countries that have aligned themselves with the US, and look at those who haven't. Whose citizens are better off? Isn't this the point of the movie? Why does no one want to admit this? Seriously--has anyone contacted Matt and Trey to get their perspective on what they produced and what we're discussing here?</p>
<p>In all seriousness, I appreciate your patience with me. But similarly, in all serious, wtf are you thinking with your article? Are you a teenager or something?</p>
<p><br />
I must note that my article keeps getting replaced, without any response to my questions. This only encourages me.</p>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, thank you for moving all commentary to this page, instead of in the article. It makes everything much easier! Secondly, please refrain from personal attacks. You might consider toning down your language when approaching others here. We try to keep it friendly and polite! I did not write this article-I was merely protecting it from obvious commentary in the wrong spot. If you feel the article has clear bias (a topic which many of us struggle with) then please <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">be bold</a> and attempt to write a better, more objective article about this subject. Thanks so much, and good luck. (Don't forget to sign your comments on these pages with the 4 tildes so we can keep the conversation straight!) <a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECabiria_de3d.html" title="User:Cabiria">Cabiria</a> 08:18, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Mkelly1993 08:27, 25 June 2006 (UTC)Four tildes here--hope I'm doing this right. My tone will be reflective of the article I'm reviewing. So long as it's objective, I'll remain so; where it's insulting and ignorant, I have difficulty not responding in kind. That said, I'm definitely ignorant of how things work in this forum, so I apologize for the personal attacks on you, seeing now that you weren't the one personally writing the article. For whomever authored it, however, my commentary still stands. Again, Cabiria, I appreciate your patience with me. And thanks for removing the bigoted garbage at the end of that article.</p>

<dd>I actually added it back in, but I can see how it might be troublesome under Wikipedia's guidelines of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">no original research</a>. However, I prefer to edit and recent change patrol, so I'll let those (like you) who wish to duke it out over article information have at it. Good luck, and check your talk pages- I think another user has left you a good introduction to some of the guidelines we have here, especially the information on <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a>. These guidelines can be confusing, but I'm sure you will do fine. Best of luck! <a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECabiria_de3d.html" title="User:Cabiria">Cabiria</a> 08:34, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mkelly1993 08:50, 25 June 2006 (UTC)You seriously think the other two content-governing policies don't present a bit of trouble as well? "At once, the list mocks American...ignorance,...lack of original culture,...attention span", etc. Verifiable? Unbiased? What about "in a display of stereotypical American pompousness" mentioned earlier in the article? What would be said about an article that said something like, "In a display of stereotypical Muslim proclivity towards violence"? Would that be unbiased? Verifiable? I don’t think I’m doing too well with the confusing guidelines that ensure the objectivity of this online encyclopedia.</p>
<p>I don't mean to be combative; just disappointed with the direction this resource (Wikipedia) has taken.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hi. It's customary to sign posts at the end. With respect to you point about <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotype.html" title="Stereotype">stereotypes</a>, that's exactly right when addressed by a parody. If we were to say that the 9/11 attacks were a "display of stereotypical Muslim proclivity towards violence", that would be biased because that is a real-life event; if we were to say that the actions of Muslims in this movie (or in, e.g. <i><a href="../../../t/r/u/True_Lies_7d0c.html" title="True Lies">True Lies</a></i>) were a "display of stereotypical Muslim proclivity towards violence", that would be an accurate statement about the <i>portrayal</i>. There is a stereotype, and the portrayal invokes it. It may be an unintentional invokation, but it is an objective observation that this movie portrays Americans as using excessive amounts of force to accomplish their goals, while being oblivious or insensitive to the resulting damage and offense. Similarly, the film portrays a group of Americans protesting <i>against</i> Team America, culminating in a fat, drunken American (<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Moore_f401.html" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a>) conducting a <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_bombing.html" title="Suicide bombing">suicide bombing</a> of the Team America headquarters, while still another group of Americans (the FAG members) are easily deceived into forwarding the plans of the chief evildoer. In short, whether the authors <i>intended</i> it or not, the film does lampoon America. The song works in the same vein - it is played in conjunction with the team setting out to engage in the excessive activities portrayed in the film, and lists things which are absurd if posited as points in which we take national pride (slavery, porno, valium, fake tits, wax lips, immigrants), which calls into question the seriousness of other points such as Taco Bell, Wal-Mart, The Gap, etc. Perhaps we should both search for sources that support our respective interpretations. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>bd2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><b>T</b></a> 16:24, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I think it is pretty apparent that the Bed Bath and Beyond part of the song has nothing to do with attention span and everything to do with it being a less "manly" store, hence the lack of enthusiasm at that part.<a href="../../../j/p/e/User%7EJPeetey_b9fa.html" title="User:JPeetey">JPeetey</a> 11:21, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's more of a satire of overly patriotic movie songs, not the United States itself... perhaps some policies, the statement is POV. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYouknowthatoneguy_61fc.html" title="User:Youknowthatoneguy">Youknowthatoneguy</a> 10:51, 10 November 2006 (UTC).</p>

<p>I would characterise this article as stupid. Directionless lists? Unimportant topic? A whole article which could be much better served by a direct link to the content? Wikipedia forever. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaRodman_7cd8.html" title="User:JoshuaRodman">JoshuaRodman</a> 21:13, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I wouldn't call it unimportant, but I don't understand how it's like Randy Newman's <a href="../../../i/_/l/I_Love_L.A._f546.html" title="I Love L.A.">I Love L.A.</a>. I fail to see how countless amounts of people think Newman is making fun of Los Angels simply because he mentions the homeless in one line. Yeah, it's humorous given the rest of the song, but it doesn't suddenly make the song anti-Los Angeles.--<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreepablo_6ec3.html" title="User:Freepablo">Freepablo</a> 05:14, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
