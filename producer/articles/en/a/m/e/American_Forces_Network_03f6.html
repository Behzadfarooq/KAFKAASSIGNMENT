<p>The American Forces Network can trace its origins back to <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>, when the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_War_9516.html" title="United States Department of War">War Department</a> established the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS). A <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> service was first introduced in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1954.html" title="1954">1954</a> with a pilot station at Limestone AFB, Maine and AFRS became the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS). All of the Armed Forces broadcasting affiliates worldwide merged under the AFN banner on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1998.html" title="1998">1998</a>.</p>

<p>In the years just preceding <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> there were several radio stations based in American <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_base.html" title="Military base">military bases</a>, but none were officially recognized until <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>. The success of these individual radio stations helped pave the way for the AFN. As such, there was no single station that could be called the "first" to sign on as an AFN station. About two months before formal establishment of AFN, however, a station called "PCAN" began regular broadcast information service in the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panama_Canal_Zone_aeef.html" title="Panama Canal Zone">Panama Canal Zone</a>, primarily for troops on jungle <a href="../../../b/i/v/Bivouac.html" title="Bivouac">bivouac</a>. The station, located at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Clayton_a0ce.html" title="Fort Clayton">Fort Clayton</a>, was later to become part of AFRS, first simply as "Armed Forces Network" located at Albrook Field.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Forces_Network_03f6.html" title="Edit section: World War II">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">World War II</span></h3>
<p>The U.S. Army began broadcasting from <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> during World War II, using equipment and studio facilities borrowed from the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Broadcasting_Corporation_b1c0.html" title="British Broadcasting Corporation">British Broadcasting Corporation</a> (BBC).</p>
<p>The first transmission to U.S. troops began at 5:45 p.m. on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_4.html" title="July 4">July 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1943.html" title="1943">1943</a> and included less than five hours of recorded shows, a <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_news_4b43.html" title="BBC news">BBC news</a> and sports broadcast. That day, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporal.html" title="Corporal">Corporal</a> Syl Binkin became the first U.S. Military broadcaster heard over the air. The signal was sent from London via telephone lines to five regional <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transmitter.html" title="Transmitter">transmitters</a> to reach U.S. troops in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> as they made preparations for the inevitable <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Overlord_76ce.html" title="Operation Overlord">invasion</a> of Nazi-occupied Europe.</p>
<p>Fearing competition for civilian audiences the BBC initially tried to impose restrictions on AFN broadcasts within Britain (transmissions were only allowed from American Bases outside London and were limited to 50 watts of transmission power) and a minimum quota of British produced programming had to be carried. Nevertheless AFN programmes were widely enjoyed by the British civilian listeners who could receive them and once AFN operations transferred to continental Europe (shortly after D-day) AFN were able to broadcast with little restriction with programmes available to civilian audiences across most of Europe (Including Britain) after dark.</p>
<p>As <a href="../../../d/-/d/D-Day_72ea.html" title="D-Day">D-Day</a> approached, the network joined with the BBC and the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation_65d3.html" title="Canadian Broadcasting Corporation">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a> to develop programs especially for the Allied Expeditionary Forces. Mobile stations, complete with personnel, broadcasting equipment, and a record library were deployed to broadcast music and news to troops in the field. The mobile stations reported on front line activities and fed the news reports back to studio locations in London.</p>
<p>Although the network's administrative headquarters remained in London, its operational headquarters soon moved to AFN <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>.</p>
<p>As Allied forces continued to push German soldiers back into their homeland, AFN moved east as well. The liberation of most of Western Europe saw AFN stations serving the forces liberating <a href="../../../b/i/a/Biarritz.html" title="Biarritz">Biarritz</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannes.html" title="Cannes">Cannes</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Havre_3181.html" title="Le Havre">Le Havre</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marseille.html" title="Marseille">Marseille</a>, <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nice.html" title="Nice">Nice</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, and <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reims.html" title="Reims">Reims</a>.</p>

<p>On <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_31.html" title="December 31">December 31</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/4/1945.html" title="1945">1945</a>, AFN London signed off the air, and in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948.html" title="1948">1948</a> AFN closed all its stations in France. This started the cycle of AFN stations where they would be built up during wartime then torn down or moved after the war was over. Of the 300 stations in operation worldwide in 1945, only 60 remained in <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>.</p>

<p>A large number of AFN stations continued broadcasting from American bases in Europe (particularly Germany) after World war Two (8 remain on-air today. See German Wikipedia: <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Forces_Network#Frequenzen_in_Deutschland_und_Benelux" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Forces_Network#Frequenzen_in_Deutschland_und_Benelux" rel="nofollow">AFN Europe Frequencies</a>) During 1950s and 60's civilian audiences in Europe widely listened to AFN as American music was very popular but rarely played on most European broadcasting stations (which at the time were largely state operated). This was particularly the case in Communist bloc countries where (despite the language barrier) it was seen as an alternative way of maintaining contact with the west and had the added bonus of not being subjected to <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_jamming.html" title="Radio jamming">radio jamming</a> unlike such stations as <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Free_Europe_8fc2.html" title="Radio Free Europe">Radio Free Europe</a> which carried News and propaganda in Eastern European languages.</p>

<p>When war broke out in <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korea.html" title="Korea">Korea</a>, Army broadcasters set up in <a href="../../../s/e/o/Seoul.html" title="Seoul">Seoul</a>, in the Banto Hotel (the old American Embassy Hotel). When the Chinese entered Seoul in December, <a href="../../../1/9/5/1950.html" title="1950">1950</a>, the crew moved to a mobile unit that was just completed and retreated to Daegu, South Korea. Due to the large number of American troops in Korea, a number of stations were also started. Mobile units followed combat units to provide news and entertainment on the radio. By the time the 1953 armistice was signed, these mobile units became buildings with transmitters, and a network, American Forces Korea Network, was born.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Forces_Network_03f6.html" title="Edit section: Vietnam War">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Vietnam War</span></h3>
<p>As the American military presence in <a href="../../../v/i/e/Vietnam.html" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> increased, AFRTS opened radio and later television stations there. During the Vietnam War, the first broadcasts were beamed to the ground from fully equipped <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stratovision.html" title="Stratovision">flying studios</a> operated by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Navy_d2ed.html" title="United States Navy">United States Navy</a>.</p>
<p>AFRTS stations in Vietnam were initially known by the name "AFRS" (Armed Forces Radio Saigon), but as the number of stations quickly expanded throughout <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Vietnam_25cf.html" title="Republic of Vietnam">South Vietnam</a> became known as "AFVN" (American Forces Vietnam Network) and had several stations including <a href="../../../n/h/a/Nha_Trang_1cd6.html" title="Nha Trang">Nha Trang</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/e/Pleiku.html" title="Pleiku">Pleiku</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/_/Da_Nang_aab1.html" title="Da Nang">Da Nang</a>, with the headquarters station in <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saigon.html" title="Saigon">Saigon</a>.</p>
<p>In Vietnam, AFVN had a number of war related casualties. The station staff at Hue had been captured and spent time as <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoners of war</a>. At the height of American involvement in the war, Armed Forces Vietnam Network served over 500,000 fighting men and women at one time.</p>
<p>For Vietnam AFVN developed a program along the lines of "G.I. Jive" from World War II. A number of local <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disc_jockeys.html" title="Disc jockeys">disc jockeys</a> helped make hour-long music programs for broadcast. Perhaps the best known program became the morning "Dawn Buster" program, (the brainchild of Chief Petty Officer Bryant Arbuckle in 1962) thanks to the popularity of the sign-on slogan "Gooooood Morning, Vietnam" (which was initiated by <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrian_Cronauer_732f.html" title="Adrian Cronauer">Adrian Cronauer</a> and later became the basis for the film <i><a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Morning_Vietnam_b478.html" title="Good Morning Vietnam">Good Morning Vietnam</a></i> starring <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Williams_a8f4.html" title="Robin Williams">Robin Williams</a>). Among the notable people who were AFVN disc jockeys were Cronauer and <a href="../../../p/a/t/Pat_Sajak_5a3e.html" title="Pat Sajak">Pat Sajak</a>. Beginning in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> AFVN began to close some stations in Vietnam. The last station to close was in <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saigon.html" title="Saigon">Saigon</a> in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1973.html" title="1973">1973</a>.</p>
<p>In Thailand, the Department of Defense began the planning for the Armed Forces Thailand Network in 1964 with Project Lamplighter. By late 1966, implementation of the network began by the US Air Force with stations on the air at Korat, U-Tapao, Ubon, Udon, Tahkli, and Nahkon Phanom (NKP). In addition, there were more than 20 satellite stations that rebroadcast one or more of the primary stations and that included one or more clandestine locations in Laos.</p>
<p>In April, 1970, a battle damaged F-4 fighter-bomber, returning from a reconnaissance mission to survey a road being built by the Chinese toward Burma in northwest Laos, crashed into the AFTN station, killing nine of the Air Force broadcasters. This incident was the single worst catastrophe in the history of military broadcasting.</p>
<p>AFTN became the American Forces Thailand Network in the summer of 1969, and continued operations until the spring of 1976 when the remaining US troops in Thailand were withdrawn at the request of the Thai government. More than 600 broadcasters from the Air Force, Navy, and Army had served during the ten years that AFTN operated.</p>
<p>The history of AFTN can be found at the <a href="http://www.aftn.net" class="external text" title="http://www.aftn.net" rel="nofollow">www.aftn.net</a> web site along with a memorial to the nine broadcasters who gave their lives in the service of their country.</p>

<p>Radio, and later television, to U.S. troops stationed in the Panama Canal Zone was provided initially by Armed Forces Radio (AFN) at Albrook Field and later as the Caribbean Forces Network at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Clayton_a0ce.html" title="Fort Clayton">Fort Clayton</a> with translators located on the Atlantic side of the Canal Zone.

<p>Broadcasting <i>"from a secret location"</i> in Iraq, radio's <i>"most heavily armed staff"</i> continues the AFN tradition of going where the troops go with AFN-Iraq, Freedom Radio. AFN-Iraq began broadcasting in December of 2003 on the <a href="../../../f/m/_/FM_ff94.html" title="FM">FM</a> band shortly after the fall of <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam.html" title="Saddam">Saddam</a>. The first song on the air was <i>Freedom</i> by <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_c886.html" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>. Within a short period of time, Freedom Radio was broadcasting on multiple FM channels from as far south as Basra to as far north as Mosul.</p>
<p>AFN-Iraq, Freedom Radio began as joint effort between the Air Force, the Marines, and the Army. The very first unit to operate the station was the 222nd Broadcast Operations Detachment, an Army Reserve unit out of Southern California. <i>"Always There and On The Air"</i> was the phrase that started it all, even though there were only 8 hours of live radio to kick things off.</p>
<p>After an introduction from Lt. Gen. <a href="../../../r/i/c/Ricardo_Sanchez_2f20.html" title="Ricardo Sanchez">Ricardo Sanchez</a>, the Commander of Coalition Ground Forces in Iraq, Air Force Master Sergeant Erik Brazones was the first DJ on the air. When the 222nd BOD took the reigns of the radio operations, the first two regular radio shows were "Niki Cage in the morning" and "Abbey in the Afternoon".</p>

<p>While the audience tunes-in to AFN to watch their favorite shows or listen to the latest Stateside hits, entertainment is the "candy coating" used to attract the military viewer/listener; as AFN's primary mission is to provide access for local command information (CI) programs. Spots run in the place of commercials in breaks run the gamut from reminding servicememebers to register to vote, promotions of local command-sponsored recreation events, off-duty educational programs, health and wellness tips, and what's playing at local base movie theaters.</p>
<p>AFN inserts <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_service_announcements.html" title="Public service announcements">public service announcements</a>, educational featurettes (as in presenting an American state capital), and localized messages from senior leadership in place of normal commercials.

<p>Like its radio counterpart, AFN TV tries to air programming from a variety of sources to replicate what is airing on American TV. This means that a lot of programming is sourced from commercial networks and <a href="../../../p/b/s/PBS_66e9.html" title="PBS">PBS</a> at little or no cost. Like in the United States, AFN broadcasts using the <a href="../../../n/t/s/NTSC_4b38.html" title="NTSC">NTSC</a> television standard. Unlike stateside broadcasts however, there are no commercials. Rather than be commercial free AFN produces public service announcements consisting of various military rules and regulations, or otherwise. The most common public service announcements are ones dealing with <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_harrassment.html" title="Sexual harrassment">sexual harrassment</a>, public health &amp; safety, and messages to the troops.</p>
<p>There are 8 TV streams that are produced by AFN. All of them can be picked up via satellite by military audiences. These streams are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>AFN Prime</b>. Formerly AFN Atlantic and AFN Pacific. The standard AFN feed airs current <a href="../../../s/i/t/Sitcom.html" title="Sitcom">sitcoms</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drama.html" title="Drama">dramas</a>, syndicated "judge" shows, <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_show.html" title="Talk show">talk shows</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_show.html" title="Game show">game shows</a>, and <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reality_show.html" title="Reality show">reality shows</a> popular in the United States, with a time delay from 24 hours to a week behind the United States airdates. In addition, popular US <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soap_opera.html" title="Soap opera">soap operas</a> such as <i><a href="../../../g/u/i/Guiding_Light_3221.html" title="Guiding Light">Guiding Light</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Hospital_da91.html" title="General Hospital">General Hospital</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../p/a/s/Passions.html" title="Passions">Passions</a></i> are aired by AFN on a one-week tape delay. This stream is divided into three feeds (<b>AFN Prime Atlantic,</b> <b>AFN Prime Freedom</b> (Middle East), and <b>AFN Prime Pacific</b>); the difference between the three is that they are time-shifted so that programs air later on AFN Prime Pacific then they are on AFN Prime Atlantic, with AFN Freedom in between. Many regional feeds (such as AFN-Europe, AFN-Iraq, and AFN-Korea) are based off of AFN Prime and add local programming to it; thus, in a way, AFN Prime mimics the regular network TV concept.</li>
