<p>The following writer claims the article is "blatantly POV." As one who has done the most writing on the AFL-CIO's foreign policy program over the past 17 years, I would agree: I have a "point of view," and it guides my writing: I am against imperialism in all forms, and against all oppression. As I (and a number of other writers) have documented, again and again, the leadership of the AFL-CIO has been carrying out a foreign policy program out of sight, behind the backs, and against the interests of workers in the US and around the world--and done everything possible to keep US union members from learning about these activities, and have even corrupted what democratic processes that exist within the national labor movement to do so.</p>
<p>Don't take my word for this--read the literature on AFL-CIO foreign operations and make up your own mind. The largest bibliography of material on this subject--including many articles on both sides of the debate, and with many articles downloadable from the Internet--is on my "Contemporary Labor Issues" web site at <a href="http://faculty.pnc.edu/kscipes/LaborBib.htm#AFL-CIO_foreign_operations" class="external free" title="http://faculty.pnc.edu/kscipes/LaborBib.htm#AFL-CIO_foreign_operations" rel="nofollow">http://faculty.pnc.edu/kscipes/LaborBib.htm#AFL-CIO_foreign_operations</a> .</p>
<p>My work is carefully documented, and often has extended references. The three most important articles I have written are each on-line (and listed in the above bibliography), but I would like to draw people's attention to them:</p>
<p>-- "AFL-CIO in Venezuela: Deja Vu All Over Again." Labor Notes, April 1994. On-line at www.labornotes.org/archives/2004/04/articles/e.html . (This details the AFL-CIO's "Solidarity Center's" work in helping to lay the groundwork in Venezuela for the 2002 attempted coup against democratically-elected President Hugo Chavez.)</p>
<p>-- "Labor Imperialism Redux? The AFL-CIO's Foreign Policy Since 1995." Monthly Review, May 2005. On-line at www.monthlyreview.org/0505scipes.htm .</p>
<p>-- "An Unholy Alliance: The AFL-CIO and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) in Venezuela." Z Net, July 2005. On-line at www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?sectionID=19&amp;itemID=8268 . (This especially provides information on the involvement of the AFL-CIO's Solidarity Center as one of four "core institutes"--along with the international wing of the Democratic Party, the international wing of the Republican Party, and the international wing of the US Chamber of Commerce--of the National Endowment for Democracy, a misnamed project started by the Reagan Administration to do the work overtly that the CIA had previously done covertly.)</p>
<p>For more information on the AFL-CIO's Foreign Policy Program, I suggest you check out the Worker to Worker Solidarity Committee's web site at www.workertoworker.net .</p>
<p>And, for the record, in case any one considers me an ideologue, please note that I am a former Sergeant in the US Marine Corps (serving 1969-73, although staying in the States all four years), and am a current member of the National Writers Union, affiliated to the United Auto Workers and the AFL-CIO. (I have also been a member of the Graphic Communications Union, AFL-CIO; the National Education Association; and the American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO.) I currently teach sociology for one of the regional campuses of Purdue University.</p>

<p>The Solidarity Center had a puff piece up here earlier on its work in Haiti. A new article gets to the bottom of their activities in Haiti. This was published by a mainstream labor publication, one of the largest in the United States- Labor Notes.

<p>Dear Dr: I am assuming good faith in that you accidentally deleted my comments, however "page history" is a very useful tool. So... Dr. Scipes, if I may, my orginal arguements followed by a brief rebuttal. Please remember that the talk page, as well as the article itself are not your exclusive right. Posting on wikipedia does not allow you to have hold control over the words you donate. Additionally, I apologize for my intital exicitement/ bold words of my orginal comments, but I am just a recent undergrad, so I haven't completely absorbed the concept of colligellity. My orginal words:</p>
<p>== My orginal arguements== (hold on a moment, will post shortly) <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinejoesmith_907c.html" title="User:Valentinejoesmith">V. Joe</a> 21:24, 7 June 2006 (UTC) This article is blatantly POV. -“Despised by Iraqi workers?” Cite. Even if you cite it, is POV -“Hugo Chavez democratically elected government?? Bullspit. Chavez stole the vote and has been arresting members of the opposition. Again, POV. -The CTV in fact led a damaging strike aimed at overthrowing the Chavez government, after recvieving money and training from the Solidarity Center. Again, cite.. I think the CTV, related to the French Confederation Generale du Travail is highly unlikely to rise up in support of a clearly American-led coup. Again the author (so) of this article haven’t provided any support for this argument. If the center gave $$ to the CTV to raise it, I expect proof. I also expect proof that it was indeed an anti-government/ anti-Chavez initiative. For the record, I applaud anti-Chavez efforts but I’d like proof. I’m therefore attaching a neutrality tag on this article. Unfortunately, I don’t know enough about this item to understand the fact, but words like despised are clearly POV.</p>

<p>All of the sources under: articles are all highly left-wing and POV. If it is really part of a “Bushite conspiracy, wouldn’t Time, Newsweek, etc want to publish it.

<p>As I stated when I wrote my objection, I don't really have "a dog in this fight" when it concerns Union activity or the AFL-CIO. However, I also don't think the article should stand "as is." Words like despised, whatever the Doctor's qualifications do not have a place under <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_7fb1.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">wikipedia: NPOV</a>. Further, the evidence you offer is merely a resubmission of what you have already posted previously. I still don't feel that Chavez's government was really Democratic or that. This writer: well, M. le Docteur, I have a wiki-name, and I use it. I don't use my real name, and that is my privledge. Do you treat your students in a like manner? You are indeed against imperialism and oppression, well, so am I and virtually everyone else. I am also agaisnt incest, racism, cancer and political assasination. I am also agaisnt indifferent wikipedia articles. Therefore, I suggest that you consider writing about something that interests you, but that isn't a part of your job. Cheers, and thank you for your time. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinejoesmith_907c.html" title="User:Valentinejoesmith">V. Joe</a> 21:45, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I replaced soapbox/blog/rant with past "official" posting from the organization itself. If you are a critic of the organization, you should not be erasing their contribution and replacing it with your own POV. This action goes against the spirit of Wikipedia. This website is not a soapbox for your views. Create your own website for that. Poccs 04:00, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure that the "official" posting is particularly valid either without balance. It seems to me that critical examination and editing is exactly within the spirit of Wikipedia.--<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookandcoffee_bb60.html" title="User:Bookandcoffee">Bookandcoffee</a> 04:34, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>As it stands the article is objective which is one of the primary goals of Wikipedia: content "containing notable verifiable knowledge." If someone needs information for a research project then the article, in its current form, is a valid source. I'm not saying it shouldn't be edited but rather that this is a better framework to build on. You can't argue with the content unless you believe the organization is lying and if you feel that's the case it's probably because you're a critic. The most beneficial course of action would be to provide researchers with a heading containing various criticisms. Instead, the former article was primarily written by one of the organization's most vocal critics and violated 3 fundamental Wikipedia rules: Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought, a soapbox, or a blog. The past article was the most thoroughly biased entry in hundreds if not thousands of Wikipedia articles that I have researched. Poccs 05:19, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I'm afraid that I disagree. It has been my experience that "official" and "objective" are two things that you rarely find together. <s>It is a bit naive to say that you "can't argue with the content unless you believe the organization is lying."</s> Things are never that simple. The ACILS wants to project a good view of itself - who doesn't? I don't fault them for that - but this article isn't (just) about what the ACILS says it does, <s>it's about what Wikipedia say the ACILS does. (That sounds a bit ominous doesn't it... jeez&#160;:)</s> Hopefully a number of interested editors work from outside sources, and eventually reach a semblance of the truth; including an honest assessment of the criticisms, and critics. I would contend that editing toward that goal, rather than reverting (a process which is almost inevitably temporary) would be a better course.--<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookandcoffee_bb60.html" title="User:Bookandcoffee">Bookandcoffee</a> 06:56, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article has been taken over by people critical of the Solidarity Center.

<p>I think this article should be started over. It was orginally written by someone with a clear bias, whatever his qualifications. When writing an enclopedia article, one does not say that Hitler was evil, one simply gives his deeds and lets the reader draw his own conclusion. Additionally, if you are writing an article about, say, the Britsh Empire 1910-1930, you had better interview both Winston Churchill and Eamon De Valera if you want balance. I think this should be started over, written at first as a stub, and then slowly expanded using both the ACLU Solidarity website, critical sources, and State Department press releases about it. Otherwise, you are going to continue to get left-wing rants... and right-wing rants that attempt to refute them. (Which will convince no one, being slogans shouted back and forth. I also think the "Haiti" section of this article has been taken over by <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristide.html" title="Aristide">Aristide</a> <i>partisans</i>, who is both a defrocked priest and a failed president/dictator/whatever who blames the US for his departure. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValentinejoesmith_907c.html" title="User:Valentinejoesmith">V.

<p>Aristide was (maybe) democratically elected for a (limited) term of office, which he then proceded to exceed vastly. He then thumbed his nose at world opinion and was deposed by the Haitians themselves... after he which he fled to the United States. After a time, he returned to Haiti, became the President (again) and "surprise!" began to violate both human rights and to steal from the very poor people of Haiti. At the bequest of a multilateral agreement, the United States and France sent troops to restore order. The United States claims to have protected Aristide and allowed him to seek the protection of the U.S. Marines, which then took him back to the U.S. on a C-130 cargo aircraft. He was treated as a V.I.P. and only later, after talking with foes of the Bush Adminstistration, decided to claim to be kidnapped, something like 2 weeks after he was sent on his way.</p>

<p>When the US wants to "capture" or "kidnap" or whatever you want to call it. They don't use Marines. They use <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_Force_6873.html" title="Delta Force">Delta Force</a> which is an Army project when they need to capture enemey VIPs. Most famously, the Delta Force was used in Somalia in an attempt to capture <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammed_Farah_Aidid_1837.html" title="Mohammed Farah Aidid">Mohammed Farah Aidid</a> and in Columbia to kill/capture a drug lord (see <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killing_Pablo_8adf.html" title="Killing Pablo">Killing Pablo</a> by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Bowden_c9ee.html" title="Mark Bowden">Mark Bowden</a>). If the US is really serious about killing somebody (i.e. Bin Laden) they use cruise missles. They certainly don't realease somebody like Aidid or Pablo, and if Aristide was so no dangerous he'd still be in jail. If Aristide was really that much of a bad guy, he'd either be on trial for crimes agaisnt humanity or we'd have handed him over the Haitan opposition that deposed him or to the French, where he would have quietly (and immediately) suffered a fatal heart attack</p>

<p>I don't think I dominate the article. I haven't actually edited it much, although I have made my views known on the talk page. I do not think that the ACILS is as important as people are trying to make it and I also do not believe that it is a CIA front. Ideally, I'd like to see a much shorter, much more factual article that is little longer than a stub.

<p>Arisitde was not deposed by the Haitian masses. See Giant marches right before his ouster by poor that supported his government. Polls showed in 2002 Aristide had massive overwhelmingly support. It was a 4 year embargo, an elite opposition which received over 100 million dollars each year from USAID, EU, CIDA, and NED which destabilized his democratically elected government. Death squad rebels with help of Pentagon and Dominican military then invaded Haiti. This is well documented. In 1991 he was overthrown by the Haitian military and the Haitian people demanded his return. Upon his return the Clinton administration attempted to force him to privatize but he refused. With the founding of Fanmi Lavalas in 1997 on the line of opposing privatizations the US government and others saw aristide as the #1` threat in Haiti. Arisitdes government had corruption like every other government in Haiti but the difference was that the elected government actually spent money on school , medicine, and improving the rights of workers. This is also well documented. The Solidarity Center, like so many other "democratizatin" and aid organizations, dependent on Government money ignored the persecution of pro-aristide workers following the coup. Over 10,000 people fired in an attempt to privatize civil enterprises. The statements above are refletions of the anti-aristide propaganda in the media which been constant since the early 1990's when doctored CIA reports claimed he was insane and spent time in a Canadian mental hospital. This was repeated by NC Senator Jesse Helms and later proved false. Have you ever been to Haiti? Have you ever seen the protests of hundreds of thousands of people demanding democracy to then be shot in the back by US and Canadian trained police? This is not a left wing conspiracy it is fact told from the ground.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.164.227.66_b8ac.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.164.227.66">72.164.227.66</a> (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.164.227.66.html" title="User talk:72.164.227.66">talk</a>) .</small></p>

<p>Arisitde was elected in 1990 to carry out five years. He was elected again 2000 to carry out five years. In total he should have served out 10 years. But targeted by two Haitain military coups he only served for barely five years. Arisitde was no dictator. He was overwhelmingly elected with vote monitors approving his elections.

<p>If I am "sadly confused"... prove that Aristide is anything but a thug. Even if he were democratically elected, it does not excuse his actions... nor does it prove that he was deposed by US Marines. My knowledge of Haiti, BTW, is confined to its impact on the History of France and the United States as well. But to quote myself, in a different environment (when addressing a hardcore socialist) "To what motivation would the United States and France have a profit in deposing Aristide? There is no oil, nor any other resource of possible profit, except for the poor people, who don't have enough money to buy anything, anyway. There isn't even guano worth mining anymore... and you can get sugar cane from Hawaii or La Reunion." Ask yourself that question before deciding it was a war for oil or imperialism or whatever."</p>
<p>If Aristide is such a "good guy"... why does he continually ally himself with "bad guys" like Chavez and Castro? If he wanted anything but power for himself he'd ask for foreign aid from those same rich countries he insults. Surely, no one can argue that the United States, France, Canada or Luxembourg wouldn't be a more profitable source of foreign aid. If he is concerned about "American influence", he could get it from the French or the Canadians, etc.</p>
<p>That said, my other root problem with Aristide is that socialism, especially Liberation-style socialism equals dead people. Lots of dead people. Anarchy would be better for the Haitans, who until now, whose only succor has been the Catholic church. Torquemada and Beria make very poor bedfellows. Of course, I may have answered my own question about why America would intervene... but why France?</p>
<p>Also, since when does the Canadian governent support the U.S in anything? Or are you refering to something that occured in Canada and the States? I have scant sympathy with rioters for any cause.</p>
<p>Also, you haven't cited why anyone of the "bad guys" (the U.S., Canada and the Dominician Republic) would have any reason to intervene in Haiti?</p>
<p>Why is privitazation a bad thing? It seems to have done wonders in Estonia, Latvia, etc.</p>

<dd>Haiti is important for USA out of strategic concerns as a territory in the Carribean, not for its natural resources. It is also important for ideological reasons. The USA does not want another socialist island in the Carribean or the spread of any form of socialism in this hemisphere at all. Haiti going socialist is like another slave revolt all over again, in a region which is supposed to be USA's corporate plantation/colony/sweatshop. It is bad enough that Cuba, Venezuela and Bolivia are there and we know the USA is doing its best to break them too...Canada and France's motivation for intervening is the same as anywhere else, they are fellow (subordinate) NATO members and when it comes to sticking it to third world countries in the name of corporate imperialism, they usually agree more than disagree. Their biggest disagreements are not over legitimacy or justice, but over competing business interests (Iraq, Iran etc) in which case they just refrain from acting. The Dominincan Republic by the way, is just a fancy name for Puerto Rico 2.</dd>

<dd>You mentioned begging for foreign aid. Did you think this aid comes like rain from heaven without any conditions? You must be 14 years old, if not younger. Governmental foreign aid is given to poor countries in exchange for these poor countries allowing themselves to be controlled by the aid-donating gov. Truly NG NGO's are often too small and have too little budget to make that much of a difference. Foreign investments? Well in Haiti that would entail sweatshops and investors are really just the government's corporate face (or is it the other way around, the government is the corporation's 'official' face?)...Approaching Cuba, Aristide shows a desire for achieving some form of self-sufficiency and economical independence for Haiti, albeit under a rather totalitarian form of government. But approaching Venezuela on the other hand, might have been Aristide's way of reaching out to a fellow democratic, independent country in the region, resisting US imperialism and ruled by a government upheld by its working class and poor majority and which could help its fellow Haiti with oil in times of need (under embargo of USA). With such dangerous ideas, no wonder USA had to act fast...You say Liberation style socialism equals dead people? Oh so the masses of people who died under the US-supported Duvalier dictators, they are actually not dead, they are just under a voodoo spell? Interesting...</dd>

<dd>Privatization in Estonia and Latvia made the two countries defacto colonies of the Russian Maffia and both countries had basically become the best place to go in Europe for cheap whores, drugs and smuggled/"hot" merchandise in the 1990s. Very generous aid from the European Union ultimately resulted in the two countries coming into the EU's fold in 2004 and this has made both countries a little more presentable. Still, they have big problems with organized crime and poverty. The EU has no plan to give Haiti this kind of government aid, privatization in Haiti will result in the country being largely foreign owned</dd>

<p>Aristide doubled the minimum wage. The leaders of the group of 184 were sweatshop owners who were opposed to the raise in wages. Aristide also subsidized rice so the poor could eat. Some of the main financial backers of the paramilitary rebels were involved in the food distribution trade between miami and haiti. The republicans have hated arisitde since 1990 when he was first elected. Go to Haiti and meet with poor people. You will find that Lavalas is still the largest and most popular party even after 10,000 have been killed by the interim dictatorship of Latortue. Why does the Solidarity Center not investigate the persecution and murder of Lavalas workers? Is it because it does not fit within "U.S. Strategic interests?" I think so. Haitians want food, clothing, and shelter. They wanted a democratic government. They don't care about your political ideology and western ideas being imposed upon them.</p>

<p>Pascal... I don't think going to Haiti is a good idea... especially as a "Yank" with minnimal French. I would NEVER be so impolite as to discuss domestic politics in a foreign country, its both impolite and somewhat unhealthy. That includes England, France and Germany, but also includes less civillized places like Russia, Mexico or ESPECIALLY Haiti. If Haiti is such a grand place, why is it the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere? Sure, it doesn't have the natural wealth of Cananda, the United States or Brazil... but neither does Aruba or Jamaica... It has something to do WITH GOVERNMENT. 'Nuff said.</p>

<dd>I would caution on using Kelber as a primary source. The <i>Labor Educator</i> is a newspaper, not a research journal, and Kelber has a distinct point of view he is pushing. Personally, I would not rely on Kelber as my only source for a fact; I would also seek back-up (Kelber got his information from somewhere!).</dd>
<dd>The Sims book is useful, although dated (nearly 15 years old). The book does not rely on much original-document research, and South End Press is not without bias. Nevertheless, the Sims book is useful as a source of information from other countries, non-U.S. labor unions, etc. I would think the Sims book is useful for putting things in context, as a finding-aid for non-original-document sources, for information which would not appear in Carew's, Cox's or Kelber's pieces (e.g., non-U.S. sources), and so on.</dd>
<dd>Foner's book is very well done. Foner has a bias, but he works very hard to adopt a neutral viewpoint in the work. And, as he does in all his books, Foner documents everything five or six times over! It's no surprise that labor leaders try to influence the opinions of union members (duh!), but there is much useful information on labor's overseas activites in this work, too.</dd>
<dd>Finally, biographies of <a href="../../../a/f/s/AFSCME_a576.html" title="AFSCME">AFSCME</a> and its president in the 1960s, <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Wurf_ff8c.html" title="Jerry Wurf">Jerry Wurf</a>, discuss how entangled AFSCME was with FTUC/ASLIC. Such works may also contain useful information. (For example, when Wurf took over as president of AFSCME, he found that a number of AFSCME staff were in fact agents of the CIA and FBI--undercover as labor staff, but fully funded by the intelligence community and doing only intelligence work.) - <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim1965_7d40.html" title="User:Tim1965">Tim1965</a> 00:36, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
