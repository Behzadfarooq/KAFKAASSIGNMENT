<p>Contributors have created two articles on the revolutionary era in America: This one focuses on the military campaign, while the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolution_bd44.html" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a> covers social and political issues.</p>
<p>The current approach has been to summarize the war in a way that will be clearly understandable to the lay reader, without cluttering it up with too many details. Concentrate on the major figures and actions, and try to leave detailed discussion of tactics, casualties, historical debates, etc. to linked articles about specific battles or actions. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> 01:27, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've just discovered that Wikipedia considers "the [American] Revolutionary War" and "the American Revolution" as two different things. I've lived in America all my life and never heard of that! Indeed, I would say that "the American Revolution" and "the Revolutionary War" synonymous and widely (if not exclusively) understood terms for the actual war.

<dd>[...]Many naval battles in this war did not involve American troops at all; sending an American fleet into the Indian Ocean (Battle of Trincomalee) at that time would have been an inconceivable squandering of limited resources. I very much agree that the term "American Revolution" has a broader scope than any title that includes "War" - it would include much of the political activity, and the actions of the terrorist freedom-fighters at the Boston Tea Party. <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclecticology_b6d7.html" title="User:Eclecticology">Eclecticology</a></dd>

<dd>In Cuba it's also said the revolution also still goes on. So it's not unusual to use the word in this sense as well (of a broader social change), even though that's confusing; a revolution that is stretched out in time is more like an evolution, but then again an evolution normally doesn't start with a revolution, so that word wouldn't apply either. So 'revolution' sounds ok to me, for lack of a better word. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> June 28, 2005 07:05 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Surly it is the other way round the "American War of Independence" was a side show and one of a series of wars in the traditional struggle between Britain and France where each tries to give the other a good kicking (and which continues to this day by all means short of armed conflic)? In cold war parlance it was a <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proxy_war.html" title="Proxy war">Proxy war</a>. The war as not about "revolution" it was about gaining "independence" so that the 13 colonies could decide how to govern themselves. If they chose to revolutionise their form of government, that was an internal issue and not directly relevant to the wars aims. For example if at the end of the war the 13 colonies had decided to invite some German prince to come and be their king, like Greece <a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_of_Greece_7a0f.html" title="Otto of Greece">did</a> at the end of <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottoman_Greece_3d43.html#The_War_of_Independence" title="Ottoman Greece">their war of independence</a> in the 1800s, then the issues which led to war, its duration and outcome would have been no diffrent. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_Baird_Shearer_a81d.html" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">Philip Baird Shearer</a> 11:06, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In the UK it is usually referred to as the "American War of Independence".

<p>It seems best to keep it as "American Revolutionary War" as that is how it is known in the US and the Americans won. It is better known as the "American War of Independence" in Britain, but Britain lost the war and there are fewer British Net users than American ones. JimmyTheOne 22:47, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV terms: rebels, patriots, etc.</span></h2>
<p>I notice that [...] the Americans are often called rebels. To me, this sounds like a bit of bias. "Rebel" isn't usually used as a positive term outside of Star Wars, and since they are rebels to the British, it is not exactly a sympathetic tone. In the same context, constantly calling the Americans "patriots" would be biased as well. Maybe just "Americans" would be a more neutral term. [...] --God 11/18/04 22:12 PST</p>

<dd>The terminology can be tricky. <i>Americans</i> or <i>colonists</i> are imprecise terms, because many American colonists fought against the revolutionaries. <i>Patriots</i> or <i>revolutionaries</i> might be best. However, as a patriotic American northerner, I see nothing wrong with <i>rebel</i> -- it is accurate and inoffensive in this context. Indeed, white southern Americans still embrace the term, albeit from a later war. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> 07:11, 19 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The terminology here is very confusing. First, there's the question what the terms 'America' and 'American' mean. At present many still use 'America' for the whole continent (aka 'the Americas'), but at the time I suppose that was even more the case. Both the 'rebels' and the loyalists were colonists, British (largely) and Americans (unless you take the stance that only the Indians were real Americans, but I won't get into that because it's confusing enough as it is). And the term 'patriot' isn't precise either because which 'patria' does it refer to? Great Britain or the fledgling USA? One point of the fighting was to establish a USA 'patria', so in a sense that didn't even exist yet (even though it had already been declared). And I'd say it was more than a rebellion, so the term 'revolutionaries' seems most appropriate. Or 'independence fighters', but that's a bit long. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> June 28, 2005 07:33 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You're right, it is confusing. For the colonists, the terms we should consistently use for the sake of international clarity are <b><a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriot_%28American_Revolution%29_bf14.html" title="Patriot (American Revolution)">Patriot</a></b> and <b><a href="../../../l/o/y/Loyalist_%28American_Revolution%29_e586.html" title="Loyalist (American Revolution)">Loyalist</a></b>. These are terms widely used by historians and were in use by people at the time, and they are linked to articles that explain their meaning. (The term "revolutionaries" is problematic because of a long running historical debate over whether the Revolution was truly revolutionary.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>We American (USA) editors sometimes fail to use clear terminology because so many of us were taught that the war was fought between Americans and the British (with their evil Hessian henchmen). Even the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Kings_Mountain_a9fa.html" title="Battle of Kings Mountain">Battle of Kings Mountain</a>, which was a battle between American Loyalists and American Patriots, is in some books described as a battle between the British and the Americans. (The Mel Gibson movie <i>The Patriot</i> furthers this myth by inaccurately dressing American Loyalists in British army "redcoats".) Many Revolutionary War articles on Wikipedia probably need updated with this more precise terminology.</dd>

<dd>It's not as easy to make the word "American" less ambiguous. The proper word to describe someone from the USA is "American," although the word also has wider applications. We should strive to use the word in contexts that will be clearly understood by international readers. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> June 28, 2005 12:54 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Like I said, strictly speaking, 'patriot' isn't a good word (I suppose 'independence fighter' is the best description), but if a large majority (internationally!) uses this term, then I suppose it's the best choice, though I understand that a similar case could be made for 'rebel' (is that true?). Whichever term is used, this completely circumvents the problem of the use of the word 'American'. I often have problems with the use of this word, struggling between sense and custom, but here the problem doesn't come into play if all occurrences of the word 'American' are replaced with 'patriot'. That is, if it's always used in that sense, because, strictly speaking, the loyalists were just as much American as the patriots/rebels/independence fighters. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> June 29, 2005 10:14 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"American" is the standard term used in Britain and America-- it is the preferred term in monographs, encyclopedia and surveys. The reason is that it exactly describes the political situation: people who supported the United States of America were always called Americans (by friends and foes alike). The war was all about whether this new USA would be allowed to exist or would be crushed by the British. Therefore its supporters raised armies and fought--and that is what the article is all about. So let's use it. You need a very good reason for replacing it, it seems to me. It is not true that "rebel" or "patriot" is widely used. So let's go over the reasons again: WHY replace it?<a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 04:51, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Similarly hyperbolic was the claim that Philadelphia was the second largest city in the British Empire.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ever since Burgoyne's surrender, there has been a lot of ink spilled over why Howe did not support the Saratoga expedition. Above is one theory; there are others. One is that Howe simply ignored the glory-seeking Burgoyne and instead sought his own prize -- the capture of Philadephia. Another is that nobody really thought Burgoyne would need help capturing Albany, but Burgoyne tried to shift the blame to Howe after the debacle at Saratoga.

<p>To have a url that's different from the title is a bit confusing. Or is this done deliberately to stress that there are two names for it? That would only make sense if they were equally much in use.Is that the cae? I've only ever heard it referred to as the 'US war of indendence'.</p>
<p>And that makes me think (to complicate matters). Wasn't it really a civil war? After all, it was (mainly) British versus British, right? Just in a colony, but officially that was part of Great Bitain, no? Of course the other two names apply as well, stressing different aspects of it, but at the time it must have been seen as a civil war, I suppose. If so, I'd say that should be mentioned. Although it's confusing that there was another civil war in the country later on.</p>
<p><i>America</i> is considered by many to mean the entire continent also known as 'the Americas'. And there have been several wars of independence in that continent, so shouldn't it be called the 'USA war of indendence'? But then there's another country in America called 'United States' that also had a war of independence, namely Mexico. Oh dear....</p>
<p>And another thing. <i>Spain entered the war in 1779, but did not recognize the new American nation and sent no troops to America to fight alongside the USA.</i> How did they enter the war then? Or is the international war against the British supremacy meant?</p>

<dd>There are two (at least) names for the Revolutionary War. Frankly, where I live (US), if you mention the "Revolutionary War", everyone assumes you're talking about this topic. If you mention the "US War of Independence", people will give you strange looks. Apparantly, this isn't true everywhere, but it sure is where I live.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>On the matter of civil war... the way I know it as, is that if you have a civil war where the side seeking to change the status quo loses, it's a "civil war" (see <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>). If the side seeking to change the status quo wins? That's a revolution. (Just another case of "The winners write the history books", I guess.)</dd>

<dd>Anyways, Mexico does not consider itself to be the "United States"--they reserve that distinction for America. As for Spain entering the war, but not really... beats me.<br />

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Statistics on British army in North America.</span></h2>
<p>I'm looking now at 1779 figures based on Lord North's return-books in the William Clements Library, and they chart North American troop dispositions at about 39,000, as opposed to listed 60,000. That doesn't include the Irish Establishment (for which there don't seem to be good records), but unless there were 21,000 Irishmen fighting in North America, I think this is a rather inflated figure. <a href="../../../f/e/a/User%7EFearwig_1788.html" title="User:Fearwig">Fearwig</a> 03:21, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As indicated in the footnotes, the 60,000 figure is from historian Jeremy Black. It apparently includes Irishmen and Germans, which might account for the difference. It's also possible the returns you're looking at lists only soldiers currently "fit for duty", not the total number of men in North America. Regardless, we should only use figures in Wikipedia that have been published by historians, and not, alas, based on our own readings of published primary material. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">on Wheels!</a> 13:32, 4 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>a primary source is a source is a source is a source...and should not simply be ignored because it disagrees with another.

<dd>"A primary source is a source is a source" is a naïve (though common) view of historical documents and what historians do. Historians must consider many factors in evaluating any given primary source. For example, in <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Hackett_Fischer_d647.html" title="David Hackett Fischer">David Hackett Fischer</a>'s <i>Washington's Crossing</i>, he points out that General Howe's casualty reports are always undercounts (Howe apparently had his reasons for not being accurate). An amateur historian (such as a Wikipedian) might repeat Howe's deliberate undercounts at face value without understanding the context. It's not desirable for a Wikipedian to go poking around in primary documents that he or she has not had the broad reading needed to properly evaluate: that's original research, which we don't do here. Plus there's no need, since professional historians are on the job. Now, when two reputable, published, professional scholars are in disagreement, that's when our job here gets really fun, because we can report the disagreement. What we don't do is try to be historians ourselves in any field where the pros have published. (This process is somewhat different regarding Wikipedia articles about current events or popular culture, for example, where professional research might not be published, and Wikipedians can scour the web for primary sources to their heart's content.) --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">(complaint dept.)</a> 15:19, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Need for a British Perspective</span></h2>
<p>This article drastically needs a British perspective. At the moment, it is quite Amerocentric. I added the term "<a href="../../../l/o/y/Loyalist_%28American_Revolution%29_e586.html" title="Loyalist (American Revolution)">American Loyalists</a>" to the template, because the Loyalists represented at least 15-20% of the population of the <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thirteen_Colonies_9ce6.html" title="Thirteen Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a>. There is a specific reason why including both the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Empire_782f.html" title="British Empire">British Empire</a> and American Loyalists is <i>not</i> redundant. While Loyalists considered themselves and were perceived by others to be subjects of the British Empire, internationally, <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriot_%28American_Revolution%29_bf14.html" title="Patriot (American Revolution)">American Patriots</a> were also subjects of the British Empire until the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treaty_of_Paris_%281783%29_408e.html" title="Treaty of Paris (1783)">Treaty of Paris</a>. For the same reason that we don't say that the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> was a war between the United States and the United States, however, we differentiate between the USA (loyalists) and the CSA (rebels). Here we must differentiate between Patriots and Loyalists. During the Revolution, there were two types of colonists: those who were loyal to the British Crown and those who sought independence from it. We should not diminish the fact that the war was anot a universally-popular one; the Patriots were considered to be British subjects in rebellion by the international community (and by Loyalists). The Loyalists were also still <i>Americans</i>, in the sense of being inhabitants of the American colonies.</p>
<p>It should be made explicit that there were many "Americans" who did not support the War and who were loyal to the Crown.</p>
<p>Ideally, the template would indicate a war of Patriot Colonists versus the British Empire and Loyalist Colonists.--AaronS 01:44, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Since the very first paragraph of the "combatant" section states the percentage and number of Loyalists, differentiates quite clearly between American Loyalists and American Patriots, and calls the war a "civil war", everything you say above is already quite prominent and explicit in the article. Heck, I'll bet the article itself is your source for the percentage you quote. You may be right that the article needs additional British perspective, but you've yet to identify anything that is not already well covered. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">(complaint dept.)</a> 04:33, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>If it is already well-covered in the article, then there should be no problem in adding a bit more specificity to the template. What is your objection, after all? The template serves as a very general summary of the war. The summary should not be so general that important information is excluded, and not so specific that it no longer is useful. If someone were to merely check the template in reading this article, they would be under the presumption that the war was fought between the colonists and the far away Great Britain. In reality, however, the war was fought amongst the colonists themselves as well as between the rebels and Great Britain. This should be explicit in the template.</p>
<p>Since you haven't really offered a clear objection, other than that my addition is "redundant" (I've already shown that it is not), I'm going to add "American Loyalists" back into the template.--AaronS 21:52, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You haven't shown anything, actually. You agree that the Loyalists were part of the British Empire, but say that listing both "British Empire" and "Loyalists" is not redundant. Huh? Your version of the warbox creates the mistaken impression that the Loyalists were not part of the Empire, but something like allies of it. I daresay that misses the whole point of Loyalism, if not the war.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's probably not worth belaboring, but your comparison to the American Civil War is also faulty: you write that we don't say that the war was fought between the United States and the United States. Of course not, the warbox at that article properly indicates that the war was fought between the previously established government (the United States) and the breakaway rebels (the Confederacy). And so the Revolution was fought between the established government (the British Empire) and the breakaway rebels (the American Revolutionaries), as the warbox here previously indicated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you feel it's important to list the Loyalists in the warbox, then the term "British Empire" needs to be replaced by <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_5d2d.html" title="Kingdom of Great Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a>, piped (for reasons of concision) to <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_5d2d.html" title="Kingdom of Great Britain">Great Britain</a>. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">(complaint dept.)</a> 22:56, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your comments, Kevin. Looking at the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> article, the warbox there probably isn't accurate. The War of Independence, after all, was a British civil war. The American Civil War article should have the United States versus the "Southern Rebels," or something to that extent, since the Confederacy was never recognized. So, I think that we've both got it wrong. The American Civil War article must be changed; otherwise, we would be obliged to characterize the War of Independence as a war between Great Britain and the United States, which I think we both agree would be silly.</p>
<p>I'm going to propose this change on the American Civil War discussion page.</p>
<p>Here I think the warbox should characterize the war as one between American Rebels (not Patriots, since there was no American patria, "patriot" is mainly a propaganda term, and "rebel" is the proper label, since they were rebelling against their government) and their allies and Great Britain and its allies. France is a significant enough ally of the rebels to be specified explicitly, and American Loyalists are a significant enough ally of Great Britain (yes, they were in fact British, but so were the rebels) to be listed explicitly.</p>
<p>The main reason why I think that this is necessary is because I do not think that the warbox, as it was before I edited it, properly demonstrated the fact that the War of Independence was not necessarily a popular war (especially not until it seemed like it could be successful) and that there were many colonists who remained loyal to Great Britain (and were forced to flee to Canada). It was, as you say, a civil war. Moreover, the way it was before made it seem as if the war was between "us," over here, and the British, over there.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: the American Civil War warbox would be terribly misleading if it listed the conflict as being between the United States and American Rebels (or even American Patriots, since the Confederates most certainly were Americans, and considered themselves to be citizens of the Confederate States of <i>America</i>!). Rather, it should be displayed as between the United States and Confederate or Southern Rebels.</p>
<p>Now does my request really seem all that unreasonable?--AaronS 00:10, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree with Kevin Myers, "Loyalists" is redundant, since they would be included in the term "British Empire". --<a href="../../../j/w/1/User%7EJW1805_0d7f.html" title="User:JW1805">JW1805</a> 02:12, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p>Aaron's British view seems to be that this is a civil war. (Sorry if I've interpreted you incorrectly). IMHO we should not adopt that for the article as a whole. The wording in combatants is quite enough, thank you. If the rebels lose its a civil war, if they win its a revolution. This we have, for example, the English civil war, but the Glorious Revolution. Id say take loyalists out of the box. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELouI_01b3.html" title="User:LouI">Lou I</a> 18:03, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, well I'm British. I read the article, though not carefully enough to consider every detail. I am certainly not a historian, to comment on the details. However, the phrase 'American revolutionary war' is a new one to me. I was taught about the 'American war of independence'.</p>
<p>Next, it seems odd to me to view this as a war between the British Empire and Americans. My slightly hazy history did not really consider that we had an empire at that time. America was a colony. I don't know its legal staus, but I think it might have been regarded as just another part of the United Kingdom, nothing so grand as to be considered an empire. It may be that in retrospect this is now regarded as part of the rise of the British Empire, but certainly I was taught it as a war between the United Kingdom (very possibly in fact England really rather than the entire United Kingdom, this was a kingdom controlled by England) and americans. I still regard it this way. I looked at the article linked to 'British Empire, and found hardly a reference to India, which in many ways was the heart and soul of the British Empire and what I immediately associate with the phrase. Much of the rest was colonies (like America) which feel much more like parts of Britain than an outside Empire, but also which did not become important until later. The independent Scottish parliament was only dissolved in 1707, which was just another step in the process of creation of the core of the United Kingdom. I fancy America was just regarded as British subjects adventuring abroad, and this was how they regarded themselves? Possibly the 'empire' at this stage was more like a franchise to run a business. Maybe historians have a different view? This may not help much, but such history as I have heard here more recently seems of the view that the war was essentially a political balls up, that with sensible policies the americans had absolutely no interest in rebellion and would have been very happy (indeed preferred) to remain loyal subjects of the crown. There is a reference in the article to whigs and Tories, one of which is defined as loyalist and one patriot, yet these were (and one still is) British political parties forming competing governments of the UK. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 20:06, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You get a lot of it right, Sandpiper. The colonists certainly viewed themselves as <i>British</i> subjects or <i>Englishmen</i>. There was no American national identity. At the time of the revolution, the oldest colony was not even 200 years old, and all of the culture and traditions of the colonies were, for the most part, borrowed from England. I don't agree with the maxim "if you lose, it's a civil war; if you win, it's a revolution." That just seems to be inherently biased. Are we going to ignore all of the people (argued to be a majority in many cases) who were loyal to the Crown? The American War of Independence, after all, was a war between Britons, not between Americans and Britons. To ignore the loyalists, and to pretend that it was not a civil war (i.e. a war within one nation), is to do a great disservice to history. I'm an American, but I think that it would be highly inaccurate to not make it clear that, at the time of this war, there was no such thing as an American. Perhaps an unbiased expert would like to chime in? --AaronS 21:06, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Addendum</b>: Please see the article on <a href="../../../c/i/v/Civil_war.html" title="Civil war">civil wars</a> for why the distinction between "civil war" and "revolution" is arbitrary in this case, and therefore there should be as much neutrality as possible. If it were a war in India between Indians and Britons, then it would be a revolution. Since it was a war between people of the same nation, it is more likely a civil war, and its additional classification as a revolution would be arbitrary. Furthermore, please note that few governmental changes were made within the states; states and localities already had a large degree of autonomy, with the Crown's direct oversight already greatly diminished by the <a href="../../../1/7/7/1770s.html" title="1770s">1770s</a>.

If anything, the article currently makes France look too much like the cavalry in a Western movie, coming to the last-minute rescue in the final battle, because it overlooks major problems encountered by the Franco-American alliance in the years before Yorktown.

<dd>I checked to see what terms the leading British historians of the War use. Lecky, Trevelyan, Christie and Black all prefer "American". That seems a reasonable enough solution. There is no ambiguity. The Loyalists did not consider themselves "Americans'--they called themselves "Englishmen" and after the war most left for Canada or Britain because they did not want to be Americans. Calling them Americans is an insult to them and POV. "American Revolutionaries" is unidiomatic--no one uses it and it sounds awkward. Let me add that the "colonies" ceased to exist in 1775 and became "states." <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 08:51, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're wrong that no one uses "American Revolutionaries": Black uses that term extensively, with and without the "American". He also uses "American" by itself, perhaps just as frequently, which is of course what most U.S. historians use. I don't think eminent Victorians like Lecky and Trevelyan are good yardsticks for modern terminology, to say the least. Plus, none of these writers wrote for the type of truly international audience that Wikipedia reaches, which means we have some additional considerations. Personally, I'd just use the terms Americans, Loyalists, and British, which is how this aritcle used to read, but international Wikipedians sometimes report that they find the term "American" to be ambiguous, which brings us back to where we began. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">(complaint dept.)</a> 22:16, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suggest it is rare indeed for a historian to use "American revolutionaries" as the preferred term. The Brits prefer "American." I just rechecked Black and he usually uses "American". I also just checked Piers Mackesy, Wars for America --it's online--and did a count. He prefers "American" (over 500 uses); he uses Loyalist (20 times), "Whig" 5 times and and never uses "revolutionary" when referring to Americans (he does use it for the French). Valentine's British bio of Lord Germain uses American over 100 times, and 'revolutionary' 5 times. Middlecauf has one of the most recent major stuidies. He uses "American" hundreds of times, and "revolutionaries" 6 times. So the word is not unused, it is just uncommon and not the preferred term.</dd>

<p>In 1770s the term was used, in Britain, France and America, to refer to supporters of the new USA. It is certainly not ambiguous, and if anyone thinks so they should speak up. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 22:54, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Jeremy Black has a new book on the Hanoverians, that you can search on Amazon. He uses "American revolutionaries" only once (p 129), and prefers American. In his "America As a Military Power: From the American Revolution to the Civil War" (2002) by Jeremy Black he uses revolutionary 8 times (using Google Book Search), and American 430 times.</dd>

<dd>Yes, there's no doubt "American Revolutionaries" is not the most frequently used term: that was not the issue (as I understand it). The issue was: if "American" is ambiguous (as is written above, and which shows up on other pages like <a href="../../../w/a/r/Talk%7EWar_of_1812_ab49.html" title="Talk:War of 1812">Talk:War of 1812</a>), and "Patriot" POV, is "Revolutionaries" a good compromise? Perhaps we can instead use "American" and explain early on to readers that the word, as used in this article, refers to the Revolutionaries.</dd>

<dd>By the way, your google counting method doesn't distinguish between apples and oranges, and so none of your data above is really applicable. Every use of "American" does not refer to the Revolutionaries, since the word is also a geographic term. Uses of the word to describe the "American economy" or the "American coast" or the "American war" also show up in your total, skewing the results. And the relevant Jeremy Black book is <i>War for America</i>; any book that includes pre- or post-Revolutionary history will have lots of uses of the word "American" which are not relevant to the question at hand. If you could search <i>War for America</i> and compare uses of "Revolutionaries" with only those uses of "American" that refer to the American rebels, that would be a relevant and interesting bit of data. I'll bet he uses "American" more often, but he very frequently uses "Revolutionaries" (capitalized) to refer to the rebels under arms, which is why I suggested it as a compromise term. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">(complaint dept.)</a> 04:25, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"American" is the standard term used in Britain and America-- it is the preferred term in monographs, encyclopedia and surveys. The reason is that it exactly describes the political situation: people who supported the new United States of America were always called Americans (by friends and foes alike). The term "American" is a political term referring to the nation. The war was all about whether this new USA would be allowed to exist or would be crushed by the British. Therefore its supporters raised armies and fought--and that is what the article is all about. So let's use it. You need a very good reason for replacing it, it seems to me. It is not true that "rebel" or "patriot" is widely used. It is not true that there is any ambiguity. It is not true that mysterious unnamed people have intervened to veto the word. So let's go over the reasons again: WHY replace it?<a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 04:54, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You wrote: "It is not true that mysterious unnamed people have intervened to veto the word." Incorrect. Some months ago, a user from the Netherlands removed every occurrance of the word "American" from the article, since readers outside the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglosphere.html" title="Anglosphere">Anglosphere</a> sometimes find that word ambigious. Your assertion that "it is not true that there is any ambiguity" simply means that you know what the word means to you; the goal then is to convey that understanding to international readers who don't agree with your assertion. I too prefer the term "American"; make it work and you'll hear no objections from me. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">(complaint dept.)</a> 06:12, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good heavens--someone came in and removed American from the American revoltuion? That's close to deliberate vandalism--rather like the folks who insert the vulgar words in every article. Who is this guy and why did he do it? Did he explain his goals? Did he misunderstand something? An encyclopedia is supposed to educate people out of their ignorance, and we certainly want to help this fellow and not cater to his ignorance.

<dd>I do indeed believe you. I watch about 100+ articles in history and maybe 50 in current events (and none in areas like science), and I would say that 50% or more of the "contributions" are either obscenities, or RV the obscenity. I consider that vandalism. Who uses Wiki has been much discussed recently on sources like H-WORLD and H-TEACH. College profs say that many/most of their students use it as a top source. Not many students are in the library; they dod their research here, and the editors have an obligation to help them. I think on the whole Wiki does a good job, except that the history articles are not nearly as good as the current events articles I watch.<a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 07:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed, I keep wanting to get away from Wikipedia for awhile to work on some other projects, but I'm always running into history articles that are <i>so</i> wrong that I feel compelled to do some reading in order to correct them. This is good for me, because I learn so much in the process, but it's a never ending trap, I tell ya! I think history articles on Wikipedia tend to be poor because so much of it is based on two suspect sources: amateur web sites, and half-forgotten stuff learned in high school. Additionally, people who don't read a lot of history tend not to have the experience to differentiate between what is reliable source for an encyclopdia, and what is not. While current events articles are easily researched on Google, much history information found via Google is crap; the good stuff is still at the library, as you know. I'm confident Wikipedia will improve this situation in time, but we've got a long way to go. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Myers_58fc.html" title="User:Kevin Myers">Kevin Myers</a> | <a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKevin_Myers_d288.html" title="User talk:Kevin Myers">(complaint dept.)</a> 22:30, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Professor J R Pole (in Companion to the American Revolution 2004), is an eminent authority and he loves the word revolutionary. As in era, period, mind, generation, cause , thought, beliefs, agenda.... I used Google.Book to get these examples. But NOT when talking of armies. ( he uses American armies 11 times, and revolutionary armies zero times). As I say, it's not idiomatic to talk about Revolutionary armies, navies, regiments, etc. Another issue lurking here. Some people seem to ge geographical determinists. They think terms like American, German, British, French are related ONLY to geographical areas tou can see in an atlas. Since you have both USA and North America, there is a ceratin ambiguity in using the atlas for the word American. But in fact the terms have geographic, ethnic, cultural and political components, and how they mix is a very complex issue. The riots in France this year were about, who is French? It was not in dispute where the rioters lived or were born–the atlas cannot help much in explaining the riots. In 1776 the British had a world empire and to be British meant to ne loyal to the Empire. Check out <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Empire_Loyalists_b44c.html" title="United Empire Loyalists">United Empire Loyalists</a>. To be American meant to have allegiance to the new USA. That could happen if you lived in Paris (like Franklin) or even London. And Europeans could and did come over to become Americans, permanently and fight for the USA. (Like John Paul Jones, or von Steuben). <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 06:03, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">States, not colonies</span></h2>
<p>All the "colonies" vanished in 1775-76 when the Brits removed all their colonial officials. Only in Georgia, for a while, did they even attempt to ressetablish a colonial government. All the former colonies became states and should be called such. The war was NOT fought between Britain and some colonies. It was fought with the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">United States of America</a>, a new country. <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 07:12, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No fallacy. There was very little fighting before Jul 4, 1776. The Declaration of Independence meant this was not a squabble that could be compromised--that it would be a full scale war. Once that happened the British made it a real war sending a huge fleet and army to capture New York, and the fighting began in earnest. France would not have intervened in a squabble aroiund Boston--the US had to declare independence first. Once France was involved it became a major world war.<a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 08:16, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
