<p>The daytime all-time winnings record (for a cumulative run on the show) is held by Tom O'Brien, a contestant on <i><a href="../../../s/a/l/Sale_of_the_Century_%28US_game_show%29_5080.html" title="Sale of the Century (US game show)">Sale of the Century</a></i> in 1987. A contestant during the Winners' Board era of the show, O'Brien won all 11 games he played in, winning 10 prizes off the board plus a $50,000 bonus for winning an 11th consecutive game. That, plus over $20,000 in winnings in Tournament of Champions play, gives O'Brien a grand total of over $173,000 in cash and prizes.</p>
<p>The record for most winnings by a woman in a cumulative run is held by another <i>Sale</i> contestant, Stephanie Holmquist, whose $150,000+ record run (actual total, see Sale page) was the all-time daytime record as well until topped by O'Brien.</p>
<p>(It should be noted that O'Brien's total is not the highest total in <i>Sale</i> history. That belongs to contestant Tim Holleran, who won over $180,000 in cash and prizes. However, most of Holleran's winnings were from his run on the 1985-86 syndicated show, with a little over $20,000 in winnings coming from tournament play on the NBC network show.)</p>

Michael Larson's record, which stood for over 22 years</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The single day record, for many years, was held by <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Larson_89d2.html" title="Michael Larson">Michael Larson</a>, who won $110,237 on <i><a href="../../../p/r/e/Press_Your_Luck_bcff.html" title="Press Your Luck">Press Your Luck</a></i> in 1984. Larson's record was achieved due to his memorization of the board patterns the show used. Alhough his episode was split into two episodes that aired on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_8.html" title="June 8">June 8</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_11.html" title="June 11">June 11</a>, the format that was spread over these episodes, with the second episode predominantley being the extended fourth round which is otherwise always confined to no more than seven or eight minutes.</p>
<p>In 2006, Larson's record was broken by Vicki-Ann Chrobak-Sadowski on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Price_is_Right_eae9.html" title="The Price is Right">The Price is Right</a></i>, who also set a regular show record in the process on the show's 35th season premiere. She won both Showcases, and on top of her regular game winnings ended up with $147,517 in cash and prizes.</p>

<p>The record for overall winnings on American game shows has changed hands quite a few times over the years. From the big money, scandal ridden quizzers of the 1950s to today, American game shows have had their fair share of big winners.</p>
<p>Although the fifties had their fair share of big money quiz winners (<a href="../../../h/e/r/Herb_Stempel_a3ee.html" title="Herb Stempel">Herb Stempel</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Van_Doren_46cb.html" title="Charles Van Doren">Charles Van Doren</a> of <i><a href="../../../t/w/e/Twenty_One_%28game_show%29_3935.html" title="Twenty One (game show)">Twenty One</a></i> infamy being two of the most notable), the biggest winner of them all was Teddy Nadler, who set a record that would stand for the next two decades by winning $252,000 on both <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_%2464%2C000_Question_2dff.html" title="The $64,000 Question">The $64,000 Question</a></i> and <i>The $64,000 Challenge</i>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>It wasn't until 1980 that Nadler's record fell. During the summer of that year, a US Naval officer named <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thom_McKee_5629.html" title="Thom McKee">Thom McKee</a> began a run on <i><a href="../../../t/i/c/Tic_Tac_Dough_df61.html" title="Tic Tac Dough">Tic Tac Dough</a></i> that carried over into the following season. Since champions on <i>Tic Tac Dough</i> played until they were defeated, and games on the show could end in ties with the pot carrying over, McKee was able to keep building his total as long as he kept winning (which wasn't always true on other shows). Altogether, McKee won $312,700 in cash and prizes in winning 43 games, which included eight cars (on <i>Tic Tac Dough</i> and its sister show, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Joker%27s_Wild_fd0e.html" title="The Joker's Wild">The Joker's Wild</a></i>, a contestant automatically won a car after every fifth game they won).</p>
<p>In 1999, McKee was passed by Michael Shutterly, who was the biggest winner in the first airing of <i><a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Wants_to_Be_a_Millionaire_cbb7.html" title="Who Wants to Be a Millionaire">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire</a></i> in the United States. Shutterly was the first contestant on the show to get to the 15th and final question, but elected to walk instead with $500,000, which made him the highest winner in game show history.</p>
<p>(Some people have regarded McKee's record as standing until 1999. This is technically untrue, as nine couples on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_%241%2C000%2C000_Chance_of_a_Lifetime_1468.html" title="The $1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime">The $1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime</a></i>, which debuted in January 1986 and ran until September 1987, won the show's top prize of $1,000,000 in cash and/or prizes. The couples that won the top prize in season one split $1,000,000 in cash, which totalled $500,000 each. The second season couples split $900,000 in cash, giving them $450,000 each. However, these prizes were won by <i>teams</i> of players instead of solo players, unlike McKee's, which he won all by himself.)</p>

John Carpenter</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>It was during the second airing of <i>Millionaire</i> in the United States that the show crowned its first million dollar winner. On November 19, 1999, <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Carpenter_%28game_show_contestant%29_6560.html" title="John Carpenter (game show contestant)">John Carpenter</a> climbed to the top without using any lifelines, save for a phone call on the final question to tell his father he was going to win the million dollars. After Carpenter answered the final question, which concerned Richard Nixon's appearance on <i><a href="../../../l/a/u/Laugh-In_ab31.html" title="Laugh-In">Laugh-In</a></i> in 1968, host Regis Philbin called the answer "the final answer heard 'round the world", then proclaimed Carpenter as the show's first millionaire.</p>
<p>Carpenter's record stayed safe until the following year. In early 2000, <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahim_Oberholtzer_5e2c.html" title="Rahim Oberholtzer">Rahim Oberholtzer</a>, a contestant on the revival of <i>Twenty One</i>, won four games in his appearances on the show, and combined with $120,000 he earned in the show's "Perfect 21" bonus round, he ended with $1.12 million in winnings, just enough to pass Carpenter (Maury Povich proclaimed him "the new game show king" when he topped Carpenter's mark).</p>

Curtis Warren</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Oberholtzer's record did not last long. Late in its run, the Fox show <i><a href="../../../g/r/e/Greed_%28game_show%29.html" title="Greed (game show)">Greed</a></i> began bringing back contestants who had won money on previous shows to try for $1 million extra. <a href="../../../c/u/r/Curtis_Warren_%28game_show_contestant%29_d45b.html" title="Curtis Warren (game show contestant)">Curtis Warren</a>, who was part of the first <i>team</i> to win $1,000,000 on the show, was one of the contestants brought back to do so on February 12, 2000. After answering an elimination question, Warren was given a question about TV shows that had been made into movies, with 8 choices (of which he had to identify the four correct answers). He successfully did so, earning an additional $1 million on top of the $410,000 he had won in his first appearance on the show, giving him $1,410,000 and the record.</p>
<p>Warren's record was even shorter lived than Oberholtzer's had been, lasting only four days.</p>
<p>Three days before Warren's big win, a contestant named <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Legler_bf76.html" title="David Legler">David Legler</a> on <i>Twenty One</i> began a run to the top. Four days after Warren's win, the run continued, with Legler earning a grand total of $1,765,000 in six wins to surpass Warren's total and become the third contestant in a span of two months to top $1,000,000 on a game show. (It should be noted that shortly after Rahim Oberholtzer's win, <i>Twenty One</i> changed its payoff structure, which is part of the reason why it took Legler 5 wins to reach $1 million in winnings and 6 to top the record instead of the four it took Oberholtzer to top Carpenter's record. For more on the structure, see the <i>Twenty One</i> page.)</p>
<p>Legler held the record for well over a year. Around the turn of the year, <i>Millionaire</i>, deciding that it had been too long (five months) since their top prize had been won, began offering an accumulating jackpot, which increased by $10,000 each time the top prize was not won in a game. The prize reached $2,180,000 on April 10, 2001, the night that <a href="../../../k/e/v/Kevin_Olmstead_f48c.html" title="Kevin Olmstead">Kevin Olmstead</a> took the hot seat.</p>
<p>After answering all 15 questions, including the final one about Igor Sikorsky's invention of the helicopter, Olmstead became the first contestant to top $2 million in total winnings on a game show and supplanted Legler as the all time leader. It was said among some that the record might last forever.</p>

Ken Jennings</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>However, for its twentieth season which began in 2003, <i><a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy%21.html" title="Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a></i> changed their rules to allow contestants to continue playing until they lost. Theoretically, a person could accumulate millions of dollars, just as long as they kept winning. On June 2, 2004, such a streak began.</p>
<p><a href="../../../k/e/n/Ken_Jennings_ed15.html" title="Ken Jennings">Ken Jennings</a>, a software engineer from Utah, dethroned the reigning champion that day and began a streak that continued for the next two months to finish the season, and the first 3 that season 21 spanned. By the time his streak ended on November 30, 2004, Jennings had won $2,522,700 in cash, which was over $300,000 more than Olmstead had won.</p>
<p>Shortly after Jennings' streak ended, <i>Jeopardy!</i> decided to see how he would fare in tournament play. On February 2, 2005, the show launched its <a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy%21_Ultimate_Tournament_of_Champions_28fe.html" title="Jeopardy! Ultimate Tournament of Champions">Ultimate Tournament of Champions</a>, inviting back 144 past champions (including the highest-winning five-time champions and all tournament winners (save those from the defunct Seniors Tournaments)) to compete over the next three months in a five-round elimination tournament with a $2 million grand prize. Jennings received a <a href="../../../b/y/e/Bye_%28sports%29.html" title="Bye (sports)">bye</a> into the finals of the tournament, where he faced <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerome_Vered_cb5b.html" title="Jerome Vered">Jerome Vered</a>, a record-holding champion from the 1990s, and <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brad_Rutter_d8f3.html" title="Brad Rutter">Brad Rutter</a>, winner of the 2002 <a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy%21_Million_Dollar_Masters_4d67.html" title="Jeopardy!

<p>In the tournament's three-day final, Rutter handily defeated Jennings and Vered to win the tournament and $2,000,000. Including the $1.18 million he had won in his previous <i>Jeopardy!</i> appearances (five regular season games, a Tournament of Champions win, the Masters win, and three matches in the earlier rounds of the UToC), Rutter has won $3,255,102 in cash. Jennings won an additional $500,000 for his second-place finish and is thus second behind Rutter in all-time winnings at $3,022,700.</p>
