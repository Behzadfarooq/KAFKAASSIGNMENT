<p>The original intent of Amway's founders was to create a business using a novel means of product distribution that facilitates entrepreneurialism, understanding of economic management, and economic independence among its associates (i.e. distributors; the term currently in use is Independent Business Owners, or IBOs). Rich DeVos also wrote a book called <i>Compassionate Capitalism</i> while Jay Van Andel wrote a book entitled <i>An Enterprising Life</i>.</p>

Friends since childhood, Van Andel and DeVos became business partners in endeavors such as a hamburger stand, air charter service, and a sailing business.</p>
<p>Ja-Ri was incorporated in 1959, and changed its name to "Amway" in 1963.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> All Amway and Quixtar distributors are "downline" to the founders. Their first product was the laundry detergent L.O.C. In 1964 the Amway Sales Corporation, Amway Services Corporation, and Amway Manufacturing Corporation, merged to form a single company.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>Amway bought the <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutual_Broadcasting_System_6892.html" title="Mutual Broadcasting System">Mutual Broadcasting System</a> radio network in 1977 and sold it in 1985.</p>
<p>Amway expanded overseas to Australia in 1971, to Europe in 1973, to parts of Asia in 1974, to Japan in 1979, to Latin America in 1985, to China in 1995, to Africa in 1997, and to Russia in 2005.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> Amway India was established in 1995 and commenced commercial operations in 1998 <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The product line grew, with a new detergent <a href="../../../s/a/8/SA8_9d05.html" title="SA8">SA8</a> added in 1960, and later the hair care range Satinique (1965) and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artistry_%28cosmetics%29.html" title="Artistry (cosmetics)">Artistry</a>(1968).

</dl>
<p>In the 1979 <i>In re. Amway Corp.</i> (93 F.T.C. 618) ruling,<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Trade_Commission_eba7.html" title="Federal Trade Commission">Federal Trade Commission</a> found that Amway does not qualify as an illegal pyramid scheme since the main aim of the enterprise is the sale of product and money is paid only for business volume, personal and group. It did, however, order Amway to change several business practices and prohibited the company from misrepresenting the amount of profit, earnings or sales its distributors are likely to achieve. Amway was ordered to accompany any such statements with the actual averages per distributor, pointing out that more than half of the distributors do not make any money, with the average distributor making less than $100 per month. The order was violated with a 1986 ad campaign, resulting in a $100,000 fine.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>Amway (and its American online incarnation, Quixtar) have been controversial due to allegations that these companies are <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyramid_scheme.html" title="Pyramid scheme">pyramid schemes</a> or <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cults</a>, despite the 1979 FTC ruling (93 F.T.C. 618 (1979))<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> that legitimized the Amway business. The case revealed that, as of 1979, most of the products sold by Amway were to the Independent Business Owners (IBOs) themselves for personal consumption rather than to retail consumers who weren't enrolled as IBOs. Buying products or directing clients to buy from Amway or <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quixtar.html" title="Quixtar">Quixtar</a> gives IBOs points and they are paid back on the number of points that they generate from personal consumption or from client volume. An existing IBO can sponsor others to get an IBO number so that they can help others divert their buying habit from other stores to Amway or Quixtar. Thus, the business grows as a greater number of people join the group. The share of profit is based on the volume that an IBO is responsible for each month, therefore an IBO may actually make more money per month than the IBO who sponsored them into the Business.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/w/Amway.html" title="Edit section: Other legal cases">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Other legal cases</span></h3>
<p>In 1983, Amway pleaded guilty to criminal <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_evasion.html" title="Tax evasion">tax evasion</a> and <a href="../../../c/u/s/Customs_%28tax%29.html" title="Customs (tax)">customs</a> <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraud.html" title="Fraud">fraud</a> in Canada, resulting in a fine of $25 million CAD, the largest fine ever imposed in that country. The company was fined another $45 million CAD in 1989 to settle a suit brought by Canada's trade office.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup> In an 1994 interview, Amway co-founder Rich DeVos stated that this incident had been his greatest "moral or spiritual challenge", first in "soul searching as to whether they had done anything wrong" and then for pleading guilty for technical reasons, despite believing they were innocent of the charges. DeVos stated he believed that the case had been motivated by "political reasons".<sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America_ae97.html" title="Recording Industry Association of America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA), as part of its anti-piracy efforts, sued Amway and several distributors in 1995. The RIAA alleged that copyrighted music was used on "highly profitable" training videotapes.<sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[15]</a></sup> Amway settled the case out of court for $9 million.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup> In a related lawsuit initiated by the distributors involved, the Court established that Mahaleel Lee Luster, who had been contracted to make the videotapes, had violated copyright without the knowledge of three of the five of those distributors.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup></p>
<p>Amway grew quickly in China starting from 1995. In 1998, after abuses of illegal pyramid schemes led to riots, the Chinese Government enacted a ban on all direct selling companies, including Amway.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup> After negotiations, some companies like Amway, Avon, and Mary Kay continued to operate through a network of retail stores promoted by an independent sales force. Although multi-level payments were still banned, it is alleged that Amway didn't significantly alter its pay scheme, and justified them as payments for services. <sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup> In 2006 Amway was one of the first companies to receive a license to resume direct sales. At the time they had a reported 180,000 sales representatives, 140 stores, and $2 billion in annual sales.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup> Multi-level marketing (commissions on sales of new sales persons recruited) is still forbidden.</p>

<p>In 1999 the founders of the Amway corporation launched a sister (and separate) <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet.html" title="Internet">Internet</a>-based company named <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quixtar.html" title="Quixtar">Quixtar</a>. The <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alticor.html" title="Alticor">Alticor</a> corporation owns both Amway and Quixtar, plus several other concerns. Quixtar replaced the North American business of Amway in 2001, with Amway operating in the rest of the world. Amway's internet sales in Europe are conducted via their Amivo website. The Access Business Group was split off to handle manufacturing.</p>
<p>Later additions to the core product range included water filters and cookware.<sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup> The eSpring water filter, introduced in 2000 and developed by Alticor, includes eCoupled wireless power induction technology.

<p>A significant part of the Amway culture is the promotion and sale of training materials, as well as the attendance at meetings and rallies locally, regionally, and nationally. Training includes education about the topic of generalized, non-Amway specific <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entrepreneurship.html" title="Entrepreneurship">entrepreneurship</a>. The purpose of this is to create interest and enthusiasm. They are intended to maintain and increase membership, and to inspire IBOs to be more successful in their businesses. To a casual observer, they have some resemblance to a religious gathering, due to the fact that meetings and rallies within some distributor organisations in the United States begin with the Pledge of Allegiance and a prayer. (As noted above, <a href="../../../e/x/i/Exit_counseling.html" title="Exit counseling">exit counseling</a> groups have expressed concern in regards to this.) By involving people in a regular schedule of meetings, people are encouraged to maintain their focus, and to not be distracted by critics and other nay-sayers. Their training organisations', AMOs, perception of the role of women, though, always includes successful women in awards, recognition and speaking engagements. One rarely, if ever, sees a male, married distributor speak on stage without his wife getting equal billing, and explaining her active role in the business.</p>
<p>Typically, IBOs spend money on tapes, books, and seminars which are promoted to IBOs as the preferred way to learn the "business skills of the IBOs" and to maintain their desire to build their business. These "Business Support Materials", or "BSMs", are not provided by Amway itself but organizations often described as Amway Motivational Organizations (AMO) in general run by people in the higher ranks of the organization. One example of an AMO is Crown Ambassador Dexter Yager's organization, the International Dreambuilders' Association/Digital Alliance (usually simply referred to by the abbreviation IDA), one of the largest and most widely-known AMOs. Claims regarding the support material (also known as "tools" in AMO parlance) range from "can be of help to an IBO" to some organizations claiming they "are absolutely required" to "build a big business". Investigations like one done by Dateline NBC<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup> in April 2003 (this episode aired in 2004) suggested that most of the money being earned by these successful individuals was coming from the hidden "tools" business rather than through selling the company products.</p>

<p>Several groups including those associated with the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-cult_movement.html" title="Anti-cult movement">anti-cult movement</a> have expressed concern that tactics of AMOs may constitute cult-like activity. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Hassan_d776.html" title="Steven Hassan">Steven Hassan's</a> Freedom of Mind Center lists the practices of AMOs as potentially abusive according to his <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mind_control.html#Steven_Hassan.27s_BITE_model" title="Mind control">"BITE" Model of mind control</a>.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[39]</a></sup> Other similar organizations that have expressed concern with the activities of AMOs in practice include FACTnet,<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[40]</a></sup> Cult Awareness and Information Centre (Australia),<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[41]</a></sup> and others.

Procter &amp; Gamble alleged that several Amway distributors were behind a resurgence of the urban legend in the 1990s and sued several independent Amway distributors and the parent company for defamation and slander. After more than a decade of lawsuits in multiple states, by 2003 all allegations against Amway and Amway distributors had been dismissed, with the trial judge declaring <i>"Throughout this and its related protracted and duplicative litigation, P&amp;G has tried to evade the law of the case doctrine, and has squandered scarce judicial resources"</i>.<sup id="_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#_note-43" title="">[44]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#_note-44" title="">[45]</a></sup> However, in October 2005 a Utah appeals court reversed part of the decision dismissing the case against one Amway distributor, Randy Haugen, and remanded it to the earlier court for further proceedings.<sup id="_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#_note-45" title="">[46]</a></sup> On 3/20/2007 P&amp;G was awarded $19.5M by a jury.
