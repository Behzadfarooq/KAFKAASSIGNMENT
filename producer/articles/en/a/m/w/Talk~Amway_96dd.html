<p>I'm adding this section because the massive debate below is a little intimidating to wade through, espiecally if someone just wants to let people know about simple &amp; uncontroversial change.</p>
<ul>
<li>Under <b>Legal rulings</b>, when referring to Amway's 1983 pleading, changed Dick DeVos to Richard DeVos. While Dick is technically a valid shortening of Richard, the co-founder of Amway is usually referred to as Richard, while his son is referred to as Dick.</li>

<p>I have edited the article today (08 January 2003) to promote a more neutral point of view. The article seemed to be biased, just slightly, to an anti-amway perspective; I have deletedo - that is a name exclusive to critics of Amway, and should be mentioned as such. Someone doing that search will not find answers from Amway or pro-Amway folks as they don't use that term.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>

<dl>
<dd>It seems that you are trying to claim that only answers from Amway or pro-Amway folks are appropriate to this article. Brad Eleven</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>There are, aligned with Quixtar, groups like ina.net that fit this description and do the training and motivation of Quixtar distributors, who distribute Amway and other products through a common distribution arm.</p>
<dl>
<dd>So what's your point again? <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>these groups are called Independent Marketing Companies or something else by Quixter, ina.net is one of these.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's a fundamental issue with direct multi-level marketing organizations that they can't control the behavior of frontline distributors, probably no more than Arafat can control the timing of suicide bombers. Same top-down versus bottom-up behavior influence debate... the Amway Corp does try to make certain things standard, e.g. no "door to door selling", and they succeed in general, but they have only a few blunt instruments with which to do so.</p>
<p>This article needs to be updated, and the "AMOs" need to be documented - I don't doubt that somewhere somehow someone used this name for them, but they serve a legitimate role in multi-level marketing, although they may overstep it and become bad religions...</p>

<dd>Oh God. Now 24 starts to preach MLM in addition to "embodied mind" and "ecoregion". <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>ecologists preach "ecoregion", psychologists preach "embodied mind" - I merely report. As to your issue with MLM, it's seems to me to be an issue with <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a>. Which I think I gave very neutral treatment to. You want an economic system driven by human desire and advertising, you're going to see a lot of people conned, often. That may or may not be the fault of the organization that provides the products and the attracive payoff scheme.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>a neutral fact is that Amway has created more millionaires than any other company in the world, Microsoft is only second. Both companies are hated but it's a combination of envy *and* perhaps some abuses of market position that account for it. MLM schemes come and go, Amway/Quixtar has stayed. Of course not everyone succeeds in it. But the millionaires aren't complaining.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>... and a citation for this "neutral fact"? <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's not at all neutral, and is an assertion, not a fact. It seems to be impossible to prove, since the "Amway millionaires" overwhelmingly owe their financial success not to Amway, but to the sales of books, tapes, and seminar tickets--and these same people cannot acknowledge this <i>proven</i> fact because of the obvious damage it would cause to the people to whom they claim that there is no profit in these "tools".

<dd><i>The FTC ruling was allegedly initiated by Proctor and Gamble, who competes with Amway for sales of packaged consumer goods. P&amp;G were concerned about continued erosion of their market share by Amway and businesses with a similar structure to Amway's.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Who has alleged this when and where?</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Rather than contest the charges, which could have resulted in distributors suffering financially because of a court injunction prenting business during a trial, Amway paid the fine. Amway later successfully appealed the fine but did not appeal the conviction -- again to avoid causing suffering to its network of distributors.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>How could they appeal the conviction when they had pleaded guilty in the first place? Are you saying that they first paid the fine, then successfully appealed the fine and got the money back? How much did they pay in the end? <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxelBoldt_4306.html" title="User:AxelBoldt">AxelBoldt</a> 03:42 Jan 15, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>____ I see somebody has added something about Emma Page jewellery being available through Amway in Australia, as well as New Zealand. Please provide a source for this. I am well aware of its availability in NZ; my wife and I are both Amway distributors and have sold Emma Page jewellery under Amway auspices. In Australia, however, my understanding is that Emma Page has <i><b>its own</b></i> distribution network; only in New Zealand does it contract Amway. That was the last I heard (last year) - that Australian Amway distributors were very envious of their New Zealand counterparts because there is a substantial profit in Emma Page. Now, for all I know, this MAY have changed. If it has, could you name your source? I will make some inquiries myself; in the meantime, I will let your edit stand. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">Davidcannon</a> 11:09, 29 Mar 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I came to this site looking for unbiased information so that I could make a fair evaluation for myself. I have previously been highly skeptical of all multi-level marketing systems and remain so, however, I was afraid I had not been open minded about the idea and wanted more information. I did not find it. This article contains numerous spelling and/or grammatical errors and shows poor proofreading. "IBO" is never written out on this page, I think it's probably "Independent Business Organizatons" or something like that, but abbreviations should be explained on this page. The only pro-Amway linnk is their corporate website, there must be others. The use of the word "kingpin" and the phrase "train wreck" are very far from the Wikipedia call for unbiased language and the paragraph that cites Independent Media TV as well as one that follows do not allow for errors in reporting or POV in those reports but recite the reports as facts themselves. This article needs a lot of work. Unfortunately, I came here looking for information I didn't already have and still don't. Someone else will have to rewrite this entry and I will have to look elsewhere for my information. -- DH 2005.04.07</p>
<p>Your point is well taken. It seems that Amway/Quixtar requires its own page, with links to articles about the various AMOs which have, unfortunately, given the Amway Corporation a bad name. OTOH, Amway--and Richard DeVos in particular--have acknowledged the problem with AMOs, but have not taken any steps to resolve the problem. It is my opinion, from personal experience and research, that the Amway Corporation's marketing plan is extremely fair: Unlike pyramid schemes, their plan requires retail sales, and does not reward individuals for simply finding another hard-working individual whose efforts they can profit from, simply from having sponsored him or her. In particular, it has been shown that the Amway/Quixtar income represents only a fraction of the total income of the wealthiest distributors. Most of the income results from the markup on books, tapes, seminar tickets, and other merchandise sold to unsuspecting distributors, who believe--and in some cases, are told--that these "tools" are sold at cost plus a small margin to cover shipping and other associated expenses. The evidence for this assertion is readily available as free and public information in the dozens of lawsuits filed by distributors who do not like the unfair terms of the "tool business."

<p>I've added some information surrounding Amway's cultic characteristics and complications with the legal system, as well as my own observations regarding the behavioural conformity of AMOs with Hassan and Jay Lifton's models of mind control, and mention of G Robert Blakey's expert report from Amway v Proctor &amp; Gamble. However, I've tried to keep this information limited to what I hope are demonstrable facts rather than value judgements/interpretations, and have also largely confined my additions to the "Criticisms" section. Although my opinion of Amway most certainly is not either neutral or positive, it is my hope that because my additions have been contained in Criticisms, and because I have made an attempt to keep my additions factual, a reasonably neutral tone can be maintained, while at the same time noting Amway's less ethically desirable characteristics. I have also removed the references to the terms "train wreck" and "kingpins" in an attempt to create a more neutral tone. - <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetrus4_c8c1.html" title="User:Petrus4">Petrus</a> 06/05/2005</p>
<p>Someone has removed my reference to the Blakey report, which I don't believe is really appropriate. That report includes important information about the structure of Amway...I think it's important that someone thinking of becoming involved with Amway should know if they are potentially becoming involved with a quasi-criminal organisation. - <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetrus4_c8c1.html" title="User:Petrus4">Petrus</a> 08/05/2005</p>

<p>The article needs some work to be brought current; but I'm not sure the best way to go about it. After the 1999 reorganization, a lot of elements were relabeled. The large corporation formerly known as Amway is now called Alticor; the North American division is called Quixtar; the products manufacturing division is now called Access Business Group; and the segment of the company that does business outside North America is now called Amway.</p>
<p>In addition, the word "distributor" is no longer used within the organization; the function has been relabeled "Independent Business Owner" (IBO). There are other examples like this.</p>
<p>The article should also mention the company line given to explain the reorganization (that the Quixtar online division accounted for 95+% of their business within it's first year of operation, so they relegated the Amway name to international business) and the counterpoint that in the States, "Amway" had colloquially become synonymous with "scam" and the company was probably trying to do whatever it took to lose that image.</p>
<p>Because a lot of people don't know about the 1999 reorganization (and because it's kind of confusing) the relabeling is going to have to be explained carefully. Also, a lot of people are unfamiliar with the term "IBO" but are much more familiar with the deprecated "distributor."</p>
<p>Suggestions? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshf_2e3c.html" title="User:Joshf">Joshf</a> 9 July 2005 12:48 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for that careful analysis. I have a suggestion (though I'm not especially familiar with Amway/Aticor/Quixtar I have read and edited many articles). As an encyclopedia it is best if our articles report on what <i>was</i> as well as what <i>is</i>. So rather than changing the old label to the new label, or vice versa, it be better to write a history that essentially says, "When the company started it was like this. Then it was like this. As of 1999, it is now like this." It sounds like the 1999 reorganization deserves a section or at least a major paragraph, while right now it gets just two sentences (there may also be some other bits and pieces that can be moved). May I also suggest that you <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">be bold</a> and do the edit yourself? There may be some websites in the list of links that can provide sources. Cheers, -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 23:37, July 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Personally, I wouldn't recommend including the relabelling in a more extensive way than simply offering a glossary of terms. The primary motivation behind the name changes/re-organisation was to attempt to shed the company's entrenched global image of at worst a commercial cult, and at best a quasi-legal organisation with a fundamental structure and function very similar to the traditional crime syndicate, which was ultimately only allowed to do business in the US in particular due to a technicality. Offer a translation table, perhaps, but simply switching to use of the new names could lead to exactly the kind of confusion which those who engineered the name changes were hoping for.</p>
<dl>
<dd>What I want to do is *avoid* the confusion and so put the "translation" table in an obvious and accessible spot; probably near the beginning of the document. I think the only way to make it flow with the rest of the article is to explain the '99 merger right off the bat; maybe in the intro or maybe make the first paragraph a history with an explanation of the merger/name change. I also think it'd be worth it to merge this with <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alticor.html" title="Alticor">Alticor</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quixtar.html" title="Quixtar">Quixtar</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshf_2e3c.html" title="User:Joshf">Joshf</a> 14:46, 11 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Too focused on Dexter Yager's organization which is totally unreflective of the business in other parts of the world especially the fastest growing and already the biggest part of the Amway business, the Asia and Asia Pacific region. Misses completely the success of Foo Howe Kean, a legendary figure as a Crown Ambassador in 3 different countries, and a more identifieable figurehead in the huge Asian region.</p>
<p>Very long sections on critism and controversy, and yet for such a huge business the article is extremely short on business success details. Completely glosses over the fact that it has made many millionaires all over the world. Does not mentione the core products such as the Nutrilite range, which has a long history and contribution in the field of nutrition, the founder being Carl Rhemborg, who created the first multivitamin and mineral supplement over 70 years ago. Also misses the point that Euromonitor has named Artistry as the top 5 leading prestige cosmetic brand in the world.</p>
<p>Very biased article.</p>
<p>-Johan</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it's not POV'ed. Yager is mentioned twice. The article comments on Amway's profits in East Asia. Criticism and controversy are discussed because there is lots of criticism and controversy surrounding this company. Furthermore, the millionaires you mention most likely made their riches not from selling products but from selling tools. If you want to give people more information on Nutrilite and Artistry, you're welcome to make additions to the article, rather than complaining.</dd>
</dl>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, it is very POVed. Why Yager has an entire paragraph at all concerning him is beyond me, except for the fact he is American, he doesn't represent Amway to the world at large by any means. What you said, "Furthermore, the millionaires you mention most likely made their riches not from selling products but from selling tools." is patently untrue. For every person or couple that has made money this way, I can mention at least 10 who doesn't, mostly in the biggest market of Amway, the Asian region. I am willing to contribute ( I wrote the part about the owners being elected chairmen of the Chambers of Commerce) However, there are so many missing parts, it merits a total rewrite. I loathe to do this, because i get the feeling this is not the wiki way of doing things.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>No, not really. Yager is THE major distributor/tools provider and is hailed by many Amway/Quixtar LOSs. A paragraph is a reasonable amount of text devoted to him. What, is Amway embarrased of Yager now? Second, the sentence you quoted is accurate, not biased, as the main money in AmQuix comes from tools. I can also counter with the law of averages: For every person in AmQuix who makes a good income ~($50,000yr), dozens have to be losing money to bring the average income to $137/month. Finally, your "owners elected chairmen" part is completely IRRELEVANT to the Amway business. Just because you don't agree with the article, and because it discusses controversial issues regarding Amway.</dd>

<dd>No, really. Yager is not very well known in regions which make up the biggest part of Amway. Foo Howe Kean and Nakajima are. To say that the American Yager in any way represents what Amway is to the majority of the world is a blatantly western-centric POV. AmQuix is the American establishment of Amway, however Amway is in over 90 countries and territories, the statistics in Amway America does not represent the entire world. Amway aside, 95% of conventional business's fail within their first 5 years. The incorrect notion that people have to lose money for someone to succeed in Amway is like blaming the 5% of successful conventional businesses for 95% failures. In no way does the plan require you to lose money in the Amway business, however the low barrier of entry means more people are willing to invest in the Amway business compared to conventional business'. The owners being elected chairmen of the Chambers of Commerce is completely relevant for it shows the standing of Amway among the business community.</dd>

<dd>First, if you want to add information about Asian diamonds, feel free to do so. Are you embarrased of Yager? Many Asian LOS (Gala, for example) push just as many tools as Yager's org. Second, the "95% of businesses fail during the first five years" is a direct quote from a motivational "tools" tape; it is also FALSE. According to the Small Business Association, "66.0 percent of businesses remained open at least 2 years, 49.6 percent at least 4 years, and 39.5 percent at least 6 years" <a href="http://amquix.info/pdfs/small_business_faqs.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://amquix.info/pdfs/small_business_faqs.pdf" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Please stop posting tapespeak lies. Third, by its very nature as a closed pyramid, the plan REQUIRES that those at the bottom lose money. All those at the bottom will lose money until they recruit enough people; at that point, those people will lose money until they recruit enough, etc. Finally, the owners' status as members of the CoC has absolutely NO BEARING on Amway as a business, and is therefore IRRELEVANT. The owners are not being discussed in this article; Amway is. And if you care to know what the actual "business community" thinks about Amway IBOs, I'll tell you: they're a laughing stock.</dd>

<dd>Adding information is one thing, removing plenty of information pertinent only to American Amway is another. Its wholesale changes. What I'm embarrassed with is that the more successful Asians are somehow represented by an American. No single distributor organization represents Amway. Its a worldwide phenomenon and its insulting to assume any one person as the definitive image bearer of the business. The 95% quote i got from the much vauted internet of yours, not from any tape. Here is the link and they quote the Small Business Association too: <a href="http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/smallbusiness/a/whybusfail.htm" class="external free" title="http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/smallbusiness/a/whybusfail.htm" rel="nofollow">http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/smallbusiness/a/whybusfail.htm</a> Whatever the numbers are, it still validates my point, taking your own numbers, its like blaming the top 39.5% for the failures of the rest.</dd>
<dd>Your insistence that the Amway business plan is a pyramid shows your POV in this matter. Firstly, the FTC (Federal Trade Commision) totally disagrees with you. This is from the FTC website "In In re Amway Corp.,(19) another landmark decision from the 1970's, the FTC distinguished an illegal pyramid from a legitimate multilevel marketing program." <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/speeches/other/dvimf16.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.ftc.gov/speeches/other/dvimf16.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftc.gov/speeches/other/dvimf16.htm</a> Maybe its your lack of understanding of plan that is making this unclear to you. The downlines can be very rich and still the upline can fail in the business. It happens all the time and regularly at that.</dd>
<dd>Yes, the standing of the owners and founder of Amway has plenty to do with Amway Corp. If knew the history of the company, what Amway is today are totally based on the human principles put forward by their founder and owners. It is these very owners which were elected as the chairmen of Chamber of Commerce, showing the trust of the business community on the principles which are the foundation of Amway Corporation today.</dd>
<dd>Your laughing stock comment shows yet another ingrained POV from yourself. A business leader does not laugh at a multibillion dollar multinational company.</dd>

<dd>Why are you so insistent upoin removing information? Are you embarrased by Yager? If, as you say, Amway has many faces, then Yager is STILL ONE OF THEM. So add info about Asian IBOs if you want to diversify, but don't expect that this article will be only complimentary towards Amway. What is "Blaming the top 39.% percent for the failures of the rest" supposed to mean? I didn't blame anyone, I simply quoted statistics. So cut the tapespeak. The Amway plan IS a pyramid; the only reason that the FTC declared it "not illegal" is because of the 70% rule, which demands that 70% of products be sold OUTSIDE the organization. We both know that this rule is not enforced. The recruiting and sponsoring aspect of the plan is a pyramid. I still maintain that the standing of the owners is irrelevant, as are the "principles that it was founded on" because the only principle that the company curently follows ius worshipping the almighty dollar and upline. As far as being the "laughing stock," ask any serious businessman what he thinks of an Amway IBO. Here's something comparing real businesses with IBOships <a href="http://www.webraw.com/quixtar/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2110" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.webraw.com/quixtar/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2110" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. And as far as POV goes, yes I have a POV, so do you (a POV which is clearly taken from Amway tapes). The point is that the article is NPOV. Finally, this is not the place to debate the merits and demerits of Amway; why don't you go to <a href="http://www.webraw.com/quixtar" class="external text" title="http://www.webraw.com/quixtar" rel="nofollow">Quixtar Blog</a> and debate there?</dd>

<dd>why are you so insistent in getting me to say i'm embarassed of yager? Every post you have made has asked me the same question, and everytime I have replied "I'm embarrassed that in the article, any one distributor is made out as if he represents Amway" Yager by far and away doesn't. <b>No one</b> does. If I have to list out every single succesful organization, all with their own methods and individuality, it would be like writing a book. In the tiny country of Malaysia alone there are 8 crown ambassadors and hundreds of emeralds and above, lets not include the likes of China, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan and India. No single distributor is so signifacant in Amway today that they are worth mentioning in a summary artcile like this. It is an insult to the other successful distributors to leave any out. Are you willing to call the Amway company of each 90 countries and territories to list out all the succesful distributors and their assets like Yager was in this article?</dd>
<dd>Yes you did blame, "For every person in AmQuix who makes a good income dozens have to be losing money" which is really blatantly inane assesment, its like saying, for all the succesful business in this world, the rest must lose money. Anyone who actually knows the amway marketing plan would know this. As the FTC said, there is a huge difference in a pyramid scheme and a multilevel marketing system. In a legitimate MLM system, the top guy can easily fail as the bottom guy. the lower level guys can be insanely succeesful and his own sponsor can still fail.</dd>
<dd>"Cut the tape speak"? How about you cut the condescending attitude.</dd>
<dd>"We both know that this rule is not enforced." Actually, by your comments, you don't really know much about happens besides what anti-amway zealots tell you. The 70% percent rule is enforced in the distributor level and its a rule that is alive and well.</dd>
<dd>"ask any serious businessman what he thinks of an Amway IBO". Ok, how about asking the the many businessmen who made made their millions outside Amway in malaysia and why they are doing Amway now. Or possibly a certain Dato' Zul, who runs a billion ringgit company and 12 other companies, why he is closing down each one, one by one, to do Amway. Your limited experience of people laughing at Amway is consigned to your own small region. Amway Asia is huge and well respected. It is this sort of so called critisism which is entirely non-universal which litters the whole article.</dd>
<dd>The point of my post in this discussion page was to say that the article is POVed. And that is still the reason I continue to post here.</dd>

<dd>Yager is significant because he was one of the original developers of motivational "tools" which are for the most part responsible for the controversial nature of Amway businesses. You may call the criticism of Amway "non-universal" but that does not diminish the fact that there are some serious problems with the company, at least in the United States, Canada and India. Just because only a fraction of the apple is rotten does not mean it should be ignored, lest the rot spread to other parts.</dd>
<dd>I never said "for all the succesful business in this world, the rest must lose money." Saying that I made such a comparison is a straw-man technique and is utilized in many of Amway motivational tapes (Tapespeak, again!) However, say that a Diamond income is about $150,000. Amway ITSELF states that average distributor income is $1,380 annually BEFORE EXPENSES. Therefore, to bring the average down to the given figure, over 13,000 people must be LOSING money in the Amway business<a href="http://www.webraw.com/quixtar/forum/viewtopic.php?p=32605&amp;highlight=#32605" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.webraw.com/quixtar/forum/viewtopic.php?p=32605&amp;highlight=#32605" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.</dd>
<dd>As far as tapespeak, I call them as I see them.</dd>
<dd>I don't need to listen to "anti-Amway zealots" to know what happens. Many American LOS encourage people to "buy from themselves" and to recruit more members. The "70% of products must be retailed to outside consumers" is more often than not IGNORED, and the focus is made on recruiting. Moreover, it is difficult to retail Amway products with their inflated prices (compared to Walmart, Costco, etc) and Amways debilitating restrictions on advertising and reselling products.</dd>
<dd>Once again, the Amway article is accurate and fair. If you don't feel that it does justice to Amway Asia, then feel free to help out.</dd>

<p>I'm unsure as to why the above comment was signed with my username, when I have no recollection of writing it. Perhaps the original author made a mistake, or perhaps they were seeking to deliberately impersonate me. Given the degree of moral ambiguity which has at times been observed in Amway's supporters, I can only speculate as to what this individual's motives may have been.</p>
<p>Also in response to the above - it is well known that senior Amway distributors dislike any information about the business' less positive elements becoming public knowledge at all. For all the people who may have become wealthy via Amway, the business remains at least a partially criminal organisation, and while noting its successes, any genuinely objective reference about it must not hesitate in classifying it as such. Organisations such as Amway and the Church of Scientology have been made painfully aware of the ability of the Internet to subject them to a level of a forced accountability which they never experienced in the purely offline world, and they are being made to realise that despite whatever efforts they may make to the contrary, the truth about who and what they really are will become known. Cults can still run, but online they can no longer hide.<br />

<dd>The wrong username was an editing error, I apologize. This is my first time using the wikipedia. An example of a POV is your statement "For all the people who may have become wealthy via Amway, the business remains at least a partially criminal organisation" which has no basis at all. Having experienced the business personally in the Asian region, there is no criminal element in it whatsoever. And as i have said before, the Asian region the majority of Amway's business.</dd>
</dl>
<hr />
<p>I have extensive experience with two distinct Amway AMOs. For this article to ignore them is like an article on the world history ignoring the impact of technology. Simply put, it is impossible to build a large multi-level/network marketing business such as Amway or Quixtar without the support of a motivational organization such as an AMO. Consider what owning a franchise would be like without constistent marketing support. Consider also that franchisers ensure that they'll make money from the deal--and that while their motives may seem justified, their methods are not always ethical.</p>
<p>I can see how people with AMO knowledge and an inclination to expose them might contribute material that seems biased. By the same token, I know personally how people currently involved with an AMO become very defensive. I personally argued with newcomers who immediately saw that the tools' prices suggested profit-taking in their sales--before I had any inkling that anyone was profiting from the sales of books, tapes, or seminar tickets.</p>
<p>There is a distinct difference between people who have been unsuccessful with an Amway/AMO and people who have enjoyed success in the same situation. In the former case, the tendency is to blame the organization--and to be perceived that way. There are several highly successful Amway IBOs who have quit and/or sued their respective AMOs over unfair business practices. Conversely, very few successful Amway IBOs have sued Amway.</p>
<p>As for the claim that Amway has produced more millionaires than any other company in the world, I would like to see some documentation. I seriously doubt that many millionaires have been created by Amway alone. Even if some Amway IBOs have taken their Amway income and invested it or diversified into other high-income businesses (e.g., real estate development, automobile dealerships), the Amway corporation just doesn't pay enough for anyone to even gross $1M in one year's time. I'd like to know more about the definition of "millionaire". Is it someone who has $1M or more in assets? Someone who has earned $1M or more in one year?</p>
<p>In 1990, I attained the level of Pearl Direct Distributor, with a very profitable organization. That is, I had twenty personally sponsored distributors, and nine were actively building their organizations. Two had gone direct, i.e., attained the level of Direct Distributor, and the other seven were Silver Producers (their organizations included at least one Direct, but they themselves hadn't qualified for Direct). My Amway checks included four distinct bonuses for speed of growth, overall volume, profit sharing, and for the number of direct distributors in my organization. My gross income from the Amway corporation--above bonuses plus PV bonuses--peaked at $3300/month. While the Pearl level is certainly not the highest level--and recognizing that the bonus structure has obviously changed over the past 15 years--let us consider my AMO income at that level. In five months after I made Pearl, I got AMO checks for $5400, $6100, $7900, $8700, and $9900. Let us be very clear: The AMO checks represented profit sharing from the AMO's sales of books, tapes, and seminar tickets, plus speaking fees I was paid for appearing at regional rallies. As I approached the Emerald level, several of my upline Diamonds counseled me to quit my job. I didn't want to quit, and I was very heavily pressured to do so. Among other things, I was offered a bigger cut of the profits from the tool volume in my organization. Aside from the staggering increase in tools income in the jump from Pearl to Emerald, I was taken aback at just how much money was at stake--and how much more the Diamonds and other high pin levels were making. It was obvious that the AMO income represented far more than their Amway income. After seeing a crossline Pearl get cut out of the AMO pie because of his religion (possibly particular to the AMO), I bailed out. I didn't want to quit my job because I enjoyed it, and I didn't want to get stuck doing what my AMO "upline" said to do because I needed the money.</p>
<p>I don't think it's important to "expose" the AMOs. I realize that some people are ashamed of Dexter Yager, and that some have deep respect for what he has accomplished. I think it's vital for an encyclopedia page to fully disclose all known information on any topic.</p>
<p>I don't think that this [discussion page] is the forum to relate AMO experiences. I personally had a bad experience that may or may not be representative of AMO participants, and so I decided to quit. I sold my Amway business. Take note that my AMO business was not considered saleable--the AMO decided who got my piece of the profits. Consider this fact the next time you hear (or say) that an Amway business and its attendant residual bonuses are willable and fully transferable.</p>
<p>I don't know what the best way to represent the AMOs is, but I am certain that they must be referenced. Perhaps a link to another page? For sure the claim that Amway has created the most millionaires should be either substantiated or removed. The current page is pretty representative of the Amway Corporation. Leaving out the AMOs doesn't work, although I support a neutral/positive page on the Amway Corporation. My experience with Amway is excellent: the company has unusually high integrity, its products are superior, if overpriced, and it has worked very hard to create a multilevel/network marketing system that truly rewards hard work, and only hard work. The same just can't be said of the AMOs.</p>
<p>Regarding the argument that Dexter Yager is an American and that IBOs in other countries have enjoyed great success: In any industry, the chief innovators are at least acknowledged. Dexter was a pioneer in that he figured out how to motivate people, to really help them to succeed--and he built in compensation for his efforts. That's revolutionary, and in theory, it's fair. Certainly the other super-IBOs worldwide owe something to Dexter. In many cases, he has provided his expertise, personally and via his closest associates, to IBOs the world over. You can be sure that he is compensated for this, whether by selling materials to the IBOs, providing production support, or through some other long-term arrangement. There is still nothing wrong with this.</p>
<p>The problem is simply that the AMOs are for the most part concealed. They are analogous to the lobbying industry in our government: they provide substantial leverage to the corporation and to the IBOs, but they are very secretive about their practices. Like the government's apparent unwillingness to reform the lobbying industry, Amway does a lot of talking about the problems with AMOs, but it refuses to take action. It is not at all obvious that most of the money earned by successful Amway IBOs comes from AMOs. Nor is it obvious that the AMOs do not use the same reward system as the Amway corporation. The AMOs have dominated the Amway corporation's distributor affairs organizations in the same way that their IBOs dominate Amway's volume.</p>
<p>I don't think it's important to make the AMOs wrong. Although they have had major problems with individual members (what wealthy organization doesn't?), their activities are not illegal, with the possible exception of some minor disclosures. Officially speaking, they are silent about the amount of money that they take in and pay out. Some individuals do misrepresent this aspect of AMOs, whether intentionally or naively.</p>

<dd>A discussion on FTC is incomplete without explicitly mentioning the 70% rule and 10 customer rule. This was central to the FTC decision. It is difficult to prove/disprove on Wikipedia whether distributors follow this rule.

<dd>Hiya. Re FTC v Amway, the 70% rule and 10 customer rules were indeed in place prior to the FTC case. They were <i>not</i> however crucial to the finding of Amway to not being an illegal pyramid. What the FTC said was that they prevent abuses of the marketing model - primarily inventory loading, but also helping ensure legitimate products. The 70% rule is often misinterpreted as a "70% retail sales rule" - ie you have to sell 70% of products to a non-distributor. This isn't the case, it's entirely about inventory loading. 70% of products you buy have to be used or resold. In other words, if you end up with a garage full of soap trying to get a "pin" then you're breaking the rules. In the old Amway model you would buy products and resell to your downline. Those wholesale sales are also covered by the 70% rule. In the new model A/Q mostly ships direct, so inventory loading is not an issue with downline volume, thus it primarily refers to personal use and sales to customers. The 10 customer rule is a slightly different story. If you have legitimate "outside" customers than this is "proof" that you have a legitimately marketable product. This protects against you against all sorts of accusations of scamming, which is why Amway/Quixtar has always kept it in some form. It was not however crucial to determination of whether you are an illegal pyramid or not. Indeed a few years ago in response to the Direct Selling Association, the FTC explicitly stated that the "level of internal consumption" (ie whether it's all used by distributors or not) plays no part in determining whether something is a pyramid or not. You can read the letter <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutquixtar.com/images/resources/ftc_letter.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.thetruthaboutquixtar.com/images/resources/ftc_letter.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<dd>Yes, as I pointed, I have not yet said anything about the interpretation of the rules. At least we should mention the names of the rules in the articles. For the interpretations we can quote some sources on which we have consensus. Whether these rules were "crucial" or just "an element" of the FTC decision is a very subtle point. At least that FTC link I mentioned emphasizes the need for products to move out of the network. I will check the links you gave, but I am offline for 2 days starting from now. -- <a href="../../../k/n/v/User%7EKnverma_ea5c.html" title="User:Knverma">Knverma</a> 15:35, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I can't find your link again, could you direct me please? Following too many articles&#160;:-(. The FTC letter I supplied clearly states that they do <i>not</i> "need" products to move out of the network. Also, be careful of <i>non sequitur</i> - the FTC often points out that outside sales are evidence that something is not a pyramid. This does not mean that lack of outside sales <i>is</i> evidence of a pyramid, that's a logical non sequitur. In any case, this issue is actually addressed in the Quixtar article, Quixtar rules explicitly require member/client volume in order to qualify for downline bonuses. On the other hand, this rule is not in place in the majority of international markets, which is Amway today and where the FTC doesn't have any jurisdiction.

Your point regarding <i>non sequitur</i> is valid in general. But in this case, let me quote: "<i>If a plan purports to sell a product or service, check to see whether its price is inflated, whether new members must buy costly inventory, or whether members make most "sales" to other members rather than the general public. If any of these conditions exist, the purported "sale" of the product or service may just mask a pyramid scheme that promotes an endless chain of recruiting and inventory loading.</i>". So can we now agree that FTC feels the "need" for porducts to move out of the network? If the FTC website contradicts the letter you have, that is another issue which could be discussed. -- <a href="../../../k/n/v/User%7EKnverma_ea5c.html" title="User:Knverma">Knverma</a> 12:11, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have added Amway to the Category:Criminals because the corporation plead guilty to tax evasion and other charges in Canada. The corporation itself was the criminal defendant and was convicted.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please keep things in context. I suggest removing Category:Criminals from the page, as it indicates that Amway <i>is involved</i> in criminal conduct and should be viewed as such. This is not the case. Many major international companies around the globe have been found guilty of various charges, yet few people would consider these corporations belonging in the criminal category for their conduct, especially several decades after the fact. The information provided under the "Legal rulings" subheading should suffice in highlighting the legal elements of Amway's history. It is also interesting to see that the owners of the company have served in high level positions in the US Chamber of Commerce, positions that I'm sure business leaders from around the US would not have elected them into if they thought that the primary company of these people was <i>criminal</i>.</dd>

<p>Some of the information currently presented in this section is in fact incorrect. Status is <b>not</b> determined by ones position in the LOS. Status is derived from the highest pin level achieved. This is quite different, especially at the higher recognition levels where a downline can, and often, has a higher status than the upline. Also, reference to employment is incorrect. People who register with Amway are independent operators responsible for their own business activities (within a number of rules and regulations outlined in the contract).</p>
<hr />
<p>Your point is well taken, and reinforces the Amway Corporation's attention to detail in creating and maintaining its business plan. Distributors must earn their pin level (and attendant income from Amway) and re-qualify every year.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that pin levels are also used by AMOs to determine speaking fees and discounts on "tools" merchandise, e.g., the bigger your pin, the more money you make selling books, tapes, seminar tickets to your groups. Amway is strict about qualification and re-qualification, but AMOs are not. "Once a Diamond, Always a Diamond" are the words the Yager organization uses to describe this policy.</p>

<p>Yes but what are you calling 'Amway'? I expect you have plenty of contact with your 'upline' and he gives you plenty of 'advice.' And you probably have some tapes or books and such, you may even have to buy them on a regular basis. Lots of people attend the seminars, which frequently hide that they are Amway.

<dd>Amway is Amway Corporation quite obviously. My upline is not Amway. As for tapes and books I don't *have* to buy anything, but I chose to, just like I chose to buy text books at university, or kiyosaki CDs, or whatever. I've been to some Amway seminars, butthe seminars I go to regularly are not run by Amway or endorsed by Amway, they are run by another company, Network TwentyOne. Amway doesn't talk to newcomers or potential IBOs, and neither does Network TwentyOne - IBOs do that, so you claim that "Amway avoid the 'A-word'" is completely nonsensical. Some IBOs might do that, but they are not Amway. The I stands for "independent", they run their businesses however they want. Some of them run it in ways that give the Amway "brand" a bad name.

<dd>Unsourced and factually incorrect. In reality "typical" IBOs spend no money on any of these things. Very few IBOs spend money on BSM - Business Support Materials.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Typically, IBOs spend money on tapes, books, and seminars which are promoted to IBOs as the preferred way to learn the "business skills of the IBOs" and to maintain their desire to build their business. These are not provided by Amway itself but organizations often described as Amway Motivational Organizations (AMO) in general run by people in the higher ranks of the organization. One example of an AMO is Crown Ambassador Dexter Yager's organization, the International Dreambuilders' Association/Digital Alliance (usually simply referred to by the abbreviation IDA), one of the largest and most widely-known AMOs. Claims regarding the support material (known as "tools" in AMO parlance) range from "can be of help to an IBO " to some organizations claiming they "are absolutely required" to "build a big business". However, investigations like one done by Dateline NBC in April 2003 (this episode aired in 2004) suggested that most of the money being earned by these successful individuals was coming from the hidden "tools" business rather than through selling the company products. Critics also claim that the materials are specifically geared towards encouraging IBOs to continue working for a non-economic return, rather than improving their actual business skills. Proponents of the materials claim that the "tools" business is the best way to develop a large business, because every person in their organization can get the same information (as opposed to the results achieved by "playing telephone" as a child, where one person passes a message onto another, to another, etc). Proponents note that many IBOs with large numbers of people in their organization cannot possibly spend the required time teaching every single person without taking time away from their family or job or other responsibilities.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>POV, No sourcing for the majority of the claims. Dateline NBC investigation was in to one group within one Quixtar organisation, not Amway which no longer even operated in the US in 2003. The investigation is dealt with in the article on Quixtar, which is where it belongs.</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>As noted above, several groups — usually ex-Amway members, but also some groups associated with the anti-cult movement — have expressed concern that tactics of AMOs may constitute cult-like activity. Steven Hassan's Freedom of Mind Institute, that monitors potentially abusive groups, lists the practices of AMOs as potentially abusive according to his "BITE" Model of mind control. [1] Other exit counseling organizations that have expressed concern with the activities of AMOs in practice include FACTnet,[20] Cult Awareness and Information Centre (Australia),[21] and others. The Rick Ross Institute, keeps a collection of related material in its website. [2]</i> Sources are highly POV and discredited by most mainstream academia and invalid WP:RS and WP:COI as sources. They are professional "cult busters" who charge thousands a day to "save" people.

<p>1. There is virtually no proper information on the role of PDPs - Professional Development Programs. Yager Internet Services/IDA is mentioned, however his is just one of literally dozens of independent companies providing PDPs to Amway IBOs. The term "AMO" is POV and misleading and was created by an Amway critic - in reality "motivation" is only one small part of what they do.</p>
<p>2. As mentioned the Amway/Quixtar relationship needs to be explained properly. Amway has not existed in the US for several years but still operates globally</p>
<p>3. There is very little mention of Amway history, unique products, endorsements, success stories, philanthropy etc etc. Apart from the UNEP award it has for example been labelled a "global superbrand". It's products have won numerous awards and a notable for a number of technological and historical reasons.</p>
<p>4. Little mention is made about international markets and expansion - which is 100% of Amway these days. The article as it stands is virtually entirely historical (and onesided at that) and completely ignores the last decade. Much of it belongs in the "urban myth" category.</p>
<p>5. Very ethnocentric and POV, when controversy is discussed it is unsourced and focuses on individuals and groups without providing context. Dexter Yager is for example but one of around 70 Crown Ambassadors and the "AMO" he runs is not even the largest. There is a large focus on the christian beliefs over the founders and some IBOs like Yager, when in reality it is likely the majority of IBOs are not even Christian and Amway rules explictly talk about "the right to differ".</p>

<dd>This article I wrote sometime back - <a href="http://www.thetruthaboutquixtar.com/index.php/content/view/1763/90" class="external free" title="http://www.thetruthaboutquixtar.com/index.php/content/view/1763/90" rel="nofollow">http://www.thetruthaboutquixtar.com/index.php/content/view/1763/90</a> gives you the history but it is not sourced to wikipedia standards. Nice for getting a handle on it though. Most of it's information is from Alticor.com, amway.com, amway-europe.com and books like James W. Robinson's "Empire of Freedom: The Amway Story and What It means to You". The latter is independently researched and written. PDP information is available on <a href="http://www.ibofacts.com" class="external free" title="http://www.ibofacts.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibofacts.com</a>. Unfortunately the corp in the US has in recent years focused on developing websites targeted towards Quixtar, so sites like that are NA-centric and don't directly refer to Amway, thus while the concepts are relevant the actual information is not always accurate for Amway. Books like Empire of Freedom have independent information on various PDPs. I'm not aware of any decent collation of material on PDPs online apart from what is happening on quixtarwiki.com (which is poorly named now - it has more info on amway than quixtar!). I've been trying to collate a list of different PDPs and have been learning about more and more. At present I've identified more than 30. Quixtarwiki still only has US based ones. I'll see what I can come up with re sources, but it's a large job, which is why I'd previously done little editing to this article. The existing unsourced POV stuff should not be allowed to remain as it is though. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 20:30, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><i>In a related lawsuit initiated by the distributors involved, the Court established that Mahaleel Lee Luster, who had been contracted to make the videotapes, had violated copyright without the knowledge of Amway or the Amway distributors and was solely responsible for the copyright infringements. <a href="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/199914123.OPN.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/199914123.OPN.pdf" rel="nofollow">Foley v Luster</a></i></li>
</ul>
<p>I've read over the opinion twice now and I still don't see where it says that Amway (or even the distributors) had no knowledge of the copyright violation. I'm not a lawyer. Perhaps someone can point out where this is stated? -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 07:29, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In the case - <i>"Luster argues that it was error to instruct the jury that “[v]icarious liability arises when someone, without knowledge that the activity infringes a copyright, has the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity and a financial interest in the activity.”"</i>. In other words he was trying to defend himself by claiming they were also guilty even though they didn't know the "activity infringes a copyright". The court said - "The district court made clear that if the jury found that Luster was not completely responsible for the copyright infringement, it would have to find for Luster." If they'd known about the infringement then Luster obviously would have argued in that direction. I'm no lawyer either, but I'm pretty certain that if you employ somebody to do something, knowing they are violating copyright, then you will have some liability. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 08:27, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Further - <i>"and not based on any direct or contributory infringement by the Plaintiffs themselves."</i> Knowledge that what a contracted party is doing is illegal without stopping them is contributory.--<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 08:50, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The above is not entirely correct. The case in the link was an appeal by Luster from an earlier suit where the jury "found for Luster on the claims of two distributors, where they apparently believed that Luster was not entirely at fault." The original suit was brought by five distributors: "At the trial, cross-claimants included the Foleys, the Andersons, the Haugens, the Gooches, and the Grabills. Luster successfully defended the claims brought by the Foleys and the Gooches, so only the verdicts in favor of the Andersons, Haugens, and Grabills are at issue in this appeal."</dd>
<dd>Thus, some of the distributors did have knowledge of what Luster was doing. As for Amway, they were not a party to this particular suit and the court made no opinion whatsoever on whether Amway had any knowledge of what Luster was doing. The Wiki article should be changed accordingly. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonIncognito_27e0.html" title="User:DonIncognito">DonIncognito</a> 16:13, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Amway wasn't a plaintiff in the case, so <i>"and not based on any direct or contributory infringement by the Plaintiffs themselves"</i> would not apply to the company. This material appears to involve a lot of interpretation of a primary source. Since Amway wasn't a party to the suit, I don't think it is really relevant here. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 18:24, 31 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I missed that re the distributors involved. We really need the orginal case/appeals to work this one out. The case cited is actually Foley v Luster, so it would appear Foley was cleared too, leaving only Gooch with any kind of liability, and we don't know whether he appealed either or the result of any of that. How it stands is possible not correct (3 of 5? why not 4 of 5? Could even be 5 of 5?) but it's not that important, I'm happy enough with it's current from. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 19:51, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Nevertheless ...</dd>
<dd><b>Cult References</b></dd>
<dd>Rick Ross's, Steve Hassan's, and CAIC websites do not pass WP:RS. None of the website proprietors have recognized "Scholarly" qualifications. All are partisan with obvious biases - they charge hundreds even thousands of dollars to "save" people from purported cults, none of the sites have editorial oversight and their claims "are contradicted by the prevailing view in the relevant academic community" (see <a href="http://www.slate.com/?id=2061166" class="external free" title="http://www.slate.com/?id=2061166" rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/?id=2061166</a> for a journalistic overview). I'm a psychologist, I have more qualifications in this area then these folk. When I engaged Rick Ross in a discussion on the topic as it applies to amway he didn't address any of the issues I raised and simply kept accusing me of being brainwashed! Read that salon article for the prevailing academic view on that kind of rubbish.</dd>
<dd>The section also has a self-published ebook as a source, and the last claims re Amway China are flat out wrong the way they are termed and POV. It claims for example a ban "on all pyramid schemes including Amway". Amway isn't a pyramid scheme (see FTC v Amway), and China cracked down on all <i>direct selling</i>. The paragraph also includes "original research" in it's interpretation of the news article, which is posted on the fails WP:RS rickross site (a self-published site as a secondary source in other words). If the China situation is to be addressed (and I see no reason why it shouldn't), there's a multitude of WP:RS sources for it. This is just link spamming.</dd>
<dd><b>Politics &amp; Culture</b></dd>
<dd>First paragraph has no source. The whole "dominionist" stuff seems to be OR, sources 22 and 23 are blogs. I don't even know what the relevance of the founders sons sisters brother is to the article? Give me a break. Madsen Report as a source? I'm a lefty and even I don't go that far. Heck, even DailyKos won't accept him as a source. I haven't checked all of them, but virtually every source for this "dominionsit" stuff seems to fail WP:RS. The enviroment section should be better sourced, and indeed I think perhaps deserves it's own section as it's a vital part of Amway's "notability" - biodegradeable cleaners, UNEP NA award, Nutrilite organic farms etc etc.

<dd>I'm not against the "cult" allegations being addressed in someway, even Amway brings it up on their site, but the current version fails WP:RS and is very POV. IMO the only reason Amway has had to address them is primarily a result of the Internet Echo Chamber effect. This article, POV, failed WP:RS and all, is "echoed" all over the place for example. The politics of the owners I don't think is that relevant, since pushing political viewpoints is explicitly against the rules. The largest groups in Amway today aren't even christian, let alone "dominionist". If anywhere it should be discussed in articles about the DeVos's, not in one about a company they own. It would make as little sense in an article on the Orlando Magic. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 01:49, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hassan, Ross, and the CAIC are used in many articles as sources. Further, they are used as primary sources for their own opinions. I agree that the "Merchants of Deception" is not a reliable site for our purposes.
<dl>
<dd>They shouldn't be used anywhere in Wikipedia, the obviously fail WP:RS, which you haven't addressed. Just because other articles are poorly sourced doesn't excuse them. They are particularly good at self-promotion. As mentioned, you consider Rick Ross's CV to be a valid source, so I'd suggest you have a bias here and are not the best judge. The APA and courts have made the position on the Singer/Lifton model they use clear - it has no basis. What's more, Amway doesn't even fit that model! They fail NPOV. They fail Editorial oversight. The "are contradicted by the prevailing view in the relevant academic community". They fail "Self-published sources". Given all of this, and the fact that they personally have no experience with Amway, and are thus secondary sources, what's your justification for including their opinions over any other opinions? --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 03:14, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>What's this about Ross' CV? Where did I say what about it? Ross and Hassan are known and recognized authorities on cults. Experts are permitted to self-publish. The article does not endorse their opinions, we just report them, the same as we do in many other articles. They are primary sources for their own opinions, not secondary sources for objective truths about Amway. Also, it's usually preferred on Wikipedia talk pages to avoid interleaving comments. Otherwise it quickly becomes confusing for folks who come later. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 08:03, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You linked to Ross's CV as your source for the RIAA stuff. Ross and Hassan are NOT recognized authorities on cults by scholarly sources. They get themselves in the media and on the internet and spout stuff that is not considered valid by legitimate experts in the field. While some courts have allowed them as expert witnesses in the past, many courts have also disallowed them. Their theories are based on the theories of Margaret Singer and Robert Lifton, and these theories are considered discredited by the great bulk of academia in the area. Uri Geller is a recognized "expert" by the public on psychic powers too - doesn't mean he's not a fraud. Now, I don't think Hassan and Ross are "frauds" per se - I think they believe in what they say - it's just they're obsessives who write themselves up in pseudo-scientific manner and people believe it. The Internet has allowed folk like Ross and Hassan to popularise their theories despite them having no evidential basis whatsoever. The bizarre thing is of course that Amway doesn't even fit the theories they espouse. But the more "cults" there are the better, because that's how they make their money. I recommend you read <a href="http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/concult.htm#scholar_v_public" class="external text" title="http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/concult.htm#scholar_v_public" rel="nofollow">The University of Virginia's Professor Steve Haddan's website</a> for a scholarly review of the area. I quote from that article - "All of the so-called "cult experts" speak a language that purports to be scientific, but there is very little empirical evidence to support the large majority of their claims. But as frequently happens in politics, evidence can be overwhelmed by smooth rhetoric." He addresses the sources you want to consider "experts" <a href="http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/anti.htm" class="external text" title="http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/anti.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>. As another example, The Cult Awarness Network Australia site, also cited, was started by a student and former Jehovah's Witness at the University of Queensland in Australia, who forced her to remove it from her UQ student account as people were claiming a University connection that did not exist. I know - I was on faculty at that University at the time. Apart from a handful of exceptions, your "experts" are only recognized as such by people who are not. Now, I'm an atheist, so I'm no fan of any religious movement, but these two guys should not be accepted as "expert sources" for any article in wikipedia. Anyone who accepts them has been conned. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 23:30, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

Regarding Hassan, he has testified before the U.S. Congress as an expert witness. That's good enough for Wikipedia.

<dd>Yes, my mistake. Fitzpatrick is another self-declared expert, I get them confused&#160;:-). Hassan testified before a congress subcommitee nearly 30 years ago regarding his personal experience with the Unification Church - not as an expert on anything apart from that. He's not even mentioned in the copy of the congressional report he has own his own site. I grant he may be considered an expert witness on his own experiences.

<dd>Most of Ross' website is a database of press clippings. It is accurate and useful, but the individual entries are copyright violations. Therefore Wikipedia should not link to those pages directly. I've swapped out the references. With those out the article now only says that Ross maintains a file on Amway, by way of generally sourcing the fact that some regard it as having aspects of a cult group. (He's also got a shorter file on Herbalife<a href="http://www.rickross.com/groups/herbalife.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rickross.com/groups/herbalife.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>). -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 08:22, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

I understand the reasons for deleting the link to Eric Scheibeler's site. On the other hand it is fair to point to the claims of so many former high level distributors (emeralds and diamonds).

<dd>the claim of "many" I think needs to be put in the appropriate context. For example, some Amway fact sheets from 2004 (I don't have an english link sorry) state there have been more than 4000 people qualified at Diamond and above. Include Emeralds and you literally have tens of thousands. What qualifies as "many" in that context? 10? 100? 1000? To the best of my knowledge the "high level distributors" making such "claims" have been less than 20 or 30. Furthermore, to the best of my knowledge virtually <i>all</i> of those distributors have been associated with just one "line of sponsorship" and "system" within A/Q. If you understand the business model this is <i>highly</i> relevant and would need to be included. All of this (both sides) is difficult to properly source from a WP:RS perspective and without OR. At least one of these former "high level" distributor, Bo Short, is cited in the MSNBC Dateline episode and the allegations already included. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 17:22, 12 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>By "many" I definitely didn't mean thousands (even if thousands may have complaints, at least I don't have sources). If all complaints are in a particular LOS, that can be documented. Basically the point is that among the former distributors who complain and in the lawsuits that are filed, there is a very common pattern of allegations, which is why it is worth documenting. --</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure it can be documented without original research. Actually, I'm not sure the initial claims of "many" can be either. But for your own enlightenment I recommend you check which "system" virtually all of the IBOs involved in lawsuits are affiliated with. You also might want to check QuixtarWiki, for example the list of Crown Ambassadors, to get an idea of different organizations sizes. This Wikipedia Amway article I think at one stage even claimed Bill Britt was one of only two Crown Ambassadors! That's how "ignorant" the world is of the rest of Amway that seems to happily operate under the radar. Have a look for example at the size on <a href="http://www.quixtarwiki.com/index.php?title=Network_TwentyOne" class="external text" title="http://www.quixtarwiki.com/index.php?title=Network_TwentyOne" rel="nofollow">Network TwentyOne</a> and see if you can find any lawsuits, or even substantive complaints. They got sued once for breaking copyright of a book. The grandson of the author admitted it was his fault. That's pretty much been it. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 21:47, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you mean that most lawsuits are against Britt/Yager systems and N21 has been rather clean, then I will be most happy to mention that. On the other hand, please be careful about strong claims about N21 being very different from other systems. You could be accused of COI (I am not disputing anything, I am <b>merely</b> asking you to be careful, and to consider the possibility of accusations). If quixtarwiki is wrong, I will pay less attention to them in future. Or may be their information is old, remember that N21 is rather new compared to Britt/Yagers. And I have clarified the word "many", I will definitely admit to the possibility that the number of former diamonds who make accusations is "very less" compared to the number of current diamonds. I never had any illusions on this issue . And I am not claiming their accusations to be true, I am only claiming that the accusations are essentially the same in all the different cases.-- <a href="../../../k/n/v/User%7EKnverma_ea5c.html" title="User:Knverma">Knverma</a> 10:05, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If the world is "ignorant" of N21, don't worry, I am interested in documenting N21 also besides Britt. We have another reason to provide some solid documentation to remove their "ignorance". Regarding sizes, I have not yet checked the situation in other countries. But according to quixtarwiki (again correct if they are wrong) N21 has something like 3-4 diamonds in India. The number of Britt diamonds in India (counting the breakaway WI group) might be a dozen or a few dozens, I have to check.

<p>Yes this link is important and provides newer information which I was going to add. Remember it is dated 2006 where as the other article is dated 2003, so this information should be included. Some new direct-selling laws have probably been created after that 2003 article, but I don't have details. Usage of the term "pyramid scheme" could be inappropriate. On the other hand, it does not imply that Amway was specifically banned. It says that all pyramid schemes including Amway was banned.

But are "illegal pyramids" and "(legal) pyramids" same or different? Has some authority defined these? The articles say that China cracked down on pyramids in 1998. But Amway was working under its usual rules between 1995 and 1998. Also China (at least at that time) did not give separate treatments to "mlm" and "legal/illegal pyramid".

<dd>Regarding pyramid schemes, one of the sourdces says:
<ul>
<li><i>That system came into question in 1998, when Chinese officials cracked down on pyramid schemes and tarred direct-sales companies with the same brush. Though companies like Amway say their model is vastly different -- their revenue comes from sales of real products, among other differences -- officials saw no distinction. The State Council, China's cabinet, banned all forms of such sales in a harshly worded notice that accused some companies of promoting "evil cults, secret societies, and superstitious and lawless activities."</i>.

<dd>So according to the first link, Amway got the direct-selling licence in (end of) 2005 and not 2006. My question about the latest laws is now answered. Direct selling is now allowed but MLM (sales people recruiting other sales people) is not allowed. And it is clear that in 1998, China mainly had problems with MLMs and pyramid schemes but it decided to put direct-selling companies also into the same category. Currently we say that all MLMs and pyramids including Amway were banned. I think one of Insider201283's concern was that we should also mention that direct selling was banned. I suggest saying that "MLM, pyramid schemes and direct-selling companies, including Amway" were banned. -- <a href="../../../k/n/v/User%7EKnverma_ea5c.html" title="User:Knverma">Knverma</a> 20:19, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't really have much against this wording except the concern that if we make any indirect suggestions then we should be sure of sourcing. Are we suggesting that all direct selling was banned because people found it hard to distinguish it from pyramids? Well people/citizens may find it hard to distinguish the two, but was that the reason for the ban? "1 December 2005" and not "December 2006" I guess? "Legitimate companies such as ..." reflect our thinking about legitimacy, but laws are different in each country, and they continued during this meantime also due to some negotiations (see the WSJ 2003 article). "non-employee representatives"? The 2003 WSJ article says that Amway offered two legal schemes: either people apply to become formal employees or they apply to the government for individual business licenses. Always, if we create our own words instead of picking lines from the articles, then we run into problems. <s>"... one of the first countries ..."</s> is factually correct and can be kept to make it positive for Amway. Otherwise the (3?) companies could be named. And remember the statements (in the 2003 WSJ article) regarding Amway not significantly changing its bonus scheme and government officials maintaining silence on the issue, that still deserves some mention. -- <a href="../../../k/n/v/User%7EKnverma_ea5c.html" title="User:Knverma">Knverma</a> 22:54, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>the "non-employee representatives" was a phrase used in one of the articles. Amway etc are explictly called legal, so calling them "legitimate" doesn't require any interpretation on our part. Amway got it's direct selling licence December 5, 2006. If I recall correctly the ban was lifted a year earlier, with licences to be issues, but licences were not actually issued for a year, something like that. I think there was one company who announced they got a licence on December 1 and Amway and Avon annonuced on Dec. 5. I don't recall who was first and haven't time to google right now. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 23:32, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>number of stores, sales etc are not really the important issues here, although I have nothing against their inclusion, it might provide the information that China provides a big percentage of the global sales. Yes, I checked that one article mentions Amway's plans about "non-employee representatives" although another one talked about two the two schemes I mentioned above. The above wording seems more or less factually correct to me.

<dd>Let's finalize this one, I was waiting to first recheck all the China articles. Considering the sales volume of Amway China (more than Quixtar's) we shouldn't hesitate to spend some more lines to clearly explain the China situation. How about:
<dl>
<dd><i>Amway grew quickly in China starting in 1995. After abuses of illegal pyramid schemes led to riots, the Chinese Government enacted a ban on all direct selling in 1998. After negotiations, some companies like Amway, Avon, and Mary Kay continued to operate through a network of retail stores promoted by an independent sales force. Although multi-level payments were banned, it is alleged that Amway didn't significantly alter its pay scheme, and justified them as payments for services. In December 2005, China enacted new direct-selling laws, and in December 2006 Amway was one of the first companies to receive a government licence to resume direct selling activities. Multi-level marketing (commissions on sales of new sales persons recruited) is still forbidden. In the year ended August 2005, Amway China had a sales volume of more than $2 billion, almost a third of Alticor's global sales</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Any comments? I decided to include the allegations about not altering the pay schemes, because presence or absence of MLM style payments is the main issue in all this, and should be clearly understood.--<a href="../../../k/n/v/User%7EKnverma_ea5c.html" title="User:Knverma">Knverma</a> 18:10, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with Knverma. The differences between Quixtar and Amway appear to be relatively minor and could be handled in a single short section. They are all owned by one company and have pretty much the same product line and business model. Merging Quixtar into Amway would not be U.S.-centric, just the opposite. Merging in Alticor makes sense too. It's just a holding company and has little identity beyond Amway. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 17:15, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Amway and Quixtar are completely separate companies and operate as such. If anything you could indeed argue for different articles for each different Amway company in different Amway markets. Different markets have different bonus scales, different qualifications, different products, different rules etc etc etc. Amway China is different to Amway Australia is different to Amway Scandinavia. Merging them would be to effectively dismiss more than 85% of the total Amway/Quixtar business - an INCREDIBLY american-centric thing to do. To claim Alticor is just a holding company "with little identity beyond Amway" is also quite ignorant. Gurwitch and Laura Mercier, Allan James Group, Fulton Innovation, eCoupled, Access Business Group, Amway Grand Plaza Hotels etc etc. Jaguar and Volvo are both owned by Ford and have more in common than, for example, Amway China and Quixtar. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 21:46, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We don't have separate articles on most of Alticor's companies and there's no reason that we should. The reason to contemplate a merge is that there is so much overlapping material. The FTC case, for example, was prosecuted against Amway but is binding on Quixtar. The Dr. Phil matter involves two arms of Alticor. The Dateline NBC case touched on both Quixtar and Amway. The corporate history is one continuum. The key personnel are the same. The Quixtar accreditation seems to be a minor matter, with only one group accredited. All U.S. Amway distributors became Quixtar IBOs. The product lines are mostly the same, the business models are the same, etc. Paul Harvey, IIRC, did advertisements for Amway before doing them for Quixtar (though I doubt he never did them in Australia or Europe, so non-Americans wouldn't have heard of him anyway.) The continuing presence of Amway as a brand name in the U.S. is proven by the recent renaming of the Amway Arena, at a cost of millions. While it'd make for a long article, it'd reduce a considerable amount of duplication and confusion. If I may suggest, let's focus on merging Alticor and Amway first. They are the most easily and naturally combinable. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 00:03, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are being incredibly American-centric Will, and I pointed out long ago that the Dr Phil matter really had no relevance to Quixtar. The dateline NBC article mentioned Amway just once, it never mentioned any of Amway internationally. The key personnel are not the same. The heads of Amway Australia, Amway Europe, Amway Japan, Amway Russia etc etc etc have never worked for Quixtar. You're again displaying your ignorance, Quixtar Accreditation is a MAJOR matter for the US, and three groups have been accredited, not one. Quixtar PR when asked about the naming of Amway Arena pointed out the widespread televising of the NBA. More people watch the NBA in China than the United States and Amway China just received it's direct-selling licence to move ahead with growth again. That's unlikely just to be a coincidence. If we were talking merging an article on Amway North America and Quixtar then I'd agree. But this article is on Amway. Amway North America has not existed for 5 years, and has been only a small part of Amway for 20 years. Quixtar is a different company with different operations, different marketing, different staff. Quixtar is a <i>billion dollar company</i> in it's own right. Merging the articles makes no sense. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 10:18, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The word "Amway" appears at least 6 times in the Dateline transcript. And the Amway-Quixtar connection is emphasized at least twice. The key personnel, other than DeVos and Van Andel family, are the top distributors (even if they are not employees). No one is interested in articles about the heads of Amway Australia, Europe, etc. The top distributors in these countries may be important, and if necessary, we can have separate articles for them. I am working on Britt, and at least a few others like Yager may be worthwhile. And we should not have separate articles for BWW (Britt system) US, BWW India, BWW Malaysia etc. Your NBA reasoning is a bit far-fetched. -- <a href="../../../k/n/v/User%7EKnverma_ea5c.html" title="User:Knverma">Knverma</a> 12:59, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No I won't suggest that. Britt, Yager and Dornan may be fine, not too much more. Further, I don't recommend separate pages for Bill Britt and BWW, one page is enough for both. Just as we already have a page for Network 21 where some information about Dornan can be provided. The point is that most publicly available information about Dornan is in connection with N21. The famous N21 leaders in various countries can be mentioned on the N21 page. Similarly for BWW. If we have a page on AMOs then the list of all the other systems can be provided there.

<dd>So why only some of the american larger pins and not others? Schwarz &amp; Müller-Meerkatz have half of europe downline of them, and Amway Europe is comparable in size to the US. The asian businesses are just ridiculous. I personally think that kind of information is fine for quixtarwiki.com (which I am encouraging the owners to rename amwayquixtarwiki), but most IBOs, even Yager and Britt, who are the ones who make the most headlines (and not always for good reasons) don't pass "notability" guidelines. I've no problem with factual articles on associated training companies per se, but there's at least 40 that I'm now aware of, which ones get listed and which don't? How is notability decided? I really don't think lists of these companies and leaders has a particular place in wikipedia. In any case, to the original point. Merging Quixtar into Amway makes little sense and there is no reason not to have two articles. They're not the first companies to have common histories and parent companies and they won't be the last. However, the Amway article still needs a lot of cleaning, and the history sections of both can be cleaned up, I would suggest with the Quixtar article referring to the Amway article for more information or similar. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 16:25, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>That 1 million Indian IBOs is almost certainly false or exaggerated. As of 2003 Amway India only had around 310,000 renewed IBOs, which means no more than around 800,000 total IBOs, and they're not all downline of Bill Britt. Network TwentyOne as just one example has a number of Diamonds in India. High level IBOs actually do not know how many people in their downline, that kind of figure is not supplied, so there's lots of guestimating going on. Walk into a Network TwentyOne seminar in India and I'll guarantee most of the IBOs there have no idea who Bill Britt is. He may very well be "worshipped" among his own organization, but the Britt Organization is one of many in the world. Total number of IBOs in all of Amway/Quixar in the world in any given year (including first year IBOs) is in the order of 10 million people. So even if Britt had 1.5 million in his downline, that's only 15%, and many of those downline would not even be in his organization. Britt and Yager are downline of the Hansen's and Ross's, who are part of Network TwentyOne. That doesn't make the Britt organization part of Network TwentyOne. Indeed I suspect that *I* may be downline of Britt - but I've never heard of him apart from reading stuff on the 'net, because the group I work with has nothing to do with him or his organization and hasn't for decades. My NBA "reasoning" being "farfetched", it's not my reasoning. It's Quixtar PR departments own statements. I quote from the Quixtar PR blog about why they chose Amway Arena - "If we're going to shout a name around the world through NBA broadcasts, it's going to be Amway. In other words, we get more bang for our buck by using the Amway name.

You have raised many issues, they need to be dealt with one by one. First what is the source of the 10 million figure? You contest a figure provided by quixtarwiki but are not prividing the source of your figure. -- <a href="../../../k/n/v/User%7EKnverma_ea5c.html" title="User:Knverma">Knverma</a> 16:20, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1. More than 3.6 million IBOs source: <a href="http://www.alticor.com/people/ibo.html" class="external text" title="http://www.alticor.com/people/ibo.html" rel="nofollow">Alticor</a> this is as of Jan 1. 2005. 2. Alticor/Amway/Quixtar report renewed IBOs only when they report numbers of IBOs source: Foundations for Business, CD1, Jim Dornan (2004). Dornan is a Founder's Crown Ambassador and member of IBOAI, so he would know. Confirmed in <a href="http://www.web-marketing-reviews.co.uk/index.php/alticoramwayquixtaramivo/" class="external text" title="http://www.web-marketing-reviews.co.uk/index.php/alticoramwayquixtaramivo/" rel="nofollow">this 2006 article</a> where it is stated "Amway claims to have 4 million distributors worldwide who have renewed at least once" 3. Overall renewal rates are less than 40% source: various, including FTC v Amway plus confirmation via accurate calculation of actual number of Quixtar IBOs using Quixtar sales data and Quixtar Platinum Index (see post on my site - MYTH: No growth in IBOs in 30 years, section "fun with numbers"). That gives an end of 2004 figure of 9 million (3.6 million renewed), prior to opening of Russian market and relaunch of Chinese market sponsoring, which would easily take it to a total figure of 10 million plus, consistent with the 4 million renewed figure given in the 2006 article. QuixtarWiki is I think a useful resource that should be included in external links, but it's not a valid enough source as far as actual wikipedia article information. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 18:48, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes this 3-4 million figure is what I have seen everywhere. If you do your own calculation to provide some 10 million figure then that cannot be used on Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../k/n/v/User%7EKnverma_ea5c.html" title="User:Knverma">Knverma</a> 19:14, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was contesting your statement that most of the Amway world has not heard of Americans like Britt. This clearly seems not to be the case. And I didn't deny that the Quixtar PR said that. But connecting this to China is what I called far-fetched. -- <a href="../../../k/n/v/User%7EKnverma_ea5c.html" title="User:Knverma">Knverma</a> 19:27, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I can tell you that most of Network TwentyOne wouldn't have heard of him unless they've spent time googling. He's well known in the britt/yager organizations. Those groups do not constitute a majority of Amway, so it's not sensible to assume other LOS's and LOA's would know much at all. Why would they have? If you can source <i>your</i> apparent claim that most of the Amway world <i>has</i> heard of Britt, then feel free to show me your sources, even your own calculations are fine for here in talk.</dd>

<p>Re Amway Arena, how is "connecting this to China" farfetched? China has 30 million people watching the NBA every week <a href="http://corp.sohu.com/20060902/n245128851.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://corp.sohu.com/20060902/n245128851.shtml" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> compared to less than 84,000 US household who watched last years NBA finals <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20060623/ai_n16507563" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_20060623/ai_n16507563" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>. The stadium was renamed Amway Arena on December 11, less than a week after Alticor announced Amway China received it's direct selling licence <a href="http://media.alticorblogs.com/2006/12/05/china-all-systems-go/" class="external autonumber" title="http://media.alticorblogs.com/2006/12/05/china-all-systems-go/" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>.

<dd>I didn't say "most of Amway world has heard of Britt". But taking your 15% figure for the moment, already it contradicts you statement "most of Amway world has not heard of Britt". The second statement being false does not mean that the first statement is true.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Re China: The point is that you are using those long arguments to show that Amway China is very distinct from Quixtar. If the <b>Quixtar</b> PR talks about worldwide coverage etc. then it is only further evidence of the Amway-Quixtar connection. -- <a href="../../../k/n/v/User%7EKnverma_ea5c.html" title="User:Knverma">Knverma</a> 20:04, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The link you gave itself says that Quixtar and Amway are deeply connected: <i>Alticor has two business opportunity brands -- Quixtar in North America and Amway in dozens of countries and territories around the world. Amway started here in the U.S. nearly 50 years ago and while interest in Quixtar exceeded interest in Amway here a few years back, the Amway name is synonymous with our kind of multilevel marketing business. Amway is the brand most associated with our company on a global basis as in most of the countries and territories in which we do business, we do business as Amway. Amway is responsible for the lion's share of Alticor sales. And, we have Quixtar IBOs who have Amway businesses in other markets and Amway IBOs who have Quixtar businesses here.</i> -- <a href="../../../k/n/v/User%7EKnverma_ea5c.html" title="User:Knverma">Knverma</a> 20:14, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So? Nobody is denying a connection. Well, nobody here anyway. I'm aware some idiot IBOs do. They're sister companies. Quixtar is the successor to Amway in the United States. All of this is true and should be noted in the article. But the <i>fact</i> remains that Quixtar is a billion dollar company in it's own right. Quixtar runs the #1 health and beauty website, not Amway. Quixtar operates in North America, not Amway. Quixtar has different staff. In some instances it even markets different brands than Amway. It's notable in its own right, and as the company becomes older this becomes even more the case. Sooner or later Quixtar will be better known in North America than Amway, with Amway North America an historical footnote. How long? Who knows. But their separate companies, simple as that. There is no sensible reason to merge the articles. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInsider201283_6b1c.html" title="User:Insider201283">Insider201283</a> 15:32, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>About a year ago, this article had a good explanation on the Amway business model, etc. In fact the whole article was pretty good in general.

<dd>The material about pin levels etc seems to have been deleted on 27 October by an unregistered user. At that time there were active editors supposed to have both "pro" and "anti" Amway POVs.

<p>I wasn't involved in the article at the time, but I see that the old text on pin levels had no sources. Are there any good sources on this topic?

<dd>No problem. Sometimes the omissions in Wikipedia articles can be shocking. Moving forward, the sourcing for an article like this is tricky. Impeccable sources would be newspapers, journals, magazines, books and other secondary published sources. Primary sources, like Amway literature, are harder to verify because most folks don't have access and newer stuff is still copyrighted. Could we at least give a short, general, non-controversial description of the system? I know some of it may be historical, but that's still of interest. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> · <a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWill_Beback_e8d4.html" title="User talk:Will Beback">†</a> · 08:54, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Another point to bear in mind is that there might be slight differences in rules in each country. Quixtar rules are mentioned in the <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quixtar.html" title="Quixtar">Quixtar</a> article and the Quixtar biz compendium <a href="http://www.quixtar.com/Documents/IWOV/VIS/010-EN/PDF/compendium.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.quixtar.com/Documents/IWOV/VIS/010-EN/PDF/compendium.pdf" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> is a good source for that.

<p>Sorry, but the claim about Dominionism is bunk. The citations are 2 OPINION columns that appear to only casually link the Devos clan to dominionism. This is highly disputed accusation (a blog and liberal Rolling Stone magazine not necessarily the most authoritative sources). The family has roots in the Christian Reformed Church which at the denominational level is a bit left-of-center.
