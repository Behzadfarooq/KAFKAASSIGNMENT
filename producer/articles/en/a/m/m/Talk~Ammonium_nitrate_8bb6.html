<p>As an addition to this, I'd like to add that if heated *slowly* above 170 Centigrade, ammonium nitrate releases laughing gas. However, do not attempt inhaling the vapor from a commercial product, because it has added magnesium and calcium which, depending on the process of granulating chosen by the manufacturer, may result in toxic vapors, and the result will definitely not make you laugh.</p>

<p>Is there evidence of use in fireworks? My understanding is it makes a poor pyrotechnic oxidizer, and is rarely used. Also, my reasonably thorough knowledge suggests it is *not* used in model rockets at all, and only occasionally used in experimental / amatuer rockets. Usually potassium nitrate and ammonium perchlorate are used instead.</p>

<p>Ammonium Nitrate is generally not refered to as "saltpeter". Historically the term "saltpeter" refers only to potassium nitrate or sodium nitrate (see Wikipedia entry for saltpeter).</p>
<p>In addition, the major hazard of ammonium nitrate is that it is a strong oxodizer, and not that it is shock sensitive. For information on this compound go to an MSDS at: www.jtbaker.com/msds/englishhtml/a6048.htm - 19k thank</p>

<p>As someone knowledgeable about this subject, I will make the following comment and have edited the page. The article stated that manufacturing ammonium nitrate (AN) is "quite easy". Actually, it could be considered "simple" but not easy at all. You have to react nitric acid and ammonia, which is a very exothermic and violent reaction. This gives you an AN solution of around 83% strength. Then, to make the solid AN, you have to evaporate the water, giving AN "melt" of between 95 and 99.9% AN concentration, which then must be converted to solid "prills" or granules by other simple but not easy processes. All in all, it is a very equipment and capital-intensive process, and should NEVER BE ATTEMPTED BY AMATEURS OR IN IMROVISED EQUIPMENT! Again, it is simple in concept and in regards to chemistry, but by no means easy. In the fertilizer industry, it is considered one of the more difficult processes to make a good commercial product.</p>
<p>I am a person with over 15 yrs experience in the industry, having visited nearly every AN plant in N and S America, as well as a few in other parts of the world. I also have extensive laboratory experience in working with AN.</p>
<hr />
<p>(the history of AN was also removed) History:</p>
<pre>
    Ammonium nitrate, NH4NO3, is prepared by neutralising nitric acid with ammonia, or ammonium carbonate, or by double decomposition between potassium nitrate and ammonium sulfate. It can be obtained in three different crystalline forms, the transition points of which are 35 °C, 83 °C and 125 °C. It is easily soluble in water, a considerable lowering of temperature taking place during the operation; on this account it is sometimes used in the preparation of freezing mixtures.
</pre>
<pre>
    On gentle heating, it is decomposed into water and nitrous oxide. Berthelot showed in 1883 that if ammonium nitrate is rapidly heated the following reaction takes place with explosive violence: 2NH4NO3 → 4H2O + 2N2 + O2.
</pre>
<pre>
    In combination with gasoline or other liquid hydrocarbons it is a widely used industrial explosive, being particularly useful in open pit mining and is known as ANFO. The detonation rate is about 3000 feet per second (900 m/s); relatively slow compared to other high explosives, which detonate at over 25,000 ft/s (7,600 m/s), (1,000 m/s as a general minimum, though any material capable of detonation can be considered a high explosive). This explosive combines the advantages of low cost and stability, requiring a high velocity explosive primer to begin detonation. It is sometimes used in small packets to break up snow cornices in avalanche control.
</pre>
<pre>
    Ammonium nitrate confined in large quantities (such as might be found in a ship's cargo hold) can detonate explosively if combined with hydrocarbons and heated sufficiently by a fire. A fire in a ship carrying ammonium nitrate waterproofed with wax was the cause of a devastating explosion resulting in the Texas City, Texas disaster.. On July 28, 1987 two teenage boys mixed zinc dust, ammonium nitrate and ammonium chloride from one of their father's lab. Water hit their pile and started a violent fire. The fire destroyed 6 homes and killed one of the boys.

<p>When ammonium compounds are used in <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methamphetamine.html" title="Methamphetamine">methamphetamine</a> production, the desired product is anhydrous ammonia in order to dissolve <a href="../../../l/i/t/Lithium.html" title="Lithium">lithium</a> for a reduction reaction. A strong ammonia odor often gives away meth labs. There is a case in <a href="../../../f/r/a/Franklin_County%2C_Missouri_2ce0.html" title="Franklin County, Missouri">Franklin County, Missouri</a> of a man heating ammonium nitrate to make the anhydrous ammonia with disastrous results, and he'd have made <a href="../../../n/i/t/Nitrous_oxide.html" title="Nitrous oxide">nitrous oxide</a> if he'd averted the explosion. <a href="http://leda.law.harvard.edu/leda/data/707/Martin05_redacted_version.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://leda.law.harvard.edu/leda/data/707/Martin05_redacted_version.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Reaction of ammonium nitrate or <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammonium_chloride.html" title="Ammonium chloride">ammonium chloride</a> with a concentrated <a href="../../../s/o/d/Sodium_hydroxide.html" title="Sodium hydroxide">sodium hydroxide</a> solution produces the anhydrous ammonia and requires no heat, since the reaction generates its own.
