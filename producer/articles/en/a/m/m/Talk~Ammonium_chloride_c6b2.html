<ul>
<li><b>Ammonii Chloridum {ammonium chloride, sal ammoniac). White crystalline powder or fine granular crystals. Made chiefly from gas liquor by neutralising with hydrochloric acid and subliming. Used as a <i>stimulant</i> expectorant.</b></li>
<li>Dose, 0.2 to 05 gm. (3 to 8 grains).</li>
</ul>
<p>Need not mess it up with <i>pharmacopoea</i>. Also as explained in talk page, NOBODY prescribes irritating POWDER to someone already COUGHING unless malevolent, joking or sadistic&#160;:-) Please read the <i>Merck Manual</i>, page 599, lines 4 through 49 of the 16th - second most current printed edition and <i>most circulated, valued and corrected medical text currently available</i>. The implication that NH4Cl is used as peripherally acting demulcents is at best POV, at worst medical misinformation.&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>other traditional expectorants (eg. ammonnium chloride etc.) are found in numerous OTC cough remedies. Their efficacy is doubtful, particularly in the dosages of most preparations.'</i></li>

<p>Concerning "Used as a stimulant expectorant." NH4Cl is used in order to promote the EXCRETION of stimulants. It does so by acidifying the urine which helps to trap basic (pH around 9.9) amphetamines in the urine in an ionic form. qidexan 10:48, 2006, Jan 29 (EST)</p>

<p>Concerning Theresa's reversion of my medical observation: Medical help, if NOT specialized, only LOSES PRECIOUS TIME. Not reverting to previous edit, therefore, IS DANGEROUS. Every country caring for the life of people has a poison center. Let us not deceive the brave care givers everywhere! Diverting victims of accidental ingestion of toxic stuff to time-losing spurious <i>medical care</i> could spell the difference between life and death.

<p>Maintaining that to inhale a powder of dubious value if you are a patient who coughs and has irritated bronchi would lead to therapeutical expectoration might be technically correct, but is equivalent to the methods of <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mengele.html" title="Mengele">Mengele</a>.

<p>Note for anyone reading this page. As you can see in the article and in the talk above, no one except irismeister is talking about inhaling powder.

<li>It would also seem he lacks an understanding of Mengele's atrocities, which were not equivalent of "allegedly ineffective nostrums". - Zotz 22:48, 26 Feb 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It wouldn't surprise me in the least bit if irismeister was fully aware of Mengele's atrocities. The truth of the matter is that irismeister's hatetred of me is so great that he will say anything in order to argue with me. He follows me everywhere I go in order to try to intimidate me.

<li>Yes I have, but Irismeister is being investigated by the arbitration commitee at the moment. So I'm happy for him to incriminate himself for the time being.

<p>I think the point is not "<i>should</i> ammonium chloride be used as an expectorant?", but "is/has it been used as an expectorant?". According to a Google search for "ammonium.chloride expectorant", the answer <i>to the latter question</i> appears to be clearly "yes". The answer to the first question is the subject of the controversy here. -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Anome_61a9.html" title="User:The Anome">The Anome</a> 10:32, 27 Feb 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is a subject dear to my heart (who doesn't love eating ammonium chloride?!?&#160;:-) ).</p>
<p>While Finland is perhaps the largest exporter of ammonium chloride based candy (thanks to Fazer), ammonium chloride is widespread in candy all over Scandinavia, and I believe (but have not personally confirmed) it to be sold in at least parts of Germany and the Netherlands as well.</p>
<p>The most well known brands internationally might be Turkish Pepper (Fazer) - a "shell of boiled ammonium chloride, salt and sugar containing a powder of the same -, and Salmiakki (Fazer) - small "pills" of pressed ammonium chloride, liquorice and salt, but a huge number of other types are manufactured both by large manufacturers like Fazer-Cloetta and Haribo.</p>
<p>As a kid in Norway I grew up consuming vast quantities of the stuff - usually I'd spent at least half my allowance on various "salty" candies.</p>
<p>They vary from just powdered ammonium chloride combined with one or more of sugar, salt and liquorice, via chewy liquorice products with added ammonium chloride and salt, through hard boiled shells of ammonium chloride with one or more of the earlier mentioned ingredients with or without variations of the powder. Often there are small amounts of other stuff in it as well.</p>
<p>Most of the same countries where ammonium chloride in candy is popular also consume a lot of extremely sour candies and confectionary...</p>
<p>From experience, though, don't try to introduce English people to it without preparing them for the taste in advance - I've yet to find a single one here in London that have appreciated the experience...</p>

<p>Hey why is this article acting like this is poison. It tastes good and I only agree with that "wash your eyes" stuff. This is used as candy and I have even made it in school (and ate it ofc). "Induce vomiting. If victim is conscious and alert, give 2-4 cupfuls of milk or water.Seek medical help" &lt;- total crap. It is strong as pure but not dangerous.</p>
<p>Actually, it's not totally safe either, as overdose is possible. Ammonium chloride can cause higher blood pressures (my mom's a doctor and once pointed ammonium chloride candy out for the cause of a patients hightened blood pressure). Also, when given to children that grows, it can make their bones become weaker. Check out this page, though it's about ammonium chloride in pet foods, but I believe it's the same in humans <a href="http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/magnesium.php" class="external free" title="http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/magnesium.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/magnesium.php</a>. About the blood pressure thing, I can't find an article about that, but I will post it here if I do. It's certainly worth mentioning I think.</p>

<p>The part about its toxicity must have been written by a Briton or an American. Consumed in moderation (not more than about 20 g in one go), even pure ammonium chloride is perfectly safe. Yet the article makes it sound like this is <a href="../../../c/y/a/Cyanide.html" title="Cyanide">cyanide</a>. I eat salmiakki candy almost daily and have always remained conscious, am I doing something wrong? <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 09:32, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>NaClO4 + NH4Cl → NH4ClO4 + NaCl</p>
<p>The reaction listed for making Ammonium Perchlorate needs to be checked because that reaction can not happen on its own. Either it needs more information or needs to be corrected. Both salts are soluble, only one ion is a weak acid or base, and nothing else is indicated. The two solids will not react in solution or other states. So unless a distillation or something like that occurs, this reaction isn't possible. <a href="../../../l/o/y/User%7ELoyalSoldier_61a1.html" title="User:LoyalSoldier">LoyalSoldier</a> 17:35, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
