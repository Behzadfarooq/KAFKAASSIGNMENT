<p>An <b>ammunition column</b> consists of <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military.html" title="Military">military</a> vehicles carrying <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a> and <a href="../../../s/m/a/Small_arms.html" title="Small arms">small arms</a> <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammunition.html" title="Ammunition">ammunition</a> for the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant.html" title="Combatant">combatant</a> unit to which the column belongs. Thus the ammunition columns of a <a href="../../../d/i/v/Division_%28military%29.html" title="Division (military)">division</a>, forming part of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigade.html" title="Brigade">brigades</a> of field <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artillery.html" title="Artillery">artillery</a>, carry reserve ammunition for the guns, the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_gun.html" title="Machine gun">machine guns</a> of the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">infantry</a> and the <a href="../../../r/i/f/Rifle.html" title="Rifle">rifles</a> of all arms. Generally speaking, the ammunition column of each of the artillery brigades furnishes spare ammunition for its own batteries and for one of the brigades of infantry.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammunition_column.html" title="Edit section: In the British Army">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">In the British Army</span></h2>
<p>All ammunition columns are officered and manned by the <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Artillery_85a7.html" title="Royal Artillery">Royal Artillery</a>. They are not reserved exclusively to their own brigades, divisions, &amp;c., but may be called upon to furnish ammunition to any unit requiring it during an action. The officers and men of the R.A. employed with the ammunition column are, as a matter of course, immediately available to replace casualties in the batteries. Teams, wagons and materiel generally are also available for the same purpose. The horse artillery, <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howitzer.html" title="Howitzer">howitzer</a> and heavy brigades of artillery have each their own ammunition columns, organized in much the same way and performing similar duties. The ammunition column of the heavy brigade is divisible into three sections, so that the three batteries, if operating independently, have each a section at hand to replenish the ammunition expended. The horse artillery brigade ammunition columns carry, besides S.A.A. for all corps troops other than artillery, the reserve of pom-pom ammunition. In action, these columns are on the battlefield itself. Some miles to the rear are the divisional and corps troops columns, which on the one hand replenish the empty wagons of the columns in front, and on the other draw fresh supplies from the depots on the line of communication. These also are in artillery charge; a divisional column is detailed to each division (i.e. to replenish each set of brigade ammunition columns), and the corps troops column supplies the columns attached to the heavy, howitzer and horse artillery brigades. The ammunition thus carried includes ordinarily seven or eight kinds at least. S.A.A., field, horse, howitzer and heavy gun <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrapnel.html" title="Shrapnel">shrapnel</a>, howitzer and heavy gun lyddite shells, cartridges for the four different guns employed and pom-pom cartridges for the <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalry.html" title="Cavalry">cavalry</a>, -- in all twelve distinct types of stores would be carried for a complete army corps. Consequently, the rounds of each kind in charge of each ammunition column must vary in accordance with the work expected of the combatant unit to which it belongs. Thus, pom-pom ammunition is out of place in the brigade ammunition columns of field artillery, and S.A.A. is relatively unnecessary in that attached to a heavy artillery brigade. Under these circumstances, a column may be unable to meet the particular wants of troops engaged in the vicinity; for instance, a cavalry <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regiment.html" title="Regiment">regiment</a> would send in vain to a heavy artillery ammunition section for pom-pom cartridges. The point to be observed in this is that the fewer the natures of weapons used, the more certain is the ammunition supply. (C. F. A.)</p>
<p>The first projectiles fired <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannon.html" title="Cannon">cannon</a> were the darts and stone shot which had been in use with older weapons. These darts ("garros") had <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron.html" title="Iron">iron</a> heads or were of iron wrapped with <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leather.html" title="Leather">leather</a> to fit the bore of small guns, and continued in use up to nearly the end of the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th century</a>. Spherical stone shot were chosen because of cheapness; forged iron, <a href="../../../b/r/o/Bronze.html" title="Bronze">bronze</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead.html" title="Lead">lead</a> balls were tried, but the expense prevented their general adoption. Further, as the heavy metal shot necessitated the use of a correspondingly large propelling charge, too great a demand was made on the strength of the feeble guns of the period. Stone shot being one-third the weight of those of iron the powder charge was reduced in proportion, and this also effected an economy. Both iron and stone shot were occasionally covered with lead, probably to preserve the interior of the bore of the gun. <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cast_iron.html" title="Cast iron">Cast iron</a>, while known in the <a href="../../../1/4/t/14th_century.html" title="14th century">14th century</a>, was not sufficiently common to be much used for the manufacture of shot, although small ones were made about that time. They were used more frequently at the latter part of the following century. Towards the end of the <a href="../../../1/6/t/16th_century.html" title="16th century">16th centurynearly</a> all shot were of iron, but stone shot were still used with guns called Petrieroes (hence the name) or Patararoes, for attacking weak targets like ships at short range.</p>
<p>Case shot are very nearly as ancient as spherical shot. They can be traced back to the early part of the <a href="../../../1/5/t/15th_century.html" title="15th century">15th century</a>, and they have practically retained their original form up to the present date. They are intended for use at close quarters when a volley of small shot is required. With field guns they are not of much use at ranges exceeding about 400 m; those for heavy guns are effective up to 1000 m. In the earlier forms, lead or iron shot were packed in wood casks or in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canvas.html" title="Canvas">canvas</a> bags tied up with twine like the later quilted shot. In the present type small shot are placed in a cylindrical case of sheet iron, with iron ends, one end being provided with handles. For small guns the bullets are made of lead and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antimony.html" title="Antimony">antimony</a> -- like shrapnel bullets -- while for larger calibers they are of cast iron weighing from 2 ounces 3.5 pounds (60 g to 1.6 kg) each.</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/r/a/Grape_shot.html" title="Grape shot">Grape shot</a> is now obsolete. It consisted generally of three tiers of cast-iron balls separated by iron plates and held in place by an iron bolt which passed through the centre of the plates.</p>
<p>There was also another type called quilted shot, which consisted of a number of small shot in a canvas covering tied up by rope. Chain shot, in the days of <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sailing.html" title="Sailing">sailing</a> ships, was much in favor as a means of destroying <a href="../../../r/i/g/Rigging.html" title="Rigging">rigging</a>. Two spherical shot were fastened together by a short length of chain. On leaving the gun they began gyrating around each other and made a formidable <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missile.html" title="Missile">missile</a>.</p>
<p>Stephen Batory, king of Poland, invented red-hot shot in 1579. The <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">English</a> used them with great effect during the siege of <a href="../../../g/i/b/Gibraltar.html" title="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, especially on September 13 <a href="../../../1/7/8/1782.html" title="1782">1782</a>, when the <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">French</a> floating batteries were destroyed, together with a large part of the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> fleet. Martin's shell was a modified form; here a cast-iron shell was filled with molten cast iron and immediately fired. On striking the side of a ship the shell broke up, freeing the still molten iron, which set fire to the vessel.</p>
