<p>I just saw your edits, Ammar, and I have a few comments:</p>
<p>(1) There <i>was</i> in fact a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constantinople.html" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in <a href="../../../1/8/1/1818.html" title="1818">1818</a>. The Ottomans still referred to their capital as such in official documents for many centuries after they captured it, and so did the Europeans until 1924. In fact, there are old Ottoman coins that say "Kustantiniyye" on them in beautiful Arabic script&#160;:) . So, I think "Constantinople" is more in line with the spirit of that time period than Istanbul. By the way, if you look closely at the two words you'll notice that "Istanbul" is just a corruption of "Constantinople" that occurred over time. In fact, the word "Stamboul" was used to refer to the city even when it was still in the hands of the Greeks. I'm not going to change it back, because Istanbul is also correct; I just wanted to correct this misconception.</p>
<p>(2) I notice that you changed "Shi'ite" to "Shia" and "Najd to "Nejd". Are you saying that it's preferable to use a transliteration that's closer to the original Arabic pronunciation? You also changed "Muhammad" to "Mohammed", even though "Mohammed" is an older usage associated with orientalist and "Muhammad" is the more modern, acceptable spelling. Is there a wikipedia rule on these things that I'm not aware of?</p>
<p>(3) You also changed "'Asir" to "Asir", even though 'Asir is closer to the original Arabic, and the wikipedia page on the subject is called "'Asir" not "Asir".</p>
<p>(4) Finally, you changed "cleanse" to "clean". I changed it back because I think "cleanse" is a better-suited word in the academic context. <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlackerlawstudent_170a.html" title="User:Slackerlawstudent">Slackerlawstudent</a> 01:51, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>hello again friend&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(1) you right , i just read that , i used to believe it was renamed in <a href="../../../1/4/5/1453.html" title="1453">1453</a> , but i think i was wrong&#160;:)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(2) please check this out&#160;: <a href="../../../s/h/i/Talk%7EShia_Islam_9621.html#Poll_for_clarification" title="Talk:Shia Islam">Talk:Shia_Islam#Poll_for_clarification</a> , there is no wiki rules about changing such names , but wiki community prefer much more words in commons , for example if you search on google about "USA" and "US of A" you would find more result hits for "USA" in this case we better use it&#160;:) , same with thing with the name "Mohammed"&#160;:).</dd>
<dd>"Nejd" is more common in english refrences , english people often change cities names a little as you know&#160;:) for example&#160;: Cairo (qahira) , Hejaz (hijaz) , Yemen (yaman) , Allepo (halap) ....etc&#160;:).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(3) same case of number (2). but u still able to restore it&#160;:)</dd>

<p>Salam.. I am sorry, I think you are mistaken, I didn't do that edit&#160;:)).. i was just scanning through categories on wikipedia and updating them so that they are listed under correct categories, if you take a look at the history of the article you will see that it was another user that made that edit before I updated the category - take a look at his edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeddah&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78355989" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeddah&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=78355989" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and my edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeddah&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=78355989" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jeddah&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=78355989" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.. As for praying at someone's grave, I know that it is against Islam, and not just Wahhabism&#160;:) On hindsight, I should have reverted that edit myself.. cheers! <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 21:50, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello amr ,first,I would like to acknowledge &amp; appreciate your beautiful work,I really liked the way you creat &amp; developed the article and it really deserving of respect and admiration for you. second,I'm really sorry if my modification annoyed you ,but IMHO I think we should be very cautious if we attempt to writing information in the great wikipedia,if you ask me, I did what I thought it correcting wrong information should be accurate &amp; correct for people, about the university founder I think the AOU founded under umbrella of the Arab Gulf Programme for United Nations Development Organisations (AGFUND),it is the real whole founder and it's not accurate or reseable or even fair to neglect &amp; ignore other parties efforts into the whole organisations and reduce it in one individual,I think the Prince Talal Bin Abdulaziz does not accept this way &amp; does not like to see only his name as the only founder of the AOU away from other contributes.</p>
<p>another thing the e-mail of the university should not be for personal e-mail address in one university branch ,moreover the fact that the university has its own website at <a href="http://www.arabou.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.arabou.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.arabou.org/</a> and this e-mail not mentioned or appear in this site in contact us page or any other page, kindly you can see that I did not change things for personal reasons as you wrongly thought.</p>
<p>when I decided to add information about AOU,it comes firstly to appreciating your efforts by give a hand for you to complete the information &amp; produce a clear image for the university,second as I'm an IT &amp; Computing Level 3 student at this university, and would like to give a correct &amp; free information in the way to make it convenient,fair and without any vandalism makes me proud with the AOU as a one belongs to it.</p>
<p>Again I acknowledge &amp; appreciate your good &amp; beatiful efforts spent to creat &amp; start this article, and I hope I always help &amp; give a hand to produce the best of our aims whenever the time we meet and wherever the field if you needed me. I'm really waiting your reply and co-operation.</p>
<p>sincerely, Islam</p>

<p>Salam Ammar. Thanks for the message. I see you've been here for a relatively long time but i've never seen you around! I've seen also your last message to Carnildo. Maybe i can give you an answer.

<p>Hi Ammar.&#160;:) I wrote this to 68.39.174.238 because he left me a message about Steve's wiki, and I see that you were the one to leave the copypaste on the article, so I thought I'd leave it on your talk page, too. I can completely understand why you'd think all that information was copied and pasted from somewhere, but it was actually all information I got by digging around, asking friends, asking Steve himself (or being around when Steve was asked certain things), etc. Back when Steve was still pretty new to OLP, I was going to make a fansite for him, but didn't end up doing it... so that's why I went and gathered together a lot of that info (just in case you were wondering haha). Sadly, I can't really cite my sources, because it's impossible to cite a conversation you had with a person in real life.--<a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikki4982_b7ed.html" title="User:Nikki4982">Nikki4982</a> 06:20, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello Ammar. Eid mubarak. I have the article on my watchlist and i am dealing w/ chronical vandalism there. The thing is that semi-protection is the last resort especially where blocking multiple anonymous or newly-created accounts individually is not a solution. I don't believe the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Saudi_Arabia&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Saudi_Arabia&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">situation now</a> is out of control and there is no enough activity to warrant a semi-protection for now. Next time, if you need a semi-protection or a <a href="../../../f/u/l/WP%7EFULL_ad10.html" title="WP:FULL">protection</a> when i am offline you can make a request at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_page_protection_b2ec.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for page protection">Wikipedia:Requests for page protection</a>. Most of the time, an admin would answer your request immediately. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="DarkSlateBlue">Szvest</font></font></a></i> - <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: gold"><sup><i>Wiki me up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 10:01, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've seen your comment in the history of the Romanian Air Force article. I'm sorry if my informations are incorrect but, as far as I know, in Romanian Air Force are 110 MiG-21 LanceR and 10 An24&amp;An26s....i'm a romanian citizen and I checked this information on the official RoAF site and in some newspaper articles. I'll give this link:<a href="http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=9555&amp;art=25285&amp;cHash=edf53ceaeo" class="external free" title="http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=9555&amp;art=25285&amp;cHash=edf53ceaeo" rel="nofollow">http://www.cotidianul.ro/index.php?id=9555&amp;art=25285&amp;cHash=edf53ceaeo</a> .........just check in the 3rd paragraph. thanks 85.186.50.133 18:03, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>My cleanup was NOT vandalism, and I'm shocked that anyone could think so. Remember, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assume_good_faith.html" title="Assume good faith">ASSUME GOOD FAITH</a>. This was simply an article I came across and saw that it needed to be cleaned up. The English in the article was mediocre and the information was disjointed. I added virtually nothing, and the only real change I made was to alter the slightly POV assertion regarding the aims of Wahhab. Your "reversion as vandalism" is, I believe, completely unwarranted. <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenozoicEra_e9b8.html" title="User:CenozoicEra">CenozoicEra</a> 19:43, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is a difference between vandalism and POV. At worst, adding <a href="../../../w/a/h/Wahhabism.html" title="Wahhabism">Wahhabism</a> would be POV, not vandalism, and that is certainly not my intention. I understand that the term has some negative connotations, but that is the name of the article that is used in the English Wikipedia. If you think <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salafism.html" title="Salafism">Salafism</a> is a better article to refer to, then by all means change it. You can even delete the link if you think it is not necessary to understanding the article (that's the whole point of Wikipedia). I inserted it only for the purpose of allowing readers to follow the link to understand the aims of Wahhab. As stated, my goal was strictly to improve the readability of the article for readers.

<dd>It is not possible to make a graphic of the structure of the Saudi Arabian Army yet, as the information is insuffiecient! Thanks to <a href="../../../p/u/b/User%7EPublicus_830d.html" title="User:Publicus">User:Publicus</a> we have more information now, but there is still too many questions: What are the battalions numbery/names? What is above the brigade level? a division? a corps or directly the general staff? Are the army aviation company, engineer company, field workshop and medical company part of the support battalion or directly under the command of the armored brigades staff? Is the reconnaissance company in the armored brigades a own entity or part of the tank battalion? How many infantry brigades are there? Who commands them? Who commands the artillery battalions, who the airborne brigade, what about the Engineer Force 5 "Saif Allah", the 1st Aviation Battalion, the 7th Target Acquisition Company, the 6th Target Acquisition Battery, the 2nd AT Company- who do they answer too?... and so on and on. So i rather do the Argentinian, Australian and Chilean army next, as they provide ample and detailed information about all their units. <a href="../../../n/o/c/User%7ENoclador_22af.html" title="User:Noclador">noclador</a> 08:37, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do strongly suspect too that Zimbabwe will be buying the FC-1. The $300m arms deal with China has not been fully explained. Interesting enough, China denied Zimbabwe had ordered any planes and then a few months later Zimbabwe had K-8s. The twelve K-8s will cost under $60m – I know the 2nd batch of 6 was for $4.6m each. Then it is said Zimbabwe also got 100 vehicles, said to be the DF Motors version of the HMVEE. That cannot explain the $240m! I do believe the Zimbabwean have placed a advance order of the FC-1.</p>

<dd>Yes don't worry , some Vandals trying to remove information just like that , anyways , please do the following:</dd>
<dd>(1) , edit the article , make each section for each type of info (Current and future aircraft) is bad discribtion , but Current AirCrafts) section and (Future AirCraft) section is a good one.</dd>
<dd>(2) , start searching for websources , add each source to it owns aircraft or deal .</dd>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I would like to ask you to have a look and monitor the discussion for editing pages to include info and other POVs in these pages <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Gulf_06b2.html" title="Persian Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Gulf_naming_dispute_532d.html" title="Persian Gulf naming dispute">Persian Gulf naming dispute</a> as many users refuse to include the real translation to Arabic and insist to use their own "transliteration". I would like to ask you to have a look and judge the way of immediate deletion, radical refusal to include any information or other POV, ancient maps as evidences, citiations from ancient history books, references and UN resolutions. Ancient works (like, writings by a Roman historian, medieval maps) are always claimed by some users to be "false" and "incorrect", which is apparent offense of human heritage to achieve geopolitical domination. I cannot believe that there is no bias and political reasons behind this behavior.
