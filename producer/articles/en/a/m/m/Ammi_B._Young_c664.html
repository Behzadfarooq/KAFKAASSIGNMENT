Born in <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon%2C_New_Hampshire_2ac5.html" title="Lebanon, New Hampshire">Lebanon, New Hampshire</a>, he showed a talent for designing monumental buildings. His <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vermont_State_House_9ac4.html" title="Vermont State House">Second Vermont State House</a> brought him fame and success, which eventually led him to become the first <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_of_the_Supervising_Architect_8e7d.html" title="Office of the Supervising Architect">Supervising Architect</a> of the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Treasury_Department_522a.html" title="U.S. Treasury Department">U.S. Treasury Department</a>. As federal architect, he was responsible for creating across the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> numerous <a href="../../../c/u/s/Custom_house.html" title="Custom house">custom houses</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post_office.html" title="Post office">post offices</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Courthouse.html" title="Courthouse">courthouses</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospitals</a>, many of which are today on the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_4c8b.html" title="National Register of Historic Places">National Register</a>. His traditional architectural forms lent a sense of grandeur and permanence to the new country's institutions and communities. Young pioneered the use of <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron.html" title="Iron">iron</a> in construction.</p>
<p>He was the son of Samuel Young, a carpenter-designer of churches, courthouses and academy buildings in the Lebanon area. At the age of 14, Young began work in his father's trade, and in <a href="../../../1/8/2/1823.html" title="1823">1823</a> married his first wife, Mary Hough of Lebanon. He learned the classical orders from pattern books of architect <a href="../../../a/s/h/Asher_Benjamin_8094.html" title="Asher Benjamin">Asher Benjamin</a>. Moreover, his design for the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_style_architecture.html" title="Federal style architecture">Federal style</a> First Congregational Church, built in Lebanon in <a href="../../../1/8/2/1828.html" title="1828">1828</a>, borrows significantly from <i>Plate K</i> of <i>The American Builder's Companion</i>. Early commissions included dormitories at nearby <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_College_efeb.html" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a>, where his brother, Ira Young, was Professor of Natural Philosophy. But the novice architect also learned from working in the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a> office of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Parris_39ba.html" title="Alexander Parris">Alexander Parris</a>, whose characteristic work in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Granite.html" title="Granite">granite</a> influenced Young's subsequent governmental commissions.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/3/1830.html" title="1830">1830</a>, Young opened his own office in <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burlington%2C_Vermont_67b0.html" title="Burlington, Vermont">Burlington, Vermont</a>, a trade center growing fast since the <a href="../../../1/8/2/1823.html" title="1823">1823</a> opening of the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Champlain_Canal_620f.html" title="Champlain Canal">Champlain Canal</a> which connected <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_Champlain_5cc6.html" title="Lake Champlain">Lake Champlain</a> with the <a href="../../../h/u/d/Hudson_River_318c.html" title="Hudson River">Hudson River</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a>. Here he designed the <a href="../../../1/8/3/1832.html" title="1832">1832</a> St. Paul's Church in the <a href="../../../g/o/t/Gothic_Revival_d3b9.html" title="Gothic Revival">Gothic Revival</a> style. His first monumental work was the Second Vermont State House, a <a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruciform.html" title="Cruciform">cruciform</a> Greek Revival structure built between <a href="../../../1/8/3/1833.html" title="1833">1833</a> and <a href="../../../1/8/3/1838.html" title="1838">1838</a>, which combined a Doric <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portico.html" title="Portico">portico</a> modeled on the Temple of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theseus.html" title="Theseus">Theseus</a> in <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athens.html" title="Athens">Athens</a>, with a low saucer <a href="../../../d/o/m/Dome.html" title="Dome">dome</a> inspired by the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pantheon%2C_Rome_03df.html" title="Pantheon, Rome">Pantheon</a> in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>.

But a fire in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1857.html" title="1857">1857</a> destroyed much of the building, except for the portico and some of the walls. With considerable respect for Young's original design, the Vermont State House was rebuilt, although now with wings extended by a <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bay_%28architecture%29.html" title="Bay (architecture)">bay</a>, and a <a href="../../../c/u/p/Cupola.html" title="Cupola">cupola</a> crowning the roof – the plan of Thomas Silloway, trained in Young's office from <a href="../../../1/8/4/1847.html" title="1847">1847</a> until <a href="../../../1/8/5/1851.html" title="1851">1851</a>. The result was considered by architect <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_White_a307.html" title="Stanford White">Stanford White</a> the finest example of the Greek Revival style in the country.</p>

<p>Entering the <a href="../../../1/8/3/1837.html" title="1837">1837</a> competition to design the Boston Custom House, Young submitted another cruciform scheme combining a Greek Doric portico with a Roman dome. Planned on a large scale at what was then the waterfront, the building reflected the strength and confidence of the young, growing nation. It won, defeating several other entries, including one by Asher Benjamin. Young was appointed supervisor of construction, which took from 1837 until 1847. In <a href="../../../1/8/3/1838.html" title="1838">1838</a>, he established a Boston drafting room. The building's 32 columns were each carved from a single piece from <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quincy%2C_Massachusetts_6c46.html" title="Quincy, Massachusetts">Quincy</a> granite. They measured 5 foot 4 inches in diameter, stood 32 feet high, and weighed 42 tons. <a href="../../../p/u/r/Purist.html" title="Purist">Purists</a> decried the Roman dome on a Greek form. Far less sympathetic to the building's Greek form, however, would be the soaring <a href="../../../c/u/s/Custom_House_Tower_c502.html" title="Custom House Tower">Custom House Tower</a> which replaced the dome in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a>-<a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a>.

<p>Young entered the <a href="../../../1/8/5/1850.html" title="1850">1850</a> competition to design enlargements to the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Capitol_9d8c.html" title="U.S. Capitol">U.S. Capitol</a> in <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington%2C_D.C._323f.html" title="Washington, D.C.">Washington</a>. Although considered a leading competitor, he lost to <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_U._Walter_a24e.html" title="Thomas U. Walter">Thomas U. Walter</a>. As a sort of compensation, he was appointed in <a href="../../../1/8/5/1852.html" title="1852">1852</a> as the first Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department, a position created by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Corwin_ecbd.html" title="Thomas Corwin">Thomas Corwin</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_the_Treasury_05ff.html" title="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a> during the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millard_Fillmore_5e1f.html" title="Millard Fillmore">Fillmore</a> administration. From a studio in the Treasury, Young produced designs and specifications for federal buildings ordered by the government to facilitate its various functions throughout the nation. Mandated to be fire-proof, the custom houses, post offices, courthouses and hospitals he built featured masonry foundations, walls and vaulting, with <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cast_iron.html" title="Cast iron">cast iron</a> interior structural and decorative elements, including columns, stairways and railings. Heavy iron shutters were mounted on the inside of windows. Floors and treads were <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marble.html" title="Marble">marble</a>, and roofs were <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galvanized.html" title="Galvanized">galvanized</a> metal. Column capitols, <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascia_%28architecture%29.html" title="Fascia (architecture)">fascia</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pediment.html" title="Pediment">pediments</a> on the exterior, when not stone, were cast iron painted to look like stone -- which drew criticism of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parsimony.html" title="Parsimony">parsimony</a> by the federal architect. Cast iron components were manufactured to Young's specifications in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> state, then shipped to building sites.</p>
<p>At the same time, ongoing modifications to the Treasury Building concerned Young, expected to create working drawings based on plans by Walter. For the South Wing, he invented a column capital which symbolized the department, substituting <a href="../../../a/c/a/Acanthus_%28ornament%29.html" title="Acanthus (ornament)">acanthus</a> leaves of the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corinthian_order.html" title="Corinthian order">Corinthian order</a> with <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle.html" title="Eagle">eagles</a> and a fist holding a key. Young held the role until he retired on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_24.html" title="July 24">July 24</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/6/1862.html" title="1862">1862</a>, dismissed by <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salmon_P._Chase_8b52.html" title="Salmon P. Chase">Salmon P. Chase</a> of the <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">Lincoln</a> administration.

Several of Young's buildings would play a part in the rebellion, particularly his custom house in <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond%2C_Virginia_2b80.html" title="Richmond, Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>, which served as the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederate_States_of_America_b8e1.html" title="Confederate States of America">Confederate</a> Treasury.

Indeed, from its courtroom <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jefferson_Davis_8885.html" title="Jefferson Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> was indicted for <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a> in May of <a href="../../../1/8/6/1866.html" title="1866">1866</a>, although he would be granted <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesty.html" title="Amnesty">amnesty</a>.</p>
<p>Young was awarded honorary degrees (M.A.) from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Vermont_11e6.html" title="University of Vermont">University of Vermont</a> (<a href="../../../1/8/3/1839.html" title="1839">1839</a>) and Dartmouth College (<a href="../../../1/8/4/1841.html" title="1841">1841</a>).
