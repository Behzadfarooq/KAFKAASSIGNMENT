<p>Question:</p>
<p>Has there been any experimentation of recombining small amounts of NH3 with liquefied petroleum gases such as propane or butane and then buring the fuel mixture? I heard that it is possible to create a release of toxic gas similar to phosgene.(Jbjoseph 17:56, 22 February 2007 (UTC))</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>As a process engineer, i have one question regarding Ammonia.</p>
<p>one reactor/ vessel having amonia. if during rainfall amonia gas leakages and mixed with rain water what possible reaction might occur? and is it dangeraous to structure steel? what possible measures to be taken?</p>
<p>Bhavin SHeth bhavin_sheth@rediffmail.com</p>
<dl>
<dd>Hello Bhavin, you probably shouldn't really be getting your engineering advice from random strangers on the 'net (check our <a href="../../../g/e/n/Wikipedia%7EGeneral_disclaimer_3e44.html" title="Wikipedia:General disclaimer">disclaimer</a>). However FWIW, at room temperature ammonia has no effect on steel (in fact steel is one of the preferred materials for handling ammonia), nor on most other structural materials (it might bleach paints, etc). It will however severely corrode copper alloys and zinc (including galvanising on the steel). Your first concern in a leak should be human toxicity. Fortunately however your leak apparently occurred in rain, and ammonia is so extremely water soluble it is unlikely much gas failed to dissolve into the water. So your second concern should be what is now going to happen to the now alkaline run off? If it escapes into a confined body of water, you may end up with a <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishkill.html" title="Fishkill">fishkill</a>. <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecuriger_6d53.html" title="User:Securiger">Securiger</a> 11:58, 29 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think the crystal structure should be removed from the table. In standard conditions ammonia isn't a crystal. In other conditions almost any structure may be possible.

<dd>I don't think there is a stable molecule having the formula N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>. It seems to me to be a part of a <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrazine.html" title="Hydrazine">hydrazine</a> molecule. Hydrazine has the formula N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. It is a liquid compound at room temperature. One of the hydrogens on it could be substituted by another group to give a <i>substituted hydrazine</i> like MonoMethylHydrazine CH<sub>3</sub>-N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>. Then the molecule would have an -N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub> functional group. How is this relevant to ammonia? There just some ammonia like groups or compounds, that's mostly about it. I know hydrazine at very high temperatures will decompose to form ammonia. Probably some compounds with the -N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub> group would also decompose at high temperature to form some ammonia. <a href="../../../h/_/p/User%7EH_Padleckas_0cae.html" title="User:H Padleckas">H Padleckas</a> 05:36, 5 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I started a minor overhaul of this article offline and never got around to finishing it. Let me see if I can finish my changes in a while (couple days maybe). I agree it could use some modifications. <a href="../../../h/_/p/User%7EH_Padleckas_0cae.html" title="User:H Padleckas">H Padleckas</a> 21:33, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just made some of these changes I mentioned above, including expanding some chemistry discussion and use of ammonia as a refrigerant. Other things I would like to cover in this <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammonia.html" title="Ammonia">Ammonia</a> article are to improve the organic compounds discussion slightly, to mention ammonia as a ligand for such metal cation complexes as Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>, Cu(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><sup>++</sup>, and<br />
Ni(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub><sup>++</sup>, mentioning Tollen's Reagent, and the discuss ammonia as a very weak acid forming the "amide" ion (in addition to ammonia being a base forming <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammonium.html" title="Ammonium">ammonium</a> ions). These changes I have yet to formulate. <a href="../../../h/_/p/User%7EH_Padleckas_0cae.html" title="User:H Padleckas">H Padleckas</a> 01:23, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have quite a list of changes to make to this article, but still no good sections on ligand properties and solvant behaviour.

It could certainly be an FA candidate, but let's wait till HCl (that is, hydronium chloride solution) is FA distant history, as we need an organic or something for our next FA candidate. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalkerma_c63c.html" title="User:Walkerma">Walkerma</a> 18:27, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In water, even strong acids such as hydrochloric acid are still called such, like hydrochloric acid and written as HCl, not called hydronium chloride and written as H<sub>3</sub>OCl, even though they are essentially completely dissociated into such. Therefore, hydrochloric acid in liquid ammonia should be called hydrochloric acid, not ammonium chloride. If you call it ammonium chloride in ammonia, you must call it hydronium chloride in water - or else you're being inconsistent. So, I choose to refer to "ammonium acetate" and "ammonium nitrate" dissolved in liquid ammonia as "acetic acid" and "nitric acid", respectively. After all, we don't call aqueous nitric acid solutions "hydronium nitrate" or aqueous acetic acid solutions "hydronium acetate". So, I rightfully choose to put acid names up as well. If you believe otherwise, please explain your logic. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightvid_fbbb.html" title="User:Nightvid">User:Nightvid</a></p>

<dd>Chemical nomenclature is not an exact science, as you will realise from a look at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28chemistry%29_031e.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (chemistry)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (chemistry)</a>. I do not feel under any obligation to be "consistent" in the sense that you imply, merely to be clear and unambiguous. The Bronsted theory of acidity as applied to non-aqueous solvents is a fascinating topic which should be discussed in more depth in Wikipedia, but I cannot see what is gained by using the same name to refer to both HCl and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. Such a usage would break the fundamental <a href="../../../i/u/p/IUPAC_2cc4.html" title="IUPAC">IUPAC</a> rule of nomenclature, namely that each name should map to a single, unique structure. <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> 16:31, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There is a second misconception in your arguement: the nomenclature of aqueous acids is also "inconsistent" by your criteria. You correctly point out that we do not talk of hydronium nitrate for aqueous nitric acid, even though it is completely ionized: in this case, the acid (potential proton donor) is the hydronium ion, the strongest acid which can exist in aqueous solution. We do not talk of hydronium acetate as this is almost never the majority species in aqueous solution: the majority proton donor is the MeCOOH molecule. Incedentally, we <b>do</b> refer to hydronium salts in the rare cases in which they are isolated as distinct crystalline compounds, <i>e.g.</i> hydronium perchlorate, H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>â</sup> (crystallographically characterized).</dd>
<dd>The different theories of acidity are briefly dealt with in <a href="../../../a/c/i/Acid.html" title="Acid">acid</a>. I will pull together a couple of paragraphs on their transposition to non-aqueous solvants and use it to start the article Inorganic non-aqueous solvant (watch this link!).</dd>
<dd>As for formulae, French school inspectors require teachers to write hydrochloric acid as (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>â</sup>): I don't agree with this, but I have yet to convince them otherwise! <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> 22:45, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First of all, it would not be using the same name to refer to HCl and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, but rather to call solutions containing NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions in liquid NH<sub>3</sub> "HCl" if solutions containing H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> in liquid H<sub>2</sub>O are called "HCl". Certainly writing HCl(am) indicates dissociation into NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions as much as HCl(aq) indicates H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions (am means ammine solution, or solution in liquid ammonia). In addition, there are already chemical names in existence which refer to more than one thing. The term "amide" for example, refers to both organic compounds with the functional group -CONH<sub>2</sub>, and to ionic compounds with the anion NH<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>.</dd>

<dd>You're right about acetic acid being weak in water, so it does make sense to write it in the molecular form (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH). However, to write aqueous nitric acid as "HNO<sub>3</sub>" is not any better than writing ammine nitric acid ("ammonium nitrate") as "HNO<sub>3</sub>". Also, why is hydronium perchlorate only called such if crystallized? Perchloric acid is a strong acid, so aqueous solutions will contain H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> and ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> ions, and [essentially] zero HClO<sub>4</sub> molecules. If you write aqueous solutions as "HClO<sub>4</sub>", then you should also write ammine perchloric acid ("ammonium perchlorate") as "HClO<sub>4</sub>", and only when it is isolated, write it as "NH<sub>4</sub>ClO<sub>4</sub>".</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I do respect that chemical names are conventions. Maybe if we lived on a planet where the oceans were made of liquid ammonia and life was based on ammine solutions, we would write "HCl" and "HNO<sub>3</sub>" for ammine solution containing ammonium and (chloride or nitrate) ions, respectively. I guess I am just really tired of people who don't realize that the water and the ammine solutions of acids are perfectly analogous. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightvid_fbbb.html" title="User:Nightvid">User:Nightvid</a></dd>

<dd>Whoa, I thought I knew chemistry, but now I'm feeling humble! Anyway, I see where you are coming from, but I must point out that if you always exclude all solvent formula units, then sugar water is simply C(aq). This seems farfetched to me!</dd>

<dd>The equilibrium reactions you're mentioning are not simple Bronsted-Lowry acid-base reactions. They are, as a matter of fact, Lewis acid-base reactions. I certainly was not thinking of this, but you definitely have a valid point. Maybe we should write all aqueous acids and bases as their most dehydrated form, and ammine acids and bases as their most "deamminated" form. This would, interestingly, cause some compounds to be written in a form that resembles nonexistent/very unstable compounds. For instance, in this system, a solution of potassium amide (KNH<sub>2</sub>) in liquid ammonia would be written as K<sub>3</sub>N(am), or ammine potassium nitride. The compound potassium nitride itself is unstable, pure K<sub>3</sub>N decomposing quickly into potassium metal and nitrogen gas. Nevertheless, I have to say, I am very impressed with your idea.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It makes the issue far simpler to discuss only aqueous acids which contain no oxygen, and ammine acids which contain no nitrogen. The hydrohalic acids work well for comparisons, as they contain no oxygen or nitrogen. All four of them (HF, HCl, HBr, HI) are strong acids in liquid ammonia, and all of them except HF are strong acids in water.</dd>

<p>By convention, salts containing the ammonium ion are referred to as "acid salts" in the chemistry books I've been exposed to. I'm tweaking the article text to reflect this, and removing anon's large modification on this topic. As for "consistency", if chemical names were consistent, figuring out how many oxygen atoms were being described with the hypo-/per-/-ous/-ic system would be a lot less confusing. Convention trumps consistency, as the goal is to produce an article that's readable. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 20:52, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The whole of acid-base chemistry has its parallel in liquid ammonia. We write aqueous hydrochloric, nitric, and perchloric acids as HCl, HNO<sub>3</sub>, and HClO<sub>4</sub>, respectively, rather than H<sub>3</sub>OCl, H<sub>3</sub>ONO<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>3</sub>OClO<sub>4</sub>, despite the fact that as strong acids they exist in the ionized state. Thus we should do likewise for the ammine counterparts, that is, ammine solutions of the aforementioned acids we should also write as HCl, HNO<sub>3</sub>, and HClO<sub>4</sub>, respectively, even though they are strong acids and would be totally dissociated. If you call solutions containing ammonium ions, with chloride, nitrate, or perchlorate ions, in liquid ammonia, as not acids but ammonium salts with formulas NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>, and NH<sub>4</sub>ClO<sub>4</sub>, then it's fine, but then you should also refer to aqueous solutions with hydronium ions as not acids but hydronium salts. Either you call them salts of the protonated solvent, or you call them acids. It is completely nonsensical to use the former for ammine solutions and the latter for aqueous solutions. Make sense?</dd>

<p>Most insect and animal toxins are proteins. If you can change the shape of the protein (denature) it is rendered ineffective. This can be accomplished by means of acids, bases, or heat. For example if you get stung by a Portuguese man-of-war you can piss on the wound or apply very hot water.

<dd>The fact of the matter is that both ammonia and nitrous acid are amphoteric, meaning that they can act as an acid or as a base. Ammonia behaves as a base in water, but behaves as an acid when added to lithium nitride. Nitrous acid behaves as an acid in water, but would probably behave as a base (accept a proton) if added to anhydrous perchloric acid. The thing is, ANY molecule which contains one or more H atoms is an acid, however weak, and ANY molecule which contains one or more unshared pairs of electrons is a base, however weak. This doesn't mean that they can behave as such in water, however. But it doesn't make any more sense, fundamentally speaking, to choose water as your solvent than it does to choose either molten lithium nitride or anhydrous perchloric acid. By convention, though, if it doesn't behave as an acid in water, the "H" is NOT written first. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightvid_fbbb.html" title="User:Nightvid">User: Nightvid</a></dd>

<p>If the formula were written to sort electronegativity by successive groups, then this would be the order: N(+) â HN(+) â HHN(+,-) â HHNH (-,+) â HHNHH<sup>+</sup>. Without being given to water, ammonia is still mostly electronegative because it has two electron donors and one proton donor, as shown by the signs in the former groups. And, as nitrogen starts out electronegative, it doesn't matter if however many <i>free</i> bases stick to it because, as they are free, they have a nonzero attraction to the unfilled partial charges. Nitrogen will, however, fill up with only three bases because their freedom is broken by splitting their energy levels and raising their entropy. And, if "conventional" formulÃ¦ were followed, then the ammonium ion would be written last because of its greater <i>tendency</i> to be a proton donor when offered a choice between proton and electron, even thouh it would still take another proton on its other orbital end: HONH<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p>What you said about convention is rubbish. I wasn't talking about whether something is convention, but with whether it should be a convention. (It's â Its) Even if everyone writes the formula wrong, Wikipedia may still report that it <i>is</i> written wrong, and why and how, given the rules that are a greater deciding factor than conventions. I've seen borane, alkane, silane, azane, germane, and even oxane before, but I've seen no acknowledging of -ane used in dictionaries other than with carbon; the etumologies say that it's a variant of -ene, -ine, and -one. Besides, other names that contradict -ane are fosfine (Yes, that's how it should be spelt.) and arsine. At first, the different ending looks to do with saturation and bond order, but looking at a table with electronegativity it more importantly has to do with whether H becomes positive or negative. In most haps, it becomes positive, going in front of the formula, and taking an -ane. Otherwise it's a hudride or maybe -ine. So silane, borane, and germane are wrong. Carbane and azane and oxane are riht, becoming carbanium, azanium, and oxanium in acid. If one wants to use them in terms of their central or electropositive atom, then those would be the names. But as <i>molecules</i> and <i>materials</i>, one may still say methane, ammonia, and water/aqua/hudros.</p>
<p>Does water behave as acid in water? It behaves as both, so why don't chemists use HOH instead of H<sub>2</sub>O? I'd expect something like "H<sub>2</sub>O" to be a superbase! The convention of putting H in front for acids in water is accidental, because there are so many common acids, and that's where the H normally <i>would</i> go despite its behaving in water. <a href="../../../l/y/s/User%7ELysdexia_bda0.html" title="User:Lysdexia">lysdexia</a> 21:42, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a soapbox.

<p>The molecular formula of ammonia is NH<sub>3</sub>, the structural formula is H<sub>3</sub>N. Molecular formula is normally used as a shorthand, so as to prevent long carbon compounds from having to be written out longhand. Eg.

<p>Does anyone know if exposure to ammonia can cause asthma? I see it is reported as a respiratory irritant, but does this do any long term harm? I ask because when I was at school, age 15 or so, I was called upon to demonstrate an experiment where nylon was formed from some monomer material dissolved in concentrated ammonia - you can pull out the nylon polymer material using a glass rod - science teachers probably recognise the experiment I am talking about. However, due to the fume cupboard being broken, I inhaled a lot of the ammonia - the exposure went on for maybe 3 or 4 hours, and I lost my sense of smell afterwards for about a week... however, longer term I developed mild asthma and a sensitivity to other substances such as sulphites (E220) which I don't recall ever having had prior to the ammonia thing. I just wondered if there is any evidence that this might have been a causal factor? <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGRAHAMUK_f38c.html" title="User:GRAHAMUK">Graham</a> 04:03, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Under Base Definitions: "The degree to which ammonia forms the ammonium ion depends on the pH of the solutionâat "physiological" pH (~7), about 99% of the ammonia molecules are protonated." ... Source? If anything, I would think that it means to say "about 99% of the ammonia molecules are NOT protonated" as ammonia is a relatively weak base.

<dd>It is a simple calculation from values of the <a href="../../../a/c/i/Acid_dissociation_constant.html" title="Acid dissociation constant">acid dissociation constant</a> which, for NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> is about 9.2. At pH&#160;9.2, there is a 50:50 split between NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and NH<sub>3</sub>. Physiological conditions are normally around pH&#160;7.2, which means that there is roughly one hundred times as much NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> as NH<sub>3</sub>. <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> <a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhyschim62_05f3.html" title="User talk:Physchim62">(talk)</a> 10:43, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ammonia has a k<sub>b</sub> value of about 1.75*10<sup>-5</sup> (Or mildly weak base). A solution of .200M Ammonia will produce a pH of about 11.26(Same concentration of Sodium Hydroxide is around 13.30) so that should give you an idea of how strong/weak it is. Even though it is a weak base it is still relatively strong. A weak base is just one that does not ionize completely, but that doesn't mean it would still be some what strong.<a href="../../../l/o/y/User%7ELoyalSoldier_61a1.html" title="User:LoyalSoldier">LoyalSoldier</a> 06:09, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's a grain of truth in it, although it needs serious improvement. Agriculture, as needed to feed the current human population, depends on fertilizers which are based on ammonia. --<a href="../../../i/t/u/User%7EItub_c2f2.html" title="User:Itub">Itub</a> 06:34, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
