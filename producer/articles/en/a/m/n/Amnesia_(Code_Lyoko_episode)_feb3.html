<p>When Mrs. Hertz gives a lesson on nanotechnology, she has small machine designed to produce the little robots as an example. Little does the class realize that XANA has infected it, so when they find it filed with gel, Odd carelessly ends up pushing Ulrich's face into a small scoop of it. Later on, Ulrich gets a headache and collapses. When he wakes up, his memory is gone. Sissi is there at the time, so she uses Ulrich's memory loss to convince him that she's his girlfriend. As the rest of the group tries to bring him to his senses, more cases of amnesia occur, spreading from person to person like a disease. Only after most of the school is affected does Jeremie realize that XANA-produced nanotechnology is responsible.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesia_%28Code_Lyoko_episode%29_feb3.html" title="Edit section: Recap">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Recap</span></h2>
<div class="notice spoiler" id="spoiler"><b><a href="../../../s/p/o/Wikipedia%7ESpoiler_warning_6b56.html" title="Wikipedia:Spoiler warning">Spoiler warning</a>: <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></b></div>
<p>At the beginning of the episode, <a href="../../../x/a/n/Xana_%28Code_Lyoko%29_66e8.html" title="Xana (Code Lyoko)">XANA</a> activates a <a href="../../../t/o/w/Tower_%28Code_Lyoko%29_4ce5.html" title="Tower (Code Lyoko)">Tower</a> and seeps through <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Suzanne_Hertz" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Mrs. Hertz's</a> computer. From there, the ghost enters into a nanobot dome and activates a pool of nanobots whilst the teacher is elsewhere. XANA puts its own nanobot inside some cleansing gel.</p>
<p>Some time later, the eighth grade comes in for Science class, and Mrs. Hertz is giving them a demonstration and lecture on nanobots. When she leads them over to the nanobot container, she claims that the Nanotechnology Services Company was nice enough to lend the school this piece of equipment. <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elisabeth_Delmas_1152.html" title="Elisabeth Delmas">Sissi</a> asks Mrs. Hertz if the nanobots will be capable of curing cellulite and other disorders. The class laughs and Mrs. Hertz says they can, but more critical diseases like cancer will take priority. <a href="../../../o/d/d/Odd_Della_Robbia_49ea.html" title="Odd Della Robbia">Odd</a> then says, "Poor Sissi, and nanobots can't do a thing about stupidity!"</p>
<p>When she sees the gel-filled sphere, Mrs. Hertz says the contraption was not properly cleaned. <a href="../../../u/l/r/Ulrich_Stern_94b0.html" title="Ulrich Stern">Ulrich</a> says the gel looks like the grease Odd puts in his hair and gets a few laughs. Mrs. Hertz tells Ulrich that if he's so clever he can get a gel sample. As Ulrich dips in a sample slide and holds it up to eye level, he says it looks like jam. Odd, not knowing of the harmful elements inside the substance, knocks Ulrich's face into the slide, covering his nose with the clear gel. As the class laughs, Ulrich promises revenge and Mrs. Hertz calls the room to order. Odd tells the stymied Ulrich that "I just couldn't resist!". The XANA nanobot enters Ulrich's body via his nasal passages.</p>
<p>Whilst Team Lyoko is talking in the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Courtyard" title="Kadic Junior High School">Quad</a> after their classes, Ulrich is eating a chocolate bar. Odd asks for some and, in revenge for Odd's earlier prank, Ulrich hits Odd's forehead with the half-melted chocolate bar. Ulrich, Yumi and Jeremie laugh while Odd protests. Suddenly, Ulrich's veins bulge out of his skull and he promptly faints. He is rushed to the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Infirmary" title="Kadic Junior High School">Infirmary</a>. During dinner, Sissi comes to visit Ulrich, and discovers he doesn't remember a thing. She decides to use this to her advantage and tells Ulrich she is his girlfriend. Suddenly, a few memories flash through Ulrich's mind and he says that's impossible and "I'm allergic to anyone who is conceited." Nevertheless, he lets Sissi guide him around. When Ulrich sees <a href="../../../y/u/m/Yumi_Ishiyama_c57b.html" title="Yumi Ishiyama">Yumi</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jeremie_Belpois_ebe7.html" title="Jeremie Belpois">Jeremie</a> and Odd in the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Park" title="Kadic Junior High School">Park</a>, Sissi tells Ulrich that they are his worst enemies. When Odd comes over to greet Ulrich, the latter yells at Odd to buzz off. After this incident, Jeremie talks to <a href="../../../a/e/l/Aelita_%28Code_Lyoko%29_7a7c.html" title="Aelita (Code Lyoko)">Aelita</a> about any activated Towers. She tells him that she senses Pulsations in the <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyoko.html#Ice_Barrier" title="Lyoko">Ice Barrier Sector</a>, so Jeremie contacts Odd and Yumi, who get ready to go to the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Factory_%28Code_Lyoko%29_6884.html" title="Factory (Code Lyoko)">Factory</a> to assist the AI.</p>
<p>Before leaving for the Factory, the three stop by the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Science_building" title="Kadic Junior High School">Science Building</a> in order to investigate what was probably the source: the nanodome. Upon inspection utilitzing a compound light microscope, Jeremie uncovers spider-like viruses with the Eye of XANA imprinted on their backs. Jeremie concludes that XANA bioengineered these to attack memory cells. He then muses, "A world without memories..." as he trails off, Yumi picks up: "Under XANA's control!"</p>
<p>Under the arches bordering the Quad, Sissi introduces Ulrich to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Herv.C3.A9_Pichon" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Hervé</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Nicolas_Poliakoff" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Nicolas</a>, who she says are Ulrich's best friends. Sissi's accomplices stare blankly at Ulrich before Sissi tells them to "remind" the amnesic boy, since he "often forgets." The next time Ulrich sees Odd peeking at him from behind a tree on the Quad, Ulrich charges the blonde wildcard and yells at Odd to stop stalking him. When he tackles Odd, several memories of Ulrich hanging out with Odd promptly flash through the former's mind. He lets go staggers back into the <a href="../../../k/a/d/Kadic_Junior_High_School_8384.html#Dorm_rooms" title="Kadic Junior High School">Dormitory Building</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the entire school is catching amnesia. As Ulrich stumbles down the Quad's surrounding arcade (not a video arcade, but in this instance an arched breezeway) he sees Sissi faint, promptly followed by Hervé, Nicholas, and dozens of other students. As he walks past Ulrich, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Jean-Pierre_Delmas" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Headmaster Delmas</a> clutches his forehead, moans and passes out as the nanobots travel via human contact to infect the rest of the nation's populace, and soon, the world will be under XANA's influence.</p>
<p>Ulrich stumbles down the hall in the Dormitory Building. Tristan Brossard, who has not been affected yet, is walking in the opposite direction carrying a gunny sack. As the two pass, Ulrich grips Tristan's arm (this, in effect, transfers the virus to this previously unaffected boy), and asks the seventh grader for directions to Odd's room. Tristan asks if everyone has gone crazy and tells Ulrich it's the third door on the left and he promptly scampers off.</p>
<p>In the dorm room, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_secondary_characters_in_Code_Lyoko_4458.html#Kiwi" title="List of secondary characters in Code Lyoko">Kiwi</a> comes to greet Ulrich. As the dog licks the boy's hand Ulrich says, "I don't know who you are, but I guess we're friends." Then, Ulrich finds a photo of him and Odd hanging out together. At sight of this, Ulrich feels an urge to go to the Sewers. He does so, and ends up in the Factory, where Jeremie greets him. Ulrich says that he doesn't know what is going on, but he feels that he is needed here. Jeremie transfers, scans and <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scanner_%28Code_Lyoko%29_7363.html#Virtualization" title="Scanner (Code Lyoko)">virtualizes</a> him.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../l/y/o/Lyoko.html" title="Lyoko">Lyoko</a>, Ulrich relearns how to use his katana with Odd. After some practice, Ulrich and Odd are running down the icy path and Ulrich, who could not hit Odd with his katana during training, tackles his friend and says that he won their duel. Odd congratulates him, but says that he attacked an ally. He points out Yumi and Aelita up ahead and labels them as allies. He also points to two <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_monsters_in_Code_Lyoko_4848.html#Krabes" title="List of monsters in Code Lyoko">Krabes</a> who are firing at Aelita's Creativity-induced wall of ice. The Krabes are enemies. The ice wall is broken and Ulrich attacks with gusto. Yumi turns around to greet him, but is quickly hit and devirtualized by a laser bolt. She does not react to this blunder well upon returning to the real world. Up in the Lab she tells Jeremie that she is happy Ulrich is feeling better. She is surprised to learn that Ulrich still has amnesia, but is willing to help anyway. The two watch Ulrich destroy the Krabes and usher Aelita to the activated Tower. Aelita deactivates it, putting our heroes back to science class.</p>
<p>That morning, Ulrich makes his wisecrack about the gel and Mrs. Hertz orders him to get the sample as a result. Knowing what lurks within, Odd doesn't push Ulrich's face into the sample slide. Ulrich comments that the gel looks like jam and recommends that they cook it. Mrs. Hertz and the class (save Jeremie and Odd) stand dumbfounded at Ulrich's suggestion and watch him carry out his experiment. Ulrich holds the slide with a pair of tongs over a lighted Bunsen Burner. Within seconds the super-heated blue flame melts the gel, slide and tongs. Mrs. Hertz is furious at this and gives Ulrich a severe punishment for destroying school property, a punishment, "That you are not soon to forget!" Ulrich responds saying, "I sure hope not Mrs. Hertz." Jeremie and Odd laugh at this while the rest of the class and the teacher stand stupified at Ulrich's response.</p>

<li>When Jeremie told Ulrich to go to the Scanner Room, Jeremie told Ulrich to go in the elevator and go one level up, but the Scanners are one level down.</li>
<li>When the camera swings partially behind Odd in one of his fight scenes with Ulrich in Lyoko, his purple shirt disappears and only its collar remains.</li>
<li>In one shot, the collar to Jeremie's turtleneck and way past the neck line is missing. One can even see the lines that define his collarbone.</li>
