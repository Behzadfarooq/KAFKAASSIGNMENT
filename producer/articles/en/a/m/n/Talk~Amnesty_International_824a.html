<p>Hi Guys - I am new to Wikipedia, and am sorry if I am doing this wrong. However, my wife just got a job with AI which has forced me to revisit my personal views on the subject. Basically, I am torn between the general notion that AI is fighting the good fight and the absolute revulsion I have towards them with regards to the Mumia Abu Jamal affair. In a nutshell, Mumia Abu Jamal is a man in Philadelphia, USA who is alleged to have killed a police officer and was sentenced to death for this. I have no general philosophical problem with AI's overall anti-death penalty stances. The specific problems in this particular case, which many Americans in particular are aware of and thus have at best mixed feelings about AI over, center around AI's actions in this case. For example,</p>
<p>1. AI's choice to visibly support MAJ was highly questionable given the preponderance of evidence against him. MAJ is highly photogenic. This would itself not be a problem, except that ... 2. The evidence against MAJ was, is, and continues to be very damning. By any reasonable standard, given the evidence (both allowed in court and not), it is fairly clear that MAJ is guilty of the crime which he is alleged to have committed. Neverthelss, AI's use of his case an anti-DP rallying point would not be so bad if it weren't for ... 3. The fact that AI continued to spread outright lies, distortions, and inaccuracies about the case well after the fact that such items were well known to be untruths. for example, AI continued to spread (extremely vicious, in comse cases) untruths related to the ballistics experts reports, the record of the presiding judge, witness testimony and location, and so forth WELL after these things had been discredited AND it was clear that the AI members responsible would have to have been aware that such things had been roundly discredited. In other words, the basic criticism is that the anti-DP zeal here got in the way of the actual facts of the case. I, and many Americans, found AI's actions here to be unconscionable.</p>
<p>Adding insult to the injury (please remember that there was a slain police officer's widow seeing all these), AI was fundamentally involved in organizing pro-MAJ marches and protests throughout the world and having MAJ declared an honorary citizen of Paris. in short, AI orchestrated the deification of this man who, had he been innocent, may have deserved it. However, when confronted with the facts, rather than modifying their stance, AI's MAJ supporters let momentum get the best of them and ignored, distored, and suppressed facts to further perpetuate the MAJ myth that they were largely responsible for initiating.</p>
<p>One defense that I have heard of this is that AI was (is?) a highly distributed organization, and that the pro-MAJ actions were done by an isolated group. Such a defense, of course, should be case for further criticism. After all, even while some sub-group may act independently, should there not at some point be an organizational oversight who forces them back into line if they strayed as badly as they did in this case?</p>
<p>The whole MAJ affair was a major turn-off for many Americans with regards to AI. It reinforced the view that AI was strongly anti-American beyond just the death penalty - indeed, much of AI's criticisms of the MAJ affair centered upon tales of racism that, while perhaps fitting with the stereotypes of many in the European left about the USA, didn't actually jibe with reality in this case.</p>
<p>For many of us, the case of MAJ and AI are inexorably linked. Certainly, in Philadelphia, the 5th largest city in the USA and arguably its most liberal (moreso even than Boston or San Fransisco), it's hard to say AI in one breath without having somebody mentioning MAJ. I suggest that this is a major area of criticism that has been completely overlooked in the AI article. Perhaps somebody could write this?</p>
<p>UPDATE: Since I wrote the above a few hours ago, I read through the web a bit. It seems that AI or whoever have whitewashed their position nearly completely over the web from "MAJ is innocent" to "MAJ didn't get a fair trial." The second sounds more plausible, no? However, the problem is that the issues of "MAJ didn't get a fair trial" have all been thoroughly addressed. In some sense, this relatively new (since 2001 or so) focus on "didn't get a fair trial" is almost more devious, since the lay reader has to take even more "on faith" from AI. The reality is that MAJ did receive a fair trial by any civilized standards, and he has had NUMEROUS appeals and reconsiderations since. The MAJ wikipedia article has links to quite a number of good websites - danielfaulkner.com is perhaps the best place to start.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>thank you</p>

<p>This article is completely skewed towards the far far far far far far far right.</p>
<p>Amnesty International has many left-wing critics, including most of its own grassroots members, who contend that the organisation is run by people with a far-right ideological bent, in contrast to its mostly left-wing members.</p>
<p>For example, Amnesty International strongly supports the brutal occupation of Palestine, and strongly condemns anyone who fights against it.It also attacks any left wing countries for trying to support human rights.</p>
<p><br />
And it has a very narrow interpretation of human rights, which doesn't include access to basic services.</p>

<p><br />
Is there any link (preferable to AI web) proving that "AI supports occupation of Palestine"?</p>
<p>Viliam Bur 195.46.70.44 11:54, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Oh come on. "brutal occupation of Palestine." Every word in that phrase is loaded (except, maybe, 'of'). If you want us to take your views seriously, at least pretend to try to state them in some neutral way. It would also be helpful if you took a realistic view of your own political leanings - to state that the article is slanted to the "far<sup>7</sup> right" is ludicrous. Even if you think it is slanted to the right, there's no need to hyperbolize this, as it just makes your views seem less credible and more ideologically motivated. Your statement that "it attacks any left wing countries for trying to support human rights" is overbroad and ridiculous. In fact, I am wondering why we don't just get rid of your silly comments altogether here - you would be welcome to repost them, of course, if you were to state them with a little balance and evidence.</p>

<p>On the contrary.</p>
<p>From an Amnesty International report: "Some 3,700 Palestinians – most of them unarmed and including over 600 children – have been killed by the Israeli army and settlers, and almost 1,000 Israelis – most of them civilians and including more than 100 children – have been killed by Palestinians since the start of the current uprising (Intifada) in September 2000. In addition, Palestinians living under Israeli military occupation in The West Bank and Gaza Strip are subject to a wide range of human rights violations."</p>
<p>In my opinion, Amnesty International is remaining as neutral as possible—calling a human rights violation when it is, indeed, a human rights violation.</p>
<p>James 19:31, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Carl Kenner's point are absolutely untrue: "As well as violating international humanitarian law per se, the implementation of Israel's settlement policy in the Occupied Territories violates fundamental human rights provisions, including the prohibition of discrimination. The seizure and appropriations of land for Israeli settlements, bypass roads and related infrastructure and discriminatory allocation of other vital resources, including water, have had a devastating impact on the fundamental rights of the local Palestinian population, including their rights to an adequate standard of living, housing, health, education, and work, and freedom of movement within the Occupied Territories." <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE150212005" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE150212005" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<p>I've deleted all of the critisism of AI part of this page, not because i feel Amnesty is beyond critisism, but because wikipedia is not a debating society. Look at the wikipedia Human Rights Watch page; half of it is not devoted to critisim, it's a short page that gives relavent facts. Amnesty International is a similar organization to Human Rights Watch and should therefore have a similar page. Sligahan</p>
<dl>
<dd>Before someone simply reverts to the old content, I would like to say I agree with Sligahan's arguments - wikipedia is not a debating society, although it sometimes has a tendency to become so for contentious topics. The amount of criticism here had gone totally out of proportion. Mentioning in a few sentences that certain regimes oppose AI is warranted, and maybe a few sentences should be put back, but all in all I applaude Sligahan's edits.

<p>With the greatest respect to the reverter of the page; look at the Human Rights Watch page, is half of it about critisim of the organization? Enough of your point of view. Also Stephen Hopgood listed under 'Leading Critics' is an anthropologist, would he describe himself as a 'leading critic'? Anthropologists don't think in those terms; Jacques Lizot major critic of the Yanomami? If you feel the critism is that important you should start a seperate Wikipedia page for it. Sligahan</p>

I'm sorry if there are those who don't think AI deserves criticism, while respecting their POV. Since we should strive for a NPOV article I think inclusion of critics of AI's viewpoint is warranted, provided that it isn't just another POV but is rather a presentation of factual information. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaisershatner_51b9.html" title="User:Kaisershatner">Kaisershatner</a> 22:13, 4 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Xed, even if I were a "sock puppet," which I am not, you still ought to make revisions based on NPOV facts, right? Allegations of "propaganda" are highly POV. I'd be happy to discuss our disagreement, but given some of the evidence I've seen about your style on Wikipedia, I'm not convinced this will go anywhere.

<p>Despite the sober and neutral way that the criticisms of AI is delivered I would still consider this section to be highly POV because it contains <b>only</b> negative cricisms of AI without any refutation of the points - a <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism.html" title="Criticism">criticism</a> is not necesarily a negative analysis of something, merely an analysis. I think it would be a gesture of cooperation if the author(s) of this section went through and added equally neutral responses for AI and it's supporters so as to assure the neutral stance of this page. I think the length and breadth of the cricticisms is also somewhat prohibitive - do we note every single criticism made against AI in the popular press? That would make a very long and un-wieldy article. Surely it would be better to provide an example of each criticism (claims of pro-Palistinian bias, anti-American bias, etc) backed up with one or two examples followed by one or two examples of statements in defense. --<a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 17:15, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Axon, as I stated on your User page, I think those are good criticisms and since I was responsible for listing all of those articles, I revised the main article by removing them and inserting a more abstract summary of types of criticism of AI, with fewer examples. I think this may be more effective. As a result I did not respond point-by-point to your criticisms of each example below, many of which raised good points. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaisershatner_51b9.html" title="User:Kaisershatner">Kaisershatner</a> 19:51, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Kaisershatner, you edits are most welcome and go a long way to making this section more neutral and alleviating the edit war this page has been host to. You should be congratulated... erm... so I congratulate you&#160;;)</p>
<p>I would still like to modify this section a bit more. For example, the argument in support of AI is still a little one-sided. I think an argument can be made that human rights abuses are more likely to come to light in a democracy with a free press (although I think that statement itself might be a little contentious depending upon your definition of free press). However, it ignores the fact that western countries might actually be guilty of more human rights abuses.</p>
<p>Also, some links to examples of pro- and anti- argument might also be useful and improve the depth of the article. --<a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 10:38, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd><i>Last focused on a March 26 press release by AI that castigated "coalition forces for "war crimes" on account of the U.S. effort to take Iraq's state-run television station off the air," while including only brief reference to the history of war crimes perpetrated by the Hussein regime</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not sure, but surely a report of American war crimes would naturally be quite brief with regard to the human rights abuses of others? Surely, a better point can be made by demonstrating that AI issues more reports about American war crimes rather than criticising individual reports (which would create a length article). Also, constantly referring to "war crimes" in inverted commas is highly NPOV... better to use the term <i>alleged war crimes</i>.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In another conservative American publication, frontpagemag.com, author Christopher Archangelli presented a timeline of AI press releases during the Iraq war in an effort to establish what he called "one-sided and transparently tilted condemnation of the United States, to the exclusion of the evils of Saddam Hussein."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Again, this seems like repeating itself. Perhaps we should merely establish that AI has been accused of anti-American bias.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In the same publication, author Steven Plaut praised AI's international work on behalf of human rights, and noted among other things AI's opposition to Iranian persecution of Jews [4] (<a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=8141" class="external free" title="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=8141" rel="nofollow">http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=8141</a>). However, Plaut also observed that human rights violations are disproportionately identified and reported on in nations with a free press and with comparatively advanced rights protections, explaining "the AI reticence and almost total absence of denunciation of human rights abuses in places like North Korea and Cambodia. It also explains why AI apparently had no knowledge of the killing fields in southern Iraq until US and British troops uncovered them in the recent war.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Again, this is starting to read like we've copy-and-pasted text directly from a NGO Monitor publications and it seems be using language repeated from previous sections. A simple paragraph detailing allegations of anti-Isreali bias would be sufficient.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Plaut also noted that AI contends that "Palestinians have a “right”, not only to their own state in the West Bank and Gaza but also to migrate to and reclaim any property inside Israel they may wish to claim," without taking similar positions on the "right" of "Jews who were evicted from Moslem countries to reclaim their property."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Again, we seem to be repeating ourselves here. And we see those naughty, naughty inverted commas sneaking in. More detailed research for more sober quotes is perhaps required here. Or, as Plaut might say, more "detailed" "research" for more "sober" "quotes" is "required".&#160;;) Does he talk like that all the time? Must get quite annoying at meal time: <i>Can you "pass" the salt, please, "Mom"? Ahem...</i></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>n 2003, the Anti-Defamation League, an American Jewish organization with no political affiliation</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I think describing the ADL as an organisation with "no political affiliation" (whoops, doing it myself now) is a bit misleading - it's like describing the British Conservative party as having "no political affiliation" with the American Republican party. Let's leave discussion of the existence or non-existence of ADL political affiliations on the ADL page.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The ADL has also complained that AI's reporting led to unsubstantiated accusations of a "massacre" perpetrated by the Israeli armed forces in the Jenin refugee camp.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I think there is a good deal more to this story than what is described above. As I recall, accusations were flying about all over the place.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Plaut article also points out that AI has in the past "regarded the PLO itself as a reliable source about “abuses” committed by Israel. Addressing the media in Jerusalem in November 1989, Amnesty International spokesman Richard Reoch acknowledged that his organization regarded the PLO, which works with the PHRIC, as an objective information source. "Since the PLO is not a government body," he said, "we feel comfortable with Amnesty using them as a source."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm slightly more dubious about the above claim: a quick google for the phrase "Since the PLO is not a government body" only brings up four hits and all of those seem to a right-wing site, pro-Israeli site and this page. I can find no first-hand verification for this quote. I'm extremely dubious about the idea that AI really does regard the PLO as an objective source and this statement needs some more concrete citations otherwise it should be deleted. Even if (a big if) AI does source information from the PLO but that is not the same thing as regarding them as an objective source. Is there evidence that AI doesn't similarly source information from the Isreali government? Again, research is required here to achieve a neutral objective.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Writing in The Boston Globe on April 29, 2002, Charles Radin and Dan Ephron asserted that "Amnesty International’s charges against Israel were contradicted by Palestinian witnesses themselves. The group had falsely said that "Israel failed to provide safe passage from the camp to noncombatants."</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>One cannot help ask what is the relevance of the above. We've already established (again and again) that some individuals consider AI to be biased. What purpose does this serve?</p>
<p>In summary, this section is POV and needs careful, sensitive and well researched notes on this talk page before it can be modified into an NPOV state without kick-starting an(other) edit war. Let's all take a deep breath and remember that Wikiedia is not a soap box and you can't use it to prove one argument or another. Controveries must be clearly detailed, rather than presenting one side as fact with <a href="../../../w/e/a/Wikipedia%7EWeasel_words_3d79.html" title="Wikipedia:Weasel words">Wikipedia: weasel words</a>.

<p>I also think it's slightly dubious making references from NGO Monitor - isn't this site funded by the right-wing purely for the purpose of discrediting left-wing NGOs?

<dd>The accusation is that AI is biased. However, by using a source of information that is itself accussed of bias you are not really helping your own argument. Also, using a single source of information is not really a neutral way of presenting your information (and most of the quotes seem to be filtered through NGO Monitor).

<p>It is clear that NGO Monitor is playing games with its relative counts of Amnesty reports for Israel/OT versus Sudan. If you go to <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/engindex?open=&amp;dropdown=true" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.amnesty.org/library/engindex?open=&amp;dropdown=true" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and select the place you want, you can see a complete list. According to AI's own interpretation of what a report is (click "Reports" in the blue heading), 2001-2004 saw 42 for Israel/OT and 50 for Sudan. (Always assuming Zero can count...) In both cases the number includes any "report" that mentions the specified place, even if it is a single paragraph in a long document, so there is further opportunity for cooking the comparison. Counting all the documents listed there (not just "reports") I get 261 for Israel/OT and 268 for Sudan. From all this I conclude that the claim by NGO Monitor is unsustainable and so we should not quote it. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 15:02, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

So i guess adding <i>(see <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuban-American_National_Foundation_9b62.html" title="Cuban-American National Foundation">CANF</a> article for more)</i> should be what Axon wants? <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 15:45, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You are correct: I certainly didn't see any sources in the above and previous versions of this section. You have only suppplied partial sources for the above: you have not cited evidence of links between CANF and terrorists, that the conference actually took place, etc, or a link to a reputable publication that makes the link that AI supports leaders of a terrorist organisation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In fact, the facts do not even back up the assertion you made above: that is CANF is not a "terrorist organisation" but has links to a terrorist organisation. The correct title would be (if you could provide a reference to back up the link at all) "Support for leaders of a group allegedly linked to terrorist organisations". Not quite so catchy and highly tenuous and POV.</dd>

<p>Axon, your arbitrary removal of factual, referenced information is highly POV. The sources are there for you to look at. i don't see anything in <a href="../../../c/i/t/Cite_sources.html" title="Cite sources">cite sources</a> which says that wikipedia articles are invalid sources, though i'm still looking. However, since you want the sources, i can copy/paste them from the CANF article. i would have thought that that goes against modularity (best to have references closest to what they talk about), but since that's what you seem to want, so be it.</p>
<p>Associating with a terrorist organisation is an important fact. The sources are there in the CANF article and your claim that this is bad wikipedia style is a poor argument for simply removing the text. The sentence is written in NPOV with <i>allegedly</i>.

<dd>(b) CANF is a perfectly legal organisation in the US and elsewhere, and whilst undoubtedly dedicated to the overthrow of Castro, there is no evidence that as an organisation it endorses terrorist methods. There is little evidence even that any members do/did.
<dl>
<dd>The legality of CANF does not change the fact that it's a terrorist organisation. It claims to want to overthrow the Castro regime - and the links with terrorist methods seem rather uncontroversial to the CIA/FBI. Try reading the references, keywords <i>Canosa</i> - who was head of CANF from its founding in 1981 to his death in 1997 - and <i>Posada</i></dd>

<dd>(c) How can it possibly be AI's job to vet every minor action by every one of its members to a tougher standard than the US government?!! Critics seem to demand that AI is whiter than white, and so perfectly balanced, so much pleasing everyone, that no organisation could even hypothetically meet those standards. Then those critics conclude that just because AI doesn't meet some impossible ideal it's all a waste of time. This is the counsel of despair. AI does as much good as could reasonably be expected, which especially for individual prisoners of conscience is a lot; it isn't there to fix the world. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 17:56, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>i certainly <b>agree that AI does a lot of very good stuff</b> and i am <b>not</b> suggesting a counsel of despair. But this isn't about vetting every minor action. It's about associating with a terrorist organisation. Imagine if an Amnesty international researcher was present at a conference with a leader of al-Qaeda. Wouldn't this be rather embarrassing? This incident is an embarrassing fact - which Amnesty can live with and correct just as it continues to live on after the mistake about the test-tube babies in Kuwait.

<p>It's still unjustified for an encyclopedia article. It's just not significant enough. It wasn't even a conference organised by Amnesty, and Montenegro appeared under a different name than the CANF. To demand the AI researcher to pull out of this conference - which included <a href="../../../m/e/p/MEP_3bbc.html" title="MEP">MEPs</a>, Polish senators and others who (in full knowledge of Montenegro's background or not) shared a platform with Montenegro - is totally unreasonable. Sharing a platform with someone does not constitute an endorsement, even if the event in questioned is advertised on the AI website! There is no way that this non-event is significant enough for inclusion in an encyclopedia! I am removing it. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 22:49, 19 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Would sharing a platform for a conference with a leader of <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Qaeda_fab2.html" title="Al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a> be a non-event unjustified for an encyclopedia article? Sharing a platform with a leader of <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Qaeda_fab2.html" title="Al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a> <b>would</b> constitute an endorsement by Amnesty, especially if it were advertised on an Amnesty website.

<dd>No it wouldn't constitute an endorsement. In the UK, we have TV programme called Question Time, on which politicians of all stripes share a platform. They are not endorsing each other, any more than in Northern Ireland the parties endorsed terrorism by signing the <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Friday_agreement_f13c.html" title="Good Friday agreement">Good Friday agreement</a> that brought peace. How on earth is debate supposed to work if you can't share a platform with someone, at a conference organised by someone else (you make far far too much of a little advertising of a conference, which is standard), without being accused of endorsing everything all participants have ever said or done??? <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> 13:28, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It is <b>not</b> original research. The terrorist nature of CANF is documented by many, including the CIA/FBI. The sources are there. The event which happened in Warsaw is documented on the Amnesty International Poland website. <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> does not mean just reflecting the opinions of the mainstream press. It means documenting things which either are uncontroversially accepted are which are clearly documented from third party , reasonably reliable sources.

<dd>The fact that Montenegro appeared under the name of a different organisation is only marginally relevant: Suppose that Amnesty advertised a conference in which <i><a href="../../../o/s/s/Ossama_bin_Laden_4c91.html" title="Ossama bin Laden">Ossama bin Laden</a>, North-West Pakistani Human Rights Association</i> appeared alongside an Amnesty researcher.

</dd>
<dd>To address your points (a) it <i>is</i> original research - <i>IT being the allegation that this non-event has any significance, not that CANF has alleged terrorist links.</i> Original research is not the same as "fiction" - I appreciate that you have made the effort to find original sources (AI website etc). However it is not reported in any media, mainstream or otherwise; there's not even any organisation of any kind, however tiny and pointlessly biased, that has complained. It is <i>clearly</i> original research.
<dl>
<dd>Now you're grasping at straws to avoid a fact that you don't seem to want to accept. The significance of associating with a terrorist organisation is not something that requires research. Common sense says that associating with a terrorist organisation is a surprising fact for a human rights organisation. Incidentally, i see nothing in <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> about the <i>significance</i> of a fact having to be previously documented. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 00:54, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>(b) This non-event has no significance. You don't even know what was said at the conference! For all you know, that AI researcher opened his comments by saying, "Of course, neither AI nor myself could ever endorse terrorist methods which this person has been linked with, by this is not a reason for my walking out of this conference today."
<dl>
<dd>Now you are speculating. It would be easier if we just stick to documented facts from reliable sources rather than speculate. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 00:54, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>(c) Even if we accept the terrorist allegation and full knowledge on the part of the parties (but assume non-endorsement, as we must without further evidence), it is well demonstrated that only be engaging with violently hostile parties can progress be made. Look at the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_peace_process_98cf.html" title="Northern Ireland peace process">Northern Ireland peace process</a>. Even if you don't accept this, CANF's views on why they take whatever actions they take (however reprehensible those methods may or may not be) are still valid views and not automatically to be excluded from polite conversation.
<dl>
<dd>In that case, why do you want to exclude this significant fact? <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 00:54, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>(d) your Bin Laden example is absurd. You might as well say "But if AI demanded that we all hop on one leg whilst reciting the Kama Sutra backwards, that would be newsworthy." This is irrelevant - they haven't, and aren't likely to. It's also a false analogy, as Bin Laden is one of the world's most wanted men.

<dl>
<dd>i don't understand why you claim that the analogy is absurd.

If not then this is original research.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Was AI aware the CANF was "linked" to a terrorist organistion (FBI and CIA evidence exists for this but does this evidence stand up in a court of law? As we have seen by recent events, sometimes military intelligence can be trusted) or that they would be appearing at a conference?

<dd>i agree that the final sentence in the initial version that i wrote was badly written - in the most recent revert i removed it. i agree that it is possible to play the devil's advocate and assume that AI was ignorant of the facts, but speculating on the reasons for what happened is speculation, not reporting of sourced facts.<a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 00:54, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Please address the rest of my points above: has any reputable source made the link you make in this section or have you simply added tghe two facts together to make original research?

</dd>
<dd>As for playing devil's advocate, the whole section seems like speculation to me. The points I raise above are simply the unanswered questions as warnings that can come from original research. As we can see from the above questions a little knowledge is a dangerous thing: that is, one or two carefully selected facts can be used, by themselves, to create a novel interpretation of events. In this case to somehow arrive at the conclusion that AI is somehow associating with terrorists. Of course, your evidence demonstrates no such thesis. Using your logic, one could equally argue that judges are complicit in the crimes they try: after all, the are "associating" with the criminals at the trial which is all very suspicous, but only if you only consider a minority of the facts. <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 09:10, 21 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is no novel interpretation of events here. It is only collecting together of sourced facts, which, given the stated goals of Amnesty International, are significant as a surprising (though possibly isolated) event. The analogy with a judge judging an alleged criminal is a poor analogy: the theme of the conference was not the terrorist events with which Omar Lopez Montenegro is allegedly associated, he was assumed to be one of many promoting human rights, his association with terrorism was not the theme of the conference.<a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBoud_7cef.html" title="User:Boud">Boud</a> 13:08, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've been through this numerous times before with others: you are misinterpreting the original research policy.

<p>It's far from true that AI only pays a small core of directors. There is a 200+ strong staff at the International Secretariat in Clerkenwell, London which pays staff at all levels through directors, campaigners, lawyers and administrators. In addition, many of the sections (national offices) have paid staff. The contribution of volunteers is nevertheless crucial to the work of AI, particularly at the local level. &#160;::are you happy with me ammending this? Hx</p>

<p>There is a long sections of links to articles critical of AI at the end of the article. Surely, for the sake of neutrality, it would be appropriate to add a list of links to some of the innumerable articles that exist praising AI? I find this long list another subtle way of making the article negative towards AI. (<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarend_cf13.html" title="User:Barend">Barend</a> 17:54, 14 January 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>67.189.172.2 12:06, 24 January 2006 (UTC) I think it's also important for folks to understand that the origin of some of these criticisms of AI lie in the nature of AI as an organization dedicated to opposing the human rights abuses of governments, not terrorist organizations. For many years, AI was accused of bias in its coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict because it reported on Israeli abuses and not on Palestinian acts of violence; however, at the time, the PLO was not in any way a governmental organization, and so the many acts of violence perpetrated by the PLO were outside AI's purview. A good artilce (not a Wikipedia article, but a journal article) is to be found in discussing the implications and consequences of this (in effect, AI often finds itself being used as a source of propaganda by terrorist groups it in no way supports, and then is blamed by association; on the other hand, it also means that AI sometimes has a blind spot for more transactional kinds of violence, in which governmental abuses are responsive to conditions created by a violent opposition group).</p>
<p>The fact that the current US administration, many of whose personnel used AI reports for years as sources for their critiques of US opponents, is now engaging in a group of policies that directly confront AI's mission has led to a great deal of partisan criticism of the organization. The fact is that concealed rendition has always been a target of AI, long before the current US administration decided to engage in the practice; the use of cruel and abusive interrogation techniques was always a target of AI, long before Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo; and the use of warrantless searches and surveillance against government opponents was always a target of AI (leading me to suspect that we may see some words on this subject in next year's AI report). Because the approach of the current US administration comprises a direct challenge to AI's mission, not only on an operational but on an ideological level, and because policies taken by the US are often reflected in the behavior of other countries ("if the US does it and isn't criticized, who has the right to criticize us?"), AI's critiques of current trends in the US are important to its mission, regardless of the overall human rights picture in the US as compared to other states. It rightly holds the US to a higher standard.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Barend. I commend the inclusion of critical material; but feel we need to redress the balance by including more details of AI's many successes, recognition as one of the most frequently referenced authorities on contemporary human rights abuses, and its "grass-roots" popular support across a vast range of groups and countries. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETranzid_729f.html" title="User:Tranzid">Tranzid</a> 16:32, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

I haven't reverted it because I suspect it might be better to start from scratch with the criticism; there is/was far too much detail on isolated cases (and where people have vested interests anyway). There needs to be more on the successes, and the criticism needs to be boiled down to a summary of the substance of it. Some of what was Criticism could be redone as History or something, which would entail a change of approach that would probably look less like an attempt by the article to take sides. <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 00:25, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>However, the right to freedom of expression is not absolute -- neither for the creators of material nor their critics.

<p>This piece is deeply unfair, focussing on one statement where (in fact) Amnesty's position is echoed by many other organisations (including journalists' unions), and excluding the serious work AI has done to campaign against state repression of journalists and in favour of greater press freedom.

<dd>Did this section ever criticise AI for trying to protect journalist? However, it is a matter of fact that AI has never criticised jailing of likes of David Irving which are pretty much universally condemed in U.S. and other coutries where restriction on hate speech is seen as a covert attack on the freedome of expression. So AI's position is popular in Europe and Middle East. Does it make AI's position right by default? I don't think so. The previous version merely spelt out what AI's position is in term of hate speech without making judgement as to whether it is wrong or right. Now you are inserting your defence of AI's position, which looks like an original research. It is not sourced to AI's documentation and it appear to be your personal interpretation of an international treaty. I inserted counter argument to make it NPOV, however, I do believe both advocacy and critics of AI's position should be deleted. <a href="../../../v/a/p/User%7EVapour_251e.html" title="User:Vapour">Vapour</a></dd>

<p>I intend to remove it on the basis that its motive is suspect, and therefore the author should be expected to cite a source. I am not an expert on this topic, but it seems unlikely to me that AI would have made the claim if they had been offered a <i>legitimate</i> visit rather than a "guided" tour. I call on the author of this sentence to either support the statement or hold his peace. In the meantime, I would probably consider amending it, but since I don't have enough knowledge about what exact reports or events the author may be referring to, I think it really needs to just come out for the moment.

<dd>I agree, although the section would have to reflect the fact that considerable controversy exists within the organisation over the issue, and will be ongoing at least until the next international meeting where sections get together in 2007.

<p>In the section dealing with criticisms of AI over reporting errors, the article currently states:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Reporting errors: Gulf War incubator babies</i></dd>
<dd><i>In the run up to the Gulf War, in a report on human rights violations in occupied Kuwait, Amnesty International stated that "over 300 premature babies were reported to have died after Iraqi soldiers removed them from incubators, which were then looted". The report lent credibility to the story which was reported widely in the media. In the US Senate, several senators specifically cited the allegation in their speeches supporting the resolution to give President George Bush authorization to use American forces in Kuwait. However, the information was unverified and later some of it proved to be false. Amnesty International retracted its report, saying it had become clear that the allegations were baseless, drawing widespread criticism as it did so.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This only tells half the story. Yes, the allegations were in fact fabricated -- but they were fabricated by a PR firm hired by the Bush Administration, which then used Amnesty's report to help justify war against Iraq. (This sounds like a wild conspiracy theory as I read over that sentence, but the whole affair is in fact well documented.) Doesn't anyone else here think that this information is crucial?</p>
<p>Furthermore, this is the only instance of reporting errors cited in the article.

<p>I tend to agree with the above poster (Sligahan) that, whether AI deserves or does not deserve criticism, Wikipedia is not "a debating society" and therefore a focus on "criticisms" doesn't seem appropriate to this article. Nevertheless, I would like to propose a compromise that might resolve the conflict between the two camps here. Rather than listing criticisms and countercriticisms, I would suggest developing a topographical <b>overview of the tensions</b> that have surfaced within the human rights movement generally and Amnesty International specifically. Such an overview may have a place in this article given that Amnesty International has been an instrumental driving force behind the entire human rights movement.</p>
<p>For example, rather than criticising Amnesty for its stance on free-speech/hate-speech and starting up a whole debate on where the line should be drawn, the focus should be shifted to the <b>tensions</b> the movement necessarily has had to face over what to do ABOUT the issue of hate speech. What have previous human rights leaders and/or political thinkers said about the matter? How have those views impacted Amnesty? In short, I think this section should deal more with WHERE Amnesty's positions have come from and, perhaps to a lesser extent, the differing views that got the organization to where it is today.</p>
<p>I believe this compromise has the potential to settle this debate once and for all: it allows a place for those who believe that "criticisms" of AI should be reported here, but it also allows that debate to be brought to the surface in an academic and impartial manner. That is, it allows valid points to be voiced without degenerating into street-talk politics.</p>

<dd>It's worth pointing out how I have seen "Criticisms" section develop in other articles, in a way which preserves NPOV. The crucial thing is that the section is not a place to develop your own ideas of criticisms, and NOT a place to develop rebuttals. It doesn't matter whether the article is about an organsation that is "good" or "bad" and whether the criticisms are "true" or "false". It is a place to report the fact of specific and <b>well sourced</b> criticisms that have happened. The <i>fact</i> is the existence of the criticism. If there are well sourced rebuttals (e.g. specific press comments or reports from those criticised), they <i>might</i> belong there, but this should not develop into a game of one-upmanship of sources, and never editorial rebuttal of sources. Changing a section that reports criticisms into one that reports internal tensions is not at all the same thing (though both are good, if they can be sourced). <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 07:47, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Not sure I see how creating an entire article <i>criticizing</i> the NGOs can be called a "whitewash". In any case, this article originally had nearly a third of its contents devoted to the controversy over AI's Israel/Guantanamo coverage. This gives readers the impression that AI is an organization devoted to criticizing Israel and the US, when in fact it covers dozens of countries. Furthermore, I didn't "remove" the material from the main page, I left a summary of the criticisms (which you were welcome to expand) and a link to the complete text. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyronen_7385.html" title="User:Tyronen">Tyronen</a> 13:55, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

That's about 110 articles per year for the Sudan and less than 100 for Israel <i>and</i> the Palestinian Authority combined, which doesn't show the bias NGO Monitor writes of. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyronen_7385.html" title="User:Tyronen">Tyronen</a> 21:35, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The argument is spurious anyway. The selectivity of AI's work is explained, it's not a "bias". The piece implies that AI is biased against Israel, a key argument of pro-Israeli groups, rather than the reality that Israel is in breach of international law on many points, Israel is a relatively open, accessible, democratic country where campaign work can have effect and where research is relatively easy to carry out. If anyone can come up with an allegation of "selection bias" that appears to favour two similar countries, then there might be a point. Israel and Sudan are not comparable in terms of the ability of AI to do work (Sudan regularly denies visas, for example), thus are not evidence of bias. The Darfur crisis made it easier to research and work on because so many refugees ended up in Chad, where they were easier to contact. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 13:46, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Am I wrong, but the info box used in the article seems to be inappropriate and further is full of wrong information. For example although AI is a NGO, in terms of business the organization resembles a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Company_limited_by_guarantee.html" title="Company limited by guarantee">company limited by guarantee</a>. Also AI has not 1.8 million employees, human rights are by no means an industry and certainly AI has no revenue and lobbying, conducting research and providing consultancy can't be regarded as products. Therefore I removed it. Attraho 20:13, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The piece just added, which I've removed, was ridiculously inaccurate. The campaign relates to the arms <i>trade</i> and absolutely NOT to individual ownership.

<dd>First, please try to speak civilly and not assume that I'm a 'redneck' that bases info on NRA articles. Second, that was a sourced statement from the Amnesty International website. Third, it's clear that when the arms trade is controlled, it is controlled for everybody, and they are asking <b>governments to <i>regulate the transfers of weapons</i></b>. It doesn't take a genius to see who's going to be disarmed..it won't be the governments or their militaries.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Fourth, the <a href="../../../s/m/a/Small_arms_proliferation.html" title="Small arms proliferation">article</a> you just referred me to says this in it's first sentence: <b>Small arms proliferation</b> is a term of art used by organizations advocating the restriction of small arms sales to private citizens in conflict zones. These organizations argue that restricting the number of small arms in a conflict zone will reduce the number of deaths. So you just showed yourself wrong and me right. Fifth, <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">you</a> by your own admission, are a member of this organization and should not be editing it.

<dd>In any case, the gun control issue does not belong in the intro as it is not a core part of Amnesty's identity. It should be in the "Criticism and response" section. Secondly, the phrase "thereby disarming the populace from the very oppression they claim to defend them against" is not found in the Amnesty site. It is an <i>inference</i> which is unsourced.

<dd>This section needs to NPOVed immediately. Only in some parts of the world is gun control regarded as oppression - it's a POV. That aside, the campaign does not seek to regulate the legal ownership of guns, but, rather, the unregulated trade in arms. There's a huge difference. Even the gun lobby argues that there is a problem with illegal weapons - the campaign seeks to tighten the rules around the international trade to prevent the major importation of arms for unlawful use, particularly in conflict zones, where civilians rarely have anything like the access to guns militias and government has. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 17:10, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>AI is very much interested in gun control. Here's one of their goals: "<i>Community level: Civil society and local government agencies to take effective action to improve safety at community level, by reducing the local availability and demand for arms.</i>" <a href="http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGPOL300182003" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGPOL300182003" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></dd>
<dd>There's nothing there about allowing regulated gun ownership. It's also worth noting that their partners in that campaign, Oxfam and IANSA, are advocates for gun control. AI has changed.</dd>

<dd>Yes, you see the campaign to get a UN treaty to regulate the Arms <i>trade</i> inaccurately as a campaign to control ownership of guns, which it isn't. The piece is in the Criticisms section, but is <i>itself</i> a criticism rather than a statement of the fact that AI is part of the Control Arms campaign and a verifiable citation of criticism from the NRA (who have criticised it) or any even-handed attempt to seek out any refutation from AI.

<p>With all due respect to the very intelligent debaters here: The question is <i>not</i> whether we wikipedians believe that AI's campaign to regulate the arms trade is a threat to the individual right to bear arms. The question is whether some <i>significant figure or group has claimed</i> that AI's campaign to regulate the arms trade is a threat to the individual right to bear arms. If there is no such significant critic, then the criticism of AI (for hypocrisy, for supporting some individual rights and not others) is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>, and the gun control section should be removed. If there is a significant critic, then the gun control section needs to be backed up with a reference to a quote or press release from that critic. (In the interest of full disclosure, I am 152.3.246.169, who reinstated the material on gun control by Whiskey Rebellion as NPOV'ed by Tyronen, as I was unaware that this discussion was going on.

The six Arabs then raped my daughter in front of me, my wife and my other children.”" [<a href="http://www.nraila.org//issues/articles/read.aspx?id=201" class="external text" title="http://www.nraila.org//issues/articles/read.aspx?id=201" rel="nofollow">NRA article</a>].

<dd>You linked to an article that had NO criticism of AI in it. You claim the Control Arms Campaign, which has clear aims, is about something it isn't. You are currently being condemned on the Anarchism talk page as a glove puppet of a banned user and have shown an inability to adhere to the rules of this site. You now, finally, admit you wrote a POV piece, yet you continue to claim that personal knowledge of an organisation and its campaigns makes me inappropriate for fixing misrepresentations and POV. You clearly have no understanding of how this site works or the principles of NPOV, which I do. I have no problem with there being an accurate representation of criticism of AI - I have challenged you, over and over again, to find appropriate DIRECT criticism of AI or the Control Arms Campaign, which you have failed to do - instead you attack me. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 22:04, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Donnacha has been completely honest about his position, Whisky hasn't, and so far hasn't actually found evidence to back up his edits (i.e. opinion first, find facts/evidence to support it later, if possible) It's Whisky's kind of POV pushing that that drives away legitimate editors who care about getting accurate and truthful articles... <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostlyharmless_cd83.html" title="User:Mostlyharmless">Tell me to get back to work!</a> 22:11, 3 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have been completely honest about my edits. When I said there was <i>some</i> POV in my original edit I was being honest and I was referring to one statement that I wrote "<i>Thereby disarming,etc.</i>" I just wrote a factual, non-biased edit that comes straight from the horse's mouth, the Amnesty website and Donnachade reverts it with no explanation whatsoever. And btw, Donnachade, that was <b>4</b> reverts in one day. What POV can I be pushing that only states the facts and nothing else. The reader can draw his or her own conclusions. You, on the other hand, keep trying to remove this fact as if it were an embarassment or worse to you and to Amnesty.

<dd>Your POV is clear to anyone who reads your edits and what you write - you are a pro-gun person (also an oxymoron, sorry, anarcho-capitalist as is clear elsewhere). My POV is clear to everyone else as well - I want clear factual NPOV information in the acticle, in a balanced manner, that represents things fairly. Below this is a call for someone to write up a critic of AI's position more clearly. I've sought a cite for the NRA criticism. You maintained a factual error in the History part - AI doesn't lead the campaign. You're also trying to highlight the campaign more than any other, due to your POV. Everyone can see it and it's clear that, just as in the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">Anarchism</a> article, you have no interest in facts, just pushing your own POV. It's also very clear that there is no way you're someone who just signed up a month ago. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 23:17, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have now rearranged the wording of the first sentence in my edit. If you still find something wrong with this edit then your hidden agenda is showing and it's showing even worse than ever. Stop attacking me and address the edit. It is factual. It is neutral. It is straight from the Amnesty International website. And it is sourced. You have to have a better reason than "<i>You have to be kidding.</i>" which was the edit summary in your last revert. <b>Stop trying to keep fact out of this article.</b> And also, like Humus sapiens said, "<i>I didn't realize this article has an owner</i>" Only, you <b>do not own this article</b>, Donnachadelong. <span style="padding: 0px; background: white; border: 1px solid; border-color: #0A2060"><a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiskey_Rebellion_1c39.html" title="User:Whiskey Rebellion"><font color="#720000">Whis</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiskey_Rebellion_1c39.html" title="User:Whiskey Rebellion"><font color="#00036A">key</font></a> <a href="../../../w/h/i/User_talk%7EWhiskey_Rebellion_bfdc.html" title="User talk:Whiskey Rebellion"><font color="#720000">Rebel</font></a><a href="../../../w/h/i/User_talk%7EWhiskey_Rebellion_bfdc.html" title="User talk:Whiskey Rebellion"><font color="#00036A">lion</font></a></span> 04:03, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You reverted me MOVING the Dershowitz link to the correct part, thus having it there twice. It shouldn't be in the External Links section. You insist on adding excessive information about the Control Arms Campaign because of your POV. I've reverted again and, if you don't stop, I'm going to report you for your POV. This article should have clear, factual and <b>BALANCED</b> information.

<dd>Yes, it should be alongside the other articles in the Bibliography, not in the permanent external links piece. I'm a bit dubious about most of those pieces in the Bibliography - some people are being lazy - as they represent a load of criticism that should be written up properly rather than just stuck in as links at the bottom. The Paul de Rooij stuff, in particular, should be one paragraph (it's a counter-point to the pro-Israeli stuff). <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 14:03, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I could answer that, if the article was used to help put the page together (leading to one of the other sources, providing insight into how something should be worded, etc., or serves as a source for information in the article), then it's appropriate for the Bibliography section. If it merely further illustrates something in the article, then it belongs in External Links. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 14:43, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, it's neither (which is also the case with the Paul de Rooij links), it's a link to the latest Dershowitz rant about AI and the war between Israel and Hizbollah in Lebanon. It seems to be the case that links to criticism not covered in the article are just lumped together here. As I said above, it would be far better if someone took the time to actually write up these criticism properly if they're important enough to be part of the article. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonnachadelong_ddd0.html" title="User:Donnachadelong">Donnacha</a> 14:55, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Came over from AN/I. I'd rather keep this off the admin radar, so let's try a few things. First of all, as I pointed out on AN/I, this is a free encyclopedia. It is not a battleground; it is not a place where screaming matches and namecalling should happen. So... chill. Drop the namecalling, forget that the namecalling ever happened. Drop the grudges. I guarantee that your life will be a lot better. Second, why is the arms control bit in Criticisms? Looking through the history, I'm not seeing anything in particular that suggests that anything related to arms control is something that notable commentators have focused on. Unless it's a notable criticism, it doesn't belong in the "Criticism" section. The fact that something <i>can</i> be criticized does not mean that it belongs with criticisms of the org. Bear in mind that I'm not suggesting that a mention of the arms control situation shouldn't be in the article... just that it's inappropriately located and contextualized. There's already a mention near the start of the article. Finally, with regard to "conflict of interest, editors with a personal stake in an article are not prohibited from editing; however, they should be careful to remember that all edits must be sourced, that they must conform to a neutral point of view, and that it is always important to be civil with those with a different point of view on the subject. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 11:26, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think we should have a frank and honest discussion over the introduction to this article. The current introduction is as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Amnesty International (commonly known as Amnesty or AI) is described as a non-governmental organization, and as a worldwide movement of people, which campaigns for internationally recognized human rights. It compares actual practices of human rights, in countries, with internationally accepted standards and demands compliance where these have not been respected. To these ends it undertakes research and campaigning to mobilize public opinion in the belief that it is this which has the power to exert pressure on governments.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Amnesty International states that it is independent of economic, political and religious interests. It does not support or oppose any particular government or group, nor does it support or oppose the views of the victims whose rights it seeks to uphold. It is concerned solely with the impartial protection of human rights.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Amnesty International is unpopular with some and is often criticized, but its principles and efforts are well respected by many. It is a Nobel peace prize laureate and its information is sought both by news agencies and governments alike.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Its official symbol, a candle surrounded by barbed wire, was inspired by the Chinese proverb: "It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness".</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I see a number of problems with this, which include both content and style.</p>
<p><b>Content</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Amnesty isn't "described" as a non-governmental organization. It is one.</li>
<li>While it's true that Amnesty campaigns for internationally-recognized human rights, the organization tends to focus on certain rights, such as freedom of expression, assembly, right to fair trial, etc. All of this was included in the introduction before, and I don't know why it was removed.</li>
<li>"Unpopular with some and often criticised"? This certainly creates the wrong impression: Amnesty is probably the most highly respected human rights organization in the world, and while this does not place it beyond criticism, the vast majority of those criticisms have been levelled at it by governments for purely political -- and not factual -- reasons. Its portrayal in any mainstream newspaper is significantly different from how it is portrayed, for example, in a government press release responding to Amnesty's human rights concerns.</li>
<li>Related to my previous point, the introduction says nothing about how the organization is received by the public <i>as a whole</i>. The organization has a well-developed reputation and this is not reflected in the article's introduction at all, I suspect because of the ongoing debate over criticisms of AI. (Which, for some reason, is highly polarized here.)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Style</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The language and sentence structure is choppy and inconsistent throughout. The first two sentences need particular attention in this regard.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the introduction from about four months ago:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Amnesty International (commonly known as Amnesty or AI) is an international non-governmental organization with the stated purpose of promoting all the human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international standards. In particular, Amnesty International campaigns to free all prisoners of conscience; to ensure fair and prompt trials for political prisoners; to abolish the death penalty, torture, and other treatment of prisoners held by international law to be cruel or inhumane; to end political killings and forced disappearances; and to oppose all human rights abuses, whether committed by governments or by other groups.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Amnesty International has a long history of pursuing neutrality within the context of its campaigning for the protection of human rights. The organization officially describes itself as "independent of any government, political ideology, economic interest or religion. It does not support or oppose any government or political system, nor does it support or oppose the views of the victims whose rights it seeks to protect. It is concerned solely with the impartial protection of human rights."[1] As a result, Amnesty International is among the most widely respected human rights organizations in the world.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>It was awared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This one isn't perfect either, but it makes some of the most important points, makes them succinctly, and does it in fewer paragraphs than the present one. This intro also has the advantage of pointing out AI's particular focuses (on torture, political killings, and disappearances, etc.) without neglecting the broader international human rights standards. Furthermore, it quotes Amnesty's madate directly, which I believe to be important because those three simple sentences sum up perfectly what Amnesty International is as an organization. This also allows the organization itself to be presented before its criticisms.</p>
<p>Like I said, neither of these intros is perfect, but, obviously, I prefer the latter (for the reasons already explained). With perhaps a few changes to reflect the recent developments of this article, and of course input from everyone else in this discussion, I would like to replace the current intro with the older one. --<a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodeswalzer_c454.html" title="User:Todeswalzer">Todeswalzer</a> | <a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodeswalzer_03da.html" title="User talk:Todeswalzer">Talk</a> 18:57, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Amnesty International has been criticised by a very large number of governments, who feel that the criticisms made are unwarranted, overly harsh, are particularly one sided, or ignore mitigating factors. While these may or may not be true, if we include the response of every government affected, and counter responses by Amnesty and its defenders, the article will be very very very long. Lets keep it reasonable, and decide which criticisms are strictly necessary, and which aren't. 130.195.86.37 22:21, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hkelkar, thank-you for making your political bias painfully clear to the editors on this page.

<dd>The A stood for amnesty. The other A stood for a word that I shall refrain from expanding out of politeness. Yes I happen to agree with Nobel Laureate David Trimble when he said 'One of the great curses of this world is the human rights industry. They justify terrorist acts and end up being complicit in the murder of innocent victims.' However, my edits are well-sourced and I have established it's relevance so you can't delete them. Why is it that the libertarian fanatics on wikipedia always respond to issues with argumentum <a href="../../../a/d/-/Ad-hominem.html" title="Ad-hominem">ad-hominem</a> I wonder.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 17:39, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Read the ref.These are said by the Government spokesperson.Oh,and before the usual leftist torrent of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indophobia.html" title="Indophobia">Indophobia</a> begins,let me assert that India is NOT some banana republic whose democratically elected government can be dismissed blithely. It, at least, bears mentioning.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 21:33, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Which ref, please? There are a lot on this page.</dd>
<dd>I'm a leftist, to be sure, but have no idea why you bring up "Indophobia" in response to my question. I'm not Indophobic, nor have I given you any indication to think I am. I've seen no Indophobia in this discussion, although perhaps I've missed something.</dd>
<dd>I'm well aware that India's government is democratically elected, and that it's not some "banana republic." However, just as with the abortion that passes for an <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_Administration_21a1.html" title="George W. Bush Administration">administration</a> in my own country, it's not immune to criticsm and reproach if it misbehaves.</dd>
<dd>I'm curious about an earlier remark of yours, where you said AI "screws around with democracies." That's a pretty good trick, considering AI has no armies, no vote in the UN, and no ability to apply economic sanctions. How does AI "screw around with democracies?" Remember, democracies and the leaders thereof, do sometimes do things which are reproachable.</dd>
<dd>More to the point, if we're going to have a large-scale presentation of criticisms of AI, perhaps that should be moved to a separate page with a link from this one. I'm not going to undertake that (especially at my current level of Wikiskills), but <a href="../../../b/b/_/Wikipedia%7EBb_7fb4.html" title="Wikipedia:Bb">don't let that stop you.</a></dd>

First of all, I made no ad-hominem attacks upon you. I've merely stated the <a href="../../../f/a/c/Fact.html" title="Fact">facts</a>: your obvious political bias as well as your deprecation of Amnesty as an organization. As such, I think my concerns about your editorial impartiality are justified; those concerns are fundamentally different from baseless personal attacks. Moreover, your assumptions about my own political leanings are quite misguided, not to mention highly irrelevant.</p>
<p>Perhaps more to the point, <b>Amnesty International has never justified the use of violence for any ends whatsoever</b>. If you had bothered to check your facts you would have realized that Amnesty has a record of consistently condemning the use of terrorist tactics, particularly with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. More than that I don't think I need to say; you've already discredited yourself in this forum. --<a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodeswalzer_c454.html" title="User:Todeswalzer">Todeswalzer</a> | <a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodeswalzer_03da.html" title="User talk:Todeswalzer">Talk</a> 20:41, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Firstly, the references in the section you added do not support the claims you've made. The Govt of India spokesperson imputes motives to AI that it really doesn't have. There is no secret Kashmir agenda. Amnesty takes no money from governments, and never has. And to repeat the above, Amnesty does not 'scoff at' or 'condone' the violence of any group, and explicitly condemns such actions. The paragraph needs a rewrite; I think it should be pulled out and put here until NPOV problems can be sorted out. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostlyharmless_cd83.html" title="User:Mostlyharmless">Mostlyharmless</a> 01:42, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>In a similar vein, the Government of India, the world's largest democracy, has also accused Amnesty International of biased coverage regarding communal problems and Terrorism in India. The bias is alleged to be along the same lines as the "selection bias" above, with disproportionate focus on communal riots against the Muslim minority in the country, and minimizing (and often justifying) actions by Islamic Fundamentalists, such as Terrorism in Kashmir and atrocities committed against Hindus, including the ethnic cleansing of the Kashmiri Pandits by the Islamist militants, the Wandhama Massacre and others. In a strongly-worded rebuke, Navdeep Suri, a spokesperson for the Indian High Commission alleges that Amnesty's hollow condemnatory statements on recent massacres of Kashmiri Pandits "further eroded its credibility- by trying to establish some bizarre form of moral equivalence between the actions of terrorists, the plight of victims and the responsibilities of government authorities".He also said that Amnesty international was confirming "a pattern of reporting that can only be interpreted as a deliberate attempt to project events in a manner that suits Amnesty’s own version of reality</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first sentence is fine. The fact that it is a selection bias is based on India being a democracy (see AI's ridiculous exxagerations and perorations about India)</p>
<p>The toi article states the allegation as a:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mystifying reluctance to condemn (terrorism) in black and white" and a curious attempt to obfuscate the real issues involved in Sunday’s tragic murder of 24 civilians in Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is, of course, just one in a long line of massacres of Hindus in Kashmir, the most famous ones being the <a href="../../../w/a/n/Wandhama_massacre.html" title="Wandhama massacre">Wandhama massacre</a> and the <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kaluchak_Massacre_a09e.html" title="Kaluchak Massacre">Kaluchak Massacre</a>, which I cited as examples, but one can be more specific if you want and remove the two specific massacres that I had put there. AI, of course, responds with it;s usual dismissive attitude and tried to placate the spokesperson with hollow platitudes, and you can put that in the paragraph below as a "rebuttal" or whatever and that's fine I guess.</p>
<p>The "Disproportionate focus on communal riots etc" is self evident from theiir farce of a website, but is not quite what the govt said so can be reworded to be more specific to the incident at hand. I will, of course, find more criticisms about their atrocious attitudes that are more general in nature, although the main culprits in the arena is the terrorist front <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Rights_Watch_35a7.html" title="Human Rights Watch">Human Rights Watch</a>, but I will get on that article later.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 01:53, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As is Human Rights Watch. India's continued to restriction of access, makes verfication of such claims impossible. Sometimes they get it wrong, but blaming them for not releasing reports on things they're not allowed to investigate is just ridiculous.

<dd>Er, countercurrents is an extreme left wing site which publishes propaganda for many terrorist cells and organizations. They have routinely published op/eds glorifying terrorist groups like Hamas, Fatah, Hezbollah and even Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda. they have made various anti-Israel and anti-semitic charges and have recently spilled over to anti-Hindu dialectic.</dd>
</dl>

</dl>
<p>They are reliable only when they archive from other sources. a native countercurrents source does not satisfy <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and their claims are usually either outright falsehoods or illegitimate exaggerations. Besides, Kashmir is a war zone and so some restrictions are natural.

<p><b>Enough nonsense.</b><br />
Hkelkar, there is a problem with your reasoning here. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostlyharmless_cd83.html" title="User:Mostlyharmless">Mostlyharmless</a> has made an excellent point about Amnesty's denial of access in India as THE primary reason for the number of reports the organization has issued about human rights abuses in the area, yet you refuse to accept this. Furthermore, you accuse the source provided to you by Mostlyharmless as being "an extreme left wing site which publishes propaganda for many terrorist cells and organizations". You should be advised that, first, this doesn't address the issues in the specific article cited at all and, second, there are more sources for this information than the one provided to you, if you would care to do your own research. Whenever any facts are brought to light which challenge your misguided and ill-informed view of Amnesty International as an organization you accuse the source of those facts as having an agenda that includes supporting "terrorist organizations" that are hellbent on undermining the government of India. This reasoning, of course, seems not to apply to your own sources.</p>
<p>So let me be perfectly blunt here. <b>Your approach to this discussion and this article thus far has been intellectually dishonest</b> and counterproductive to the ends being sought by the people on this page and Wikipedia as a whole. I don't know why or how you formed the opinion that the human rights movement is led by terrorists, or why you feel the need to push your own political agenda on this page. And I don't really care either -- because this isn't the place to debate such things. The point of this article and discussion is to present the facts about Amnesty International in the most neutral fashion possible. It is not a soapbox for personal views.</p>
<p>Let me also be clear about something else. Amnesty International is not an organizaiton that is beyond criticism. Many other users have raised a number of important criticisms that belong in this article because they have been made by other individuals or organizations that are well-reputed and whose facts are well-sourced. My objections to your comments are not about stifling debate; what I object to is your unwillingness to honestly discuss the material. So enough nonsense. If you want to engage in a serious discussion about the factual content of this page, I and everyone else would welcome the opportunity. If you want to continue about terrorists and left-wing fanatics, post it on your own webspace. --<a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodeswalzer_c454.html" title="User:Todeswalzer">Todeswalzer</a> | <a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodeswalzer_03da.html" title="User talk:Todeswalzer">Talk</a> 17:03, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
<b>Indeed, enough nonsense</b>:</p>
<p>Countercurrents's native op/eds are unreliable per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. If you can find other sources that attest to claims made by AI to the effect that the Indian govt denies them access AND that this is causally connected to their being unable to report on the Kashmiri Pandit situation then, by all means, cite them.Until you do, such a claim is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>.Plus, the Government of India is fairly "well-reputed" and the facts are well-sourced.Find other sources that attest to your claims, and we'll be fine.In the meantime, I have found papers that criticize HRW, of course (they're a lot worse than AI) and have found 2 refs that criticize AI. What are your objections to the refs anyway? You stil haven;t detailed them.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 17:08, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Without getting involved on the issue of whether criticism from the Indian government belongs in the article (I don't have any strong feelings either way on that), I just want to note that not all the claims and arguments made in the paragraph are found in your sources. Mr. Suri's criticisms, as given in the article, only deal with AI's reporting of the massacre in Nadimarg village, that this confirms AI's bias, and that India has criticized AI in the past for using "twisted facts" or coming to "flawed conclusions." The article also notes that the Indian government and Amnesty have clashed before on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir and on Gujarat. But while the latter were obviously communal riots, the article—and Mr. Suri—don't actually specifically say that the Indian government has criticized AI for "disproportionate focus on communal riots against the Muslim minority" or "minimizing (and often justifying) actions by Islamic Fundamentalists." (Both quotes from the disputed paragraph.) The article doesn't even mention the Wandhama massacre. At the very least—irrespective of the question as to whether criticism by specific governments belongs in the article—you'll either have to source those statements or remove them.</dd>

Surely you're not going to call The Hindu newspaper a Muslim front organisation? Amnesty International only releases reports on things it has confirmed through information from multiple reliable neutral sources. That's their modus operandi, and that should probably go in the article. They do condemn gross human rights abuses without laying blame, in situations like the above where they are not able to undertake this kind of research, and call for a thorough investigation by the authorities. The examples you mentioned either had that happen, or no comment was made. As for your assertions about afinity to Islam, terrorism, Indophobia etc., stop it. You're just poisoning the well... 222.155.141.176 23:10, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As usual, we have the libertarian propaganda tactic of conflating independent issues. The "The Hindu" article deals with Gujarat, NOT Kashmir. the visa was not denied for Kashmir but for Gujarat. the two are completely independent issues.</dd>
<dd>As for amnesty's own website, well, that's just about as reliable as an al-Qaeda chatroom unless, of course, used as a primary source. One may use the AI website refs to cite counterclaims of AI, whether they are genocide, paedophilia, defeestration, necrophilia, or whatever hoopla they're touting nowadays.<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 23:36, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>This is not the first time that the Union Government has prevented the international human rights organisation from coming to the country to study rights violations. Amnesty teams apply for research visas; these applications are processed not by the visa section in London but by the Home Ministry. The Ministry appears to have a growing list of States and subjects that it considers too "sensitive" for study by a human rights organisation like Amnesty. In the past, Amnesty has been refused visas because it wanted to study the human rights situation in Jammu and Kashmir and the north-eastern States.</i> 222.155.141.176 23:45, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Despite all the disagreements on this page (and there are plenty of them), I think there are at least two points on which all of us can agree.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Everyone involved wants to produce the best possible article on this subject; and</b></li>
<li><b>The present form of the contents on this page is disputed.</b></li>
</ol>
<p>As such, I have placed a tag at the top of the page reflecting its disputed nature.</p>
<p>However, I want to remove it as soon as possible. So. Let's try to refocus on what needs to be done here. In particular, I think we need to develop some consensus on the precise nature of the criticisms section and what should be included and what should not be included. By this, I mean that we need some general rules on what to include and what to exclude; because, let's face it, we can't include everything, nor should that be our aim.</p>
<p>So for the moment, <b>let's please leave the particular criticisms aside for the moment, and let's try to develop some clear, concise rules on the general form that the criticisms in this article should take.</b> I honestly believe that we won't get any further here until we have done this.</p>
<p>To illustrate what I mean, let me propose the first such rule: <b>1) Criticisms included in this article must only come from mainstream sources.</b> What I mean by this is that criticisms of AI voiced by, say, the Nazi Party or some random person on geocities, should not be included. Now, that isn't to say that the criticisms there won't be valid criticisms, just that their presence somewhere obscure doesn't necessarily warrant it being reported in an encyclopeadia. I might go as far to say that if it hasn't been reported in a major newspaper, or if it hasn't appeared in a well-known periodical (the academic equivalent), we shouldn't be concerned with including it here.</p>
<p>I hope this can help facilitate a more civil and productive discussion. --<a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodeswalzer_c454.html" title="User:Todeswalzer">Todeswalzer</a> | <a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodeswalzer_03da.html" title="User talk:Todeswalzer">Talk</a> 22:52, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems that further clarification of my position is necessary with regard to my post at the beginning of this section. My intention isn't to discredit other sources as "unreliable" or "not noteworthy", but rather to limit the criticisms section to what is <b>most important</b>. Sources outside of my proposed rule may well be reliable and perhaps even "noteworthy" (in a broad sense), but my point here is that if it isn't a topic of discussion in the mainstream media or in academic journals, then I don't think it's important enough to mention in an encyclopeadia article.</p>
<p><b>There are a lot of facts and opinions that can well be supported by proper, reliable sources -- but should we be including <i>all</i> of them?</b> Wikipedia doesn't think so: just the important ones. That's the nature of an encyclopaedia. Hence my proposal that we use mainstream media and academic journals as the standard for deciding what is important enough to include and what isn't.</p>
<p>So, can we please discuss the merits of this proposal -- before trying to apply it? --<font face="Papyrus"><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodeswalzer_c454.html" title="User:Todeswalzer">Todeswalzer</a><big>|</big><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodeswalzer_03da.html" title="User talk:Todeswalzer">Talk</a></font> 20:06, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would argue that saying Amnesty is critcised by some and respected by many is a POV.

<p><b>A Second Proposal</b><br />
If we're all in agreement with my first proposition, I'd like to make a second:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>2) Any criticism taken into account in this article must have been made more than once.</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>What I mean here is that the same criticism, as opposed to the same incident being criticised, has to have shown up in some kind of medium (defined in my first rule) on more than one occasion. My aim here is to filter out any baseless accusations (political motives?) against the organization in the belief that if the same criticism has been made multiple times then there is probably some degree of truth to it and it should therefore be included in the article. Ideally, these should probably be two different sources; however, I don't think this should necessarily be included as a "rule". --<font face="Papyrus"><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodeswalzer_c454.html" title="User:Todeswalzer">Todeswalzer</a><big>|</big><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodeswalzer_03da.html" title="User talk:Todeswalzer">Talk</a></font> 20:55, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not a frequent editor of this article, but I believe the point is to document the main criticisms leveled against AI and to then document AI's response to them. AI would want to list all the accusations listed against it so that it can effectively rebut the charges, but you may have a point about them being able to twist the words. They are having a discussion about this further up on the talk page, I would advise you to look there. The problem being wrestled with is documenting criticism and response while maintaining an encyclopedic NPOV. --<a href="../../../y/o/y/User%7EYoYoDa1_93b2.html" title="User:YoYoDa1">YoYoDa1</a> 23:40, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Jbd107 keeps deleting the following points I've tried to add, with no comment.</p>
<p>That Benenson was a <b>recent Catholic convert</b> when he came up with and enacted the idea for AI</p>
<p>That Benenson was <b>aware of existing activism in this area, notably the communist-backed 'Amnesty for Prisoners in Spain' campaign</b>.</p>
<p>That Benenson's main co-founder was <b>the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quaker.html" title="Quaker">Quaker</a> peace activist <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Baker_%28activist%29_e19e.html" title="Eric Baker (activist)">Eric Baker</a></b> who went on to succeed Benenson as leader of the organisation. (<a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Blom-Cooper_c22e.html" title="Louis Blom-Cooper">Louis Blom-Cooper</a> and several others were also involved in the initial group but to a lesser extent).</p>

<p><br />
I've recently expanded the Baker page and created the Blom-Cooper page. I will admit having spent more time on the former, but it certainly it seemed clear that Baker was more of a 'partner' (as Benenson put it) and a 'special confidente' as someone else says I forget who.</p>
<p>Their religious affiliations seem directly relevant, in that Benenson reports his Catholicism influencing his goals and e.g. the imagery he developed, and Baker was deeply influenced by his Quaker <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_testimony.html" title="Peace testimony">peace testimony</a> and it was from him that AI confined itself to those not themselves advocating violence.</p>
<p>I'll reinstate these points again soon unless anyone objects. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEverSince_633b.html" title="User:EverSince">EverSince</a> 18:58, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't have any deep objections to including this information on the page; however, I would lean more against it for the very reason that Amnesty is an extremely non-religious organization and so the fact that Benenson was Catholic doesn't seem very relevant here. (On his own page, perhaps.) If people here feel strongly that this should be included, then go ahead and it. But in such an instance I would insist that Amnesty's non-religious mandate be clearly emphasized.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for your point that the <i>Persecution 1961</i> cases were directly and independently investigated by Benenson et al., this is crucial information and I don't know why it wouldn't have been included, much less deleted after it was added. This fact goes to the very heart of the organization and the way it operates. --<font face="Papyrus"><a href="../../../t/o/d/User%7ETodeswalzer_c454.html" title="User:Todeswalzer">Todeswalzer</a><big>|</big><a href="../../../t/o/d/User_talk%7ETodeswalzer_03da.html" title="User talk:Todeswalzer">Talk</a></font> 04:59, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While religion is indeed void from its mandate, some people do think that Christianity had a significant influence on Amnesty’s founding. Have a look at <i>Keepers of the Flame</i> by Stephen Hopgood (London; Cornell University Press, 2006) in which he presents Amnesty International as part of a Christian response to globalization. Benenson tried to include as much catholic imagery onto Amnesty International as he could, through the use of churches, candles and special events on the Christian calendar. An alternative way to emphasize the non-religious mandate could be to stress Benenson's attempts to create inter-faith cooperation on the issue of POCs in 1961.</dd>

<dd>On another note, does anyone thinks its about time that the old 'reading the paper on the train' story is given a little more context? I assume people have read Buchanan's work, among others suggesting that Benenson, disillusioned by the failures he saw in <a href="../../../j/u/s/JUSTICE_2d66.html" title="JUSTICE">JUSTICE</a>, had retreated to Italy to think about what to do next. Benenson had spent his life around civil liberty campaigns run by lawyers, and it was while in Italy he realised he needed to break out and start something that everyone could be included in. The incident on the train appears to be just a match to an already explosive keg of ideas. 82.46.179.19 15:34, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
