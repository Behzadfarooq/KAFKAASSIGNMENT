<p>The amnion is present in all reptiles (which cladistically includes mammals and birds/dinosaurs). The article as currently written implies that only mammals (and perhaps only humans) have them.</p>
<p>In fact, the technical name for all reptiles and descendants is "amniotes". Our cousins the amphibians lack the amnion, as do all other animals.</p>

<dd>I don't see these comments as an appropriate discussion that should lead to censorship.

<dd>I don't see how the definition provided on the article <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">Censorship</a> applies to this case. I'm not suggesting removing the image entirely, just making viewing it voluntary. I've always thought that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CENSOR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#CENSOR</a> should be balanced against maintaining readability of an article for readers who do not have an iron stomach in terms of graphic content. Obviously, if four users say the photo is more graphic than it needs to be, perhaps we should err on the side of <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">WP:CON</a>. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 11:40, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Personally I don't see it as particularly graphic, being an image directly related to the topic. Not including it is, I believe, censorship as we are determining what should and should not be shown. Four users may have said it's graphic, but the first two are merely comments and do not imply that it should not be included, while the third is stating that an alternative might be better. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 13:15, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think you understand that {{<a href="../../../l/i/n/Template%7ELinkimage_fe3b.html" title="Template:Linkimage">Linkimage</a>}} does not "censor" an image — that is, remove it entirely from the article - it only places a link within a template that the reader can click if they wish.

<dd>I do understand that the linkimage template allows users to choose whether or not to see the image. The problem we've always had is where we draw the line about which images should be hidden in this way.

<p>I'm afraid you're misusing the term censorship. <a href="../../../c/e/n/Censorship.html" title="Censorship">Censorship</a> means the <i>"the removal of information from the public, or the prevention of circulation of information, where it is desired or felt best by some controlling group or body that others are not allowed to access the information which is being censored."</i> Whether or not immediately, the picture remains available to everyone interested, so using linkimage template is no censorship. People may have the right to choose if they only want to read about the topic or they also want to see it illustrated. Why should you force them to do both? Please consider: <b>the opposite of "forbidden" is not "obligatory" but "allowed."</b> There is no point in using the word "censorship" here.</p>
<p><i>"The general consensus is that, unless the image is of a highly graphic sexual nature, it should be included."</i> Obviously, other kinds of images can be similarly distracting for many -- if it weren't the case, people wouldn't object to it on the discussion page. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam78_1062.html" title="User:Adam78">Adam78</a> 16:02, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It would be much better if we did not spend time arguing about definitions here. Censorship can mean "Prevention of disturbing or painful thoughts or feelings from reaching consciousness except in a disguised form" <a href="http://www.answers.com/censorship&amp;r=67" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answers.com/censorship&amp;r=67" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, "deleting parts of publications", or "The act of hiding, removing, altering or destroying copies of art or writing so that general public access to it is partially or completely limited"<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=define:censorship" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=define:censorship" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Now let us avoid pedantics...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>While I agree that some images can be disturbing I disagree that we should hide ones such as this. As we appear to be at a deadlock an RfC might be in order. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 17:39, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let me remind you again that <i>no one</i> wants to delete anything. It's about making something optional, instead of making it obligatory.</p>
<p>Yes, please initiate an RfC. Although I really don't see why you insist on your method which only reflects your preferences and why you oppose a compromise which would suit both parties, making the picture <b>optional.</b> The more developed a program or a device is, the more options it has and so the more user-friendly it is considered. Why reduce the readers' options? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam78_1062.html" title="User:Adam78">Adam78</a> 20:11, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry but I do not see the middle point between inclusion of the image and use of linkimage to be actually using linkimage. As you say "<i>no one</i> wants to delete anything" and thus you are not compromising here. The image was there for an extended time before complaints and I believe that the default position here should be that the image is included in the article.</dd>
<dd>I understand your position and how some people might not especially like the image, but I do not like the idea of random users picking and choosing what they think people shouldn't see. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 21:19, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
You misunderstood me. The compromise or middle point (or <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>) exists between using an image and not using an image and their middle point is using linkimage. It's a middle point between two default options: we have the picture and we don't have it at the same time, so to say. (Of course, a middle point can be found between <i>any</i> two points, like using normal-sized or huge pictures, or using prepared/schematic or gory pictures, or deleting the picture altogether or just not linking to it, but I chose a middle point between the two basic options, using a picture or not using a picture. I don't think it's so complicated.)</p>
<p><i>"I do not like the idea of random users picking and choosing what they think people shouldn't see."</i> Why do you think there is no such debate about a picture of playing children? If an image raises debate among several people, don't you think it may have some reason? (I believe it concerns less than 1% of the images in Wikipedia so you don't have to be afraid that Wikipedia would lose its images.) Let me repeat again: <i>everybody</i> is allowed to see the picture, anyway.</p>
<p>Or, to put it differently, "I do not like the idea of random users forcing their will on others, ignoring others' expressed suggestion and request." I like users who leave options and let others decide what they want. And if we know that even some of those few people who resolve to become doctors actually faint at the first dissections, I don't think average people should be exposed to similar images without any prior notice. It's nothing but disrespect for the others, a lack of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">civility</a>, which I hardly think Wikipedia should afford. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam78_1062.html" title="User:Adam78">Adam78</a> 23:05, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I didn't misunderstand you at all, and cries of incivility are more inflammatory even than your decision to edit war. We should stick with the image being included in the article while discussions reach a conclusion, including an RfC if necessary. The method used by linkimage is ugly and goes against good web design principles. If someone wishes to look at an article on the amniotic sac then they should expect to see an image of it. Your analogy of doctors fainting is not relevant as seeing things in the flesh (literally!) is a totally different experience to looking at an image. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 10:27, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>On the other hand, I agree with the Gray image to be included because it's not a surgery picture. I don't think it's so much difference whether a sight is "in the flesh" or not.

<p>first, and foremost, why is this image even here? it doesn't seem to add anything really to the article, it really jsut looks like a bloody mess, second of all, Wikipedia has a content disclaimer, and that's impotent to remember; any further censoring of the image is against wikipedia's policy towards censorship.</p>
<p>What seems to be misunderstood is that it's not censorship to remove the image if that image fails to add anything to the article, it is cencorship to half remove it so that the people don't see it.</p>
<p>I will support the removal of the image, and I will support the image being in the article, but I will not support the censoring of the image.--<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHoneymane_ba48.html" title="User:Honeymane"><font color="red" face="Old English Text MT, Papyrus">Honeymane</font></a><sub><a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHoneymane_56f3.html" title="User talk:Honeymane"><font face="Klingon, QuigleyWiggly">Heghlu meH QaQ jajvam</font></a></sub> 03:25, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Because it's showing the sac in a unnatural state and looks like a shock site image--<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHoneymane_ba48.html" title="User:Honeymane"><font color="red" face="Old English Text MT, Papyrus">Honeymane</font></a><sub><a href="../../../h/o/n/User_talk%7EHoneymane_56f3.html" title="User talk:Honeymane"><font face="Klingon, QuigleyWiggly">Heghlu meH QaQ jajvam</font></a></sub></dd>

<dd>If it is thought necessary to use the image, it should open in a smaller size, as similar WP images appear; it can then be enlarged if the user wants. Using a perfectly reasonable reasonable image in an unusual way does not provide the information that should have been intended--it is a shock image technique; to AGF, this may not have been realized by those inserting and supporting it. Many things appear strange and unnatura when shown larger than expected. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:46, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that the current solution is a good compromise between the opposing interests. In terms of having the image open in a smaller size, as DGG suggested, I'm not sure if that would be possible. The picture displayed on an Image: page is a thumbnail, reduced in proportion to the image's original size, and, being that Image:Amnion.jpg is over a thousand pixels in terms of both width and length, its corresponding thumbnail will be rather wide. I think the only way to have the image open in a smaller size would be to create a second version of the file that was reduced to something like 600 pixels wide. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 14:23, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I recall that no one yet understands what organ or process creates (secretes, excretes) amniotic fluid. Sure, the fetus ingests the fluid and cycles it out the urinary tract, but from where does it originate? How do all those components get there? From the mother? Or does junior manufacture it? I always thought it was blood plasma-like substance filtered by the kidneys and out the urethra, but I ain't no MD. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertkeller_b7bd.html" title="User:Robertkeller">Robertkeller</a> 00:10, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
