<dd>Thanks for the reply! A fellow Wikipedian is putting up links to "bogus" articles on his user page. Essentially, they're pages from Wikipedia, tweaked in a "what-if" kind of scenario. (They mainly deal with "what if so-and-so television station was bought by somebody else? What would their history would be like?") They're marked (in large letters) as "NOT A REAL ARTICLE", but they are still accessible through Google and such (which is how I found them.) I couldn't find any kind of protocol or precedent for such a thing in the help pages, and am leery of approaching him about it (because he's currently invovled in several uncivil conflicts right now). Are these pages OK, and if not, what would need to be done next? <a href="../../../a/m/n/User%7EAmnewsboy_59fc.html" title="User:Amnewsboy">Amnewsboy</a> 14:38, 3 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If the pages are in his own user space (For example, if I was to make [[User:9cds/WikipediaSux!], then that's allowed. Of course, if it was anything illegal then that would be a totally different issue. -- <a href="../../../9/c/d/User%7E9cds.html" title="User:9cds">cds</a><sup><a href="../../../9/c/d/User_talk%7E9cds.html" title="User talk:9cds">(talk)</a></sup> 14:45, 3 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The pages aren't ILLEGAL, per se... they contain deliberately false information, but also have a giant header that says "THIS ISN'T REAL." Should I provide a link? <a href="../../../a/m/n/User%7EAmnewsboy_59fc.html" title="User:Amnewsboy">Amnewsboy</a> 14:51, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not necessarily, no. AETN says that the letters for KETS PROBABLY stood for "Educational Television Station", and that the other stations were kept as consistent as possible -- but that there is nothing concrete to back it up.

<p>It is definitely an improvement. My one nitpick: instead of asterisking the shows that weren't aired, I might think an italicized <i>(not aired)</i> or something similar in the description field would be a little easier to read.

<p>The online schedules for Nick GAS are wrong. It is up to the television network to notify them when there is a change which Nickelodeon obviously didn't do because they could care less about Nick GAS.

<dd>Problem is, not only are online schedules saying that FK is on (in the middle of the night, but still on the schedule), but DVRs show it on their schedule as well.

How could there be an encyclopedia article on an important person, when you only know their first and middle name.

<dd>Hi Amnewsboy,</dd>
<dd>I'm sort of ambivalent on these AFDs. On the one hand, a lot of these folks hardly seem notable. But then, "notable" is always slightly subjective. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html#Alternative_tests" title="WP:BIO">The Professor Test</a> indicates most on-air station personalities are notable, in the sense that they would be more widely recognized (by name, sight, or voice) in their DMA than a local college professor. At the same time, can Wikipedia effectively patrol hundreds (or potentially thousands) of such articles? It's clear we need a guideline; until one is in place, those who have written articles which are nominated for AFD may well take deletion personally, because no comprehensive guideline can be cited. So to some users, it will appear "personal", an unfortunate effect. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 14:21, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree, and although I think I'm effectively presenting legitimate arguments, I can understand why it's being taken as such. For my part, I think I goofed by AFD'ing before trying to establish guidelines, but hope that things are getting mended. <a href="../../../a/m/n/User%7EAmnewsboy_59fc.html" title="User:Amnewsboy">Amnewsboy</a> 14:57, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>AfDs are always a touchy thing. I've been on the receiving end of a few lately, and it's easy to allow yourself to think that it's you who are being rejected - that your hard work is being trashed. I'm just not a big fan of deleting existing articles. I've written quite a few myself that today I probably wouldn't write, but I'd much rather see someone try to improve them and bring them up to standard if possible, than to delete them. I could sense <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerusso_d23d.html" title="User:Kerusso">Kerusso</a>'s offense even in his response on <a href="../../../t/v/s/WT%7ETVS_21aa.html" title="WT:TVS">WT:TVS</a> and my first thought was "after we spent some time trying to bring ideas to the discussion, he has a lot of nerve simply trashing them without offering alternatives." Fortunately, I backed off that sentiment before I put anything down on the talk page. As I wrote there, we may end up not coming to any consensus, but it's still worth raising the issue for discussion. <a href="../../../d/h/e/User%7EDhett_3581.html" title="User:Dhett">dhett</a> 03:29, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My name is Neille Ilel and I'm a producer with a national public radio show called Weekend America.

<p>We're a conversational show and want to have a relatively laid-back discussion about what goes on in Wikipedia, just to let you know that this isn't a debate-type show where we encourage fighting.</p>

<p>Good Morning! While I understand that Wiki is not a directory, I feel that these people are part of the newscast. Ms. Fountain and Ms. Myers are featured on WHAG's website, while Mr. Myers and Mr. Brown are not, they were once. The latter mentioned though are part of the newsteam (at least in my opinion).</p>
<p>Since listed on the website, the former could remain on the Wiki page, and the latter removed....would that be a happy medium?</p>

<dd>Heya, that'll work&#160;:o) If someone does come through with the same mindset, then I (or you if you ya beat me to it) can take down those four names. Also, I did update the page a little. I added the new website and an entry in the history page and seperated the news, weather, sports, and off-air teams has I did with the <a href="../../../w/h/s/WHSV_78d2.html" title="WHSV">WHSV</a> and <a href="../../../t/v/3/TV3_Winchester_1ceb.html" title="TV3 Winchester">TV3 Winchester</a> pages.

<p>Am I wrong for thinking that including every single person who works at the station shouldn't belong in this article? I removed it once, and it was promptly put back by the original author of the article... I hesitate to remove them again because a) I don't want to be seen as inciting an edit war, and b) I nominated Scholastic Ball Report for deletion (another article he authored) because it doesn't establish notability (it doesn't seem any different to me than any other local sports program).

<dd>I agree the bottom half of the article looks more like the list of credits at the end of a program than an encyclopedia article. I appreciate the care you've taken in trying to avoid an edit war.

<p>Saturday morning programming...ok, ya got me there.:) But some of the information could be valueable.

(She sent it to me over LiveJournal; I'm guessing she doesn't know how to use talk pages.) The gist of it is that she believes non on-air staff should still be listed in the article because they (the station employees, collectively) wanted to leave it there - regardless of whether or not the same information is listed on other TV station articles.</p>
<p>I left her a message on her <a href="../../../k/i/d/User_talk%7EKida97_dd74.html" title="User talk:Kida97">talk page</a>, explaining why I did what I did, why I believe it falls under <a href="../../../l/c/_/WP%7ELC_690f.html" title="WP:LC">WP:LC</a>, and how it may also bring up a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> issue as well.</p>

<dd>Hi Am,</dd>
<dd>I've left a friendly note on her talk page. Yes, listcruft should absolutely be removed. On-air personalities are <i>borderline notable</i> (some articles have been deleted, some have been retained), but off-air staff rarely pass <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. We're building an encyclopedia, and these sorts of lists aren't really conducive to that. I never saw a janitor listed on a TV station article, but I did see some <i>secretaries</i>. These folks help keep the station running, but are not notable by themselves: a local resident in Idaho wouldn't recognize them from their work at the station. Drop by my talk page at any time.

<p>They didn't own the chopper (as most small station don't) but it was Sky 12. I thought it was weird that they didn't have anything on the NBC12 site either. Oddly, no links on WTVR, WRIC or WWBT about the story....none on WBOC or WMDT for a follow-up. An updated version of the story (via the WBOC link I gave) shows the pilot, Kara Dewitt, does work for NBC12. I am not sure how you would like to go with this since only WBOC has only report (though slightly updated) and nothing on the Richmond stations. - <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../o/r/a/User_talk%7EOrangemonster2k1_f61c.html" title="User talk:Orangemonster2k1">Yell</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Orangemonster2k1_ce79.html" title="Special:Contributions/Orangemonster2k1">Toil</a>)</sup> 20:14, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I have two links...oddly, only from the Salisbury Daily Times (couldn't find a link in the Richmond Times-Dispatch). <sup><a href="http://www.delmarvanow.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200770326010" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.delmarvanow.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200770326010" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></sup> and <sup><a href="http://www.delmarvanow.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200770324002" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.delmarvanow.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200770324002" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></sup> are the links from the Daily Times in Salisbury. There were blurbs on DCRTV.com and VARTV.com, the Radio and TV news and information sites in DC and Norfolk (serves Richmond) respectfully. I wish I could find a link in the Richmond paper, but their site is just too hard to use. Hope this helps.

<p>Hey, I looked over the WP:TVS page and the talk page and I didn't see what you were saying about off-air staff (that list was done by a WYMT staffer, by the way) though I do skim the page so I may have missed it. I reverted for the time-being...could you please post the link and I will re-revert. The WYMT staffer and I keep that list as up-to-date as humanly possible, so it is accurate (even though the IP user likes to mess with it). Please let me know on the WP:TVS rule and I will re-revert. My apologizes ahead of time if I reverted something that is actually in the rules. - <a href="../../../o/r/a/User%7EOrangemonster2k1_ef23.html" title="User:Orangemonster2k1">SVRTVDude</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../o/r/a/User_talk%7EOrangemonster2k1_f61c.html" title="User talk:Orangemonster2k1">Yell</a> - <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Orangemonster2k1_ce79.html" title="Special:Contributions/Orangemonster2k1">Toil</a>)</sup> 07:50, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you and Firsfron have reached a consensus with others, I don't want to step on anyone's toes. I probably overlooked the posts about it (I skim the page sometimes too fast) but if you all want to talk about it, please let me know what the final consensus is or if I did indeed overlook something in the talk page. Again, I don't want to step on anyone's toes.

<p>Hey, FoF... the <a href="../../../k/a/m/KAMR-TV_a73d.html" title="KAMR-TV">KAMR-TV</a> article is still being reverted back to the addition of the station's producing staff... at least 2 or 3 times since the topic was brought up the last time. I think what annoys me more at this point is that there's not a willingness to discuss the matter -- the pages are simply being reverted without talking about it anywhere. I don't think the lists belong there (as per policy), but I'm willing to listen -- the problem is, nobody there is willing to talk. What can be done now? <a href="../../../a/m/n/User%7EAmnewsboy_59fc.html" title="User:Amnewsboy">Amnewsboy</a> 07:23, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

It seems likely an editor will have to see this when s/he edits the article.
