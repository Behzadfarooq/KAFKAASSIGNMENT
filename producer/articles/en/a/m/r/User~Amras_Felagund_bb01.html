<h1><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/r/User%7EAmras_Felagund_bb01.html" title="Edit section: What I Have to Say About Timmy/Trixie">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">What I Have to Say About Timmy/Trixie</span></h1>
<p>There is nothing in the <i>Fairly OddParents</i> fan base that I shudder at more than the complete and total dehumanization of the character of Trixie Tang. She started out in the episode ‚ÄòA Wish Too Far!‚Äô which was her television debut. She was stuck-up, snobbish, and had a bouncer for making sure that none of those who were unpopular (anyone apart from herself, Tad &amp; Chad, and Veronica) ever came close to her. She changed gears entirely when Timmy Turner, the star of <i>Fairly OddParents</i> wished that he had what he needed to be in the popular crowd. In the end, he had to give it up to get his true friends - not to mention his fairy godparents, Cosmo &amp; Wanda - back. Trixie admired him for standing up for his friends to get their respect back, and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek as a reward.</p>
<p>Also worthy of note: Trixie said to a female Timmy in 'The Boy Who Would Be Queen' that she'd date Timantha if ‚Äòshe‚Äô were a guy, seeing as Timmy likes both guy things (i.e.: comic books) and girl things (i.e.: ‚ÄòKissy Kissy Goo Goo Hour‚Äô) like she does - a fact never exploited or even mentioned again, I might add. Could Trixie Tang, the most popular girl in all of Dimmsdale, possibly be hiding some affection for Timmy Turner, the very bottom rung of the popularity chart?</p>
<p>Episodes like ‚ÄòMind over Magic‚Äô and ‚ÄòJust the Two of Us‚Äô shatter such notions. Trixie quite literally thinks of Timmy as a loser, as noted when Timmy reads Trixie‚Äôs mind in the former episode. In ‚ÄòJust the Two of Us‚Äô, any notion that Trixie is even the same person that we saw in ‚ÄòA Wish Too Far!‚Äô or ‚ÄòThe Boy Who Would Be Queen‚Äô is promptly thrown out the window. Ask me: what kind of human being, cartoon or otherwise, needs constant reminders of how pretty they are, and when that single source of compliments is cut off, then goes on a homicidal rampage against the one who spurned them? I have carefully noted that Butch Hartman was working on the pre-production phases of <i>Danny Phantom</i> when the former came out, and that ‚ÄòJust the Two of Us‚Äô - which I carefully noticed had virtually no Butch Hartman involvement whatsoever - came out when <i>Danny Phantom</i> was well into its first season. So perhaps this is not the direction Butch Hartman had in store for Trixie Tang at all.</p>
<p>(This seems to quickly be turning into a ‚Äòthe new writers of <i>Fairly OddParents</i> have ruined Trixie Tang‚Äôs character‚Äô report. I suppose it is inevitable when it comes to writing such things.)</p>
<p>Then again, who ever said that Trixie Tang needs to fall in love with Timmy during the course of the television series? Who ever said it was utterly impossible for her to realize that money cannot buy her true love in her teenage years, rather than in her prepubescence?</p>
<p>Think not of how an extended relationship will affect Timmy‚Äôs future alone, but <i>Trixie‚Äôs</i> as well. If she falls for him, she will learn a vital lesson in life: money and popularity can get you a lot of things, but true love is not one of them.</p>
<p>Whether Trixie Tang grows to love Timmy in her teenage years, or if she already has but is not telling us, does not really matter, though. For in the end, the outcome is very much the same:<a href="http://www.geocities.com/outlawspassion/TimmyTootie/TimmysKids2.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/outlawspassion/TimmyTootie/TimmysKids2.jpg" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
<p>I have taken note of the fact that in spite of the fact that Timmy‚Äôs daughter, Tammy, has the same hairstyle, head shape, eyebrows, colorization of clothing, and teeth as Trixie, people invariably assume Tootie to be her mother. Why, you may ask? Well, take a look at Tammy‚Äôs glasses. So? Tammy wears glasses. Big deal. For your information, Trixie‚Äôs father wears glasses.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would simply like to say that I cannot see Timmy Turner being happy with anyone but Trixie Tang, the most popular girl in Dimmsdale.</p>
<p>And I am proud of it.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I like Tootie; I just don't see her and Timmy being in an extended romantic relationship. So why do I, and so few other people in the FOP fandom, like the Timmy/Trixie pairing so? It's difficult to judge why they do, so I'll explain why it strikes me as more appropriate than Timmy/Tootie.</p>
<p>The answer is simple for me. It's because the <i>Fairly OddParents</i> is like a modern fairy tale, in more ways than one. The fairy tales I grew up with often involve a knight in shining armor fighting those who would keep him from being with the love of his life, braving all odds, and ultimately having a 'happily ever after' ending with the girl/princess. I just want to see Timmy Turner have a 'happily ever after' with his dream-girl, 'Princess' Trixie Tang.</p>
<p>Don't you?</p>

<h1><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/r/User%7EAmras_Felagund_bb01.html" title="Edit section: What I Have to Say About Jimmy/Betty">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">What I Have to Say About Jimmy/Betty</span></h1>
<p>The vast majority of the Jimmy Neutron fandom seems to be of the impression that Jimmy Neutron and Cindy Vortex are meant to be. But most of these fans seem to neglect the character of Betty Quinlan, whose first appearance was in the episode "Party at Neutron's". She seems to be the 'pretty girl' in school, and she is the clincher in Carl and Sheen's persuasion of Jimmy to throw said party in said episode. She &amp; Jimmy dance (much to Cindy's chagrin) and at the party's conclusion, Betty does something that Cindy would not be caught dead doing: she kisses Jimmy on the cheek. Rather remarkable, as this is Jimmy's first kiss, and it's in the first season, <i>before</i> the writers started shoving Jimmy/Cindy "goodness" down our throats.</p>
<p>Miss Betty Quinlan is not seen again until the second season episode "Out Darn Spotlight", where she auditions for (and wins) the role of Lady Macbeth in <i>Macbeth In Space</i>, a science-fiction version of Shakespeare's famous, bad-luck-from-saying-its-name-in-a-theater play. Unwilling to try for the title role, Jimmy is gung-ho for playing Macbeth when he learns of a kissing scene between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. He loses to Nick, who breaks his leg just before the play is to begin. Jimmy, heretofore relegated to the special effects provider, takes the role and leaves Sheen in charge of the device.</p>
<p>The device goes wonky just before Jimmy &amp; Betty's kissing scene, and Jimmy is forced to save the school from a rampaging tornado. Regretful of the fact that they were unable to kiss onstage, Betty decides to give Jimmy a thank-you-for-saving-our-lives kiss anyway. And she does, right on the mouth! Leaving Jimmy to muse about how he loves acting.</p>
<p>Not much of comment is to be found in "One of Us", apart from the fact that Jimmy inspects a hypnotic show at Betty's request, even though he is already suspicious of it. The one Betty episode that takes the cake, though, is "Vanishing Act", where Betty serves as Jimmy's motivation to do a magic show, and through subsequent misadventures that lead them through the magic kit Jimmy was using, they end up in a "liney" room (like a computer grid) and Betty drops the bomb and says the following three words to Cindy, the three words that are the bane of the existence of every Jimmy/Betty fan I know:</p>
<p>"He's all yours."</p>
<p>What a major departure from the Betty seen in the previous three episodes. Up till this point, in her last episode I might add, we have never seen any hints that she could be shallow. And even that is the only point that this aspect comes out. And yet most fans have interpreted this as her saying, "I don't like him anymore, and I know you like him, so he's all yours." Myself and the few others who support Jimmy/Betty have interpreted it as a means to get Cindy off of Betty's back, "Look, I'm giving you a shot at his heart, but if you blow it, he's all mine."</p>
<p>It is rather sad that this had to have transpired. A character who makes her feelings for Jimmy quite well known is practically written out of the show because the writers think Cindy would be a better Mrs. Neutron. Ugh. As the episode "The Tomorrow Boys" put it bluntly enough, Jimmy &amp; Cindy would bicker constantly if they ever became more than friends. Betty, on the other hand, has always treated Jimmy with kindness and respect. Likewise, Cindy has not even <i>contemplated</i> the thought of kissing Jimmy, and Betty has done it <i>twice</i>! And what's sadder than Betty's feelings for Jimmy being written out of the show, is that Jimmy's feelings for Betty have been disposed of as well. He even kisses Cindy in a very recent episode!</p>
<p>But who's to say that Jimmy <i>did</i> stop like-liking Betty? Jimmy Neutron director Keith Alcorn once said that Cindy was only crushing on Timmy in "The Jimmy Timmy Power Hour 2: When Nerds Collide", but that she still loved Jimmy as well. Perhaps Jimmy is caught in a similar predicament; perhaps he may be crushing on Cindy lately, but still loves Betty Quinlan. Besides, in "League of Villains", he has a rather large collection of pictures of Betty in his lab and rocket.</p>
<p>That is the spark of hope that me and several Jimmy/Betty fans hold on to. While Jimmy/Betty has become increasingly unlikely in the latest episodes, let me point something out: just because Jimmy is crushing on Cindy right now, doesn't mean he won't swivel back to liking Betty in his adolescent years. Who knows? Betty may not have given up on him at all, but may be patiently biding her time, waiting for Cindy to screw up her one chance at Jimmy.</p>
<p>And when Cindy does, Betty will make a move, and Jimmy's all hers.</p>

<p>I am currently writing two Fairly OddParents fanfictions on FanFiction.Net: <i>Happily Ever After</i>, a romance fanfiction for Timmy and Trixie (which there just aren't enough of), and an AU fic for my online friend cartoonwatchergirl, <i>Over Spring Hill</i>, involving the life of a girl named Stacy who is a HUGE fan of <i>Fairly OddParents</i>.</p>

<p><b>Happily Ever After</b> is a <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_fiction.html" title="Fan fiction">fanfiction</a> that focuses primarily on the blooming romance between <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timmy_Turner_1f7f.html" title="Timmy Turner">Timmy Turner</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Popular_Kids_%28The_Fairly_OddParents%29_681f.html#Trixie_Tang" title="The Popular Kids (The Fairly OddParents)">Trixie Tang</a>. It was written in response to the relatively sparse collection of fanfictions centering on Timmy &amp; Trixie (compared to the number of Timmy/<a href="../../../t/o/o/Tootie_%28The_Fairly_OddParents%29_eb4e.html" title="Tootie (The Fairly OddParents)">Tootie</a> romance fanfictions there are).</p>
<p>At over 50,000 words long (about 20,000 from the two most recent chapters alone), it is one of the longest Timmy/Trixie fanfictions ever, if not <i>the</i> longest Timmy/Trixie fanfiction ever. At this stage, certain plot developments and the introductions of certain characters could mean that <i>Happily Ever After</i> may come close to 100,000 words and possibly exceed that length, a milestone in <i>Fairly OddParents</i> fanfiction - only three others on <a href="../../../f/a/n/FanFiction.Net_e527.html" title="FanFiction.Net">FanFiction.Net</a> have reached this length.</p>
<p><i>Happily Ever After</i> is written in a style emulating that of the style <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Stover_7ec2.html" title="Matthew Stover">Matthew Stover</a> utilized in the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Star_Wars_Episode_III%7E_Revenge_of_the_Sith_%28novel%29_a6fe.html" title="Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (novel)">novelization of <i>Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</i></a>. As in the <i>Sith</i> novel, it is written in past tense and an offshoot of <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narrator.html#Third_person.2C_omniscient" title="Narrator">third person omniscient</a>, which has segments which focus predominantly on one character's thoughts and point of view. Also, there are segments that revert to a neutral point of view in present tense that detail such things as 'Anti-Fairies', 'the perfect love triangle', and the like. The 'This is how it feels to be...' segments, written in <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narrator.html#Second_person" title="Narrator">second person</a> and present tense, are utilized much more frequently than in the novelization of <i>Sith</i>, which only used these fascinating segments three times, and all for the same character, unlike <i>Happily Ever After's</i> diverse and frequent usage of it.</p>

<p><b>Trixie Tang</b> is the love of Timmy Turner's life, and the most popular kid in Dimmsdale. Struck by a love arrow in her youth, she fell in love with Timmy Turner at first sight, but - in order to maintain her popularity and stay with her family - feigned apathy towards him. As a result of her 'being horrible' towards him, she developed a very low self-image (ironic, considering her perceived high self-image) and a tremendous hatred for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Popular_Kids_%28The_Fairly_OddParents%29_681f.html#Tad_and_Chad" title="The Popular Kids (The Fairly OddParents)">Tad, Chad</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Popular_Kids_%28The_Fairly_OddParents%29_681f.html#Veronica" title="The Popular Kids (The Fairly OddParents)">Veronica</a>, but hid this behind a fa√ßade perceived only by her friends.</p>

<p>Little over a year after becoming Timmy's GodParents, however, Cosmo became inexplicably callous towards Wanda, and their very marriage was threatened. It was revealed that Anti-Cosmo, Cosmo's <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Fairy_3f8c.html" title="Anti-Fairy">Anti-Fairy</a> counterpart, was using a spell to mind-control Cosmo into saying these cruel and callous remarks with a spell his Master taught him. After thwarting his method of mind-contol, Cosmo &amp; Wanda's love (and their marriage) mended, and they became 'two halves of a whole idiot' once more.</p>
<p>In 'Chapter 9: The Moment of Truth', it is revealed that Cosmo &amp; Wanda were once Trixie's Fairy GodParents. She lost them after less than a year, for saying 'I don't believe in Fairies' in a school play. Cosmo &amp; Wanda were also in league with Cupid, who planned to get Timmy &amp; Trixie together. They kept this a secret from Timmy - who thought Cupid prefered him to fall in love with Tootie - believing that reverse psychology would drive him towards Trixie. It worked.</p>

<p><b>Tad &amp; Chad</b> are the two most popular boys in Dimmsdale. Chad was adopted by Tad's parents; Chad's surname prior to adoption was Chase.

However, this eventually evolved into true friendship, which sadly was not returned. Trixie treated them with the coldness that she faked around unpopular kids.

<p>She is Trixie Tang's cousin. Her mother, Elizabeth Tang, was Trixie's aunt, and fell in love with an unpopular teenager named Samuel Hope at 16. At 17, Samuel got Elizabeth pregnant with Sammy, and was subsequently disowned from her family for "carrying filth". Her mother has told her of her lineage since she was old enough to understand, and yearns to be part of the Tang family again. She becomes quick friends with Timmy Turner when she tells him of their mutual goals of wanting Trixie Tang's attention, and their mutual ownership of Fairy GodParents.</p>

<p>He is the virtual embodiment of darkness in the world of magic. Brought into existence by 'an errant wish' by 'that punk Turner', his prodigious skill with magic quickly elevated him to the position of Master of All Anti-Fairies. When unwished a day after coming into existence, the pain of the betrayal of his "parents", Cosmo &amp; Wanda, was too great, and so he ripped out his own heart, reducing himself to a shadow, until he was returned to a primitive and 'underdeveloped' new body by Anti-Cosmo. He is largely responsible for a number of events that have tested Timmy's resolve to be with Trixie, including a series of nightmares with Trixie as a homicidal maniac.</p>

<p>At the end of 'Chapter 9: The Moment of Truth', it is revealed that the Master Anti-Fairy is actually <b>Anti-Timothy</b>, Timmy Turner's Anti-Fairy counterpart. The 'errant wish' he refered to in his introduction occured in the episode 'A Mile in My Shoes', where Timmy temporarily wished he himself was a Fairy GodParent.</p>
<p>Anti-Timothy is also the only character in the fanfiction to coldly and mercilessly decide to kill someone.

<p>The Master Anti-Fairy is possibly the only character who does not have any humorous quirks. He is also devoid of a conscience, which renders him very cold and remorseless. He shares many similarities with the <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organization_XIII_e4d2.html#Nobody" title="Organization XIII">Nobodies</a> from <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_Hearts_series_ad3a.html" title="Kingdom Hearts series"><i>Kingdom Hearts</i></a>, such as the lack of a heart, an emotionless demeanor, and constant denial of his own existence. He has many plans in store to ensure that he exacts revenge on Timmy and make it certain that love will never blossom between Timmy and Trixie, since <i>love hurts</i>. His hatred of the oppression of his fellow Unwished Wishes by Fairy World has led to him labeling <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jorgen_Von_Strangle_a997.html" title="Jorgen Von Strangle">Jorgen Von Strangle</a> as <i>Der F√§ehrer</i>, a blend of 'Fae', the Latin word for 'fairy', and 'Der F√ºhrer', the title used by <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>.</p>
<p>Allegedly, the Master has a foot fixation, and derives sexual pleasure from even seeing a woman's bare feet.</p>

<p><b>Beatrix Elizabeth Tang I</b> is Trixie Tang's mother. She is very overbearing and has almost no love for her daughter, and even less for the unpopular.

<p>Her maiden name is Tang, although she is in no way blood-related to her husband Nigel (save through Trixie). The merger of their two families was a necessity to avoid confusion.</p>

<p><b>Elizabeth Beatrix Tang-Hope</b> is Sammy's mother. Unlike her older sister, she adores her daughter Sammy, often referring to her as 'sweetheart' and generally showering her daughter with the affection she deserves.

<p>An <b>Anry</b> is the offspring of a Fairy father and an Anti-Fairy mother. A <b>Faiti</b> is the offspring of an Anti-Fairy father and a Fairy mother. Anries resemble Anti-Fairies and Faities resemble Fairies in terms of complexion, but their magical signature is neutral; therefore, they do not need a Fairy or Anti-Fairy counterpart to 'balance' the universe out.</p>
<p>I am not the first to use the concept of half-Fairies and half-Anti-Fairies, but it is likely I am the first to do so in this manner.</p>

<p>These spells are listed in the order that they appeared or were mentioned in the story. This is not necessarily a complete list, as the Master has several spells that he has not used yet.</p>

<p>A mind-control spell. It specifically is meant to make the victim extremely susceptible to suggestion from the caster of the spell. Unfortunately, it is only functional if the victim contains a part of the spell-caster inside him or her.</p>

<p><i>Contrarotus</i> was used to brilliant effect by Anti-Cosmo on Cosmo, who had transplanted his Fa Giggly Gland into Cosmo just before he began acting coldly towards Wanda. Cosmo's cruelty was in fact Anti-Cosmo's doing; his plan was to drive Cosmo &amp; Wanda apart, as he found Anti-Wanda's idiocy to be intolerable, and take Wanda on the rebound and end up with someone somewhat closer to his intellect. His insidious plot was foiled when Cosmo's love for Wanda transplanted their Fa Giggly Glands back into their former bodies.</p>

<p>The Master's version of the <i>Contrarotus</i> spell works on anyone. This is no plot hole; the Master needs to keep his servants on a lower pedestal than him. This may come into play again later on.</p>
<p>The <i>Contrarotus</i> spell seems to have a single weakness: love. In all instances of its usage in <i>Happily Ever After</i> so far, it was overridden by the love of one person by another. This could have significance in future chapters.</p>
<p><i>Contrarotus</i> comes from the Medieval Latin word <i>contrarotulare</i>, which is a root word for <i>control</i>.</p>

<p>The spell used by Anti-Cosmo to return the Master from a being of shadows to a rudimentary body to inhabit before complete resurrection.</p>

<p><i>Ephemecorpus</i> has a curious etymology. <i>Epheme-</i> comes from <i>ephemeral</i>, a word for <i>short-lived</i>. <i>-corpus</i> comes from the Latin word for <i>body</i>.</p>
<p><a name="Poenus" id="Poenus"></a></p>

<p>A pain-based spell. The spell can vary tremendously, depending on the level of concentration, from a mildly irritating itch to a full-blown agony dancing throughout the body that defies the The potential of its usage on anyone can lead almost always to instant cooperation.</p>

<p>It was used once so far in <i>Happily Ever After</i>, by the Master on Sanderson the Pixie. Sanderson, normally stoic and reserved, was driven to screaming in agony by <i>Poenus</i>. Such was the pain he went through that the prospect of enduring it again causes him anxiety bordering on panic, and renders him rather unreserved.</p>

<p><i>Poenus</i> comes from the Latin word <i>poena</i>, for <i>pain</i>.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/r/User%7EAmras_Felagund_bb01.html" title="Edit section: Verbus Mortus">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Verbus Mortus</i></span></h4>
<p>Not utilized yet in <i>Happily Ever After</i>, but a forboding spell nonetheless. Its usage on anyone or anything results in instant death. Anti-Cosmo's fantasy of using it on Cosmo reveals that it eradicates the flesh, blood, and internal organs of the victim, leaving the skeleton behind. This may be different for the Master, who is notorious for altering spells that he teaches to his disciples.</p>
<p><i>Verbus Mortus</i>, like many of the Master's spells, has a Latin etymology. <i>Verbus</i> is based on the Latin <i>verbum</i>, for <i>verb</i>. <i>Mortus</i> comes from <i>mortalis</i>, for <i>death</i>. Hence, "Verb of Death", or by a stretch of the imagination, "<b>Die!</b>"</p>

<p>This is not an original concept, being half-Ghost, but many of the attributes in <i>Happily Ever After</i> can be credited to me.</p>

<p>Since this chapter was written before the upcoming (as of this edit) finale of <i>Danny Phantom</i>, there are bound to be some errors and/or inconsistencies with the end of the show. When that happens, I will rewrite the erroneous segments of the chapter, repost it, and fill in the old chapter in the <i>Danny Phantom</i> section of FanFiction.Net as its own individual story (with a comparison link to the new, 'canonical' chapter).</p>
