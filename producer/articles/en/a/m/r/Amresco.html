	    <p><b>AMRESCO</b> was the new name given to "Financial Resource Management, Inc." (FRMI), a <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subsidiary.html" title="Subsidiary">subsidiary</a> of the NCNB Texas National Bank in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>.</p>
<p>The subsidiary was created in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a> after NCNB's name took a beating in the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> market, after it successfully bidded and acquired the failed banks of <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dallas.html" title="Dallas">Dallas</a>-based "First Republic Bank Corporation" (FRBC) in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a> from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, the activities for which FRMI/AMRESCO was responsible, were conducted in NCNB's name.</p>

<p>Through a series of political and business machinations, orchestrated by Dallas billionaire, <a href="../../../h/2E/_/H._Ross_Perot_dcd5.html" title="H. Ross Perot">H. Ross Perot</a>, calling upon Hugh McColl, NCNB's chairman who was his old <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marine_Corps_50a5.html" title="Marine Corps">Marine Corps</a> compatriot, <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Carolina_5c52.html" title="North Carolina">North Carolina</a>-based NCNB Corporation became the winning bidder among several competing money-center institutions for the largest banking organization in Texas,</p>
<p>Though the FDIC's action was considered precipitous by many, and its application of policies uneven, arbitrary and capricious — when FDIC later began applying its policies with similar severity to east coast banks, the politicians stepped in to stop them — the general political tide at the time was flowing against <a href="../../../f/i/n/Financial_institution.html" title="Financial institution">financial institutions</a> in the southwest which had become concentrated first in the oil patch, and then in <a href="../../../r/e/a/Real_estate.html" title="Real estate">real estate</a>. Even though the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Congress_7589.html" title="U.S. Congress">U.S. Congress</a> had written laws, encouraging the very lending activities in which these institutions engaged, their failure demanded action. And the politicians did not have the courage to admit that the laws they had passed were the source of the failure. Even <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Senator_499c.html" title="U.S. Senator">U.S. Senator</a> <a href="../../../l/l/o/Lloyd_Bentsen_0594.html" title="Lloyd Bentsen">Lloyd Bentsen</a> (D-TX), Chairman of the <a href="../../../s/e/n/Senate_Finance_Committee_7a96.html" title="Senate Finance Committee">Senate Finance Committee</a>, whose son-in-law, John Falb, was a vice-chairman of FRBC, could (or would) do nothing to prevent the FDIC's action.</p>
<p>Part of the agreement between NCNB and the FDIC was that NCNB would not bear any losses from the substandard assets of the failed FRBC banks. This was the typical arrangement when FDIC found a buyer for a failed institution. However, the volume of these assets was so great that FDIC did not have the manpower to take them over in their traditional way. On the other hand, FRBC already had a large corps of employees who had been working these assets with considerable expertise. These now became NCNB employees. In addition, many more employees from the failed institutions would be repositioned to work these sub-par assets and to collect on them for the FDIC. NCNB would earn fees on the collections.</p>
<p>This group was not as efficient as it had been prior to FDIC control, because now there was a government bureaucracy involved. Eventually, the process became an excruciating one, with decisions nearly impossible to procure. And the new bank's name suffered. So, eventually, the "workout group" as this subunit was called, was spun off into a separate subsidiary called FRMI, and later, renamed AMRESCO (for "American Resources Company").</p>
<p>In the meantime, NCNB merged with another east-coast banking organization, C&amp;S/Sovran. This merger was effective in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, and realizing the beating, the NCNB name had taken in Texas (which represented roughly half of the old NCNB's holdings), the merged entity would be called <a href="../../../n/a/t/NationsBank_4508.html" title="NationsBank">NationsBank</a>. NationsBank would eventually acquire <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_of_America_3960.html" title="Bank of America">Bank of America</a> and adopt this institution's name as its own.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>, AMRESCO was spun off from the company entirely. AMRESCO had also won some <i>Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation</i> and <i>Resolution Trust Corporation</i> (FSLIC/RTC) contracts to manage the assets of the failed savings and loan institutions. Its big plan, however, was to market itself to client banks — institutions which had not failed — to provide collection services for them.</p>
<p>The FDIC considered this a conflict of interest, however, and as long as the FRBC contract was still a primary source of activity, the client bank's plan was stuck in neutral. The "Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act" of 1993 (1993 RTC Act) effectively gave FDIC control of all savings institutions as well, and a virtual <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monopoly.html" title="Monopoly">monopoly</a> on loan workout contracts.</p>
<p>AMRESCO saw a serious decline in employee morale as its future looked grim. The name, "NCNB", became the butt of many jokes, such as "NCNB" standing for "No Cash for No Body", "Nobody Cares, Nobody Bothers", and employees were even beginning to rumble that it meant "No Compensation, No Benefits".</p>
<p>Former bankers whose careers had been built on contentious activities such as collections, <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bankruptcy.html" title="Bankruptcy">bankruptcies</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/t/Litigation.html" title="Litigation">litigation</a> had little skill at such things as marketing for new clients, and frankly, the decimation of the southwestern economy of the late <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> and early <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990s.html" title="1990s">1990s</a> was finally coming to end.</p>
<p>AMRESCO would have to find some other line of business if it was to stay alive, and it did. The company transitioned into <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mortgage.html" title="Mortgage">mortgage</a> and commercial loan servicing, although it still lists debtor-in-possession (bankruptcy) financing among its services.</p>
