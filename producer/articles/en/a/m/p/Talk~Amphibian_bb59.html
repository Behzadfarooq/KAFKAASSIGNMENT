<p>Shame on this article for not telling the reader whether or not amphibians can breathe water. Something like that is a basic question that children would like to know (or adults who would like to settle a bet).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Read the section on Reproduction; included is the development of amphibians. They start life breathing with gills - gills are for breathing water. The gills are eventually replaced with lungs - lungs are for breathing air. More in-depth information on the development of these systems can be found in more specific articles (such as <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frogs.html" title="Frogs">Frogs</a>), since they may vary from amphibian to amphibian. - <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlow_Graffiti_1921.html" title="User:Slow Graffiti">Slow Graffiti</a> 07:20, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Someone please add this info: How large a portion of their life do amphibians typically spend in tadpole form? Also, do they start to metamorphose immediately after hatching, or does the metamorphosis only begin after spending some time as a tadpole? <a href="../../../s/p/e/User%7ESpectrumDT_980a.html" title="User:SpectrumDT">SpectrumDT</a> 22:23, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As above, this is something that varies from genus to genus, species to species. Refer to more specific articles for more specific information. In the line of taxonomic groupings, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Class_%28biology%29.html" title="Class (biology)">Class</a> is a very large division, just under Kingdom and Phylum. Amphibia is a Class containing almost 6,000 different species. Move down the line for more specific information: Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species.</dd>
<dd>Asking for a typical growth rate for amphibians is similar to asking for a typical growth rate or gestation period for a mammal (Class: Mammalia). A zebra has a gestation period of 365 days; a hippopotamus has a gestation period of 225 days; a lion only 108 days. - <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlow_Graffiti_1921.html" title="User:Slow Graffiti">Slow Graffiti</a> 07:41, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, I was wondering if anyone could add to this page whether or not Amphibians regulate their temperature or they are regulated by their environment, like reptiles. I was looking through the page and I did not see any information concerning the topic (it is a pretty important fact, after all). I may be overlooking something, but if it truly isn't there, I would appreciate if it was added (my guess is ectotherm, but I could be wrong). Thank you. ~Regulus.</p>

<dd>Yes-Tetrapoda is a group, and just because some sub-groups lost some or all of their four legs doesn't mean they are no longer tetrapods.

<dl>
<dd>Not really. Traditionally Class Amphibia has included all basal tetrapods, yes. However cladistic definitions of amphibia usually limit that group to the stem clade containing modern amphibians. Benton (2004), which I've advocated using as a standard guide for Linnaean ranks here, basically follows this. Basalmost tetrapods are not within any class, stem amphibians are in Class Amphibia, and Lepospondyli + Reptiliomorpha are in an "Unnamed Class", paraphyletic with respect to Amniota. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinoguy2_fb24.html" title="User:Dinoguy2">Dinoguy2</a> 23:00, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
