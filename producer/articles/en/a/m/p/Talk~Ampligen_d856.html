<p>Blanking the article is unhelpful: and suggesting that "The entire Ampligen entry is incorrect and needs to be rewritten by a specialist" with the explanation "It was for the greater part incorrect, misleading and biased" is unhelpful - where is it incorrect, where is it misleading, and why is it biased?

<p>Your contribution contains big mistakes (e.g. Ampligen phase III trial for CFS was completed in 2004, Bioclones' marketing rights are being challenged by Hemispherx Biopharma, Ampligen raw materials are no longer manufactured by Ribotech) and lacks relevant indispensable elements (e.g. the results of the phase II and phase III trials for Ampligen for CFS, relevant Ampligen patents)while containing a lot of irrelevant material (patent to infuse tobacco ). The serious side-effects you refer to lack correct evidence. The link you offer is a testimony of one person who cannot even prove that her problems were caused by Ampligen... I consider you lack the necessary competences and knowledge to write a serious article about Ampligen. It's a hopeless task to correct all the mistakes and the set-up of this entry, so someone should start from scratch.<a href="../../../w/a/m/User%7EWamper_4c05.html" title="User:Wamper">Wamper</a> 11:12, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, I agree that there may be some mistakes in the article - information on Ampligen is not readily available, it seems, and I will make the corrections you have outlined.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, you may class information as 'indispensable' but that does not neccessarily make it so - the article is not intended to be a list of every result for every clinical trial.</dd>
<dd>On the subject of the serious side effects in the section 'Impact', you are on reflection probably right. The evidence probably fails verifiability, and I will remove it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, to suggest that I 'lack the necessary competences and knowledge to write a serious article about Ampligen' somewhat misses the point of wikipedia - it is compiled by people who are not necessarily experts on what is written. Instead of being overly critical and unhelpful, it would be more useful if you were to constructively help in improving the article, making corrections where you feel they are necessary and adding relevant information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Incidentally, I didnt add the bit about infusing ampligen with tobacco. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThedreamdied_b4b9.html" title="User:Thedreamdied">Thedreamdied</a> 13:21, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, as I don't feel called upon to contribute, let me suggest you to compare the Wikipedia Ampligen entry with the information in the following fairly dependable research report <a href="http://www.boenningandscattergood.com/research/CI/HEB%20%282006.12.1%29.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.boenningandscattergood.com/research/CI/HEB%20%282006.12.1%29.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.boenningandscattergood.com/research/CI/HEB%20%282006.12.1%29.pdf</a> and in the Sec filings of Hemispherx Biopharma <a href="http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0000946644&amp;owner=include" class="external free" title="http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0000946644&amp;owner=include" rel="nofollow">http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0000946644&amp;owner=include</a> As Ampligen is an experimental drug, I would wait for an EMEA European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) <a href="http://www.emea.eu.int/htms/human/epar/eparintro.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.emea.eu.int/htms/human/epar/eparintro.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.emea.eu.int/htms/human/epar/eparintro.htm</a> or FDA equivalent <a href="../../../w/a/m/User%7EWamper_4c05.html" title="User:Wamper">Wamper</a> 14:18, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have nevertheless tried to correct some errors and have added a number of useful references. The original entry was a blot on Wikipedia.<a href="../../../w/a/m/User%7EWamper_4c05.html" title="User:Wamper">Wamper</a> 10:34, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>On the contrary, the original entry was, although relatively new, already a good Wikipedia article and shaping up to be a great one when you and your clones came along. The article had been built up from scratch almost singlehandedly by the editor whose work you are <b>still</b> putting down and obstructing by undue use of the Wikipedia AfD process. The same editor had just been put down personally, harassed, edit-warred and generally suffered from attacks by a string of single-use accounts. What makes matters worse is the possibility that <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThedreamdied_b4b9.html" title="User:Thedreamdied">User:Thedreamdied</a> is probably a CFS patient, hampered in editing here by an intractible illness and looking forward to become a Hemispherx client if the drug is approved. As you may have noticed, all this has led to your and all of the other accounts being marked as possible sock puppets of the first abusive user. Currently you are not an editor in good standing. I could say more but I'll spend the time I intended to edit the article on bringing your recent edits up to Wikipedia standards.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nevertheless, it is good to see you doing what many thousands of dedicated editors have been doing all along: making Wikipedia great by improving articles. I hope this means that you are discovering what makes Wikipedia tick and intend to do some real editing here. If so, you are most welcome. Please remember to make sure your edits adhere to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and other rules, and only (re-)introduce disputed edits after a <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7EConsensus_8a50.html" title="WP:Consensus">consensus</a> has been reached on the talk page. If you think an article, sentence or word introduces bias, all you have to do is discuss on the talk page and where necessary use our <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">WP:DR</a> process, e.g. bringing in uninvolved editors to make sure the consensus process is working and the rules are being followed. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvb_5b28.html" title="User talk:Avb"><small>talk</small></a> 12:38, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>PS You have already demonstrated that you can initiate an AfD. Do you think you, as the nominator, are up to <b>closing</b> the AfD in keeping with the relevant rules and procedures? The result of the AfD is, obviously, a Speedy Keep. I'll also try to find an uninvolved editor with a mop but it would be simply excellent if you took up the chore. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvb_5b28.html" title="User talk:Avb"><small>talk</small></a> 12:51, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not sure its really that relevant to the article to have so much about it.

<dd>I think the fortunes of Ampligen are likely to be closely tied up with ALL the obstacles it has met on its way. So we should not forget one. But feel free to cut down the Asensio story if you think it is too wordy.<a href="../../../w/a/m/User%7EWamper_4c05.html" title="User:Wamper">Wamper</a> 10:44, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Likewise, the fortunes of Hemispherx are likely to be closely tied up with the fortunes of Ampligen. Normally I would say that a separate company article is a good idea, but I'm not so sure in this case. The story of Ampligen is the story of Hemispherx. For now I've created two Hemispherx redirect pages. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvb_5b28.html" title="User talk:Avb"><small>talk</small></a> 11:31, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps, but Hemispherx have other drugs, some of which i put on wikipedia, such as <a href="../../../a/l/f/Alferon_LDO_7f4c.html" title="Alferon LDO">Alferon LDO</a>, which are now ignored by the redirect to this article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThedreamdied_b4b9.html" title="User:Thedreamdied">Thedreamdied</a> 14:24, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Generally, if the articles on the separate products would be small, we tend to write a single article on both the company and its products, redirecting the drug names to the main article. But you're right, I thought they only had Ampligen and Ampligen-derived Oragen. Since Alferon is clearly unrelated to Ampligen, it may indeed be useful to start a separate HEB article. I think we have sufficient content regarding the drugs themselves to warrant separate articles. <a href="../../../a/v/b/User%7EAvb_3038.html" title="User:Avb">AvB</a>&#160;÷&#160;<a href="../../../a/v/b/User_talk%7EAvb_5b28.html" title="User talk:Avb"><small>talk</small></a> 14:50, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
