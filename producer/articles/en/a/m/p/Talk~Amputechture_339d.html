<p>Straight from the <a href="http://www.nastylittleman.com/Clients/marsvolta/marsvolta.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nastylittleman.com/Clients/marsvolta/marsvolta.html" rel="nofollow">official press release</a>:</p>
<p>"The resultant Amputechture, the third album by The Mars Volta, marks the first time Omar and Cedric have created a work without a single unifying narrative. The essential creative process remained the same: Omar creating the music (including the horn sections) for Cedric to lyricize—but this time with the freedom to document unrelated stories, vignettes, inside jokes, various people, events memories… All in all, Cedric likens the experience alternately to the compartmentalized episodes of Rod Serling’s NIGHT GALLERY or the disparate plotlines of David Lynch’s TWIN PEAKS: Storylines not necessarily linear or in any way connected, but all told in the same voice.</p>
<p>The Mars Volta cast that performed Amputechture will be modified for live dates that begin imminently, with drummer Jon Theodore replaced by Blake Fleming, formerly of Laddio Bolocko and Dazzling Killmen and actually the drummer who played on the very first Mars Volta demos. Pablo Hinojos-Gonzalez will expand his role, contributing both guitar and sound manipulation skills. Finally, while not a member of the touring Mars Volta band per se, Amputechture contributor John Frusciante, on the other hand, will be in close proximity, as his Red Hot Chili Peppers and The Mars Volta are scheduled to tour together through November 2006"</p>

<p>In the sleeve notes of 'Frances The Mute' it names all the companies involved with the making of the album. Under 'presented by' one of the companies is called 'Amputechture' but spelt 'Amputekthure'.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The term 'Amputechture' was coined by Jeremy Michael Ward, and used in the DitC booklet (I believe). UserGameless 19:20, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What part of "could come from the idea that the album is an "archetecture" of "phantom limbs", meaning a shedding all of the religious ideas that have been instilled, and creating a work out of it? Also, the whole album contains pieces from other TMV songs; either played backwards or just shoved in the middle (listen closely). This too, could be considered a construction of "phantom limbs". " doesn't sound like orginal research to you? -<a href="../../../1/6/9/User%7E169.199.67.9.html" title="User:169.199.67.9">169.199.67.9</a> 19:21, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why is the fact that John Frusciante tracked every guitar part omitted from the article? It was stated in a few interviews, Frusciante recorded all guitar parts, allowing Rodriguez-Lopez to act as a virtual producer. It seems to be removed from Frusciante's page as well. Both pages were correct, but now seem to have biased editing against Frusciante..</p>
<dl>
<dd>Becuase its wrong? Both Omar and Frusc are on the album. Omar plays all the solos, and anywhere the guitar needed to be doubled. (which is in most songs considering you see paul hinojos playing guitar live on all the amp songs). "The album features almost a dozen artists, including Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante who is featured as guest guitarist on every track except Asilos Magdelena." is right there in the article, and frusc is in the personnel section, no one is biased against him. In addition omar plays all of asilos by himself. See below. <a href="../../../z/o/p/User%7EZopwx2_0a06.html" title="User:Zopwx2">Zopwx2</a> 18:55, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, labeling him a 'guest guitarist' leads one to believe his role is much more minor than it actually was. Both the Amputechture and John Frusciante articles previously stated his involvement as being major, taking the place of primary guitarist for the band after Omar already wrote the music. Pictures of Omar showing Frusciante what to play have surfaced on the internet. I'm not sure what information is correct as I only believe his involvement is more major than is led on because of previous versions of these Wikipedia pages. Apparently however, Wikipedia is either unreliable, inconsistent, or just plain wrong as you stated.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I got rid of the phrase "guest guitarist". But I think whoever wrote it orignally meant to say that he does indeed play a significant part on the album, but he is not a member of the touring band. Not that his role was minor or anything. Not to mention I believe it was taken from the GSL press release anyway. Although the idea that omar just sat back and taught frusciante to play the entire album and recorded it is incorrect. They both played together.<a href="../../../z/o/p/User%7EZopwx2_0a06.html" title="User:Zopwx2">Zopwx2</a> 15:16, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I believe he played on every track, including Asilos. Any reference to say that this isn't true?</p>
<dl>
<dd>He didn't play on Asilos. It was just Cedric and Omar, and Omar did the acoustic. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanbekEsen_a780.html" title="User:CanbekEsen">CanbekEsen</a> 21:18, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Asilos is not a single, and the article only seems to exist to showcase one person's interpretation of its meaning.</p>
<dl>
<dd>- Agreed, the asilos article could be deleted really, its personal interpretation and unsourced info. As the rest of each track on the album doesn't have an article either, I think that this one could be deleted. At least, the asilos article should not be merged with this. If we vote on this I vote to delete the asilos article and not merge it with this.
<dl>
<dd>I only put a merger up becuase the author kept removing the delete notice. Almost all the info is redundant and/or unsourced info so it won't make it here anyway.</dd>

<p>Does he participate on the record? Miscellanea seems to claim so, but he is not listed under personnel or mentioned in the album sleeves.</p>

<p>This article says Amputechture has gone platinum. Is there a source?</p>
<dl>
<dd>-Seemingly not. I noticed this was sourceless but didn't do anything about it, because I had the feeling it was one of those things that some guy would keep on readding. I have my doubts its gone platinum... I think it would have gone gold at the very most.
