<p>Some editors have proposed a general rename of articles named with the pattern "FOO programming language" to the pattern "FOO (programming language)". Please note that this poll only is applicable to those programming languages whose names alone would introduce ambiguity. For example, programming languages such as <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java.html" title="Java">Java</a> and <a href="../../../c/_/_/C.html" title="C">C</a> , whose names alone are ambiguous, would be at <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java_%28programming_language%29.html" title="Java (programming language)">Java (programming language)</a> and <a href="../../../c/_/%28/C_%28programming_language%29.html" title="C (programming language)">C (programming language)</a>, respectively. Unique names such as <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortran.html" title="Fortran">Fortran</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/b/COBOL_14eb.html" title="COBOL">COBOL</a>, should remain at their respective simple names.</p>

<ul>
<li><s>Abstain</s> <b>Support</b> - I initially abstained because I just wanted to get a procedure rolling. Looking at the first few comment, I support the rename. As with other editor, I only want this where ambiguity exists in the name: e.g. for "Python" but not for "Perl". Also, something like "Python programming language" would still redirect to "Python (programming language)" under the proposal, so existing links would not break. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 22:32, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> - However, I would object to specifying "programming language" anywhere in the title, as parenthetic remark or not, if the name of the language itself does not have any ambiguity issues. For example <a href="../../../c/_/p/C_programming_language.html" title="C programming language">C programming language</a> should change to <a href="../../../c/_/%28/C_%28programming_language%29.html" title="C (programming language)">C (programming language)</a> (since <a href="../../../c/_/_/C.html" title="C">C</a> is already taken), but <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortran.html" title="Fortran">Fortran</a> should stay at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fortran.html" title="Fortran">Fortran</a>. --<a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerge_Issakov_7435.html" title="User:Serge Issakov">Serge</a> 23:24, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> - originator of the request; it would also meet the common names policy and also meet the disambiguation guideline. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtanamir_d95f.html" title="User:Atanamir">atanamir</a> 23:32, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b>. The convention has been "&lt;name of language&gt; programming language" for quite a while and I don't think it helps by changing it now. There are already redirects in place for "&lt;name&gt; (programming language)" and it would only add more work to move them all there. Also, it goes against conventions in other media. In books related to programming on the copyright page where it sometimes has sorting information for the book many books say "Computers &amp; Internet - &lt;name&gt; programming language I. Title" or something similar. - <a href="../../../d/n/e/User%7EDNewhall_a69a.html" title="User:DNewhall">DNewhall</a> 23:32, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b>. To quote <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a>, "When there is another word (such as <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheque.html" title="Cheque">Cheque</a> instead of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Check.html" title="Check">Check</a>) or more complete name that is equally clear (such as <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titan_rocket.html" title="Titan rocket">Titan rocket</a>), that should be used.". It is undeniable that the "C programming language" is a widely-understood name, not just a description. There's a reason K&amp;R's book is called <i>The C Programming Language</i> rather than <i>C, a Programming Language</i>. Diverse examples from other areas include <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French language</a>, <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titan_rocket.html" title="Titan rocket">Titan rocket</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/i/Sticking_plaster.html" title="Sticking plaster">sticking plaster</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bread_roll.html" title="Bread roll">bread roll</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contract_bridge.html" title="Contract bridge">contract bridge</a>. What makes programming languages different from these topics? <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 23:44, 1 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If those articles were named like the programming languages are currently, they would have been something like sticking plaster dressing, bread roll food, and contract bridge card game. <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titan_rocket.html" title="Titan rocket">Titan rocket</a>, in fact, is a redirect to <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titan_%28rocket_family%29.html" title="Titan (rocket family)">Titan (rocket family)</a>. The natural languages are a slightly odd exception to the normal convention, but i'm not a linguist, and not about to argue with them. (I do know, however, that many non-English Wikipedias use the normal (parenthesized) disambiguation convention for natural languages.) --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiet_Delport_08f7.html" title="User:Piet Delport">Piet Delport</a> 13:40, 2 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Apologies for the bad example - <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titan_rocket.html" title="Titan rocket">Titan rocket</a> was moved since it turned out to be a rocket family, but others such as <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angara_rocket.html" title="Angara rocket">Angara rocket</a> were not. The controlling question here is whether "C programming language" is a "more complete name" for C. I argue that it is, and so standing guidelines strongly support the current name. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 10:12, 3 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would argue that isn't. You can say "I play <i>contract bridge</i>" and "I use <i>C</i>", but not "I use <i>C programming language</i>". You can expand the names into noun phrases, as in "I play <i>the contract bridge card game</i>" and "I use <i>the C programming language</i>", but in both cases "<i>the * card game</i>" and "<i>the * programming language</i>" are not part of the name itself, anymore. --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiet_Delport_08f7.html" title="User:Piet Delport">Piet Delport</a> 06:04, 4 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The presence or absence of a leading article is not a reliable indicator of whether it's a name or not, as indicated by <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_language.html" title="French language">French language</a>, unless you wish to expand this proposal to move X language -&gt; X (language) as well. <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 06:28, 4 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Definitely not something i'm interested in pursuing; let the linguists and editors involved with natural languages worry about their own naming convention. --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiet_Delport_08f7.html" title="User:Piet Delport">Piet Delport</a> 12:09, 4 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>(I know I am commenting on a now old post, but...) My take on "French language" is that it's different from "C programming language" since French is the language of the French. However, "C" is not a language named after a culture, country, or people (or anything). "C" only refers to C; "French" refers to a whole lot more than a language. Also, "French" is descriptive, but "C" is not. There's no need to clarify "C" or let it modify a noun. But being that a one letter name for something is inherently ambiguous, as well as names such as "Java" or "Python" (as already mentioned), there needs to be the parenthetical, "(programming language)".</li>

<li><b>Support</b> - this is the standard way that most Wikipedia articles are named. Use the common name and disambiguate appropriately using parentheses when necessary. --<a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolaron_cd38.html" title="User:Polaron">Polaron</a> | <a href="../../../p/o/l/User_talk%7EPolaron_e6b4.html" title="User talk:Polaron">Talk</a> 01:43, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> - For the same reasons as DNewhall. Chris Burrows 02:11, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> — Per Deco, I don't see how adding parentheses to an article title which is already clear is an improvement. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraig_Stuntz_f2ad.html" title="User:Craig Stuntz">Craig Stuntz</a> 02:47, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> -- Crypotography has had much the same problem for some time. It has adopted the "&lt;topic&gt; (cryptography)" approach which has worked well. Not elegant perhaps, but ... <a href="../../../w/w/_/User%7EWw_6383.html" title="User:Ww">ww</a> 05:20, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> — Either way, there should be a second link so that <i>both</i> "C (programming language)" and "C programming langage" produce the C article. My main reason for opposing is that it isn't really consistent with the new "C programming language, criticism" page that was spun off the main C article; what would that name turn into? By the way, the official standard name is "programming language C", but to me that sounds too much like "PL/C" which would be wrong. Deco's remark is quite right. — DAGwyn 07:56, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. This proposal is different from the original proposal, found <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_b869.html#Proposal:_parentheses_for_programming_and_other_languages" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions">here</a>, which is now understood as having unanimous consensus in favour. Please do not interfere with the original proposition by misrepresenting it and opening a straw poll here, which can only serve to undermine the usefulness of the original proposal. It would have been much better to simply post a link. - <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamsara_87dc.html" title="User:Samsara">Samsara</a> (<a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamsara_83cc.html" title="User talk:Samsara">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Samsara_6f94.html" title="Special:Contributions/Samsara">contribs</a>) 09:40, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The original proposal seems pretty wacko to me, and I don't see any evidence of a consensus. As I understand it, this current section is <i>not</i> a "straw poll", but a genuine attempt to determine whether or not to move the C article to a new name, independently of whether that wacko proposal is accepted. — DAGwyn 09:53, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b> - As per Deco, if syntactically correct name is enough for disambiguation, it should be preferred. And also, without parentheses it's more pythonic (readability counts). <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamohyl_Jan_6337.html" title="User:Samohyl Jan">Samohyl Jan</a> 10:24, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Support</b>. <s>Those opposing often</s> Some of those opposing assume that the poll is about deleting the "X programming languages" links - this is not correct.

Also, most books about programming languages simply have the title or common name of the programming language as the title of the book -- the Wrox series uses "Professional PHP" or "professional Java", not "professional PHP programming language" or "professional Java programming langauge". Many of the books I have also have the sorting information as "Computers -- Programming languages -- X," where X is the programming language. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtanamir_d95f.html" title="User:Atanamir">atanamir</a> 23:36, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The main issue is not that I'm afraid of the work but that it'll be a lot of work with next to no perceived benefit. Both "Euphoria programming language" and "Euphoria (programming language)" go to the same page and I (and others apparently) fail to see how that is an improvement over the current convention. The text is exactly the same, you're just adding parentheses. No one is going to get confused about the lack of parentheses (also remember that the names with parentheses already have redirects in place). Is "&lt;name&gt; (programming language)" a more correct title for the article? Arguably. Is it worth the effort of moving all the pages over from their perfectly understandable title to a title that already has a redirect in place for it? No. - <a href="../../../d/n/e/User%7EDNewhall_a69a.html" title="User:DNewhall">DNewhall</a> 16:10, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you misunderstand the point of stylistic consistency on Wikipedia. Any one article in isolation would be fine under either convention; in fact, if the project was only the one article on, e.g. "C programming language" there would <i>be no</i> contrast with all the other uses of parens for disambiguation. But if WP (or some subset) was prepared for print or other syndication, having relatively consistent stylistic choices helps a lot (article naming is, of course, just one small issue among many others, of course). The work involved in a rename would, obviously, be a tiny fraction of the work involved in discussing the question, so that is "vanishingly insignificant". <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 16:42, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Imagine if you have a set of objects which all fall under the same category -- let's say they're all different types of Widgets. The types are Alboo, Kabloo, Hello, Wawoob, Baboon, Choogoo, Chimpanzee, etc. Because some will cause ambiguity -- Hello, Baboon, and Chimpanzee -- they need to be disambiguated. However, since the common name (in this case, the real name) is "Hello," "Baboon," and "Chimpanzee," wikipedia has an established precedent of using parentheses. Thus, the unique widgets, Alboo, Kabloo, Wawoob, Coogoo, can have articles simply at the name itself; but the ambiguous names should have articles at <b>Hello (widget)</b>, <b>Baboon (widget)</b>, and <b>Chimpanzee (widget)</b>. Thus, the article titles will be uniform in that they are all "at" the name itself, but with a disambiguator on several of them. This is easier than making all of the articles at <b>Alboo widget</b>, <b>Kabloo widget</b>, <b>Hello widget</b>, etc. Also, it allows for the pipe trick, so links can easily be made with <b>[[Hello (widget)|]]</b> --&gt; <b>Hello</b>. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtanamir_d95f.html" title="User:Atanamir">atanamir</a> 23:54, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>an example of this that's currently on wikipedia is colours. Some colours, such as <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blue.html" title="Blue">Blue</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brown.html" title="Brown">Brown</a>, and <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red.html" title="Red">Red</a> are at their articles, but colours like <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orange_%28color%29.html" title="Orange (color)">Orange (color)</a> need the disambiguation part on them. It isn't at Orange color, althouh there is a redirect -- we can do the same thing with redirects. <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtanamir_d95f.html" title="User:Atanamir">atanamir</a> 23:57, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>also, your examples -- <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titan_rocket.html" title="Titan rocket">Titan rocket</a> is a redirect for <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titan_%28rocket_family%29.html" title="Titan (rocket family)">Titan (rocket family)</a>.

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../t/i/t/Titan_rocket.html" title="Titan rocket">Titan rocket</a> may now be a redirect, since it turned out to be a family of rockets rather than a single rocket, but there are still many rockets named that way (e.g. <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angara_rocket.html" title="Angara rocket">Angara rocket</a>) and it's still cited on <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:Disambiguation</a> specifically. The miniscule convenience of the pipe trick is not a reason for anything. My point is that this is a much wider concern than programming languages alone and represents a significant departure from the disambiguation guidelines. It would be radical to make such changes in a single area without raising them to the wider community, when your argument seems to apply to everything. The point of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contract_bridge.html" title="Contract bridge">contract bridge</a> and <a href="../../../b/r/e/Bread_roll.html" title="Bread roll">bread roll</a> is that the more common names for these topics are "bridge" and "roll". <a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeco_20f6.html" title="User:Deco">Deco</a> 07:48, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The C criticism article was split off from the main C article, where it had previously been embedded, in response to a requirement in order for the main C article to be designated a "Good Article".

<dd>You also received feedback to the effect that criticism doesn't have to be negative, that the article is fairly balanced, and that a list of limitations has to seem somewhat negative no matter how well-intentioned it may be. The C criticisms article is not at all a complete analysis of the language, just a description of the many characteristics of C that have drawn reasonable criticism. Since C is so popular and wide-spread, it is a target for a lot of sniping and second-guessing, and it is undeniable that that has happened, which is part of what the C criticism article specifically addresses. One of the useful functions of the C criticism page is to bring some balance to that criticism. — DAGwyn 20:20, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I also responded to that comment by saying (and I'll repeat the comment here for the benefit of readers of this page) that the term "criticism" still has primarily a negative connotation and that because of this it is an undesirable term.
