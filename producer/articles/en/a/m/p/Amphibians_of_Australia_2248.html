<p>The Australian continent once formed part of the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supercontinent.html" title="Supercontinent">Supercontinent</a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/Pangaea.html" title="Pangaea">Pangaea</a>, which split into <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gondwana.html" title="Gondwana">Gondwana</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laurasia.html" title="Laurasia">Laurasia</a> approximately 180 million years ago. The earliest true frog fossil, <i><a href="../../../v/i/e/Vieraella.html" title="Vieraella">Vieraella herbsti</a></i>, is dated between 188 and 213 million years old.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> This predates the splitting of Gondwana, and has resulted in frogs present on all continents.</p>
<p>The first two continents to split from Australia were South America and Africa. The amphibian fauna of both these continents are varied due to collisions with Laurasian continents. However, the South African family <a href="../../../h/e/l/Heleophrynidae.html" title="Heleophrynidae">Heleophrynidae</a>, and the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_American_1d95.html" title="South American">South American</a> family <a href="../../../l/e/p/Leptodactylidae.html" title="Leptodactylidae">Leptodactylidae</a>, are both closely related to <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myobatrachidae.html" title="Myobatrachidae">Myobatrachidae</a>, an Australian family of ground dwelling frogs.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>Fossil data suggests the <a href="../../../t/r/e/Tree_frog.html" title="Tree frog">tree frogs</a>, of the family Hylidae, originated in South America after its separation from Africa. Outside Australia, tree frogs are wide-spread throughout much of <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_America_9663.html" title="South America">South America</a>, <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a> and Asia. Tree frogs presumably migrated to Australia via Antarctica. Similarities in <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanosome.html" title="Melanosome">melanosomes</a> between some <a href="../../../l/i/t/Litoria.html" title="Litoria">Litoria</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/y/Phyllomedusa.html" title="Phyllomedusa">Phyllomedusa</a> suggests a relationship between the South American and Australian tree frogs, however <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immunology.html" title="Immunology">immunological</a> evidence suggests an early <a href="../../../d/i/v/Divergent_evolution.html" title="Divergent evolution">divergence</a> between the families. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>India, Madagascar and Seychelles split from Gondwana approximately 130 million years ago. The family <a href="../../../s/o/o/Sooglossidae.html" title="Sooglossidae">Sooglossidae</a> is native to both India and the Seychelles, and is considered a <a href="../../../c/l/a/Cladistics.html" title="Cladistics">sister taxon</a> to Myobatrachidae. <a href="../../../s/o/o/Sooglossidae.html" title="Sooglossidae">Sooglossidae</a> is more closely related to Myobatrachidae than the African or South American families.</p>
<p>Australia and <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Guinea_eecc.html" title="New Guinea">New Guinea</a> are the two major land masses which make up the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_%28continent%29.html" title="Australia (continent)">Australian continent</a>. During its history, there have been many land connections between New Guinea and Australia. The most recent of which severed 10,000 years ago during the transition from a <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glacial_period.html" title="Glacial period">glacial period</a> to the current <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interglacials.html" title="Interglacials">interglacial period</a>. The result of this recent land connection on the Australian amphibian fauna has been the swapping of species, and even families. The origin of the frog species found on both land masses can be determined by their distributions. It is likely that <a href="../../../w/h/i/White%27s_Tree_Frog_db37.html" title="White's Tree Frog">White's Tree Frog</a> (<i>Litoria caerulea</i>) migrated from Australia to New Guinea, as it is wide-spread in Australia and only inhabits small areas within New Guinea. Whereas the <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giant_Tree_Frog_3751.html" title="Giant Tree Frog">Giant Tree Frog</a> (<i>Litoria infrafrenata</i>) is likely from New Guinea, as it is widespread in New Guinea, and only inhabits the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cape_York_Peninsula_04d8.html" title="Cape York Peninsula">Cape York Peninsula</a> in Australia. The single <i>Nyctimystes</i> species in Australia is another example of genus swapping that occurred between New Guinea and Australia.</p>
<p>There are two families which are widely distributed throughout the northern hemisphere which only inhabit far northern Australia. These are <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microhylidae.html" title="Microhylidae">Microhylidae</a> and the <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ranidae.html" title="Ranidae">Ranidae</a>. Two of the fifty-nine genera of Microhylidae, and only one of approximately 750 species of Ranidae are native to Australia. Although both these families are widely distributed throughout the world, they have only recently reached Australia and New Guinea. This is because the Australian continent has remained isolated since its separation from Antarctica, and as it has drifted north towards <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a>, many species have been able to cross into New Guinea, and eventually Australia. However, most of the <a href="../../../e/c/o/Ecological_niche.html" title="Ecological niche">ecological niches</a> filled by frogs had been filled before the Ranids and Microhylids reached Australia, so only a limited number of species have established.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/p/Amphibians_of_Australia_2248.html" title="Edit section: Distribution">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Distribution</span></h2>
<p>The distribution of Australian frogs is largely influenced by climate. The areas of largest biodiversity occur in the tropical and temperate zones of northern and eastern Australia. <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arid.html" title="Arid">Arid</a> areas have restricted amphibian biodiversity, as frogs generally require water to breed. Many Australian frog species have adapted to deal with the harsh conditions of their habitat. Many species, such as those of the genus <a href="../../../c/y/c/Cyclorana.html" title="Cyclorana">Cyclorana</a>, burrow underground to avoid heat and prolonged drought conditions. Tadpole and egg development of frogs from arid regions differs from those from higher rainfall regions. Some species, such as those of the <i><a href="../../../c/y/c/Cyclorana.html" title="Cyclorana">Cyclorana</a></i> genus and other desert dwelling species have relatively short tadpole development periods. These species often breed in temporary, shallow pools where the high water temperature speeds up tadpole development. Tadpoles that live in such pools can complete development within a month. On the other hand, species such as those in the <i><a href="../../../m/i/x/Mixophyes.html" title="Mixophyes">Mixophyes</a></i> genus live in areas of high rainfall. Metamorphosis of <i>Mixophyes</i> tadpoles may take as long as fifteen months. The <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandhill_Frog_f8ef.html" title="Sandhill Frog">Sandhill Frog</a> (<i>Arenophryne rotunda</i>) lives in sand dunes between <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shark_Bay_79e5.html" title="Shark Bay">Shark Bay</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kalbarri_National_Park_a672.html" title="Kalbarri National Park">Kalbarri National Park</a> in <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_Australia_84d0.html" title="Western Australia">Western Australia</a>. This area has very little free-standing water and therefore this species has adapted another way of tadpole development. Sandhill Frogs lay their eggs under the sand and the tadpoles develop into frogs entirely within the egg. This adaptation allows them to breed with the absence of water.</p>
<p>There are large variety of habitats inhabited by Australian frogs. Variations in rainfall, temperature, altitude and latitude have resulted in a large number of habitats in Australia, most of which are inhabited by frogs. In the <a href="../../../n/u/l/Nullarbor_Plain_095e.html" title="Nullarbor Plain">Nullarbor Plain</a>, daytime temperatures can reach 48.5 °C nights can have freezing condition and rainfall is less than 200mm per year. These factors make it very difficult for frogs to survive, and few species are found in this area.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>During the 1980s, population declines were reported in Australian frog species. Many of the frogs that were reported as declining were high altitude, creek dwelling species that had little or no contact with human activities. This indicated that habitat loss and degradation were not responsible for all the declines. The causes for the dramatic declines is unknown but the <a href="../../../c/h/y/Chytrid.html" title="Chytrid">chytrid</a> fungus may be a factor.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup> In some cases entire genera were found declining. Both species of <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gastric_brooding_frog.html" title="Gastric brooding frog">gastric brooding frog</a> are now classified as extinct and all but two species of <i><a href="../../../t/a/u/Taudactylus.html" title="Taudactylus">Taudactylus</a></i> are critically endangered (<i>Taudactylus diurnus</i> is classified as extinct and <i>Taudactylus liemi</i> is classified as near threatened). Every species in the <i><a href="../../../p/h/i/Philoria.html" title="Philoria">Philoria</a></i> genus are currently declining <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[7]</a></sup> and some species in the "Torrent Frog" complex (<i>Litoria nannotis</i>, <i><a href="../../../l/i/t/Litoria_lorica.html" title="Litoria lorica">Litoria lorica</a></i>, <i>Litoria nyakalensis</i> and <i>Litoria rheocola</i>) have not been located for a number of years. Currently three Australian species of frog are classified as extinct, 14 listed as critically endangered and 18 listed as endangered. Of the 14 critically endangered species 4 of them haven't been recorded for over 15 years and may now be extinct.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Prior to the large scale declines of the 1980s, habitat destruction was the major threat to Australian frog species.<sup id="_ref-Tyler_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Tyler" title="">[9]</a></sup> For example, the decline of the <a href="../../../g/i/a/Giant_Burrowing_Frog_bb6b.html" title="Giant Burrowing Frog">Giant Burrowing Frog</a> (<i>Heleioporus australiacus</i>) was mostly attributed to human induced habitat destruction, such as land clearing for housing or agriculture and high intensity fires.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[10]</a></sup> The distribution of the Giant Burrowing Frog included Sydney, and therefore, large populations were destroyed.</p>

<p>The Australian frog fauna consists of four native families, and one introduced family. The sole species of frog introduced to Australia which has <a href="../../../n/a/t/Naturalisation_%28biology%29.html" title="Naturalisation (biology)">naturalised</a>, is the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cane_Toad_c870.html" title="Cane Toad">Cane Toad</a> (<i>Bufo marinus</i>), of the family <a href="../../../b/u/f/Bufonidae.html" title="Bufonidae">Bufonidae</a>. The Cane Toad was introduced to several locations throughout <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queensland.html" title="Queensland">Queensland</a>, and has since spread west and south.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../t/r/e/Tree_frog.html" title="Tree frog">tree frogs</a>, of the family <a href="../../../h/y/l/Hylidae.html" title="Hylidae">Hylidae</a>, are one of the major families in Australia, with over 70 species. The tree frogs are split into three genera: <i><a href="../../../c/y/c/Cyclorana.html" title="Cyclorana">Cyclorana</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../l/i/t/Litoria.html" title="Litoria">Litoria</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../n/y/c/Nyctimystes.html" title="Nyctimystes">Nyctimystes</a></i>. The tree frogs of Australia have various habits, from completely arboreal to fossorial.</p>
<p>The other major family native to Australia is <a href="../../../m/y/o/Myobatrachidae.html" title="Myobatrachidae">Myobatrachidae</a>, consisting of 20 genera and over 100 species. Myobatrachidae is endemic to Australia, New Guinea and a few small islands, however the highest diversity can be found in Australia.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/i/c/Microhylidae.html" title="Microhylidae">Microhylidae</a> and <a href="../../../r/a/n/Ranidae.html" title="Ranidae">Ranidae</a> make up a small amount of the Australian frog fauna, with less than 20 species in Microhylidae and one species of Ranidae. The majority of the species within these families are found throughout the world, with Australia making up a small portion of their diversity.</p>
