<p>We've mainly used DANFS for assigning AKA/LKA ships to classes. We've got nice templates to put at the bottom of articles of ships in each class (and this article, too). I've just vetted the templates, and unless I missed something, they conform exactly to the classes as listed in the articles on their individual ships.</p>
<p>We all know that DANFS, as wonderful as it is, contains a reasonable number of errors. There are four AKA's that I believe to be listed in the wrong class. I'll post my reasoning here, and wait for comments before making any changes:</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Duplin_%28AKA-87%29_0d9f.html" title="USS Duplin (AKA-87)">Duplin</a></i> is listed by DANFS and Wikipedia as Achernar class, but I think it should be Tolland class, for the following reasons: There are no other ships listed in the Achernar class. Achernar is listed as Andromeda class, and like all the other Andromedas was built at Federal in Kearny, and shows a C2-S-B1 hull. Duplin was built at North Carolina and shows a C2-S-AJ3 hull. All the others like this are Tolland class. Except for <i>Duplin</i> and the two ships below (both probably listed incorrectly), North Carolina only built Tolland class ships.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Ottawa_%28AKA-101%29_4dd1.html" title="USS Ottawa (AKA-101)">Ottawa</a></i> is listed as Andromeda class, but I think it should be Tolland class, because: All the other Andromedas were built at Federal in Kearny, and show C2-S-B1 hulls. <i>Ottawa</i> was built at North Carolina and shows C2-S-AJ3 hull. Except for these three questionable ships, North Carolina only built Tolland class ships.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Skagit_%28AKA-105%29_129a.html" title="USS Skagit (AKA-105)">Skagit</a></i> is in the identical situation to <i>Ottawa</i>.</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../u/s/s/USS_Oberon_%28AKA-14%29_963f.html" title="USS Oberon (AKA-14)">Oberon</a></i> is listed by DANFS and Wikipedia as Libra class. I can find no other mention of that class, though Oberon, Libra, and Titania have a lot in common, and are the only AKAs to be built on C2-F hulls. Libra and Titania are listed as Arcturus class. Unless we find that there actually <i>was</i> a Libra class, I think that <i>Oberon</i> should be listed as Arcturus class. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 14:14, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, but I don't have a whole lot of input. I did want to let you know that I've read this and your reasoning seems quite... reasonable!</dd>
<dd>I do have another issue that I'd like to get your input on, since you have worked so hard on the AKA pages. As you may know, I'm deeply involved in categorization of ships. I've begun to work on the AKAs, and I had been classifying them as amphibious warfare vessels. However, many served in more auxiliary roles, and I was wondering whether you feel they should be classified under "auxiliary ships" or "amphibious warfare vessels." I'd rather not do both, but am certainly capable of doing so. My issue with doing both stems from the current "list both the country and the navy" compromise. If I categorize them as both it adds two cats per article, which starts to look a little overwhelming. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 17:41, 22 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Total tangent, but if you want category over load, try <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Clarke_996d.html#References" title="Bobby Clarke">this article</a>. --<a href="../../../j/_/c/User%7EJ_Clear_e227.html" title="User:J Clear">J Clear</a> 04:04, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've been thinking about this, too, but I'm not 100% ready with a recommendation. When a ship is designated AKA or LKA, it is definitely an amphibious ship. It has been specially converted to go into combat zones, and is definitely a fighting-type ship. In the early days, however, 20 of the AKA's had been designated AK's, with different hull numbers than they had as AKA's. An AK is definitely an auxiliary, and though it may have a gun or two, it is basically not intended to go into harm's way.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think there's a list of the WWII AK's in the Auxiliary Ships category. If there isn't, there should be, because those ships existed. I believe, but I'm not sure, there were many more AK's than the ones that were converted to AKA's. A thing I want to do for the 20 converted AK's is to make redirect pages from their original AK designations to their AKA pages. (With maybe one or two exceptions, all these ships did a lot more as AKA's, and spent more time as AKA's, than they did as AK's, so there's a lot of justification for having their main articles under their AKA designations.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm also planning to revisit the articles for the 20 AK-to-AKA ships and make sure that the conversion is properly covered.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The whole business of designations and classes for AKA's is somewhat confused and confusing. Some of the DANFS info is wrong, other info conflicts, and of course all of the ships were long ago converted to razor blades. But it's a matter of pride for me to get the best available info and put it into Wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELou_Sander_c859.html" title="User:Lou Sander">Lou Sander</a> 21:05, 22 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Working from <i>Warships of the World: Victory Edition</i> from Cornell Maritime Press, 1946 (only wrong on some ships which ended up being cancelled) I'd concur with all of Lou Sander's suggestions. It makes any casual or serious observer's finding of vessels easier. It would probably be in the interests of all if the Maritime Commission types are listed and articles started. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarlsbottom_853c.html" title="User:Harlsbottom">Harlsbottom</a> 01:21, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
