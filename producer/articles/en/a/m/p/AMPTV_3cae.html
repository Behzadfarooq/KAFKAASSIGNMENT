<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/p/AMPTV_3cae.html" title="Edit section: 1956 to 1990">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1956 to 1990</span></h2>
<p>Armenia Public Television dates back to September 5, 1995 when the <a href="../../../s/o/v/Sovnarkom.html" title="Sovnarkom">USSR Council of Ministers</a> made a decision to construct 27 program centers and 5 broadcasting stations in the Union Republics. On 29 November 1956, the date of Sovietization of Armenia, the first program of the Armenian television was broadcasted.</p>
<p>The official opening of the Armenian television took place on February 9, 1957; this was also the commencement date for regular programs.</p>
<p>On August 6, 1957 the first news program was broadcasted, "News of the Week", which was not periodical at first; only starting from February 1958 the "News" program became periodical. The news editorial office was also created at that time.</p>
<p>On October 13, 1957 a State Committee on Radio and TV Programs of the Council of Ministers of <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_SSR_cc70.html" title="Armenian SSR">Armenian SSR</a> was formed. In February 1967 Armenian television celebrated its 10th anniversary. During those years the television already proved its leading position.</p>
<p>According to the decree of USSR Supreme Council issued in December 1970, The State Committee on <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcasting.html" title="Broadcasting">Radio broadcasting</a> and TV was renamed into the All-Union Republican State Committee on TV and Radio Broadcasting.</p>
<p>On March 17, 1973 the TV invites for <a href="../../../l/i/f/Lifetime_employment.html" title="Lifetime employment">permanent employment</a> the engineers of the color mobile station, <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">TV production</a> laboratory, <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video.html" title="Video">video recording</a> units. Preparations for color broadcasting have begun.</p>
<p>The May 1 Parade of 1973 from Lenin Square had been broadcasted in color. Initially, the color programs were broadcasted only from the mobile station, from the large celebrations, concerts, sport events of the country. Starting from 1978 about 50 percent of the programs of the first and the second Armenian channels were in color. Starting from August 1973, the first video recordings were broadcasted, which made 70 percent of the programs in 1978.</p>
<p>On November 29, 1977 a new 311.7 meter high <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_masts_and_towers.html" title="Radio masts and towers">TV tower</a> was launched as well as "Orbita-2" - a space communication station, which allowed to receive the second program of the Central television from Moscow. The average daily length of programs broadcasted by Armenian television reached 12 hours, of which 2.5 hours in color, including4 hours 35 minutes of own programs. 96 percent of the population watched the first program, 55 percent watched the second program. In 1978 it became possible to see also the fourth channel of the Central television in Armenia.</p>

<p>The political powers have changed in 1990, and according to the prime minister Vazgen Manukyan's decision, in September 1990 the newly appointed head of the State department of TV and Radio programs was not a communist, Doctor of Arts, Henrik Hovhannisyan. He started the reformation of the Armenian TV, both content wise and structure wise; those changes were called to comply with the current situation: Kharabagh Freedom movement, breakdown of USSR, declaration of independence.</p>
<p>Armenia was announced a free, independent and self-governing Republic on September 21, 1991. A month later, the president of the country signed the RA Law "On Mass Media". For the first time in Armenia the information system had an opportunity to develop in a free and favorable environment. <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_speech.html" title="Freedom of speech">The freedom of speech</a> and purely national propaganda were predominant for the Armenian television.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crisis_%28economic%29.html" title="Crisis (economic)">economic crisis</a> of the country seriously influenced the functioning of the National television. The capacities are significantly cut, the quantity of viewers decreases. According to the data of November-December 1993, the statistical TV audience is 27,4 percent.</p>
<p>In November 1996 the 40th anniversary of the Armenian television was celebrated with festivities. The national television continued to preserve with great difficulty what has been created during the former years. The bulk of the programs were entertainment, joke programs.</p>
<p>In 1996 the second channel of the Armenian television separated and became a separate program. Robert Mavisakalyan was appointed director of "Nork" television. Within a short period of time "Nork" was able to attract the attention of the bulk of the audience.</p>
<p>According to the Law of the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenia.html" title="Armenia">Republic of Armenia</a> "On Television and Radio" in force from 2000, the Public television shall start broadcasting all of its programs, films in Armenian starting from January 1, 2005. The Public television started working on the process of translating into Armenian all of the programs even before the law was adopted. A translation studio equipped with special acoustic and film cutting equipment was created.</p>
<p>New roads and prospects opened for the Armenian Public Television in 2005. As a result of hard work The Armenian Public Television and Radio were recognized full and equal members of the European Broadcasting Union at the 56th General Assembly of the European Broadcasting Union held in Dubrovnik in July 7, 8.</p>
<p>Becoming an Active Member of the European Broadcasting Union, Armenia gained the right to take part in "Eurovision" Song Contest, which during the 50 years had already become a favorite event for the Europeans.</p>
<p>In the result of the competitions held in the Republic, Andre gained the right to take part in "Eurovision – 2006" in Athens. The latter was recognized the "Best Singer of the Year" in National Music Awards during the previous two years.</p>
