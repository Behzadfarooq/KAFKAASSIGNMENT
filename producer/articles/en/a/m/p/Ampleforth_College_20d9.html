<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/p/Ampleforth_College_20d9.html" title="Edit section: Overview">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Overview</span></h2>
<p>The school's primary concern is to educate its pupils in the principles of the Catholic faith whilst providing a thorough and broad-based education. It is notable that its academic admissions policy isn't as academically exacting as that exercised by some other English <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_school.html" title="Public school">public schools</a>. As a result, the school is typically between 150 - 200 in the annual league tables of public examination results, although it was ranked 6th nationally in the 2004 "value added" table. The school's administration claims that by looking at the top 50% of candidates (those who would probably have been able to get into more selective schools had they wanted to) the school's teaching appears to score just as well as, if not better than, other famous English public schools. It maintains a strong scholarship set, with about 8% of pupils gaining the offer of a place at Oxford or Cambridge; over 90% go on to university.</p>
<p>There is a famous anecdote of Fr Paul Neville, the school's headmaster in the 1940s, boasting of record offers from Oxford to a prospective parent. "And what of those boys who don't go to Oxford?" replied the parent. "Oh, they run the companies that employ the boys who do," replied Fr Paul.</p>
<p><br />
As a result of the school's association with the monks, religion is central to the life of the school. All pupils are expected to take religious education at <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education_aa53.html" title="General Certificate of Secondary Education">GCSE</a> level. <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_%28liturgy%29.html" title="Mass (liturgy)">Mass</a> is attended by all pupils twice a week, once on a weekday in the house, and once on Sunday in the Abbey Church.</p>
<p>The school has an excellent choir, the Schola Cantorum, which sings at High Mass on Sunday and also at a choral Mass on Friday nights during term time. The choir has made various recordings, broadcasts and tours throughout the world. There is also now a girls choir, Schola Puellarum, which was recently noted in both newspaper and magazine. They sing a service every Friday, and they frequently join the boys singing high mass on Sunday. They recently went on a tour to Dublin, and sang in many of the well-known churches there.</p>
<p>Though originally only a boys' school, over recent years the school has moved from accepting day girls in the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixth_form.html" title="Sixth form">sixth form</a> to the present situation with girls throughout the school.</p>
<p>The school is arranged into <a href="../../../b/o/a/Boarding_house.html" title="Boarding house">houses</a>, with pupils living in the separate houses, eating together as a house and playing sport together as a house in inter-house competitions. There are currently ten houses, each named after a saint: <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Aidan_fe56.html" title="St Aidan">St Aidan</a>'s, <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Bede_2fed.html" title="St Bede">St Bede</a>'s, <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Cuthbert_c622.html" title="St Cuthbert">St Cuthbert</a>'s, <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Dunstan_44b8.html" title="St Dunstan">St Dunstan</a>'s, <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Edward_6dd8.html" title="St Edward">St Edward</a>-<a href="../../../w/i/l/Wilfrid.html" title="Wilfrid">Wilfrid</a>'s, <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugh_of_Lincoln_%28saint%29_7dac.html" title="Hugh of Lincoln (saint)">St Hugh</a>'s, <a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_John_Fisher_fd57.html" title="Saint John Fisher">St John</a>'s, <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Oswald_1788.html" title="St Oswald">St Oswald</a>'s, <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Margaret_de8a.html" title="St Margaret">St Margaret</a>'s and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_More_90f1.html" title="Thomas More">St Thomas</a>'. <a href="../../../s/t/_/St_Martin%27s_Ampleforth_66eb.html" title="St Martin's Ampleforth">St Martin's Ampleforth</a> is the Prep School for Ampleforth, situated a few miles across the valley in <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilling_Castle_21eb.html" title="Gilling Castle">Gilling Castle</a>.</p>
<p>Sport is a large part of school life, with pupils participating in a wide variety of sports including rugby, shooting, tennis, cricket and football. As well as many rugby and cricket pitches set in the 2000 acres (8 km²) of the valley, the school runs the St Alban's Centre (SAC), a sports centre with a large hall (also used for school assemblies and official ceremonies), a 25-metre swimming pool, three squash courts, and a fitness suite. SAC is also open to the general public for a fee.</p>

<p>The school also sports a large wall to the south of the Abbey, popularly known as "the Big Wall". It is approximately 10 m tall by 15 m wide and constructed from local sandstone. It was speculated that the wall was constructed to play an Amplefordian version of <a href="../../../f/i/v/Fives.html" title="Fives">Fives</a>; the exact nature of this game and its equipment was unearthed in a marginal doodle in a book in the monastic library by Dr Galliver, a school history master, in the 1990s. Nowadays it is often used by members of the school to brush up on their tennis skills, and by the cadet corps for drill.</p>
<p>The college is colloquially known as "SHAC": the popular explanation for this is that the <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acronym.html" title="Acronym">acronym</a> stands for "Senior House, Ampleforth College". although this is likely to be a <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backronym.html" title="Backronym">backronym</a>. It is believed that it was originally referred to as "the shack" in the early <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_Century_9dae.html" title="20th Century">20th Century</a> because of the parlous state of the old school building at that time; the phrase was coined when the then head monitor welcomed the school "back to the old shack" one September. School monitors play an important role in the smooth running of the school and are known as "shackies" to all in the college.</p>
<p>The school is situated in a picturesque valley with many sports pitches, forests and lakes. There are three lakes remaining of the original five constructed by the Fairfax Family centuries ago. The middle lake is stocked with <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trout.html" title="Trout">trout</a> (mainly brown and rainbow, although the occasional blue back has been seen).</p>
<p>The current headmaster is Father Gabriel Everitt OSB, a convert from the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_England_2cc6.html" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>.</p>

Ampleforth and the Valley from the Air</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As the leading Catholic school in the country, its occasional problems make the news - the school has suffered some poor press coverage during recent years including a story on the accusation that several monks and three members of the lay teaching staff molested the children under their care. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Around the same time, it was indicted as having taken part in a cartel of price fixing amongst public schools.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> The school has periodically experienced a drugs problem due to its location (and lack of nearby entertainment) and the relative affluence of the children who attend.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>The school was the subject of a light-hearted ITV documentary made by director Dan Barraclough shown in 2003 and entitled <i>Ampleforth: My Teacher's A Monk</i>. The aim was to show off the school to a wider audience, although it also highlighted large-scale breaking of the school rules on smoking, and what some regard as the lax rules on alcohol. However he did report that he did not witness a single act of bullying, something that used to form the image of the stereotypical English public school.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Recent pupils thought it was an accurate, if rather superficial, portrayal of the school.</p>
<p>In September 2005, Ampleforth was one of the leading British schools (including <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charterhouse_School_6b52.html" title="Charterhouse School">Charterhouse</a>, <a href="../../../e/t/o/Eton_College_8864.html" title="Eton College">Eton</a>, <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gresham%27s_School_abda.html" title="Gresham's School">Gresham's</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrow_School_01a8.html" title="Harrow School">Harrow</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haileybury_School_0cc2.html" title="Haileybury School">Haileybury</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marlborough_College_dfdc.html" title="Marlborough College">Marlborough</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_School_344a.html" title="Rugby School">Rugby</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrewsbury_School_b73b.html" title="Shrewsbury School">Shrewsbury</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stowe_School_2c1c.html" title="Stowe School">Stowe</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellington_College_31a3.html" title="Wellington College">Wellington</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winchester_College_f4f0.html" title="Winchester College">Winchester</a>) which were considered by the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_of_Fair_Trading_c807.html" title="Office of Fair Trading">Office of Fair Trading</a> to be operating a fee-fixing cartel in breach of the Competition Act of 1998.
