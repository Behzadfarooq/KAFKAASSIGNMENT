<p>Um, wasn't there *less* than 26 letters, historically? Could someone expand on this, please? (seeing that this is the article for ampersand)</p>
<p>Perhaps change it to "English alphabet," since this is what it mainly is talking about? (See <a href="../../../z/_/_/Z.html" title="Z">Z</a>)</p>
<p>I'm a bit unconvinced by the quote used to support this claim. It seems to merely say that &amp; would serve as well as z as the last letter but this does not necessarily imply that &amp; was in fact the last letter (or even considered a letter at all).

<dd>When I wrote the text for <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typography.html" title="Typography">Typography</a> I deliberately put in a few ampersands to test what other editors would do. Sure enough they were replaced with "and"&#160;:-) I knew that would happen. The style guide probably recommends "and" over ampersand. The point of reintroducing ampersands is to draw attention to their demise. Some prominent typographers have talked and written about it. Using ampersands is appropriate and fitting to Typography, if not all typography-related articles, and acceptable if you <a href="../../../i/g/n/Wikipedia%7EIgnore_all_rules_528b.html" title="Wikipedia:Ignore all rules">ignore all the rules to make a better encyclopedia</a>.<br /></dd>

<p>I believe to have read somewhere, that the Pacific Ocean language of Marshallese (am not sure which language family it belongs to, but am guessing Polynesian), the ampersand was used as a letter, a vowel to be exact, which should be 'somewhere between "a" and "e"'.

<p>The <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_alphabet.html" title="English alphabet">English alphabet</a> article suggests that &amp; has been considered a letter after Z at least since the year 1011. This casts doubt on the nursery rhyme theory. Fishal 15:02, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I must admit (it was me who added the nursery rhyme theory) that I was surprised to read about the Brytferth character set, but the article does show that this is only now being properly annotated and researched by philologists. I seriously doubt that between Brytferth and the Victorian era it was in common knowledge that there were in the days of yore additional letters after Z. My suggestion would be that the unknown author of the rhyme possibly was aware of it, and therefore was all the more ready to include it. I cannot see the original of page 203 of the Brytferth work anywhere on line. If I get the chance to go to the Ashmolean anytime soon (I have family nearby) I would love to see it, but I don't believe it was established that it was called "ampersand" at that time. I think it is referred to in this article as "ond". Still it is more likely to have been the nursery rhyme, in my hypothesis - and it is of course hypothesis - which gave rise to the term "ampersand", even though ancient texts do show it as a letter after z. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsenetpostsdotcom_fb92.html" title="User:Usenetpostsdotcom">Uncle Davey</a> <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_talk%7EUsenetpostsdotcom_1e10.html" title="User talk:Usenetpostsdotcom">(Talk)</a> 09:33, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>OK. I'll also see if I can find any secondary sources dealing with this. Fishal 14:31, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>And several months later I still haven't even looked. In the meantime, Uncle Davey, I'm putting your contribution here, since as it stands now it's an unsourced hypothesis. Here it is:</p>
<p>The most likely reason why <i>&amp;</i> was regarded as the 27th letter of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_alphabet.html" title="English alphabet">English alphabet</a> is - and like many accounts about the history of punctuation this may be apocryphal - the traditional children's nursery rhyme for learning the alphabet with verbal past tenses (instead of the usual nouns as in "A is for apple, etc") called "A - apple pie." This traditional rhyme reads "<a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A">A</a> - apple pie. <a href="../../../b/_/_/B.html" title="B">B</a> bit it, <a href="../../../c/_/_/C.html" title="C">C</a> cut it, <a href="../../../d/_/_/D.html" title="D">D</a> dealt it, etc. Of course, when you get to the end of the alphabet it becomes rather difficult to finish, so the standard version said "X, Y, Z and per se and, each had a little piece in their hand". The &amp; sign was added to round off the rhyme (not unlike the lines "Now I know my ABC, next time won't you sing with me?" in the most popular contemporary alphabet song) and the common slurring of the end of the rhyme when spoken quickly or when recited by unlearned people gave rise to the folk usage "ampersand."</p>

<dd>Ampersand may read in German <i>am</i> and French <i>Persan[d]</i> meaning <i>in Persian</i> and appears to be a secret code in certain old coded texts that the text is to be read either literally in Persian or, more commonly, reading R to L.

<dd>The Scots term epershand may actually refer to the manuscript letter <i>esh</i> (š or sh cf the Hebrew shin above) from the Persian <a href="../../../p/a/h/Pahlavi.html" title="Pahlavi">Pahlavi</a> and <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avestic.html" title="Avestic">Avestic</a> scripts. This gives us the corrected word ε-Persand (for want of a closer simulacrum other than &amp; itself). Far fetched as this may sound at first, <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustine_of_Hippo_c35d.html" title="Augustine of Hippo">St Augustine of Hippo</a> had been a <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manichean.html" title="Manichean">Manichean</a> prior to his conversion to Christianity and he would have known the <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoroastrianism.html" title="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrian</a> <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avesta.html" title="Avesta">Avesta</a> as the background to this faith. Early monastery scholarship included the oriental church scholars and the borrowing of a letter from their scripts would seem a fairly natural step in scripting the local tongue where Latin characters fail. The scholarship would seem not to have lasted (perhaps because of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Index_%28the_Roman_Catholic_Church%29_920d.html" title="Index (the Roman Catholic Church)">Index of Prohibited Incunabula</a>) and the letter has been read as the Greek one I've shown - epsilon.

<p>I did it for several reasons.</p>
<p>First, I could not understand what the author was getting at in several places. For example "Note however the Hebrew <a href="../../../k/e/t/Kether.html" title="Kether">Keter</a> (Crown)..." and the assertion that because the Hebrew name of God may not be spoken, this would somehow have affected the pronunciation of the alphabet in the time of George Eliot, 19th-century England.</p>
<p>Second, the deleted material implies several things that I believe are actually false: "This gives us the corrected word ε-Persand", the implication being that this is a "correct" original form. I do not know of any dictionary or other authority that supports this theory.</p>
<p>Third, the whole thing was disjointed and incoherent. Is there a connection with Hebrew? Or is the connection with Persian? Or is it with Egyptian? And what do any of these things have to do with each other? If the additions are true, they need a more detailed explanantion.</p>
<p>Fourth, the whole thing was uncited. But it is all so weird that it requires citation.</p>
<p>I decided that the odds were that it was added either as a prank, or else was the private theory of the author, and removed it, until such time as it can be verified.</p>

<p>I apologise for the editor's apparent wish to subject this set of entries to the Index. No prank was intended. Whilst we tend to view all three separately, due to our own slant on history, the reality is that Persia ruled as far as Egypt in the 22nd dynasty and that the Jewish Kabbalah deals with secret understandings of scripture which sometimes do not sit well with mainstream views of Judaism, such as the use of Pharaonic symbols and the name of the sun god. Modern Hebrew and Arabic / Persian scripts have a common ancestor and were, at the time that Avestic developed, quite closely related.</p>
<p>Here, I was suggesting that the Persian influence in the world of the early Christians was not negligible (the Parthian historical claims were sometimes seen as a bargaining chip in negotiations with Rome by the government of Judea and the border a source of refuge) and that the Scottish name might tell us of a piece of that influence.</p>
<p>Of course, other than Latin and Greek, Hebrew was the third force in Church controlled learning. I fail to see what is so astonishingly inconceivable about a letter fulfilling a missing function in the existing script as well as having a name that was used as a shorthand for a Latin phrase that puns on a Kabbalist con sept. (Don't forget that English used the 'ash' (æ), 'eth' (ð), 'thorn' (þ), 'wynn' and long s).</p>
<p>It seems to me that evidences of a flourishing intelligentsia in Britain after the decline of Roman power there have not been absorbed by this part of the establishment because of certain associated uncomfortable truths about entrenched stances from positions of false authority.</p>

<dd>Nothing was inconceivable about it. As I said, I deleted it because it was bizarre, turgid, unlikely, and (most important) uncited.</dd>

<p>As you may see, the Wikipedia entry for the Hebrew letter Shin itself contains the references for the possible Egyptian derivation under <i>Origins</i> and for the Hebrew Judaic usage to represent the god name Shaddai under <i>In Judaism</i>.</p>
<p>My reference to Keter (also a Wikipedia reference) and Ra was fairly obviously a Kabbalist pun on the usage to represent the Latin phrase et cetera. I chose this because the uraeus glyph shown as the possible origin of the Hebrew letter Shin is the sun crown in Egyptian religion and one of the more important crowns of the Pharaoh as deity.</p>
<p>It is, however, possible that a more Judaic reading is Keter A (alef / alif) - the first letter of the alphabet and thus the counting number one - i.e. Crown [of the] One [god]. Note that the Arabic character alif is a vertical stroke and the number one in Arabic numerals. It is also the basis for the supreme Muslim leader's title of Calif. One of the forms of Ammon (the Egyptian god who subsumed all other gods) shows him crowned with a vertical spike. It is my belief that Allah is, literally, al <i>A</i> - the One - an historical continuity from the cult of Ammon.</p>
<p>The George Eliot reference is based on her obvious classical scholarship as well as her personal choice of an Anglo-Jewish male persona. We often ignore the Jewish background of many humble English and Scottish families - long since absorbed into the cultural mainstream preferring to focus on the Hanoverian era immigration from Germany.</p>
<p>My suggestion that the ampersand is also a code for reading a section of text backwards or in Persian seems to be borne out in several sections of the coded poem <i>A Chantar m'er</i> which is my own discovery. The other part of the discovery was the @ character which bears many names including the French <i>at baclé</i> - another Kabbalist pun on the Hebrew-named cypher the atbash key (clé in French) qv also on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Your characterisation of this analysis as <i>bizarre, turgid and unlikely</i> seems to show an ignorance of Kabbalist reliance on puns and of a continuing, if persecuted, Kabbalist movement in the Christian world - persecuted by those who like the (in my opinion, less than charming) religious and temporal power in the title Dominus (which a Kabbalist might read as D or Delta minus or perhaps from Minos - a bit of bull on the dark side).</p>
