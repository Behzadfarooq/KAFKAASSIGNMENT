<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/_/AM_stereo_09fd.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>Early experiments with stereo AM radio involved two separate stations broadcasting the left and right audio channels. This was not a very practical option, requiring a listener to have two radios tuned to one station. Synchronization was problematic, often resulting in a sort of ping-pong effect between the two channels. Reception was also likely to be different between the two stations—never mind that not many listeners had matched receivers of the same model or brand.</p>
<p>In the early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> five competing AM systems were available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Belar Systems (?)</li>
<li><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harris_Broadcast_51c2.html" title="Harris Broadcast">Harris Broadcast</a> (V-CPM)</li>
<li>Kahn-Hazeltine (<a href="../../../i/s/b/ISB_1985.html" title="ISB">ISB</a>)</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnavox.html" title="Magnavox">Magnavox</a> (<a href="../../../p/m/x/PMX_ab4f.html" title="PMX">PMX</a>)</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorola.html" title="Motorola">Motorola</a> (<a href="../../../c/-/q/C-QUAM_6696.html" title="C-QUAM">C-QUAM</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Belar system, although available, was the least popular system, and may not have been used at all on any broadcast stations other than testing (perhaps on <a href="../../../w/j/r/WJR_9adb.html" title="WJR">WJR</a>).</p>
<p>The Harris, Magnavox, and Motorola C-QuAM (Compatible - Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) systems were fundamentally based on the same principle which phase modulates the primary carrier along with amplitude modulating it. The stereo information is placed on the phase modulated part of the carrier while the standard mono program was amplitude modulated as it normally would be in mono. Each of these systems would do it in slightly different ways. The Harris system utilized synchronous detection, and their initial system had a movable pilot signal, later changed to match the Motorola C-QuAM pilot.</p>
<p>The Kahn-Hazeltine system worked on an entirely different principle which independently modulated the upper and lower sidebands separately to differentiate the difference in program material. If an AM station were broadcasting AM stereo using the Kahn system, stereophonic sound could be partially enjoyed by tuning two standard radios slightly to either side of the station, one to the right side of best tune and one to the left of best tune. The best way to experience the most stereo separation however was by using an AM Stereo tuner with appropriate circuitry for decoding the Kahn system.</p>
<p>The Harris, Magnavox, and Motorola C-QuAM systems could only be decoded with an appropriate receiver. In the early '80s some electronics manufacturers, such as Sony, developed AM radios capable of receiving all four AM stereo systems. In the end, the two main systems that ended up battling it out to the death were the Kahn system and the Motorola C-QuAM system. Eventually the C-QuAM system became the FCC Standard for AM Stereo broadcasting. The Kahn system is still in use today, although not for stereophonic broadcasting. Experimentation by Leonard Kahn revealed that by using the Kahn system to put more high end on one sideband and more low end on the other sideband, you can improve the perceived coverage in the protected nulls of some directional AM signals. In some cases Kahn Powerside worked well, and in other cases it made no noticeable difference.</p>
<p>The C-QuAM AM Stereo system is also still in use to this day, but on a shrinking number of stations. As many AM stations have switched their program formats from music to talk, the need for stereophonic sound has given way to the need for better signal to noise ratio, which is more easily attainable in mono.</p>
<p>The commercial radio industry is promoting a new Digital system marketed as <a href="../../../h/d/_/HD_Radio_b245.html" title="HD Radio">HD Radio</a> but also known generically as "In Band On Channel" <a href="../../../i/b/o/IBOC_2979.html" title="IBOC">IBOC</a>. What IBOC does is insert a digital signal In Band On the next Channel above and below along with the analog audio. A Special <a href="../../../h/d/_/HD_Radio_b245.html" title="HD Radio">HD Radio</a> receiver will be needed to hear the digital audio. Recently, engineer Leonard Kahn has also devised a new analog/digital AM stereo system known as "CAM-D".</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/m/a/AMAX_7c55.html" title="AMAX">AMAX</a> was a standard adopted by receiver manufacturers and broadcasters. There was a certain level of technical requirements for broadcast equipment manufacturers and AM Stereo receiver manufacturers to hold up to in order to attain AMAX certification. It was sort of a stamp of approval indicating that a consumer was buying a quality piece of AM Stereo receiving equipment. The AMAX program was developed to try and resurrect AM Stereo in the mid '90s once the FCC finally adopted C-QuAM as the standard system for AM Stereo. Some auto manufacturers built quality AMAX AM stereo radios, and a Sony portable meeting AMAX AM stereo was available as well (the SRF-42). General Electric offers a mono AM radio, the GE SuperRadio III, which easily meets the bandwidth requirements of AMAX, but does not offer stereo AM audio.</p>

<ul>
<li>1960 - AM Stereo first demonstrated on <a href="../../../x/t/r/XTRA-AM_406a.html" title="XTRA-AM">XTRA-AM</a>, Tijuana, MX, using the Kahn ISB system.</li>
<li>1963 - WHAZ runs a stereo program on eight AM stations, four on each channel.</li>
<li>c1980 - After at least five years of AM Stereo testing with five systems. Initially they select the Magnavox system as the official AM stereo standard. Their research is immediately accused of being flawed and incomplete.</li>
<li>1982 - After another series of lawsuits and accusations, the FCC decides that the marketplace should decide and revokes the Magnavox certification as the AM stereo standard for political reasons. The marketplace continues fighting it out, and this becomes a death blow to the possibility of AM stereo becoming commonplace across the board.</li>
<li>1985 - AM stereo officially begins in Australia, with the C-QuAM standard. <a href="http://users.andara.com/~amstereo/amstereo.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://users.andara.com/~amstereo/amstereo.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>
<li>1993 - FCC makes Motorola's C-QuAM the AM stereo standard, and also requires extended band stations to broadcast in stereo. Canada also endorses the C-QuAM system.</li>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/_/AM_stereo_09fd.html" title="Edit section: Current status">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Current status</span></h2>
<p>A famous <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">European</a> transmitter using AM stereo is Villebon sur Yvette on 864 kHz, which transmits <a href="../../../f/r/a/France_Bleu_a8ba.html" title="France Bleu">France Bleu</a>.</p>
<p>AM stereo is popular in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a> because of the limited number of <a href="../../../f/m/_/FM_ff94.html" title="FM">FM</a> stations in that country, and in <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> possibly because AM stations are more suited to covering large sparsely populated regions than FM stations, and the fact that unlike the American FCC, Australia was quick to pick a single standard (C-QuAM). After some short lived experiments, the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_Broadcasting_Authority_eea6.html" title="Independent Broadcasting Authority">Independent Broadcasting Authority</a> decided not to adopt AM stereo in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">Britain</a>. Canada still has some quality AM stereo music stations on the air, and AM stereo receivers were more readily-available in Canada and Australia than the USA for some reason.</p>
<p>Some enthusiasts claim that AM stereo gives better <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereophonic_sound.html" title="Stereophonic sound">stereo separation</a> than FM stereo, but under <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skywave.html" title="Skywave">skywave</a> reception conditions, C-QuAM stereo systems suffer from "platform motion" on first-generation AM stereo chipsets, but this was claimed to be corrected by the third-generation chipset.</p>
