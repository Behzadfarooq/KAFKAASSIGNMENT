<p>Where can I find articles regarding export tax of India on Portland Cement? Do they have an export tax? --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETransit1_466a.html" title="User:Transit1">Transit1</a> 02:46, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Export taxes are one of the stupidest taxes ever invented, I would think India would be smarter than that. They just damage their own industry, exports, and economy. Import taxes, on the other hand, can help protect native industries. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 05:50, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually stu, I have to disagree. Export taxes do have their use, because selling in the foreign becomes more expensive selling in the homecountry somewhat more interesting. usually this also discourages the settlement of low-wage factories which usually are BAD for the health standard of a country. also the extra effect is that the production of cement in this case which is pretty highly polluting (at least with the techniques used in india).

<dd>Sorry, that makes no sense. They should aim to sell in both foreign AND domestic markets. Cutting off one market won't help the other. As for environmental protection, the way to do that is with tough environmental protection laws, not by destroying industry. That way, if it's possible to produce cement without breaking the laws, they will, and if not, they will go out of business. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 14:52, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, it's not the presence of low-wage jobs that are bad for the people, it's the absence of high-wage jobs. Adding low-wage jobs to an economy never hurts anything, unless it comes at the cost of high-wage jobs, and there's no reason to think that high-wage jobs would be destroyed by exporting goods. If anything, a few high-wage jobs would be created (engineering, etc.). <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 14:57, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't agree that this is good, however. If there was a domestic market with unsatisfied demand, the company would have already sold the product there before exploring export opportunities. If forced to dump their product on the domestic market, the excess supply will cause a price collapse, which will harm that company, as well as any competitors. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 02:26, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure there's a sure-fire way to do it. There are companies which will take your money and say that they will promote your invention (google "inventor agent" for a bunch of them), but personally I'd be suspicious of them (many of those sorts of companies—like self-publishing houses—feed on the vanity of their clients). If you google "venture capital" you'll get lots of resources which give suggestions or companies for finding funding; again I'd be wary. --<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User%7E24.147.86.187.html" title="User:24.147.86.187">24.147.86.187</a> 02:15, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am wondering how people make up how the molecules of a medicine looks like? For example, <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citalopram.html" title="Citalopram">Citalopram</a> a popular anti-depressant known as Celexa, has the following image for the molecule:</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/i/t/Image%7ECitalopram-skeletal.png_4919.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/e/ed/Citalopram-skeletal.png/200px-Citalopram-skeletal.png" alt="" width="200" height="155" longdesc="../../../c/i/t/Image%7ECitalopram-skeletal.png_4919.html" /></a></p>
<p>&amp; the formula is C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>21</sub>F<sub>1</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>1 .</sub></p>
<p>My question is how do they make an image of the molecule, they can't see the molecule via a microscope, and how do they make the chemical formula of the molecule?--<a href="../../../r/e/c/User%7ERecords_a254.html" title="User:Records">Records</a> 21:09, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Have a look at our article on <a href="../../../x/-/r/X-ray_crystallography.html" title="X-ray crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a>. That's one of the techniques used. - <span style="font-family: cursive"><a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a></span> 21:13, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Also such compounds are made by <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_synthesis.html" title="Chemical synthesis">chemical synthesis</a>, assembled from smaller molecules by chemical reactions that have well understood and predictable behaviour; therefor when making a compound they will know what structure to expect because they knew what starting materials and reactions they used to make it.</dd>
<dd>The image (as in your picture) is a representation of the molecule (like a technical drawing or blueprint) - even if there was a microscope that could see molecules it would look different to the image.</dd>
<dd>The chemical formula will also be known in the same way the structure is known - because the scientists that make it know what smaller building blocks they used.</dd>
<dd>Even so the formula and structure need to be confirmed (in case an unusual reaction has happened) - typicaly the structure is confirmed by <a href="../../../n/m/r/NMR_164c.html" title="NMR">NMR</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infrared_spectroscopy.html" title="Infrared spectroscopy">infrared spectroscopy</a> and other methods. The chemical formula can be confirmed by <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chemical_analysis.html" title="Chemical analysis">chemical analysis</a>.</dd>
<dd>Note the chemical formula can be got from the image of the molecule - in this case unmarked vertices (the points connecting the lines) represent carbon - so by just counting the number of each type of atom gives the chemical formula</dd>
<dd>I hope I've answered your question - apologies if any of it sounds condescending - It's not totally clear to me what you need to know so I've tried to cover most of it.83.100.138.110 21:41, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Note - the formula seem wrong to me shouldn't it be C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>21</sub>F<sub>1</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>1</sub> and not C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>22</sub>F<sub>1</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>1</sub>&#160;? Please check and correct.</dd>

<dd>That's an interesting question. We could add them together my making abitrary joins between the molecules, but I don't think that's what you're asking. There's no proceedure in chemistry for merging molecules (eg I'm assuming you mean something like merging a square and circle to make a square with rounded corners). Chemical structures have a set framework - there's no intermediate - it's like asking to merge a square and a triangle - I can't really give you a answer.83.100.138.110 23:17, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This is addressed in the heart of <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organic_chemistry.html" title="Organic chemistry">organic chemistry</a>, and <a href="../../../o/r/g/Organic_synthesis.html" title="Organic synthesis">organic synthesis</a>. The pictures given in the articles are a rendition of the molecule - indeed, nobody has ever "seen" a molecule, but we can come up with a model that is consistent with a tremendous body of scientific knowledge. From this, we have confidence that the picture gives us something reasonable that summarizes all that data. You might take a look at our article on <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamiflu.html" title="Tamiflu">tamiflu</a> - it gives two synthesis routes for that medication, and might give you a general idea of the sort of thinking involved with solving these problems.

<dd>As someone who is currently waiting for my reaction to run (another two hours or so, YES!) before I go home...Most active chemists don't make a molecule out of nowhere, we build them slowly step by step. Thus, we know what we expect to get out of the next reaction, and know what to look for. Yes, X-ray is a technique that can be used but it is expensive and relies on you able to meake a solid crystal (not always possible). Most structure determination is done through a technique called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. This works by using the fact that in a magnetic field, all atoms in a molecule "resonate" at a different frequency of applied magnetic field. They do this because they are in different chemical environments due to thae shape of the molecule. This technique can give you information about how atoms are linked together, and about how they are arranged in space relative to one another. It is fast, cheap, and easy to interpret, despite what hordes of undergrads will tell you...---John</dd>

<p>The starting material of <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citalopram.html" title="Citalopram">Citalopram</a>, (4-bromo-2-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl)-(4-chlorophenyl)-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) methanol was prepared in the following manner:</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grignard_reaction.html" title="Grignard reaction">Grignard reaction</a>-solution prepared from 220 grams (1.15 mol) of p-chlorobromobenzene and 29 grams of <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnesium.html" title="Magnesium">magnesium</a> turnings (1.2 mol) in 1500 milliliters of dry ether was added dropwise in the course of one hour to a suspension of 213 grams of 5-bromphthalide (1 mol) in 1500 milliliters of dry <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetrahydrofuran.html" title="Tetrahydrofuran">tetrahydrofuran</a>. The temperature was not allowed to rise over 10 degrees Centigrade. After the addition was completed the reaction mixture was stirred for three hours at room temperature. The mixture was then poured into 2 liters of icewater and 100 milliliters of saturated aqueous <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammonium_chloride.html" title="Ammonium chloride">ammonium chloride</a> were added. The etherphase was separated and the water-tetrahydrofuranphase extracted once with 500 milliliters of ether. The etherphase was washed with water, dried over anhydrous magnesiumsulphate, filtered and evaporated in vacuum to yield 320 grams of 2-hydroxymethyl-4-<a href="../../../b/r/o/Bromo.html" title="Bromo">bromo</a>-4'-chloro-benzophenone in the form of a yellow oil which was not purified further but used directly in the next step. The 320 grams of oil were dissolved in 200 milliliters of dry tetrahydrofuran and added dropwise to a great excess of N,N-dimethylaminopropyl magnesium chloride in tetrahydrofuran under gentle reflux. After completed addition the mixture was refluxed over night. The reaction mixture was then poured into 5 liters of icewater and 200 milliliters of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution added. The mixture was extracted with a total of 2500 milliliters of ether. The etherphase was then extracted with 20% aqueous acetic acid to acid reaction, whereupon the acetic acid solution was made alkaline with 10 N sodiumhydroxide solution. After cooling, the oil, which separated out, was extracted twice with 500 milliliters of ether. The combined ether extracts were dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, treated with active carbon and evaporated in vacuum. The remaining oil consists of somewhat impure (4-bromo-2-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl)-(4-chlorophenyl)-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) methanol which was used in the next step without further purification. Yield: 219 grams.</p>
<p>The 218 grams of oil from the previous step were heated for three hours on a steam bath with 1800 milliliters of 60% aqueous phosphoric acid while stirring vigorously. The reaction mixture was neutralized with saturated aqueous <a href="../../../a/m/m/Ammonia.html" title="Ammonia">ammonia</a> while continuously adding ice. The reaction mixture was then extracted with 1500 milliliters of ether, the etherphase separated, dried over <a href="../../../a/n/h/Anhydrous.html" title="Anhydrous">anhydrous</a> <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potassium_carbonate.html" title="Potassium carbonate">potassium carbonate</a>, treated with active <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carbon.html" title="Carbon">carbon</a> and evaporated in vacuum. The residue was distilled in vacuum and 105 grams of 1-(4'-chlorophenyl)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-5-bromophthalan was obtained as an oil which boiled at 188-190 degrees Centigrade/0.1mm Hg.</p>

<dd>1. They use the <a href="../../../m/o/l/Molar_mass.html" title="Molar mass">molar mass</a> - each moleclue is assumed to have a molar mass - the sum of the mass of the parts. Dividing the mass used by molar mass gives the number of 'moles'. A 'mole' is a standard measure of number of molecules. 1mol contains a set number of molecules.</dd>
<dd>In the case above the molar mass of chlorobromobenzene is ~192 grams per mole. So 220 grams has 220/192 moles = ~1.15moles. See <a href="../../../m/o/l/Mole_%28unit%29.html" title="Mole (unit)">Mole (unit)</a></dd>
<dd>2. Probably not a test tube. More likely a round bottom flask connected to a condensor see <a href="../../../l/a/b/Laboratory_glassware.html" title="Laboratory glassware">Laboratory glassware</a>. A book on experimental organic chemistry should give you more details.</dd>
<dd>3. No. The result will be a mixture of Citalopram, Bupropion &amp; Clonazepam plus the tablet filler (usually chalk). In this case it is unlikely that any reaction will have occurred.

<li>The <i>first</i> step is to determine what it is you want to model: The expected revenue of a ski lift? When to declare bankruptcy? Is this a "what if" exercise, and what conditions are under your control to vary? Then you determine what quantities figure into the equation (inflation rate, number of baby boomers retiring, whatever). At that point you realize you're never going to be able to find sufficiently reliable forecasts and give up. If, however, you insist on continuing, then the next thing to do is to examine the relationships between all relevant quantities and express them as mathematical equations (revenue = income − expenses; income = quantity × price; expenses = fixed + quantity × variable; that kind of stuff). Possibly you have a time involvement (revenue<sub>2006</sub>, revenue<sub>2008</sub>, balance<sub>2008</sub> = balance<sub>2006</sub> + revenue<sub>2008</sub>). Then you do the calculations, or solve the equations, or determine the optimal value of something, depending on the nature of the model. Perhaps you could first try something a bit simpler and less ambitious than you seem to have in mind. &#160;--<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 11:36, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>In the first equation you need a minus sign instead of a plus sign. It is basically the equation <a href="../../../n/e/t/Net_profit.html" title="Net profit">Net profit</a> = Gross revenue − Expenses. The revenue goes into your wallet, the expenses are paid out of your wallet, and what remains is the net profit. For the second equation, per definition <a href="../../../c/a/p/Cap_rate.html" title="Cap rate">Cap rate</a> = Income / Value. So then by elementary algebra Value = Income / Cap rate.

<p>From User:Gandalf61 External Link:</p>
<p><br />
Anyone who has studied business has at least a passing familiarity with “time value of money” formulas. Yet while many people can comprehend explanations of loan repayment schedules or retirement savings accounts, or even use financial calculators, their level of time value understanding may not include any sense of where the time value formulas come from, or how the various time value applications are related. This brief article presents a derivation of all of the standard (and some less well-known) time value of money formulas from the future value of one dollar factor.</p>
<p>Basic future value applications are easily understood at an intuitive level. Suppose you have $1,000 in an account today. If this amount earns a rate of return of 10% for a year, the balance grows to $1,100 (the original $1,000 plus $100 in earnings). Symbolically, this time value adjustment can be represented as</p>
<p>(1) PV0 (1 + i) = FV1 ,</p>
<p>an equation in which PV0 is the $1,000 in the present, i = .1 or 10%, and FV1 is the $1,100 future amount one year hence.</p>
<p>This process can be repeated, in the sense that we can now view the $1,100 as the initial balance in a second future value analysis. If this amount grows at 10% for one year, the account balance grows to $1,210 by the end of that second period. Symbolically,</p>
<p>(2) FV1 (1 + i) = FV2 .</p>
<p>Substituting equation (1)’s representation of FV1 into equation (2) reveals how the initial present value can be transformed into a future value two years later:</p>
<p>PV0 (1 + i)(1 + i) = FV2 or</p>
<p>(3) PV0 (1 + i)2 = FV2 .</p>
<p>Generalizing for any number of years n, we have</p>
<p>(4) PV0 (1 + i)n = FVn .</p>
<p>Thus, we have discovered the first of the standard time value of money factors, the future value of one dollar factor: FVFn = (1 + i)n .</p>
<p><br /></p>

<li>What does <b>Mortgage Loan Constant</b> mean? --<a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFoundby_f477.html" title="User:Foundby">Foundby</a> 12:00, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li><i>Mortgage Loan Constant</i> is the annualised ratio of the loan repayments to the initial amount of the loan - it looks like an interest rate, but it is higher than the interest rate of the loan because repayments also include capital repayments as well as interest. <a href="http://www.business.uiuc.edu/orer/V13-2-3.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.business.uiuc.edu/orer/V13-2-3.pdf" rel="nofollow">This link</a> might help, although it is quite mathematical.<a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGandalf61_7a88.html" title="User:Gandalf61">Gandalf61</a> 13:06, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>If you just take the ratio of a single loan repayment to the initial value of the loan, you get very different figures if the repayments are, say, monthly than if they are, say, quarterly. To establish a common yardstick you need to <i>annualise</i> the ratio by calculating an <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annual_equivalent_rate.html" title="Annual equivalent rate">annual equivalent rate</a>. For example, if your monthly repayment is 1% of the original loan value, the annual equivalent of 1% monthly is (1.01)^12 - 1 = 12.68% (approximately), so the Mortgage Loan Constant would be 12.68%.

Hitler may have been charismatic and succesfully manipulative, but that doesn't mean he was <i>intelligent.</i> It's clear his views on race were completely wrong from a scientific point of view, not just a moral one.

<p>I'm in love with someone I probably can't get. I'm very curious as to why this psychological state causes actual, physical pain. Specifically, a burning feeling in my chest when I think about that special someone. I guess it's pretty mild compared to, say, cutting a finger open, but still. Has anyone figured out why this happens? Pain means nerves must be being stimulated, yet my body is wholly intact. I imagine this is why love historically came to be associated with the "heart", though the blood-pumping musculature is obviously not directly involved. What gives? Thanks. 24.95.48.112 07:12, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Del, I doubt it. The cost of air fuel is rising, and there is a not-to-distant future when it will be the privilege of the middle classes.

<dd>The arrangement is one to one with local councils. Sometimes local councilors will visit the sister city and learn about local arrangements that work, in the hopes of transference.

<dd>See DDB's answer above. As far as I am aware, it is a purely civil arrangement, i.e. there is no contractual obligation to do anything at all. It all depends on people in the town taking some initiative and organising at least a few exchange visits. In the end, it's all down to the people involved to come up with ideas. Sometimes very little happens.

<li>Any presidential candidate whose eligibility was not 100% certain and who stood to win the presidency, would find their status being questioned by the opposing party, and determined by the Supreme Court. Since no person whose status has been in doubt has ever received a majority of <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral_college_votes.html" title="Electoral college votes">electoral college votes</a>, the court has never had to rule on the issue. IANAL, but I'd be surprised if the Supreme Court would ever devote time to determining whether a person who had not yet been elected president was constitutionally eligible. Do that for one person, and they'd have to do it for any other would-be president of doubtful citizenship history. They would prefer to wait till a real live case came along. That has never happened yet. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackofOz_7cdf.html" title="User:JackofOz">JackofOz</a> 08:23, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Whether the opposing party would try to challenge a candidate on these grounds would depend on a political calculation as well, because such an attempt could backfire in a big way. For example, if I were a candidate running against <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McCain_2b79.html" title="John McCain">John McCain</a>, I might decide it best not to try to have him disqualified for having been born in the Panama Canal Zone –- he might very well win the case and it would look pretty bad for me (and my party, who'll be facing another election in two years), attacking a man for being from a military family. So even then the question might remain open.--Rallette 11:10, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>That may well be the way things go with McCain. In any event, the point is that the question is still open as to whether a person born outside the USA to American parents is constitutionally eligible to become US President. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McEnroe_e772.html" title="John McEnroe">John McEnroe</a>, for example, would be well advised to get very, very good advice before embarking on a presidential run. <i>(I can see it now.

<li>Or you could be a citizen "at the time of the adoption of this constitution". That is, George Washington wasn't born in the states, because when he was born, the states didn't exist. But he was eligible because he lived there in 1789.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartianlostinspace_188a.html" title="User talk:Martianlostinspace">martianlostinspace</a> 14:29, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm not too sure about that. <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Hamilton_3fe5.html" title="Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> was considered ineligible because he was born in the Caribbean, even though he was a citizen "at the time of the adoption". <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 22:49, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>And no, there will not be a constitutional amendment specifically to let Arnie run for President. The consitution is more or less impossible to amend. That happens when pigs fly.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartianlostinspace_188a.html" title="User talk:Martianlostinspace">martianlostinspace</a> 14:30, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>So Arnie can't run for president because he was born outside USA, and to non American parents even though he has lived in USA for 14 years and is over 35?</li>
<li>That's correct. It's a moot point anyway, since <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">nobody will vote for an actor for president</a>. --Nelson Ricardo 16:35, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't know if anyone will be able to help me here, but maybe someone can at least give me a second opinion. Maybe others can relate to my, problem. I consider myself pretty smart; I think I would be able to do many things, if I tried. The problem is that I don't try. I have spurts of inspiration once in a while, sometimes lasting for only a day, sometimes for weeks. I'm one of those guys that never finishes anything, and is able to do a lot of things "pretty well". The one thing that I can truly say that I did well was something incredibly easy that not many people had tried before, so it was easy to produce results that stood out, or at least that's how I felt.</p>
<p>I know I'm not normal (other, unrelated details), but I'm not affected by anything like ADD/ADHD, and I'm rather healthy and clean. If I have a certain goal that seems direct and attainable (usually in the form of a member of the other sex) I often discover immense amounts of unused motivation to use in order to improve myself, but since those situations don't come that often for me, I'm often disgusted by my own laziness, my own lack of a drive to do anything productive.</p>
<p>Even though I am so strongly concious of my faults (I have others), and have such a strong want to become motivated, I can't change this part of myself, and it seems like I'm doomed to be lazy for the rest of my life. Why don't I try? I mean... I think I can, but I don't know why I <i>don't</i>. Hell, I've even thought of self-meditation, but of course I gave up on that, too. 222.158.163.86 15:00, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you don't have much self-motivation, perhaps you need another person to motivate you. Parents can serve that purpose early on, with "significant others" and spouses taking on that role later. I suggest you look for a life-mate who will motivate you to reach your potential. Some combination of the "stick and carrot" might be appropriate motivators. Of course, too much "stick" might make you resentful, so choose a mate which has the right balance for you. Don't, however, choose a mate like yourself, or you will both end up reinforcing each other's lazy tendencies. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 15:07, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I do think you are exactly right that I need another person to motivate me; a significant other to ying my yang and provide or restore some balance to my troubled mind. I'm on active watch. I know it is said that "no man is an island", but some men are, and as long as I'm an island, I'd like to, as much as I can, make myself into a respectable one. I think it sounds a little bit unfair to shoulder the responsibility of motivating men with half-assed lives over to women. I'm metrosexual like that I guess. Is "stick and carrot" old American for "apples and oranges"? 222.158.163.86 15:29, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I thought that was a universal expression. I believe the expression comes from how to motivate horses, with the "carrot"; being a reward, and the "stick" being a punishment. For example, your wife could reward you by letting you go out to a bar "with the boys" or punish you by banning you from watching sports (if that's something you like). Of course, you could always ignore her and do as you please, but the hope here is that your desire to please her, along with that part of you that wants to accomplish things in life, will together defeat your lazy tendencies. <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStuRat_7df3.html" title="User:StuRat">StuRat</a> 15:42, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By the way you explained it, I think your "problem" is a lot more common than you realize. Not everyone's a "type A" personality, and apparently, neither are you. Wile Stu's suggestion is definitely a helpful one, from what I gather, I don't think he realizes that the whole "finding a mate" thing is likely one of the biggest hurdles within the "problem" itself. Don't get wrong, I think it would be terrific if you <i>had</i> a mate as Stu suggests, but it can be really tough getting there. The first step I'd suggest is to quit criticizing yourself. You're not a "type A", but whatever "type" you are, don't try to change it, learn to love yourself for whatever "type" you are. Believe me, once one is happy in one's own skin, motivation rises markedly and things that used to be tough become a peice of cake. But you have to start by loving yourself for who you are.

<dd>If it's any help, I can fully identify with your problem. I have exactly the same difficulty and have had all my life. I have tried really hard to resolve it but never succeeded. Yet I have had an otherwise successful life, marriage, kids, career etc., etc., but the awful feeling of not feeeling motivated has always been there. I too am good at most things, in fact, I am often complimented on the wide range of skills I have mastered, and the results of my efforts, but as soon as I pick up a paintbrush or pen, I begin to resent having begun the project. The worst part is, I know how well I might have done if I had really been enthusiastic about it, like learning a language, playing an instrument or whatever. I am now at an age where I have to really struggle NOT to look upon my past life with regret or resentment, and any advice I would offer would be for you <b>not</b> to waste your life looking for a life-changing holy-grail solution, but to instead accept this condition as a part of YOU; like your height or gender, you cannot effectively change it or cast it off. But please, don't thrust the problem of providing the solution onto a partner. Choose a supportive partner by all means, but be honest with them from the beginning, even to asking them to give you a kick up the bum from time to time. And you can have my support to get you started.

<p>I find your problem most interesting since I would be considered at the opposite end of the spectrum. I am self motivated most of the time. I am a retiree now and doing MANY fascinating projects. I just recently retired about 2 years ago. I otherwise was self motived all my life also. I ALWAYS had plenty to do. My projects now are so interesting and fun that I do NOT have enough time in the day to get everything done (and I have ALL day). Perhaps you could learn something from me. I'll start with a couple of questions and see if this develops into something. FIRST: What are your "basic" interests? Here I mean, do you like computers? My guess is that you do, since you are here. What other "hobbies" do you like? Hobbies make for a very fasinating pass time. Also by default they are a great teacher of that field. One of my "hobbies" is Family Genealogy. It has been so "addictive" that lately I have had to wean myself off it for awhile. Now my hobby is "cracking the Da Vinci Code". It now is VERY addictive and uses up about 10 hours or more a day, seven days a week. So maybe a good start in getting self-motivated is to get a hobby. TWO: What is your job or career? What do you do for a living? Are you interested in making MORE money. Do you believe you should be interested in making MORE money? Why? Do you know HOW to make money? Are you interested in money? THREE: Do you travel? Where? What places would you like to go to? Tahiti perhaps? Maybe Bora Bora? Mexico? Club Med??? FOUR: How old are you? Do you think the advice of "Elders" is good? FIVE: Would you be considered an "honest" person? When you say "clean" is this from the viewpoint of good morals? I myself am NOT a "religious" person, however am considered a very moral person. FIVE: Instead of NOT signing in ("Logging in") as normal and saying what your name is, have the motivation to try to figure out how to "Log in" as normal and provide a name. This could even be a "nick" name like "Unmotivated", however perhaps a more positive name like "Need-Useful-Ideas" might be a better name. Start there and IF you have the motivation to answer my questions, perhaps there is much more here from an "Elder" that has "been-there-done-that". --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Coldwell_1d90.html" title="User:Doug Coldwell">Doug</a> 20:17, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Also for the original poster: passion and fire I believe is what this one above is saying to you. Do you have this "fire"? If you do, then there is LOTS of things out there to be motivated about. Out of all these questions I posed, which ones stuck your interest? Are you interested in money? Perhaps "the Da Vinci Code" or maybe travel to exotic places? Which things would you say you are MOST motivated about? What is "fun" to you; things that make you happy? What "excites" you to put some fire under you? What if you discovered a document (that nobody else has) that showed EXACTLY the names of the Apostles in Da Vinci's Last Supper masterpiece painting in the correct order; would this "excite" you? What IF this document were hundreds of years old; would a discovery or find like this give you "excitement" and passion to tell the world? What <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motivate.html" title="Motivate">motivates</a> you with fire? Perhaps making a lot of money? Would making a lot of money excite you? What fields of science or other fields do you like? What hobbies do you presently have? What "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_motivation" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_motivation" rel="nofollow">| hobbies</a>" would you like to take up, IF you had the knowledge?

<dd>Very true Vranak, the questionner is telling us he cannot get motivated by anything; I then confess to being the same, and Doug comes along and tells us to get motivated?????????? Nice try Doug, but it's like trying to tell an alcoholic or a drug addict or a gay guy to act "normal". I am only 5'4", but have always wanted to be 6'2", can you suggest anything Doug?</dd>

<p>Thanks everyone for your comments. It gives me a little more to think about. Especially Doug, for speaking your mind and representing the concrete wisdom of "the elders". 81.145.242.57's comments also especially hit me hard, because, though I'm sure you've lived to be happy with your life, it is truly dissapointing that you never found your place, and I see myself heading in the same direction. To Doug: People have asked me ever since high school what I "liked". For some people, that's an easy question to answer. People have hobbies, likes and dislikes. I don't really. I like everything, I want to know everything, I want to do everything and be everything, for a while. The idea of me devoting myself to a single task, or a bunch of related ones, is not only unthinkable, but entirely undesirable and even scary when I think too much about it. I guess the only thing I can say that I truly believe is "fun", is change, difference, newness. That basically explains my thirst for knowledge; learning things forces me to adapt myself to a new base, I feel like I become a different person. When I was younger, games were interesting because they are designed to suprise, to force you to think in creative ways. Being logical though, I no longer let myself enjoy such forced entertainment, because I feel that it takes away from the "enjoyment" of real life, something which I have yet to find much of yet, I guess. I think I am extremely moral, an extreme athiest, and extremely forward thinking. There are of course conflicts between my "brain" and my "heart" (my self and my superego?) as I am only human, but I do my best to keep them in balance.</p>
<p>Even so, the self doesn't respond well to the wants and the needs of the superego (it gets bored), and that, I guess, is my problem. I think Doug has a very strong "self", and that's something that I admire, something that I can't control. Also Doug, you have two FIVEs! 222.159.203.173 05:57, 30 December 2006 (UTC) (I am the same user as User:222.158.163.86)</p>
<p>You are absolutely correct, I do have two FIVES. I was having so much fun I lost track. Thanks for the positive remarks. Perhaps I can introduce some ideas from "an Elder" that might get you inspired. I have found that hobbies got me inspired and taught me to focus in on a single item. I have learned that focusing your energies on a single task gets MUCH better results. Also I too am NOT inspired by games. Never liked just playing games (because I figured it was a waste of good time), however DID enjoy what you call "enjoyment of real life" by applying all my energies instead to "real life" applications. One of my hobbies early in life was that of electronics. I liked building circuits and learning how they worked. This then lead me to my first career as an Electronics Technician. Since I already knew how the circuits worked, I became VERY good at my career. I was then paid very well and got the "gravy" jobs. I knew my stuff and it paid off. That was because I focused in on this single task. My next career was that of real estate. Because I knew how to focus my energies and also knew how to think logically (from logical electronic circuits) I then learned techniques of real estate. In the 1980's we moved from the eastern United States to San Diego. As you know real estate in San Diego is expensive. However I managed to learn how to acquire several properties (and I started with little money). Self motivation was the answer. Focusing in on a single task and putting all my energies in on real estate ultimately paid off very well. There were at the time several thousand real estate Agents and Brokers in San Diego County. Because I knew how to apply common sense, logic, and focus in on a single task I ultimately outwitted and outsmarted MOST of the Agents in San Diego County. One of the ways also that is VERY important here is honesty and morality. Because I was honest with people, people then liked working with me. I was then like a "magnet" and things just fell my way. I was definitely forward thinking. In fact once you learn to concentrate on something, you will learn also then you somhow set up what I might call "Universal Vibrations". You somehow then just attract things your way. I figured out such good honest moral real estate techniques that properties just came my way. Many times I purchased and obtained properties with no money out of my pocket. Really, it happens! There was a couple of instances that I was actually paid CASH money to take the property off the owner's hands. I will be glad to pass these techniques on to you, IF you are interested in these. It will make you LOTS of money, IF you are motivated to earn lots of money. And it is perfectly legal and legitimate. That was the "fun" part, I did it all honestly. You CAN make a lot of money and NOT have to do illegal or immoral things. In fact, I found in the long run, being 100% honest with people pays off in the long run. Now keep in mind, this is advice from "an Elder" that has been-there-done-that. Being DISHONEST will not work. Trust me on that one.</p>
<p>In my real estate career in San Diego my "speciality" was bank repossessions (foreclosures). Because I was so good at what I did and honest with the Bank, I was having most of the Banks calling me personally when they took back a property. I then proceeded to sell their property. My selling techniques were EXCELLENT and moral. I did not have a real estate office and no Agents under me; however DID have 6 - 8 transactions going at the same time. Most Agents are lucky if the have even ONE transaction going. Many other Agents that were trying to get this same business from the Banks were from large firms (i.e. Century 21), however the Bank presidents would rather work with me instead. Then when there was an OUTSTANDING deal, I took it. Then I negotiated DIRECTLY with the bank and purchased it far below the market. When I say "far below" I am talking 80% of market, or 70% of market, sometimes 60% of market. In one instance I bought a half million dollar home in Del Mar (if you know the area, you know this is an expensive area) for under $200,000. It had an ocean view and was in pretty good condition. The home had just recently been re-carpeted. My down payment was 10%, however since I already had commissions from this Bank "in escrow" I basically did not come up with any CASH out of my pocket. In MOST instances I was dealing with the Bank President or one of the top Bank executives (who controlled the properties). Just by "stumbling across" great deals I made LOTS of money. The Bank presidents liked how I handled their deals, so would not even bother to return the calls of other Agents trying to get their business. They then CALLED ME directly and gave me the listing to sell their properties. Pretty good, wouldn't you say? I even had one instance where I was paid 3 (that's correct 3) FULL cash commissions and I was the one that ultimately wound up with the property with no money out of my pocket. I later sold it for a $50,000 profit. Keep in mind now, these numbers are of the 1980's. Don't know what these would be today, but it would be a BUNCH more. I am now retired. FYI: Took a lot of Club Med trips. Even took one trip to the South Pacific for 5 weeks. That was my 3rd time to Tahiti.</p>
<p>Presently I am working on cracking the Da Vinci Code. Now the others that are watching this conversation will have a lot to say about this. That's good! I am having way too much fun. Am I allowed to have this much fun? I think so, I earned it (the old fashion way). What that does is put "fire" under me. I am then "fired" up to keep going. I have already found out MANY of the pieces to the Da Vinci Code, so I am well on my way. Can't hardly wait to see what others will say about this. Way too much "fun", don't you think. This is what I call FUN. Watch what they will have to say on this. It will be very interesting. Wouldn't you like to have "fun" like this? Then all you have to do then is take the advice of an Elder. Now this is the way I look at it: I cann't help it that they didn't find it FIRST. That's because they were NOT applying common sense and being 100% honest. Morality plays a LARGE factor here, so be honest in whatever you do. Would you be interested in helping me crack the Da Vinci Code? Its a lot of "fun", but also a LOT of work. However nobody else has cracked it yet. But I have...... --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Coldwell_1d90.html" title="User:Doug Coldwell">Doug</a> 11:35, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The question was not a medical one per se, but the questioner might be well advised to find a psychologist and discuss these concerns with him. A person who is "pretty smart" who is not getting what he wants out of life might have some degree of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfectionism_%28psychology%29.html" title="Perfectionism (psychology)">perfectionism</a>, <a href="../../../o/b/s/Obsessive-compulsive_disorder.html" title="Obsessive-compulsive disorder">Obsessive-compulsive disorder</a>, or <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clinical_depression.html" title="Clinical depression">Clinical depression</a> leading to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Procrastination.html" title="Procrastination">Procrastination</a>, and might benefit from medication, which a psychiatrist or in some cases his regular doctor could prescribe after evaluating him. Persons who are more comfortable interacting with others via Wikipedia rather than real life might find the article <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger%27s_Syndrome_18a6.html" title="Asperger's Syndrome">Asperger's Syndrome</a> interesting. I have read biographies of famous scientists or inventors wherein the biographer said that when he was interacting with the great one, he could keep pace with the overachiever on an hour by hour basis, working beside him in the lab or theorizing in the office, but was amazed by what the great one achieved on a day by day, year by year basis. Part of it was time on task: they just kept at it persistently and did not stop. There was also the ability to not be stopped by an obstacle: instead they would renew an attack on the problem from a different direction, or they would attack it from several directions at once. Many people get into <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analysis_paralysis.html" title="Analysis paralysis">paralysis by analysis</a> in that they try to devise the perfect plan rather than trying a reasonable approach, and if it fails try a different reasonable approach. The opposite type of person, sometimes called "A to B' just says "What are the requirements, and get out of my way," then sets off on an attack on the problem. <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Edison_ebd8.html" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a> was an example of day to day year to year tireless productivity, and every field of science or industry has countless similar examples. Of course, the focus on the main interprise often meant they neglected their family or friends, so balance is necessary. The case most in need of counseling or medical management is someone who lacks family and friends and also has no business or career or fun. Life should be more than a waiting room. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:04, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do believe Mr. Edison has some EXCELLENT advice for the original questioner. I would like to also throw in the name Leonardo <a href="../../../d/a/_/Da_Vinci_0eec.html" title="Da Vinci">Da Vinci</a>, whom also was an example of day to day year to year tireless productivity. He was a self motivator. He also had <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobbies.html" title="Hobbies">hobbies</a>. He liked to tinker with <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invention.html" title="Invention">inventions</a>. As we all know he came up with some inventions that were way ahead of their time. He is called the "<a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance_man.html" title="Renaissance man">Renaissance man</a>". Now another less known figure about 100 years before him that also was an example of day to day year to year tireless productivity was the Italian scholar Francesco <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrarch.html" title="Petrarch">Petrarch</a>. He ALSO had hobbies. One of his hobbies was the collection of ancient and crumbling Latin manuscripts or anything classical in the way of old books or Codexs. He did this during his extensive travels throughout Europe in the Fourteenth Century. He also was a tireless writer. He wrote in Latin some of the most famous poems ever written. In fact, Petrarch is considered the "Father of the Renaissance". Presently this is the person I am studing much, because he came up with some great <a href="../../../i/d/e/Idea.html" title="Idea">ideas</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/n/Innovation.html" title="Innovation">innovations</a> that originally came from <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plato.html" title="Plato">Plato</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socrates.html" title="Socrates">Socrates</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristotle.html" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>. He then reintroduced their ideas and this is called the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, which means "rebirth". Check out Petrarch's section on "Philosophy" which I believe you will find most interesting. His hobby of writing was so extensive that to this day we have only translated a part of what he wrote about. One of his books he wrote is called "Book Without A Name" (Latin: Liber Sine Nomine) which is a book written in <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code.html" title="Code">Code</a>. This is the reason for the title "....without a name" because he left out the names of the people he was writing about. He also wrote other <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codex.html" title="Codex">Codexes</a> and manuscripts using <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code.html" title="Code">codes</a>. This Code I call The Petrarch Code since it was invented by Francesco Petrarch and it is definitely a type of code. His other works have NOT yet been decoded yet since MOST scholars are not aware it is in fact a code. I have found many elements to this code already. Would you be interested in helping me crack The Petrarch Code? It will take a LOT of work and MUCH concentration, however it is a lot of "fun". One of the reasons it is so much "fun" is that (as far I know) there is no other scholars that have discovered this. Does it sound interesting and "fun" or does it sound like too much work. Be for warned that MANY people will criticize you, so be prepared for this. If you can NOT take criticism, then I would recommend that you NOT work on cracking The Petrarch Code..... --<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Coldwell_1d90.html" title="User:Doug Coldwell">Doug</a> 17:29, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You won't like my answer but, you'd have to ask a doctor;). I'm not one, but I do know that when the label says tell your doctor if you are on any of this other medication, they MEAN IT! Drugs can have surprising and NON intuitive side effects when taken with other drugs. brain chemistry is very complex, a normal person taking the medication of a schizophrenic may get completely different effects from the medication. For example, Antagonising OVERACTIVE dopamine to treat chorea may simply bring it to normal levels, not causing further depression at all. A doctor's job is to determine and weigh up all the positives and negatives of the treatments, there may be alternative treatments to chorea, partly why most people believe medical advice shouldn't be given out over the internet. <a href="../../../v/e/s/User%7EVespine_669a.html" title="User:Vespine">Vespine</a> 02:52, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It's not the best of sources, but according to a 1990s-2000s fiction television show there is no cure for Huntington's. That means you need medication to treat the symptoms and suppress the progression of the disease. That would require at least 2 different meds. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:24, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I didn't assume you had Huntington's, but your question is still asking for something that could vary greatly depending on each individual case and could only be answered by a doctor who has evaluated the individual. If someone gave you an answer, even if it was well educated, someone else could come across this site and read the answer to be more authoritative then it could possibly be. <a href="../../../v/e/s/User%7EVespine_669a.html" title="User:Vespine">Vespine</a> 21:43, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>One further thing, the article states it is a genetic disorder so there is no cure, we can't currently cure genetic disorders. It also states <i>There are treatments available to help control the chorea, although these may have the side effect of aggravating bradykinesia or dystonia.</i> So the mechanism is known at least to some degree. On the chorea article it further states <i>There is no standard course of treatment for chorea</i> so I think you are barking up the wrong tree. A doctor would take all that into account, including if depression or any other conditions are a concern and would tailor treatments and controls suitable for the individual. A doctor should not give you medication for one affliction if the side effects outweigh the benefits..<a href="../../../v/e/s/User%7EVespine_669a.html" title="User:Vespine">Vespine</a> 21:50, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Q1: There is no treatment for the underlying cause of HD, but there are good treatments for relieving symptoms. Q2: An antidepressant may or may not cause problems, there is no "scientific" answer, only individualised therapy. Without going into details, the principles would be: Initially choose medications that have been shown to help the specific symptom, and then watch the person for <a href="../../../s/i/d/Side-effect.html" title="Side-effect">side-effects</a>. Then the choice is then to either treat the side-effect, or try a different drug. There are numerous ways of treating the symptoms of depression, conventional anti-depressants not necessarily being the best, or giving better results. Whatever the doctor chooses, it is really just a matter of accurate follow-up and changing medicines appropriately. It is a matter of individualised poly-pharmacy, <i>and</i> not working straight from a textbook about normal people, <i>and</i> the doctor knowing what she is doing, <i>and</i> the patient (or family) learning to observe and report positive and negative effects, <i>and</i> it being a mutual responsibility (doctor, therapist, patient and family) to find ways of improving the situation - there is no "theoretically right treatment". Clear goals and honest communication is the only way to go. --<a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeejyb_2418.html" title="User:Seejyb">Seejyb</a> 01:26, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not an expert at all, and this is not a definative answer, but perhaps a pointer towards an explanation. Yesterday I had the pleasure of meeting <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Greengard_1679.html" title="Paul Greengard">Paul Greengard</a>, a Nobel Prize winner for work on dopamine mediated signal transduction in the nervous system. He talked at some length about his work and, what I learned from him, was how a multitude of neuro-stimuli including <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antipsychotic_drugs.html" title="Antipsychotic drugs">antipsychotic drugs</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol.html" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/f/Caffiene.html" title="Caffiene">caffiene</a>, <a href="../../../l/s/d/LSD_cccf.html" title="LSD">LSD</a>, <a href="../../../p/h/e/Phencyclidine.html" title="Phencyclidine">PCP</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/c/Cocaine.html" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marijuana.html" title="Marijuana">marijuana</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/p/Amphetamines.html" title="Amphetamines">amphetamines</a>, <a href="../../../r/i/t/Ritalin.html" title="Ritalin">ritalin</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prozac.html" title="Prozac">prozac</a> - many of which produce contrasting physiological effects and act through different transductions pathways - all converge at a common protein called <a href="../../../d/a/r/DARPP-32_6378.html" title="DARPP-32">DARPP-32</a>. It at first seems impossible to imagine how a single protein can mediate such different neurochemical effects. But - and I couldn't do the complexity or elegance of the system justice here - an incredibly sophisticated network of positive and negative feedback loops via <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kinase.html" title="Kinase">kinases</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phosphatase.html" title="Phosphatase">phosphatases</a> interact to give the protein a remarkable scope of action. Indeed DARPP-32 itself can be phosphorylated on up to seven different <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serine.html" title="Serine">serine</a> sites. Combinations of <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phosphorylation.html" title="Phosphorylation">phosphorylation</a> at least four of them are known to regulate its activity, and thus the proteins that DARPP-32 itself phosphorylates.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now here is how this is related your your query: these sites are phosphorylated independently by downstream cascades of different <a href="../../../d/o/p/Dopamine_receptor.html" title="Dopamine receptor">dopamine receptor</a> classes (D1-like or D2-like receptors). Moreover, other neurotransmitter signalling pathways have a huge, and differential, influence on DARPP-32 phosphorylaytion downstream of, and at the level of, both receptors. In other words, the same "dose" of dopamine at <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synapse.html" title="Synapse">synapse</a> can give very different responses via DARPP-32, depending on the receptor it signals through. And the local signaling environment for a given neuron - which can change from second to second - can effect both the type of dompamine receptor that is active and the effect of either receptor's signaling at DARPP-32.</dd>
<dd>So, while I don't have a specific answer for you, I believe Greengard's body of work - coupled with the consideration of signaling through different dopamine receptors - provides a mechanism that can explain why modulation of dopaminergic signaling can result in such seemingly paradoxical effects. <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a> 02:47, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Though I thought the questioner was simply trolling in a rather unsophisticated way, I liked your answer, Rocketpocket, and envy the opportunity you had. It is wonderful to see how the basic scientists are working out <i>why</i> real life health problems, such as drug responses, are as tricky as are. --<a href="../../../s/e/e/User%7ESeejyb_2418.html" title="User:Seejyb">Seejyb</a> 15:44, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you. I was very lucky. Greengard is a remarkable character (what <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearl_Meister_Greengard_Prize_18bc.html" title="Pearl Meister Greengard Prize">he did</a> with his Nobel Prize winnings speaks volumes about the man) and his work is incredibly inspiring. I heard today that I'm going to have the opportunity to have dinner with another Nobel winner, <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Brenner_9683.html" title="Sydney Brenner">Sydney Brenner</a> in a few weeks. So if anyone has any good RD questions on <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caenorhabditis_elegans.html" title="Caenorhabditis elegans">Caenorhabditis elegans</a> or <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genomics.html" title="Genomics">genomics</a> I'll put them to him. I'm hopeful that if I meet enough of these people, some of their genius will rub off!&#160;;) <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockpocket_2e94.html" title="User:Rockpocket"><font color="green">Rockpock</font></a><font color="black">e</font><a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERockpocket_62af.html" title="User talk:Rockpocket"><font color="green">t</font></a> 19:02, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
