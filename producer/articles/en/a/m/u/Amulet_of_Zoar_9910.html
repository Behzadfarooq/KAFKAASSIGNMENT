	    <p>The Amulet of Zoar is a magical artefact from <i><a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Lightning_c0ff.html" title="Ace Lightning">Ace Lightning</a></i> and is the primary item. It is a triangular item, gold and silver in colour with four purple gems incrested into its three points and centre. It was created by Zoar, the ruler of the Sixth Dimension. The Amulet is shattered at the start of the show and it is the goal of <a href="../../../a/c/e/Ace_Lightning_%28character%29_3aa0.html" title="Ace Lightning (character)">Ace Lightning</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_Fear_1f82.html" title="Lord Fear">Lord Fear</a> to collect the fragments and rebuild the Amulet. If Ace got the Amulet, he would be superpowered and could seal Lord Fear and his gang in prison in the <a href="../../../s/i/x/Sixth_Dimension_4e55.html" title="Sixth Dimension">Sixth Dimension</a>. If Lord Fear obtained the Amulet, he would develop untold powers and could conquer the universe. Known powers of the Amulet include being able to summon characters from the game when two pieces come into contact and can open portals to and from the game.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/u/Amulet_of_Zoar_9910.html" title="Edit section: Season 1">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Season 1</span></h2>
<p>According to the Ace Lightning Guidebook, <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Illusion_220a.html" title="Lady Illusion">Lady Illusion</a> freed Lord Fear and his minions from prison and they stole the Amulet of Zoar. Ace gave chase and in the following battle, the Amulet was broke and it opened a portal to Earth. Lord Fear and his minions escaped through it first, with Ace following behind. The Amulet followed but it mysteriously shattered and the pieces scattered. Lord Fear found a piece of the Amulet practically after he arrived on Earth while Ace found the centre piece of the Amulet shortly after, which he later gave to Mark for protection. Lord Fear moved into the Carnival of Doom where he captured Ace briefly and continued to try and grab Mark's piece of the Amulet.</p>
<p>The third piece of the Amulet, the top point of the artifact, was revealed to be in the possession of Lady Illusion (although not many people took it into account and mistook it for Lord Fear's piece of the Amulet). She gave it over to Lord Fear willingly. The fourth fragment was discovered by <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Villains_of_Ace_Lightning_60f8.html#Dirty_Rat" title="Minor Villains of Ace Lightning">Dirty Rat</a> as he had picked up its unique sense and found it by digging underground. Lord Fear used it to summon <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Villains_of_Ace_Lightning_60f8.html#Googler" title="Minor Villains of Ace Lightning">Googler</a> from White Hot Oblivion.</p>
<p>Several days on, Dirty Rat came up with a devious plan. He stole Mark's and Lord Fear's pieces of the Amulet and connected them, summoning <a href="../../../r/a/n/Random_Virus_%28Ace_Lightning%29_3c6d.html" title="Random Virus (Ace Lightning)">Random Virus</a>. Ace later detected the fifth fragment, located in a claw machine in a jar. While Ace was losing to Lord Fear and <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Villains_of_Ace_Lightning_60f8.html#Anvil" title="Minor Villains of Ace Lightning">Anvil</a>, Mark worked the claw machine and obtained the fragment, summoning <a href="../../../s/p/a/Sparx_%28Ace_Lightning%29_df3f.html" title="Sparx (Ace Lightning)">Sparx</a> to Earth. Sparx was later destroyed by Googler and sent back to the game.</p>
<p>Ace had developed a hatred for <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garden_gnomes.html" title="Garden gnomes">garden gnomes</a> (although it's not surprising as killer garden gnomes are an enemy in the computer game) and destroyed one outside Duff Kent's trailer. Interestingly enough the sixth piece of the Amulet was located inside to Ace's delight and he slowly searched for Mark, finding him at a campsite. The two connected their fragments and Sparx made her return.</p>
<p>The final fragment showed up in Episode 24, hidden in a prize box at the carnival. Lady Illusion, disguised as a carnival worker, was stunned when the piece was picked up by Samantha. Lady Illusion and Dirty Rat tried to get it back but failed too. Lord Fear heard what happened and went with Dirty Rat to get the piece from Samantha, who was in the school play. Lord Fear got caught up in the play, starting to play the organ and forgetting all about the fragment. Dirty Rat, however, scooped up the fragment and plotted to use it to overthrow Lord Fear.</p>
<p>The next day, Sparx was captured and had Dirty Rat guard her. Dirty Rat got the other minions together and they revolted against Lord Fear and started to chase him. Meanwhile, Lady Illusion was sent by Staff Head to get the rest of Ace's pieces of the Amulet, presumably getting those from the Thunder Tower and then obtaining Mark's while disguised as Sparx. Lord Fear obtained those pieces and managed to persuade Dirty Rat to rejoin him and gained the final piece of the Amulet.</p>
<p>Now that Lord Fear had the Amulet, the Lightning Knights slowly started to lose their powers. Mark explained from the rulebook that they would now have to fight the villains and get the Amulet back, but if any of their energy dropped below 12%, they would die. Ace, Sparx and Random went to the Carnival of Doom and did battle with the villains, but were losing badly. Mark snuck into the haunted house and tried to beat Lord Fear in his game, but lost. He then realised the Amulet was hidden in Lord Fear's organ. After playing the right notes, Mark obtained the Amulet and shattered it, automatically winning the game and killing Lord Fear and his gang.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/u/Amulet_of_Zoar_9910.html" title="Edit section: Season 2">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Season 2</span></h2>
<p>In Season 2, Mark now possessed the Amulet but hid the pieces around his house. Lady Illusion disguised herself as a housekeeper named Felicity Fury and took it upon herself to find the fragments so she could return home. However, the Master Programmer revived Lord Fear and Staff Head and Lady Illusion had to work for him again. Lady Illusion quickly located two pieces of the Amulet in Mark's room and Lord Fear used them to summon <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Villains_of_Ace_Lightning_60f8.html#Rotgut" title="Minor Villains of Ace Lightning">Rotgut</a> from the Sixth Dimension.</p>
<p>Lady Illusion found another fragment the following day that was hidden in a prank snake jar. Lord Fear summoned Anvil back from the game. Soon on, Lady Illusion found a fourth piece by shattering a vase in Mark's house. However, this was the last piece she would retrieve in her guise as Felicity. <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilobyte_%28Ace_Lightning%29_5c37.html" title="Kilobyte (Ace Lightning)">Ace Lightning</a> appeared and for a long time decided not to obtain any more pieces of the Amulet.</p>
<p>He and Dirty Rat retrieved the fifth fragment from Mark's backyard by digging up the garden, and Lord Fear used it to summon <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_Villains_of_Ace_Lightning_60f8.html#Pigface" title="Minor Villains of Ace Lightning">Pigface</a> back from the game. Lady Illusion obtained the sixth fragment at the carnival when Mark left his bag unattended and Lord Fear used it to summon Googler back, completing the villains. The final fragment was obtained by Kilobyte when he ambushed Mark at the carnival. However, Kilobyte was destroyed by Lord Fear, Mark and Lady Illusion disguised as Ace. The Amulet was shattered by the blast and the pieces flew off.</p>

<p>The cancelled Season 3 would have featured the Amulet again, but Lord Fear would not possess it as he was on the run, and would try to use Mr. Cheseborough's technology to summon his minions back from the game.</p>
