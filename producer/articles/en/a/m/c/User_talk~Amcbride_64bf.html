<p>Hi Allen, thanks for your note. I've looked at the history and where I wrote "rv to 02:29 December 21" I meant to write "rv to 02:59" i.e. the last version by 70.248.252.11. I can't see anything the anons added that should have been kept, unless you mean these quotes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals&amp;diff=32460689&amp;oldid=32188936" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=People_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals&amp;diff=32460689&amp;oldid=32188936" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> at least some of which I believe are already on the page. But you're certainly welcome to add any that aren't if you can find full citations, and also make sure the person is still involved with PETA, or at least was until recently. One of the quotes from an outreach person is from 16 years ago, which I'd say wouldn't be appropriate to include unless she's still involved. There are some <a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingrid_Newkirk_3294.html" title="Ingrid Newkirk">Ingrid Newkirk</a> quotes <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ingrid_Newkirk" class="external text" title="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ingrid_Newkirk" rel="nofollow">here</a> you might want to look at, though I see they're mostly unreferenced.

<p>"We know that Saddam has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country. Iraq's search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power...We have a goal of regime change in Iraq, we have had for a number of years. We also have a clear goal of victory in the war against terror. In the case of Iraq, it would be difficult to go it alone, but it's theoretically possible to achieve our goals in Iraq unilaterall."</p>
<p>Gore did go very anti-Iraq following the failure of finding WMD's.</p>

<p>I see you have made some changes to Al Gore controversies.

<p>Hi, there were two Supreme Court votes in Gore vs. Bush. The first (7-2) said that selective recounts with different standards were not allowed. The second (5-4) said that time was over ... all votes had already been tabulated several times with consistent standards. You keep changing the first vote to be 5-4. Regardless of our political leanings, can we not all agree that facts should remain as facts? Yes, the more important 7-2 vote is not as widely reported, but the facts are the facts. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jkwikiwiki (<a href="../../../j/k/w/User_talk%7EJkwikiwiki_d459.html" title="User talk:Jkwikiwiki">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jkwikiwiki_598b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jkwikiwiki">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>128.111.95.210hi allen thanks for your welcome. I am learning. Please explain what 'revert' means and who does it. Also I notice that some articles I edit are packed from stem to stern with self-serving points of view by those the subject of such articles. Is POV by ommission ever disciplined here? For example the Mennonite people have a long history of banning, shunning, and shaming those who fail to conform going back hundreds of years yet there is little such mention in their wikipedia history. A quick glance at any good secular history on the Mennonites shows such POV by ommission. How do I combat POV by ommision that without becoming a POV target myself and without having to fight tooth and nail against the Mennonite gang to include each uncomfortable but legitimate word here.?</p>

<p>Thanks Allen. The POV response helped me a lot. By discipline I meant a code of conduct and people who call character assassination here etc. To me discipline and standards are quite friendly because they eliminate the Hobbesian hate. I will also see what I can do to get a name so i can find myself here! Thanks again you play an important role. 128.111.95.210 06:10, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I write briefly just to pass along my thanks for your recent edits; though small, they surely helped further a neutral tone in the article, something for which the article has been sorely lacking. Most notably, though, I write apropos of your talk page post about having inadvertently confused NPOV and POV; even as you confused the two phrases, your edits still better depicted neutrality than most that have been made to the article (by those who know, or ought to know, the difference).

<p>I've added a section to the talk page to see if we can get a consensus on what the paragraph should say.

<p>The edits which have been aged on the discussion page are immediately removed when they are posted.</p>
<p>You have evidently violated the implicit terms of confidentiality expected from a Wiki administrator and broadcast the name of a person who wrote you all over the site.</p>

<p>And now you are acting as if you are paid to suppress important truths about a company which may be engaging in dubious behavior.</p>

<p>Do you have any solution in mind?</p>

<dl>
<dd>Hi Creator. Thanks for moving this comment up to the top of my page; I can't figure out what's wrong with the formatting down at the bottom. I'll move it back down there when I figure it out. First off, I'm not a Wikipedia administrator, just a regular editor, but you have a point about confidentiality. I could probably be convinced that I shouldn't have used your real name on the USAA talk page, and I apologize if I shouldn't have. In this case, though, I think it was okay for me to do that, because you originally posted under your real name. I don't believe that editors' real-life identities should be broadcast if they don't want them to be; but on the other hand, I think that <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppet</a> accounts should be tied to the original account that they are sockpuppets of. In this case, I believe that User:Creator 18-2 is a sockpuppet of User:Robertjkoenig.</dd>

<dd>Second, I apologize for not responding to your e-mail when you posted it on <a href="../../../u/s/a/Talk%7EUSAA_83ef.html" title="Talk:USAA">Talk:USAA</a>. Here is my response, which I will post on that Talk page as well in a few minutes: I cannot formally give you "permission" to revert my edits, but I will continue to revert <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unsourced allegations</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">self-referential edits</a> (edits to the article that refer to the article as an article, or to the editing process). So in that informal sense, no; you do not have my permission to revert my edits. Finally, responding to your message here, I don't know of any process by which edits are "aged" on talk pages. They are discussed on talk pages. There appears to be a durable consensus on the USAA talk page that most of your proposed edits do not belong in the article. Until that consensus changes, no amount of time will make them belong in the article. As Movementarian and others have pointed out before, some of your ideas could reasonably be included in the article, if they were sourced in a way that they didn't look like <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 17:03, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for pointing these other links out to me. Infowars.com, like WING TV, has too much advertising to be a good external link, though as far as I can tell it isn't included right now. Prisonplanet.net doesn't have as much advertising, but a partisan website, and as a site that is not widely accepted as a legitimate news source, it should only be used as a primary source and not as a secondary source. As an external link, I think it's okay here, as long as it's a notable proponent of the 9/11 Truth Movement. Please see <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External_links</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> for some guidelines on what make for good external links and reliable sources.

<p>Isn't it redundant to call a black person who lives in America "African-American", because if you are in America, it is quite obvious that he would be African American and not just African. That would be like calling squares "rhomboid rectangles". 1028 00:02, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay, so according to <a href="http://lovely-clemence.skyblog.com/" class="external text" title="http://lovely-clemence.skyblog.com/" rel="nofollow">this</a> page, the "grunge" info comes from an interview in german <i><a href="../../../g/l/a/Glamour_%28magazine%29.html" title="Glamour (magazine)">Glamour</a></i>. I'm trying to find a copy of that on the web, or a proper english language source. Still working on the "cares more about acting than fame angle". Incidentally i am curious as to why you thought these pieces of trivia could be damamging. Even if you acknowledge grunge as an inherantly negative thing, the fact already stated that the woman had rejected it. Also, putting "the craft" before fame and fortune is generally seen as an honourable, rather than damaging, thing for an actor. And since when has wikipedia only included the positive? <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoammo_73c6.html" title="User:Amoammo">Amo</a> 00:30, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Amo; thanks for your post. I agree that both these things can be seen as positive (and I'm all for grunge, personally). And I agree that Wikipedia can (and should) include negative things about people as well as positive. However, while everything on Wikipedia should be sourced <i>eventually</i>, negative things about living people should be sourced <i>immediately</i>. There is a guideline about this at <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a>. And though I agree that the Clemence Poesy statements aren't necessarily negative, my opinion is that they're easily enough interpreted as negative that they should have a source, sooner rather than later. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 00:40, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If you step into this, be aware that AlexR will claim that you are a sockpuppet of me or vice versa. I came to Wikipedia on May 26 about 22:22 wikitime because a friend that started the article voice feminization and gave up trying to even do anything here because of AlexR.</p>
<p>Since I have been here, AlexR has been constantly abusive and generally reverts any change made to any article. The original argument is about the terms ciswoman and cisman that are used without a source. Attempts made to get a source were responded with AlexR being abusive and when I pointed out that ciswoman and cisman were not even defined on wikipedia AlexR added it 17:05, 28 May 2006 with the coment (if you missed it so much ...) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cisgender&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55592661" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cisgender&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55592661" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> without adding a source to cisgender.</p>
<p>Since then I have been attempting to get ciswoman and cisman removed from cisgender and have been reading the howto’s and trying to get familiar and asking for sources. Trying to do what in says in the guidelines, and I get responses like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cisgender&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55759305" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cisgender&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=55759305" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>,</p>
<p>AlexR even admits adding the reference to ciswoman and cisman in response to my complints <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cisgender&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56471733" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cisgender&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56471733" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, ‘’First, you complain that it is not in this article, and insult and vandalize in FV, then I put it in here, and then you descend on this article.’’</p>
<p>Alex then goes gives a reference to a ‘blog’ that does not define the term linguistically, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cisgender&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56800369" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cisgender&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56800369" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, and are not allowed per wikipedia.</p>
<p>AlexR again shows that the terms ciswoman and cisman were added in response to the problems with it being used incorrectly in voice feminization. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-06-04_Cisgender&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56958363" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2006-06-04_Cisgender&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56958363" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>The comment says that it cannot be deleted because AlexR didn’t put it there and until I ask the person that did, it should not be deleted. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cisgender&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57000830" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cisgender&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57000830" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
<p>AlexR says “Since you can not prove it is false” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cisgender&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56957085" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cisgender&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=56957085" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> Ah, no – the rule is if you want it to stay, you provide a valid reference. And it was proved false with the statement that it could not be found with a google search.</p>
<p>AlexR tries to claim harassment when all I have been trying to do is get a valid reference that, since I looked for it, know that it does not exist out via google. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cisgender&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57001685" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Cisgender&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=57001685" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> AlexR refused to believe that usenet posts are not valid according to quoted wikipedia policy. (see ‘’’Talk:Cisgender’’’ Removing Reference per Wikipedia:Reliable_sources# Reliability of online sources – where I bold Usenet posts… are not acceptable as sources)</p>
<p>Along there has been slander, vulgarity (17:55, 22 May 2006 – vulgarity in comments) and general abuse.</p>
<p>(shrug) Come in and enjoy – or stay away</p>
<p>– Help if you can, but be aware if you do, you will be called all sorts of names and be told how stupid you are for arguing with AlexR.</p>
<p>I have to admit, that I can not argue with that last point... (grin)</p>

<p>Dear Allen, thank you so much for your beautiful words, your kidness and your trust in me. My <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Phaedriel_2_3e0a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Phaedriel 2">Request for Adminship</a> is finally over, and the support and appreciation that the community has gifted me will stick in my mind as long as I live. I have no way to properly express how grateful I am to you for all you've done for me, and all I can tell you is, I'll try not to disappoint you nor anyone else with my use of the buttons... and if I mess up, make sure to <a href="../../../p/h/a/User_talk%7EPhaedriel_a4cd.html" title="User talk:Phaedriel">come here</a> and give me a good yell!&#160;:) Seriously, tho, if you ever need my help, either for admin-related stuff or in any other way, you'll always be welcome to message me, and I promise I'll try my very best.<br />
Dear Allen, this is the perfect opportunity to finally speak to one another after reading your words for months and months. I am sure that we'll be able to talk often, and trust me, it'd be my pleasure. Both your contributions and, most important your warm way to deal with others made me notice you long, long ago; and being supported by a person I look up to, like you, meant the world to me. I sincerely hope this is but the beginning of a friendship, and such thought fills me with joy. Plus, as I always say... handsome Wikipedians <i>always</i> deserve special attention!&#160;:) With a big hug, your friend,</p>

<dd><font color="#FF0000">Hi. This one is in a bit of a grey-area. Although all of the edis from the IP do seem to be vandalism and the IP has been blocked twice in the last few weeks, there is not a large volume of edits and they have currently stopped. I would prefer to give the benefit of the doubt that they might have finally stopped, but I will keep an eye on them.
