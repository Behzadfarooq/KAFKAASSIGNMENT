<dd>It has been discussed thoroughly here and in more places than it should even be. WP is not about building sandcastles. WP is about creating quality articles. And WP is certainly not about pursuing an agenda! Bravada, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_8b8b.html" title="User talk:Bravada">talk</a> - 01:25, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Legacy isn't this the sort of thing that makes wp great instead of being deleted by dueling editors??</p>
<p>The Eagle would be the last AMC car before the 1988 Eagle Premier . By the 1990s, Subaru switched to a product line made completely of all-wheel-drive cars. Many auto reviewers remarked that the first sport utility wagon should be the Eagle, not the Subaru Outback, currently a best selling wagon in the US. Audi would also sell many AWD cars.</p>
<p><br />
Chrysler would not introduce another all-wheel-drive sedan or wagon util the Chrysler Pacifica and Chrysler 300C. With the the Ford 500 / Freestyle and many european nameplates, the idea of the Eagle is finally coming of age.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ol>
<li>There are many cars which were last cars by a company before the next cars of the company, including cases where this was the penultimate car of the company. If we stuffed articles with factoids like that, they would soon become undigestible. People wanting to explore AMC history further could see that in the AMC article, or could easily see that in the timeline template you said you are about to make.</li>
<li>Whether the Eagle Premier, which was never intended to be branded as AMC nor was actually made by AMC as such, can be called an "AMC car", is debatable. The fragment concerned tries to established a controversial POV as a fact.</li>
<li>The fragment on Chrysler's AWD vehicles is moderately relevant, but we can live without such info per 1.</li>
<li>There are many cars to which similar cars are now sold and are popular, but the other car was not popular, but it could be popular, but people didn't appreciate that, but they should, becuase it was a revolutionary car, and if the company existed today, it would flourish, but it doesn't, but it's a shame, but they should nevertheless be praised... blah blah blah. This is far from factual information, this is car mag column stuff, or material for a nostalgia book.</li>
</ol>
<p>May I refer you to Wikipedia rules and directions as to what to include and what not to include in an article, as well as how to write the article, what the WP is and what it is not? Please acquaint yourself with that. Pay attention to WP policy on "weasel words" and "original research". I see there is no welcome message in your talk page, which is a shame, therefore please see the one on top of my talk page for useful links.<br />
In short - anything which is not a 100% fact has no place in WP, and not anything which is a fact has a place in every article. Regards, Bravada, <a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBravada_8b8b.html" title="User talk:Bravada">talk</a> - 16:36, 24 June 2006 (UTC)<br />

<dd>I see that you also added the Eagle Premier and Chrysler 300 as "successors" to the Eagle, which is quite ridiculous since the Premier and Chrysler 300 are COMPLETELY different from the Eagle. The Eagle was an AWD compact car, the Premier was a near-luxury, full-size FWD sedan and the Chrysler 300 is a RWD/AWD full-size luxury sedan. To say that the 300 is the successor to the Eagle would be akin to saying that Bill Clinton was the successor to Jimmy Carter. While Clinton was the next Democrat as president after Carter (like how the 300 was the next Chrysler AWD car after the Eagle), he did not succeed Carter as president. --<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApolloBoy_2382.html" title="User:ApolloBoy">ApolloBoy</a> 05:02, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Sport package was available on the 1980 Eagle coupe, sedan, and wagon, according to my 1980 AMC brochure. It included the AMC Spirit's hood and straight trim piece at the hood's leading edge, as opposed to the standard Eagle hood, which came from the Concord and had a heavier header bar. The Sport package was not added for 1981.</p>
<p>1982 models did NOT get the tow package as standard equipment. The light-duty trailer package is listed in the 1982 American Motors full line catalog, not as standard equipment, but as an option. Also, '82 models added a wide-ratio automatic transmission and low-drag disc brakes for better fuel economy.</p>
<p>The Series 30 Eagle 2-door sedan was discontinued after 1982, not 1983, as my 1983 AMC full line brochure indicates. Also, the AMC 2.5L I4 became available on the Eagle in May 1983, according to Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976-1999. So alledgedly some (though most likely very few) 1983 Eagles were or could have been equipped with it.</p>
<p>Shift-on-the-fly capability was introduced for the 1985 model year, not 1984 as the article says. I'd need to see some sort of documentation to support the claim that only the Series 30 wagon was available for public sale from 1984-on. The sedan was featured in the 1984, 85, 86, and 87 retail brochures.</p>
<p>It also mentions the debut of Shift-on-the-fly, confusingly, again under 1985, though it fails to mention the fact that the Sport hood and front fascia trim became standard, while the former hood was no longer used, making this the Eagle's last styling change. And the Eagle picked up a key fob activated remote locking system as an option.</p>
<p>Under "1988", the article could stand to note that the last Eagle was built on December 14, 1987, according to Patrick Foster's "American Motors: The Last Independent", as well as other sources.</p>
<p>If I recieve no disputes, I'll update the page. Rhettro76 02:31, 2 March 2007 (UTC)Rhettro76</p>
