	    <p>I have some doubts about a couple of things here. I've never heard of a supercompact. What would that be? And I've never seen or heard of a four-door Gremlin. Thought I'd give a chance for discussion before I did any editing, though. <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERivGuySC_0a98.html" title="User:RivGuySC">RivGuySC</a> 18:25, 14 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Got a thought on the Simpsons--maybe an additional reference. I'm not an expert on the series, but it seems to me I remember a flashback episode where Marge drove a Gremlin while she and Homer were dating. (It was the one where he suggests she wear her hair up--advice which was stricly attended to!) <a href="../../../r/i/v/User%7ERivGuySC_0a98.html" title="User:RivGuySC">RivGuySC</a> 16:16, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There was also a Halloween special send-up of the old William Shatner <i>Twilight Zone</i> episode where Shatner keeps seeing a gremlin on the wing of the plane he is travelling on, but the crew and the other passages don't believe him until it's too late. In the <i>Simpsons</i> version, Bart sees a gremlin busy sabatoging the bus, but when the bus driver looks out the window, the only gremlin he can see is a '73 Gremlin in the next lane, which he proceeds to run off the road. --<a href="../../../j/p/b/User%7EJpbrenna_8d3a.html" title="User:Jpbrenna">Jpbrenna</a> 01:51, 3 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>Wasn't this in Waynes World and also in that new TV show 'Heros' (Driven by the woman with split personalities).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Also, see this:The Gremlin in the movie <i>Wayne's World</i>: Someone continues to add that a Gremlin was in the movie Wayne's World, as the car the one of the main characters drove to see Queen's <i>Bohemien Rhapsody</i>. The car in this movie was a <a href="../../../a/m/c/AMC_Pacer_cb69.html" title="AMC Pacer">Pacer</a>, not a Gremlin. I later deleted the misinormation. thank you.<a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHondasaregood_6b30.html" title="User:Hondasaregood">Hondasaregood</a> 19:46, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Hornet had a wheelbase of 108 inches, which, by the definition of the Wikipedia article on mid-size cars, is mid-size. Therefore, I reverted the edits that changed mid-size to compact back to mid-size. <a href="../../../r/s/d/User%7ERsduhamel_fe61.html" title="User:Rsduhamel">Rsduhamel</a> 13:54, 7 April, 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Rsduhamel- I have reverted your edits noted above because passenger volume also is used to determine the size classification of a vehicle. Based on US governmental standards in place in 1970, the Gremlin was most certainly a sub-compact (having been shoe horned into the back seat of a Gremlin as a junior high school student I can attest that the seating area was limited, in the kindest possible terms), and was also most certainly the first U.S. sub-compact built by a major US automaker in the United States since 1960.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, the AMC Hornet, was a compact, not a mid-size car as you indicatedand that has been reverted as well. That reversion is based upon its size compared to US standards at that time, including interior volume. While the lengths of these cars by todays standards may make them seem mid-sized, I can assure you that when they came out in 1970, both the Hornet and the Gremlin were small cars.</dd>
<dd>Also, please sign your talk page posts by type 4 tildas (~~~~) at the end of you post. This signs the post and time stamps it. Thanks, <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStude62_1ae3.html" title="User:Stude62">Stude62</a> 14:41, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think that, since it depends on what standard you subscribe to, it should be clear that the Hornet could be considered mid-size or compact. I noted this in the article. I also tried to clarify the comparison between the Hornet and the Gremlin that I tried to convey when I wrote the original article. Hope I didn't step on any toes. <a href="../../../r/s/d/User%7ERsduhamel_fe61.html" title="User:Rsduhamel">Rsduhamel</a> 06:18, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The second paragraph didn't make much sense, opening with: "Chief stylist Richard A. Teague came up with an ingenious solution;" A solution to what? This was referring back to a previous sentence which had been removed in an earlier edit. I have therefore found and reinstated that text ("AMC knew that Ford and General Motors were coming out with subcompact cars in 1971 but did not have the resources to respond with one of their own.") This sentence was removed by User:66.201.16.203 on 23 April, as part of a wider edit. I don't know why it was removed, but that change made semantic nonsense of the text immediately following.</p>

<p>I've merged content from List of 1971 American Motors automobiles, but since it's a list of specifications sourced from Oct. 1970 Popular Mechanics, I think it's safe to delete the article as long as I provide proper attribution. So here is the article history before I deleted it:</p>

<p>I removed then replaced the following sentence:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Gremlin was not a true hatchback as only its rear window could be opened, except for 2-seat models, which employed a fixed backlight.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm sure my four-seat Gremlin was indeed a true hatchback but that was a long time ago and I was young. Maybe my memory has failed me. The part about the fixed backlight doesn't seem to go with the the rest of the sentence.&#160;??? <a href="../../../r/s/d/User%7ERsduhamel_fe61.html" title="User:Rsduhamel">Rsduhamel</a> 06:30, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
