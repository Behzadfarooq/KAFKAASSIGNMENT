<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/c/AMC_Eagle_100a.html" title="Edit section: The concept">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The concept</span></h2>
<p>The Eagle, revolutionary when it debuted, came about when Jeep's chief engineer, Roy Lunn, joined an AMC Concord body with a Jeep-like 4-wheel-drive driveline. Such a vehicle was a logical step for AMC, according to then-AMC CEO <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerald_C._Meyers_8039.html" title="Gerald C. Meyers">Gerald C. Meyers</a>, as a second energy crisis had hit in 1979, and sales of AMC's highly profitable truck-based Jeep line, which was not famous for good fuel mileage, plummeted, leaving AMC in a precarious financial position. Because of this, the Eagle provided a low-cost way of bridging the gap between AMC's solid and economical, but aging passenger car line, and its well-regarded, but decidedly off-road focused Jeep line, as the Eagle used the existing Concord (and later, Spirit) as its basis.</p>
<p>A first in passenger cars, early Eagles came with a true full-time system that operated only in all-wheel drive. The Eagle's central differential was single-speed (no low range option) and used a thick <a href="../../../v/i/s/Viscous.html" title="Viscous">viscous</a> fluid coupling for quiet and smooth transfer of power to the axle with the greatest traction, on wet or dry pavement. Similar vehicles made by <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subaru_Leone_36c2.html" title="Subaru Leone">Subaru</a> and, later, <a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyota_Tercel_daa3.html" title="Toyota Tercel">Toyota</a>, only had part-time four-wheel drive systems that could not be engaged on dry pavement.</p>
<p>As the first mass-produced American passenger car with 4-wheel-drive of any type (much less with a system as advanced as the Eagle's was), autmotive critics were taken by surprise at the fact that AMC, a company most had deemed past its ability to produce competitive vehicles, turned the best of what they had into a revolutionary, novel, and all-around competent vehicle. In doing so, the small American manufacturer was seen as having cleverly pioneered a new market segment - one that would grow wildly over the next 25 years and beyond, as evinced by <b>Four Wheeler</b> magazine's conclusion in 1980 that the new AMC Eagle was, indeed, <i>"The beginning of a new generation of cars."</i></p>

<p><a name="1980"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/c/AMC_Eagle_100a.html" title="Edit section: 1980">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1980</span></h3>
<p>Based on the <a href="../../../a/m/c/AMC_Concord_dab8.html" title="AMC Concord">AMC Concord</a>, the 1980 AMC Eagle was available as a four-door <a href="../../../s/e/d/Sedan.html" title="Sedan">sedan</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Station_wagon.html" title="Station wagon">station wagon</a>, as well as a <a href="../../../c/o/u/Coupe.html" title="Coupe">coupe</a>. The Eagle came base and upscale Limited trims, both of which carried the same features as the Concord DL and Limited, respectively. A Sport package was available in all three body styles, as well, using sport graphics, blackout grille, side tape stripes, and trim, and a sport steering wheel.</p>
<p>The drivetrain consisted of one engine, the <a href="../../../a/m/c/AMC_Straight-6_engine_1a80.html#258" title="AMC Straight-6 engine">AMC 4.2L I6</a>, in conjunction with a three-speed automatic transmission (a version of Chrysler's A998), and Dana 30 and 35 differentials. All 1980 Eagles came standard with a permanent 4-wheel-drive system that employed a New Process 119 transfer case, which had a viscous fluid coupling that allowed the 4-wheel-drive system to operate on wet or dry pavement without causing undue suspension and drivetrain wear.</p>
<p>The 1980 Eagle's appearance differed from the Concord's in that the bodies were raised 3" further off their suspension to afford better ground clearance. To fill in the increased visual space between the tires and wheel wells, AMC used durable Krayton plastic wheelarch flares that flowed into rocker panel extensions. The grille was similar to the 1980 Concord's, but with the horizontal bars spaced slightly further apart, and the Eagle graphic mounted to the driver's side-center. Because coupes and sedans carried Concord DL equipment as standard, they also carried the Concord DL coupe and sedan roof treatments, featuring vinyl coverings and opera windows. However, bumpers were pulled closer to the body than those seen on Concords, due to the Eagle having been classified by the EPA as a light truck, and was therefore exempt from passenger car regulations that required front and rear bumpers that could sustain a 5mph impact with no damage. However, as seen on the Concord, black plastic end caps were featured on 1980 Eagle bumpers.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/c/AMC_Eagle_100a.html" title="Edit section: 1981">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1981</span></h3>
<p>Changes to the standard (Series 30) Eagle lineup for 1981 were notable. The GM 2.5L Iron Duke I4 became standard equipment, as the 4.2L I6 became optional. All Eagles took on a new plastic eggcrate-style grille divided into 24 squares at the front. The Eagle name moved to the grille header bar. Bumpers were updated so that their end caps flowed smoothly into the Krayton plastic wheelcarches and rocker panel trim. The Sport package, carried over from 1980 on all three body styles, used the Spirit's hood and grille header bar trim starting in 1981.</p>
<p>Two smaller <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subcompact.html" title="Subcompact">subcompact</a> models, the AMC Eagle <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kammback.html" title="Kammback">Kammback</a>, based on the <a href="../../../a/m/c/AMC_Spirit_ded9.html" title="AMC Spirit">AMC Spirit</a> sedan (nee <a href="../../../a/m/c/AMC_Gremlin_c1ae.html" title="AMC Gremlin">Gremlin</a>), and the sporty Eagle SX/4, based on the Spirit <a href="../../../l/i/f/Liftback.html" title="Liftback">liftback</a>, debuted as "Eagle Series 50" models. The Kammback and SX/4 came standard with GM's 2.5L "Iron Duke" 4-cylinder engine, 4-speed manual transmission, and power steering. The Series 50 Eagles reflected the styling updates that the larger Series 30 models showed for 1981. The SX/4 model was available with a Sport package, as well.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the model year, all Eagles carried over the new-for-1980 permanent all-wheel drive system with viscous fluid coupling, which protected the suspension or driveline components from wear during dry weather use. A "Select Drive" option, which allowed the Eagle to run in 2-wheel-drive (RWD) mode and be switched to 4-wheel-drive at the flick of a dashboard switch, was offered as a fuel economy measure at midyear.</p>
<p><a name="1982"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/c/AMC_Eagle_100a.html" title="Edit section: 1982">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1982</span></h3>
<p>New low-drag disc brakes were featured, as standard equipment. A 5-speed manual transmission joined the options list. The optional automatic transmission received wider gear ratios for better fuel economy. All received as standard equipment the Select Drive system that could be changed between all-wheel drive and two-wheel drive for a potential increase in fuel economy. The Series 30 sedan was no longer available with the Sport package.</p>
<p>Even with the choice of two wheelbase versions and five body styles, the most popular model was the wagon with 20,899 built out of total Eagle production of 37,923 for the model year.</p>
<p><a name="1983"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/c/AMC_Eagle_100a.html" title="Edit section: 1983">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1983</span></h3>
<p>Few changes were seen for 1983. The Series 50 Eagle Kammback and Series 30 Eagle coupe were both dropped from the line, due to slow sales. The Series 30 Eagle sedan lost its Limited trim line, leaving only the base model in the Eagle sedan line. The Series 50 SX/4 and Series 30 wagon continued basically unchanged. All were measures to save production costs by pruning the slow-selling models from the line, thereby streamlining their processes by reducing production variations, and therefore, complexity.</p>
<p>Starting in February 1983, the AMC 2.5L I4 theoretically replaced the GM Iron Duke 2.5 under Eagle hoods, as the standard engine, though the installation rate is unknown.</p>
<p><a name="1984"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/c/AMC_Eagle_100a.html" title="Edit section: 1984">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1984</span></h3>
<p>Few changes greeted the now 5 season-old AMC Eagle lineup. The Series 50 SX/4 was dropped for 1984. This left only the base Series 30 Eagle sedan and wagon, and a Limited wagon to carry the torch for both the Eagle line and the AMC brand. Now that the SX/4 was gone, only the wagon carried the Sport option package.</p>
<p>All Eagle models were now built in AMC's plant in <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brampton%2C_Ontario_aa5d.html" title="Brampton, Ontario">Brampton, Ontario</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> as the Kenosha plant was used for the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renault_Alliance_4c59.html" title="Renault Alliance">Renault Alliance/Encore</a> models.</p>
<p><a name="1985"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/c/AMC_Eagle_100a.html" title="Edit section: 1985">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1985</span></h3>
<p>The Eagle went in for detail, but notable changes for 1985. Exterior styling was slightly revised as all models used the "power bulge" hood and seen previously on the 1981-83 Eagle Series 50 models. The grille header bar and hood ornament/trim strip were deleted in the process. "Shift-on-the-Fly" capability was added to the Select Drive 4-wheel-drive system as standard equipment. A new key fob activated infrared remote power locking system was newly available as an option.</p>
<p>The standard powertrain was now the previously optional 5-speed manual, with the wide-ratio 3-speed automatic still available as a popular option. The AMC 4.2L I6 became standard, as well, in lieu of the 2.5L AMC I4, as the four-cylinder engine was installed on only 147 1984 Eagles.</p>
<p><a name="1986"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/c/AMC_Eagle_100a.html" title="Edit section: 1986">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1986</span></h3>
<p>AMC introduced the open differential Model 128 transfer case. The automatic transmission no longer had a lockup torque converter. Eagle sales would drop beneath the 10,000 annual unit mark for the first time for 1986 (and would slide further for its remaining two seasons on the market), as the car was aging due to its 7-season life atop a platform that debuted for 1970.</p>

<p>Though AMC debuted its "new" <a href="../../../a/m/c/AMC_Straight-6_engine_1a80.html#4.0" title="AMC Straight-6 engine">4.0L I6 engine</a> for 1987, the new engine did not make it under the venerable Eagle's hood. The 4.2L I6 soldiered on as the sole engine available in the 8-season-old Eagle sedan and wagon. No major changes were seen on the 1987 Eagle, as American Motors turned its attention to the debut of the imported <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renault_Medallion_7ac5.html" title="Renault Medallion">Renault Medallion</a> and the buyout by the Chrysler Corporation, which took effect officially that August. Less than 5,000 Eagles left the Brampton, Ontario, Canada facility for the model year.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/c/AMC_Eagle_100a.html" title="Edit section: 1988">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">1988</span></h3>
<p>The biggest official changes to the Eagle for 1988 had to do with what was taken away. The sedan was dropped after the 1987 model year. So was the Limited trim line. This left the base wagon to soldier on into 1988, its final season. Since Chrysler had purchased AMC just days before the beginning of the 1988 model year, Eagle production was allowed to continue temporarily. The car lost its AMC branding, having become a member of Chrysler's new Jeep-Eagle division, which featured a line of newly-branded Eagle cars; the Renault-designed <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renault_Medallion_7ac5.html" title="Renault Medallion">Eagle Medallion</a>, and the AMC/Renault joint-venture <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_Premier_6b3b.html" title="Eagle Premier">Eagle Premier</a>. The 1988 model was officially called the "Eagle Station Wagon". However, the 1988 Eagle did not accept the new shield-type badge that Chrysler designed for the Eagle division and placed on the Medallion, Premier, and all future Eagle models.</p>
<p>Reportedly, most of the final 2,306 1988 Eagles that left the factory were loaded with high levels of equipment in order to use up existing parts stock. The final Eagle Station Wagon left the factory on December 14, 1987.</p>

1982 AMC Eagle convertible</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>During 1981 and 1982, a Sundancer conversion <a href="../../../c/o/n/Convertible.html" title="Convertible">convertible</a> was available. The Eagle's <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monocoque.html" title="Monocoque">monocoque</a> body was reinforced and a steel <a href="../../../t/a/r/Targa_top.html" title="Targa top">targa roll bar</a> was welded to the door pillars for passenger compartment protection. The front portion of the roof was a removable lightweight fiberglass hatch, while the rear section of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polyvinyl_chloride.html" title="Polyvinyl chloride">polyvinyl</a> material and the back window folded down and had a boot cover when in the down position. The cars were ordered through any AMC dealer. The conversion was by the Griffith Company that was headquartered in <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Lauderdale%2C_Florida_a9f5.html" title="Fort Lauderdale, Florida">Fort Lauderdale, Florida</a>.</p>

<p>Though the AMC Eagle was gone after 1988, the Eagle brand, as part of the newly-formed Jeep-Eagle division of the Chrysler Corporation, would soldier on, fielding a combination of Renault-based vehicles (<a href="../../../r/e/n/Renault_Medallion_7ac5.html" title="Renault Medallion">Eagle Medallion</a> and <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_Premier_6b3b.html" title="Eagle Premier">Eagle Premier</a>, re-trimmed Mitsubishis (<a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_Summit_28df.html" title="Eagle Summit">Eagle Summit</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_Summit_28df.html" title="Eagle Summit">Eagle Summit Wagon</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_Talon_822d.html" title="Eagle Talon">Eagle Talon</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_2000GTX_9915.html" title="Eagle 2000GTX">Eagle 2000GTX</a> (Canada only), and <a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_Vista_759a.html" title="Eagle Vista">Eagle Vista</a> (Canada only)), and one Chrysler-designed vehicle (<a href="../../../e/a/g/Eagle_Vision_832f.html" title="Eagle Vision">Eagle Vision</a>).</p>
<p>The brand became too much of a disharmonious mish-mash of vehicles from different companies, sporting different characters, and never really attained much brand equity or recognition. People commonly made the mistake of calling them "Jeep Eagles", as they were doubtless confused by the brand being sold alongside Jeep and "Jeep Eagle dealership" being a common phrase used in their commercials. Due to the lack of recognition, sales never met expectations, and Chrysler quietly killed the Eagle brand after the 1998 model year.</p>
<p>To note, after the AMC-based 4-wheel-drive Eagle wagon was dropped, Chrysler would continue the concept loosely in spirit by offering all-wheel-drive optionally on the Mitsubishi-based 1990-98 Eagle Talon, 1989-91 Eagle Vista wagon, and 1992-96 Eagle Summit Wagon.</p>
