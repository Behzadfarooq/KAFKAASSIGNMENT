<p>I will point out that 2/3 or more of the article has already been removed by people who I guess might have been offended and I am trying to understand. You can find it in the history and see if you are offended too. I do not quite understand what there is to be offended at, since I am not a Hindu or Indian.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 22:59, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My article and take on it might be wrong, but I went from the sources I had and from a Hindu who helped proof read it.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 23:12, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know nothing of the politics of Hindutva. Here is what I read (which hopefully I will recall without too many errors):</p>
<ul>
<li>They changed textbooks in India and caused consternation over stances on certain issues</li>
<li>There is some discrimination against Dalits as part of Hindutva.</li>
<li>There is some antiMoslem or antiChristian or anti-whatever parts of Hindutva</li>
<li>Hindutva is associated with strict belief in some of the tenets of Hinduism</li>
</ul>
<p>Right or wrong? And why? I also have some more retarded questions if you would permit me.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 23:18, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

I was very long time wating for anyone to creat this article , god Jyotiba is our clan god and i want to give complete information about god on wikipedia. Finaly this article was created and i was very happy but suddenly just in seconds this article was created this two guy , basterds started vandalising it by missuseing Wiki rules. It was very clear that their intention was very bad and first i warned them in good legal language. But they don't listen to me and went further and started vandalising other Maratha artiles. We can bear personal attatcs but not on our gods and prides anymore. So i request all Maratha brothers that they start to take strong action agains this peoples,entities. All we know that this southindian people are Bhangi, geneticaly infirior and basterds peoples of India . They have not participated the freedom struggle of India nor the deserve to call an Indian. They are pure bread Deshdrohis, decivers , cheaters of our nation and Hindu , Aryan religion.

<p><strike>I understand your need to edit articles after I correct articles using sources. But could you at least present some sources for your argument? In the IVC article, you wrote, "partition of India", when I corrected it to "Partition of British India".</strike> <strike>India has never been partitioned. I assume you already knew that, and we have already been through the argument of, What India refers to.<br /></strike> <strike>However the warning is for your random insults towards everything Pakistani. Your only justification of editing articles is my name, and some anti Pakistan comment. Please get to the point instead of making some pointless comment, which I find offensive, since you are supposed to be posting some argument for your edit.<br /></strike> <strike>"vv partition of india is the correct and academic term. Unre4L your pathological hatred with RoI may be understandable but puhlease we are writing an ecyclopedia here not a Pakistan Studies textbook."<br /></strike> <strike>Thats the comment I am referring to and just for the record. I dont hate RoI.

<p>Hi - yes, his report on ANI against me also contains many false accusations which may/not be construed as personal attacks. However, I've seen a gist of your clashes and I must strongly advise you to keep your emotions under control and behave properly. It is not justifiable to make derogatory comments about someone's intelligence. Yes, Unre4lity, Nadirali and Szhaider have been behaving in a disruptive fashion, but you must not behave the same way. His warning to you is credible. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="orange"><b>Rama's arrow</b></font></a> 16:36, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, the history book is biased and reflects the Pakistani POV. That's exactly why it should be there. We let readers know about notable views on a subject exist, whether or not we agree with them. The Pakistani POV on the Partition is presumably held by millions of people. That makes it notable. It may be wrong, but NPOV demands that we just put it out there and let readers decide. Don't try to shut out other POVs and thereby force readers into accepting your POV. Trust the readers to see through bias. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 18:32, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>NPOV is very much about giving competing POVs. You have completely misunderstood the NPOV rules if you think that they require WP to publish only "truth." We give all notable POVs. That doesn't mean all POVs, just the ones that are commonly held and likely to be encountered by the encyclopedia user. The Pakistani POV is notable. Though it's unlikely that all Pakistanis have opinions about Pakistani history, a sizeable chunk of them must share the HoP beliefs, or it wouldn't have been published. The Hindutva POV is also notable -- though I don't believe (as you seem to believe) that all the people who voted for the BJP endorse all Hindutvadi beliefs; they were just voting against corruption and stagnation and for change. Instead of endless fighting for control of the article, and the right to declare one's own beliefs true, we just say, "A believes X and B believes Y and C believes Z." Present all arguments and let the reader choose. When people "get" this, arguments often disappear.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You can work with your enemies if all sides follow NPOV. The article on Salafism is probably a mess again -- I haven't had time to work on it -- but for a while, I was working harmoniously with a Salafi Muslim who understood NPOV and was willing to play by the rules. By his standards, I was a shameless kafir, and by my standards, his beliefs were frightening and wrong, but ... we were able to collaborate. We just made sure that all sides were presented.</dd>

<p>How long does it last for? Money should help speed up the FA process. It's a shame the editors don't get the money&#160;:)</p>
<p>Btw, I suggest when arguing with Unre4L etc. (anyone that has a different opinion to you) never criticise the person (Thats almost a personal attack, even avoid calling them a troll, it just adds fuel to fire), but criticise their points only. When admins or neutral editors come as a 3rd party to adjudicate, they are more likely to agree with you if you have a well argued case instead of saying the other guy is a troll. From now on, I'm steering completely away from controversial stuff because I'm on a semi-break for the next nine months (last year of secondary schooling) and will on push for FAs, GAs, improve articles.

<p>I have temporarily changed one of the references to "British India" to "India dab" on the Chandrasekhar page, as a temporary compromise. BTW, the business of changing British India to India dab is not anything Wikipedia has settled upon. It was only something discussed on the discussion page started by Rama's Arrow and, judging from the number of dissenting opinions, is not even remotely a WP policy. BTW, in his own autobiography at the Nobel foundations site, Chandra himself refers his birthplace as Lahore, then British India.</p>
<p>As for my being a meatpuppet for any one, I'd suggest that you keep your personal flights of imagination out of edit summaries; someone less easy going could take you to task. <a href="../../../f/o/w/User%7EFowler%26fowler_e6e1.html" title="User:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#B8860B">Fowler&amp;fowler</font></a><a href="../../../f/o/w/User_talk%7EFowler%26fowler_5ef0.html" title="User talk:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#708090">«Talk»</font></a> 18:10, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What does Pakistan coming first have to do with meat puppetry? Sind, after all, <i>is</i> a province of Pakistan. That was my only reason to move Pakistan up. I did that in part because I thought is would stem the tide of nickel and dime edit-wars being fought there. Don't know if it worked, since I never went back to that page... <a href="../../../f/o/w/User%7EFowler%26fowler_e6e1.html" title="User:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#B8860B">Fowler&amp;fowler</font></a><a href="../../../f/o/w/User_talk%7EFowler%26fowler_5ef0.html" title="User talk:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#708090">«Talk»</font></a> 18:24, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As for Sindhi literature, frankly it was something I did, as I said above, to be conciliatory. As far as I could see, the Pakistani editors didn't want the India template there <i>at all</i>, but I thought this might placate everyone. As I said, I haven't gone back to page, nor do I intend to, to see if my handiwork helped.</dd>

<dd>As for working one some of the same article as the blocked users, all I can say is that, in November and December I was fighting with all three blocked users Szhaider, nadirali and Unre4L—the Talk:india and Talk:pakistan pages are littered with evidence of our battles. However, somewhere in the battling, I also became aware of a kind of <i>higher level</i> bias being introduced by Indian editors (who are not only more numerous than their Pakistani counterparts, but also more WP savvy and can quote you chapter and verse). Unfortunately, the Pakistani editors seem to be stuck on fighting over Urdu vs. Hindi script etc (the nickel and dime edit wars that get them into trouble). My goal is simply to get <i>bias</i> out where I see it. It is really an accident that I ended up in this India-Pakistan ideological battle; some other twist of fate could have taken me to some other battle ground and our paths would never have crossed. <a href="../../../f/o/w/User%7EFowler%26fowler_e6e1.html" title="User:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#B8860B">Fowler&amp;fowler</font></a><a href="../../../f/o/w/User_talk%7EFowler%26fowler_5ef0.html" title="User talk:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#708090">«Talk»</font></a> 18:48, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Genocide Denier?. I believe I wrote you the equivalent of a book explaining that I didnt deny any genocides. Please dont insult me like this. And talking about colourful insults, I am sure you havent forgotten those insults you threw at me (and barely got a warning for).<br />
As for your explanation of British India, let me explain. The full name of British India has to be mentioned so it doesnt cause any confusion with what is now India.<br />
Similar to the Roman Empire. I am sure they didnt call it "Roman Empire" back in the day, however the term is used to stop confusion.<br />
Once again, I will forgive you for your constant insults, and would appreciate it, if you stopped throwing around the accusations.<br />
