<h2><span class="mw-headline">help regarding need for citations</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I don't know if you have time, but I could use your help. There is an argument over at <a href="../../../p/r/o/Talk%7EProgramming_language_3869.html" title="Talk:Programming language">Talk:Programming language</a> about the use of fact tags. My opponents say I used them too often and that they are a "random disruption". I am trying to explain to them that we need a citation on every fact, as you told me, to reach FA status. Is there any way you could look in and help me convince them that we need citations even on statements they consider obvious? Thanks. <a href="../../../i/d/e/User%7EIdeogram_de1d.html" title="User:Ideogram">Ideogram</a> 23:05, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I started giving the article a general copyedit, but I'm running short of time, so I won't be able to finish today. I got all the way to the "Education" section, but I'm slightly concerned about weasel words in the "Reservations" section of the article. Try to put a name (or at least a party) to all the relevant criticism, just to be sure. I also sprinkled a few {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECitation_needed_0ed6.html" title="Template:Citation needed">citation needed</a>}} templates that need fixing. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 00:07, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks, Ambuj. One important task right now is to have a more friendly and personalized welcome message.

<p><a name="Castes_and_Tribes_of_the_Punjab" id="Castes_and_Tribes_of_the_Punjab"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Castes and Tribes of the Punjab</span></h2>
<p>Hi. I am asking your opinion on this festering dispute that has developed between myself and <a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatbir_Singh_01aa.html" title="User:Satbir Singh">Satbir Singh</a> since the past few days.</p>
<p>The facts of the matter are like this:</p>
<p>I created a template called Castes and Tribes of the Punjab with a view to studying the caste and tribal groups that exist in what was the ancient Punjab region (Punjab (Pakistan), Punjab (India), Haryana and Himachal Pradesh). My intention, unlike any Ibbetsons, Todds or Cunninghams was to study these groups from a purely anthropological perspective sans any controversy so that people visiting this portal would get to know about the huge mosaic that my province (I am a Punjabi) is.</p>
<p>I started with a few groups. But soon enough the groups began to increase. For the sake of brevity, I grouped them under Categories. As the template evolved, I learnt not to name any category speculatively.</p>
<p>The final categories were:</p>
<p>Brahmin groups. Dalit groups. Jat clans. Khatris and other groups. Rajput clans. Shaikhs and other groups. Tarkhans and other groups. Others (groups to which i could not attribute any specific status). In the last (Others), I also included groups such as Kamboj, Khasa, Ahir and Gujjar. However, Satbir Singh separated them and bunched them under a new category called "Surviving Ancient Kshatriya Tribes".</p>
<p>Since that day, a revert war has been on between the two of us. According to Satbir, these groups such as the Ahirs (the ancient Abhiras), the Gujjars (Gurjaras), the Khas (the Khasas), the Kamboj (Kambojas) and Yadav (Yadavas) are ancient Kshatriya tribes mentioned in a number of ancient Sanskrit texts.</p>
<p>My own personal opinion is that all this is true. However, some points must be noted:</p>
<p>The Varna System is a topic subject to a lot of controversy and dispute. I have been noticing this in recent weeks. Pages such as Khatri, Rajput, Kayastha and Bhumihar have been vandalised because many people don't agree with the Varna status of these groups. If the Ahirs, the Gujjars, the Khasaa, the Kambojas and the Yadavas are Kshatriya groups, then so are the Rajputs, Jats, Khatris, Tarkhans et al. I did not create a category entitled "Kshatriya groups" in the first place because I knew I was treading on soft ground. All the above mentioned castes claim Kshatriya status. But we all know, how disputable these claims are. The rigmarole that is the Varna System is known to us all. For example, the Jats, who in the Vedic and Mythological periods were workers should be placed in the Shudra Category under the Varna System. But many Jats clans consider themselves the equal and perhaps the superior of Rajputs as adhrents of Kshatriya Dharma. My own caste, the Khatris and related groups such as Aroras claim Kshatriya status. But we have seen on the Khatri page as to what became of that claim. Ahirs, Gujjars and Yadavs are considered to be OBCs in most Indian states inspite of their being the descendants of ancient Abhiras, Gurjaras and Yadus. There is a controversy raging on the Yadav page presently if I am not wrong, on the status of the caste. Taking all these points into consideration and being aware of the fact that there are users (say Sanjay Mohan and Holywarrior, who have caused great disputes on various caste pages, I proposed categories such as "Kambojs and related groups" (Kamboj, Kamboja, Kamboh and Khasa) and "Gujjars and realted groups" (Ahirs, Gujjars, Dhangars and Bakarwals). But Satbir Singh and another user named Sze cavalry01 objected to it. They returned to "Ancient Kshatriya Tribes". I did a little compromise by making it "Ancient Warrior Tribes", which I later realised would also be POV. Therefore, I changed it to just "Ancient Tribes" - A completely unspeculative term.</p>
<p>However, Satbir Singh does not agree. He calls it a "gross suppression of known historical facts", "a crime against history" and "a political agenda" and has termed me a "Vandal". I have put forward my points. But both of us are yet to agree.</p>
<p>I have fighting a revert war with him for almost a week now. Have a look at the template's history page and Satbir Singh's talk page to get a complete idea of the whole fracas.</p>
<p>This fight has become downright silly. I surely don't expect myself to spend my time, money and energy on such a silly matter. And I am sure neither does the other party.</p>
<p>As of now, Administrator Shresth has protected the page on my request. He has also asked that the dispute be discussed on the talk page of the template and a consensus be reached. Yourself and anybody else you know who has an interest in the Punjab, please come and express your opinion on the talk page. Even if you don't have interest, it still is an issue of NPOV vs POV. So please express your thoughts.</p>

<p>Hi Vastu,</p>
<p>Saw that you have doing a lot of work on the Indo-Greek Kingdom maps lately. However, I also note that you always upload new maps under a different name. Just wanted to tell you that it is possible to upload a new version of an image over the previous one. In the "File history" section of the image description page, you will find a link that says "Upload a new version of this file". You can use that and save time in changing the links to the old maps. Hope this helps.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">IIT Kharagpur</span></h2>
<p>Hi - nah, it was just to fix a format problem, which was occuring on my comp. I hate to see the format torn apart by oversized and misplaced pics. If there is any problem created as a result of it, please change it back. I'm gonna make my first round of comments here (copy it to the PR if you like):</p>
<p>By a brief scan, I get the impression that this article doesn't really offer anything different from the main IITs one. I wonder if you could discover and emphasis a deeper area of information. For example, the IITs are given an overview-style of coverage, but perhaps we could get more info here on the effect of this institute on the locality, students interactions with local Bengali culture and people, association with neighbouring companies (I believe Kharagpur is an industrial area?), practices and courses that make Kharagpur different.</p>
<p>"History" needs to emphasize the unique role of IIT Kharagpur as being the first. '<b>What issues surrounded its foundation, construction and what happened in that crucial period between 1951 and 1961 that influenced the government to call the experiment a success and found IIT Bombay?</b> What does IIT Kharagpur contribute to the other IITs, Indian economy and all-India students activities? Talk about the buildings, organization that make up IIT-K, with the architecture, etc. How is the student body different from other IITs? More on the Alumni.</p>
<p>As its your almamater, I'd expect a special effort like photographing faculty, labs, classrooms, friends, the local area, doing some investigative journalism about the place's history. Digging into the library for specific information on this IIT's formation. You need to go real deep, because you can. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="orange"><b>This Fire Burns Always</b></font></a> 18:35, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi - sorry for the delay. I completely understand your points, and I encourage you to do all you can to add different, unique information to this article. Specially important is the period between 1951 and the 1960s, when IIT-K was the only institution of its kind, and may be seen as the experiment that led to the success and spread of the IITs and NITs. I would suggest that you talk to your professors and dean, and do your damned best to find any and all information on this, and of course, other topics.</dd>

<dd>As for that caste system note, no I hadn't seen it and don't understand it. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="orange"><b>This Fire Burns Always</b></font></a> 22:07, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
