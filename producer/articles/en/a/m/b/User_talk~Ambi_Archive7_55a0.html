<p>Ambi -- I wish you my wholehearted congratulations on your election to the AC. Your wit, perception, and willingness to challenge the status quo are the qualities that earned you my vote (and the votes of many others) -- don't let the stress and pressure of arbitration drive them from you.&#160;:-) I have great confidence in the new group of arbitrators, and look forward to what you will achieve. If I can ever be of help, do let me know.

<p>Let me add to the well-earned congratulations. Unfortunately, this makes it a little harder to continue your efforts as a perceptive outside critic. Also, I offer my apologies, if any are necessary, for not having acted on your suggestion that I also run. After some consideration, I decided that my attention was needed for other matters, and because I saw many fine candidates (yourself certainly included) I didn't think it was critical that I run. Since I remain outside the Committee, perhaps I can help fill your previous role from time to time. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 01:15, 20 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You haven't told me what I can fix. You are essentially telling me this article can never be featured because you will always object, apparently because you dislike me. Well, that doesn't seem very fair. How did you get elected to the ArbCom? Why did I support you? It boggles the mind. If you're going to object, I think you have an obligation to make your objection clear enough that I can act on it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:29, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have not told me. If you had told me, I would've fixed it by now, and presumably you wouldn't be objecting. And if you're such a stickler, why was <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathedral_of_Magdeburg_98ee.html" title="Cathedral of Magdeburg">Cathedral of Magdeburg</a> on the main page a few days ago? Not a bad article by any means, but certainly not featured quality by my standards, and I'm pretty liberal about it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:50, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You tell me I disagree; what is it I disagree with? Hell if I know, I guess you'd know better than I would. "The quotes"? What do you mean? Do you not want any quotes in the article? Is there a particular quote you object to? Explain. "The chart section"? Again, what do you mean? Do you want information removed? Reworded? Transformed into chart format? Explain. This is like pointing vaguely in the general direction of a big city and telling me to go fix that broken window. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:06, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I don't know if you have anything personal against me or not. I have no idea. But you did get me to support you for the ArbCom, and then you got me to think you weren't going to object to my nomination by discontinuing our discussion. Even more infuriating is that I see articles on the main page every day that aren't of the same quality as Autobiography, which just adds insult to injury—how on earth are those getting through the process while my nomination is held up perpetually, and I even get personally insulted by a few people? A person shouldn't have to contend with all that, I don't tolerate that sort of thing well at all. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 11:53, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have absolutely never ignored anybody's objections. I take offense. Quite the contrary, I've spent far too much of my life arguing about those objections, trying to figure out exactly what they are, and trying to resolve them. Now I think I've more or less figured out the crux of the objections: you and a few others are deliberately vague and unclear because what you really want is for half of the article to be deleted, but you're recluctant to come right out and say that because that would mean the nomination has become a broader question of inclusionism or deletionism—should an article be comprehensive, or should it be merely a brief summary? And to me, the implications of that go way beyond this one article. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:49, 21 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wikipedia is supposed to be inclusive of information. You know that. If I removed everything you want me to remove, the article would be a sad, miserable stub that even I wouldn't want featured. Featured articles are supposed to be thorough and comprehensive—you are supposed to read one and think, "Damn, that's great, and just look at all these other links I can follow...", not "Well, I guess they hit most of the main points and kept it concise, which is good because I don't have more than five minutes to sit down and read anything anyway." Now, I'm willing to talk about reducing the size of the article, but it absolutely must be done on the basis of preserving the info—there is no question of totally removing anything. That means that it can be moved to other articles, for example; but you know the problem with that, last time I created a subarticle it got deleted. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:20, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Forgive me, Rebecca, but when you talk about summarizing I read "removing information". Because that's what it means, even if you only remove a detail here and there. And I think when you talk about poor writing, what you really mean is that there's too much detail. If that's <i>not</i> what you mean, why don't you do me a favor and take some paragraph or a few sentences that you think are poorly written and rewrite them in a better way on the talk page, so I can see what you mean? Because as it is I'm not understanding. The tables were created specifically to <i>avoid</i> the problem of endlessly droning on with numbers. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:33, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Heya, I noticed you withdrew your support for my MedCom nomination. If this is to do with the RFC User:Lucky 6.9 started on me, I'd appreciate it if you could have a look at the edit histories in question (if you haven't already).

<p>I am a Wikipedian and I have the right to revert edits I disagree with. This is unbelievably outrageous. Am I some second-class editor who isn't entitled to the same rights as others? And I've never said I won't accept the removal of information from the article under any circumstances. I've always said I'm willing to discuss it <i>if and only if</i> it is preserved somewhere on Wikipedia. I have myself suggested a scheme of creating more subarticles and reorganizing on that basis. I can't deal with this. I don't know how to react or what to do. I don't want to be treated like this. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 15:05, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems that you think <i>you</i> have a veto over the article, and you are trying to get me banned for having a disagreement. Why isn't it <i>you</i> who's banned? Why should one side in a dispute be treated this way? Why are you resorting to this? Why can't we just <i>discuss</i>? You talk about discussing, but you haven't done hardly any, and now you're trying to get me banned. I don't know how I can continue to contribute to a project when I'm being threatened this way. I don't want to leave, God knows Wikipedia's just about the most important thing in my life, as pathetic as that might be, but I have a certain degree of dignity that I'm not willing to give up, and that means I will not under any circumstances accept having my editing rights restricted, not even for an hour. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 15:21, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, yes, I do stand absolutely for the principle that the information must remain somewhere, in some form. But does that make me a bad editor, just because I value information? You seem to stand absolutely for the principle that the information must be deleted, so if I'm in the wrong, you're just as wrong as I am. Where is the difference? Should people be banned from editing just because they have different opinions regarding inclusion and deletion, Rebecca? Aren't we supposed to discuss these things? And even if we can't reach an agreement, does that mean one party should be banned from editing just because he or she has an opinion? And even if, in some alternate dimension, that was right, wouldn't that mean both parties should be subject to the same penalty? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 15:34, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I want to discuss things and I have always tried to discuss. You have not—do you not recall ignoring me before? In any case, I have the right to revert within the limits of the 3RR forever if I so please, as do we all. I want to reach an agreement, but if we can't reach an agreement, I reserve the right to continue to revert three times a day.

<dd>Actually no, you have no such right. If you kept an article from being edited by performing, say, one revert per day to get rid of all the edits you didn't like, you'd probably hit problems with other editors before long. If you kept it up and refused to stop doing that you'd probably end up before the AC with a view to getting you to stop squatting over the pot. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:44, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Fine, Rebecca. I only want to discuss, but it seems you're just out to get rid of me for a reason I cannot even fathom. Disagreements notwithstanding, I have no desire to get rid of you. There is hardly anyone I've ever disagreed with that I'd want banned. Frankly, I can't even imagine having that mentality—I disagree with you, so you should be deprived of your right to edit. Disagreements are just disagreements, people have opinions, that's how life is. What do you want to achieve? What good will it do to force me to quit the project? Do you seriously think the articles would benefit from having me—the person who has written virtually all the content—banned from editing them? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 15:52, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Rebecca, why do you ignore me when I say that I want consensus and compromise? You say you want me to discuss and come to consensus, but I've been doing that all along. So how can I do what you want? Will you please remove your request for arbitration and acknowledge my right to disagree with you regarding the issue of inclusion? I'm asking you as a person. I can't go on having the sword of Damocles hanging over me. I want to edit in peace. I can't stomach this kind of situation. I always assume that whatever disagreements people have, the basic right to edit remains—a certain level of basic respect for others is maintained. But you are trying to deprive me of that, and it is more than I can accept or comprehend. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 16:06, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I only want the information preserved, Rebecca. Let's go to the talk page and start discussing a system of subarticles so we can shorten the article and address everyone's concerns without removing any factual content. I don't want to feel threatened; I don't want to think someone is out to get me. I want to think we have the right to disagree, and that neither one of us would take the route of trying to get the other banned just to win the argument. It is hell, absolute torture, for me to think my time as an editor might be coming to an end. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 16:16, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We can of course remove <i>quotes</i>, provided it can be shown that the information contained in the quotes can be given adequately in another way, or is already given adequately in the text. That is not a major issue for me. What must be preserved in some form is facts such as chart data. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 16:26, 23 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ambi, could I ask you to take a look at the album page over the next few days and see if it can be improved? I've just had a conversation on the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Talk%7EAutobiography_%28album%29_c4c0.html" title="Talk:Autobiography (album)">talk page</a> and the upshot is that Everyking still thinks my edits are "radical" and says suggestively "I will have another three reverts come tomorrow", and asks me to revert my edits myself and "discuss" them.

<p>This has all bothered me deeply. I'm not quite sure how to go on from here.

I would really appreciate an apology for doing that. I'm really thinking maybe I should quit, arbitration case or not. I just can't deal with this kind of thing, with an atmosphere in which I'm going to have to feel threatened from here on out. I only want to edit in peace in a spirit of compromise. I don't understand what you have against me, I really don't.

<dd>Apparently you aren't very good at determining what I think, then. I want people to edit the article. I was very happy when you helped me with the chart formats.

<p>My position now is exactly the same as it always has been. And once again, I want an apology and a confirmation of my right to edit, to hold views different from yours, and to act on those views in my edits and in my votes on FAC.

<p>I'm not going back on anything. I've always been open to negotiation about the quotes, because the quotes generally serve to <i>support</i> information and <i>enhance</i> it, rather than actually being the info itself. But with plain facts such as chart data, I am very strongly opposed to removing it unless it is just utterly trivial and nonnotable, and I just don't believe the chart data is. I mean, if I was to continue collecting chart data <i>forever</i>, yes, it might be, but as long as it's in the top 50 or so, I think that's worth noting. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:04, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ambi, if you will not retract your belief that I should be banned and recognize my right to edit and vote as I wish, I cannot continue working here as a normal editor. Moreover, I believe that the degree of animosity against me and the bad faith that is always assumed by others means that continuing any kind of proper discussion will be next to impossible. When I try, things just seem to degenerate into personal attacks by the other side. Will you consider mediation, possibly involving the two other primary participants in this dispute? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:36, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I want the threats and the personal attacks to stop. I want normal, civilized discussion. This is, however, presently not happening, and I feel that the other people involved in this dispute, including yourself, dislike me so strongly that they are not willing to sit down for a normal and civilized discussion. If I am wrong, prove me wrong by doing that on the article talk page, by ending all these petty threats and this talk of me being a bad editor, by promising to respect my views even if you disagree with them. If you won't do that, then I don't see an alternative to mediation. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:52, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>You make a good point. From what I gather from the film, the mother and child die in the plane, although this isnt clear.

<ul>
<li>About the FAA's inabilities:from what I gather, nobody claims the engine because no-one has lost one. If the engine comes from the future then all the airlines would have their planes equipped with the required amount of engines. Think of this:even if the FAA found the serial number on the engine, and they pinned it down to the correct plane, they would investigate that plane and would find out that the engine is in the plane after all, as it hasnt crashed yet, and so they wouldnt think "aah, time travel" and would think instead "hmmm, strange".

It might be worth keeping some of those diffs (like that massive revert one) around in case this does go back to arbitration, as well, as they would be handy when presenting evidence. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 11:26, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes, I think mediation in this case is more appropriate. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:47, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think you have said blatantly untrue things about me and have deeply offended me by attempting arbitration and then refusing to turn away from that path and back towards discussion. That is the basis for my remarks. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 11:53, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>You say I refuse negotiation, and that is about as false as saying it's night when the sun is shining. In fact, it seems like I'm the only one who has been trying to negotiate. You know all that. You only <i>temporarily</i> removed the request, right? So it will eventually be restored no matter what I do. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:03, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>My God, I can't take the things you say about me anymore. I have <i>always</i> said the quotes can be removed if they are superfluous. That has <i>never</i> changed, Rebecca! I have removed many quotes <i>myself</i>! Do you not know this? Have you not been following the article?! I cannot bear the threat of arbitration against me, Rebecca. It violates all norms of civility and I can't deal with that kind of pressure, with that kind of danger to me. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:15, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you aren't going to retract the threat of arbitration, then remove the mediation request and go ahead with arbitration. I can't take the stress anymore. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:17, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Arbitration. I would rather have it done with than have the threat of it hanging over my head forever. If I am banned, then I will just have to find something else to do with my time. It is all very sad, and more than anything it's sad that you can successfully use the threat of arbitration to get your way in a content dispute. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:24, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Remove the "slander" if you want. I have no interest in mediation anymore. I cannot talk with someone when they have the <a href="../../../s/w/o/Sword_of_Damocles_0f14.html" title="Sword of Damocles">sword of Damocles</a> hanging over my head. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:26, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I cannot talk with you when I have the threat of arbitration hanging over me. All threats and dangers to individuals must be removed in order to have a civil discussion. I want everyone to be happy with the article—why else would I nominate it for FAC?—I want to edit the article to satisfy their concerns, I want them to edit the article themselves to do so. I always have, and I have always said so. But I cannot deal with threats to my editing rights. I just can't. I would rather be banned than have to go through every day thinking about that. It's Christmas, and all I can think about is how a Wikipedia user wants to get me banned. That can't continue, for the sake of my own mental health it can't. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:33, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Then why don't you disclaim the use of the tactic of a threat of arbitration in order to win the dispute? As I said before, please either do that or <i>please</i> go ahead and list me on RfAr. I cannot stand the feeling of limbo. One or the other. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:44, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is all the hope in the world if the threat of arbitration is removed, and none at all if it isn't. Well, I suppose there would still be hope for resolution in a sense, but only because I would no longer be a participant on Wikipedia and therefore my opinion would not be an issue. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:50, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I stand by my position. You have already listed me once for what seems to have been nothing more than mild stubborness and occasional reverting. If I am going to be banned for that, I want to go ahead and be done with it. I don't want you to say absolutely that there will be no arbitration, because one never knows; I only want you to say you will not use it for the reasons that you used it before. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:58, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Then it is obvious you do not want to discuss matters with me in a calm, nonthreatening, civil manner. Go ahead and write up your accusations, please. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 13:04, 24 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>You already tried to use it as a first resort. I will not talk and I will not mediate when I am being threatened with arbitration. I will negotiate anything under the sun if that threat is removed, but otherwise there is no way. I'm just reiterating what I've already said. Just go ahead and write up your accusations.

<p>Rebecca, if you want me gone, I want to be gone. I don't want to stay and be considered a pain in the ass. If I'm a problem, I want to be gone.

I do not believe it will be possible to resolve this dispute unless this article is kept.

If that compromise is not acceptable, then I don't know what on earth I can do, except just leave.

<p>I have had a thoroughly fruitless time trying to reason with Everyking. He squats over that article and reverts nearly edit not his own. Since I never let myself get involved in revert wars and I cannot stomach his persistent dishonesty, I have decided that the best thing for Wikipedia is for me to cut my losses and have nothing more to do with editing that article and nothing more to do with Everyking in any context. Wikipedia does not need yet another editing dispute over a relatively trivial subject. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 00:38, 26 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is still nothing on RfAr about me. I can't imagine why. You clearly told me that if I refused mediation, and I refused to talk with you, that you would take it to arbitration. You said it was my choice, didn't you, in your threatening tones? Well, I do refuse mediation and I do refuse discussion with you until you drop the threat of arbitration. I have made my choice!

<p>Rebecca, you stay silent on all this, but I think you can be considered fundamentally to blame for it ever beginning. Taking a case to arbitration against a user who has violated no policy just because you disagree with him over article content is entirely unacceptable and shows a complete lack of understanding of the purpose of arbitration, as well as lack of respect for community norms of tolerance and civility. I believe that you should decline to take your seat on the ArbCom in light of this controversy. I at least want to <i>talk</i> with you regarding the reasons for your action, and I'd like to be able to show you where you were wrong and why. Can we continue to discuss it? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 14:36, 28 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I cannot see how it is a user dispute. What policies have I violated? Tell me and I'll stop violating them. I am just an active participant in a content dispute, but it unfortunately happens that I'm on the <i>wrong</i> side. If it was a user dispute and not a content dispute, all you needed to do—all you need do, if you believe it continues—was, or is, tell me how to make it just a content dispute and not a user dispute anymore. John holds the position than I should be punished for some belief he believes I have, even if I only have that belief on a "subconscious" level. If that ain't grasping at straws, I don't know what is. I haven't violated policy, I'm just stubborn and convinced that I'm right, and I suppose that is just unforgivable. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 00:32, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you. I can be included in a consensus. That is a huge step forward. I wish John would agree to that as well, but that you have said it makes me feel a million times better. Maybe I will be able to sleep better tonight. If we can just work on those grounds—that everyone's opinions matter, and everyone has a right to edit—then I think this can easily be resolved. I admit I am skeptical. I feel the arbitration listings put forward by you and John represent a fundamental unwillingness to accept my rights as a fellow Wikipedian. Perhaps I am wrong about that, as you would say, but that is how I have perceived things. But in any case, I cannot expect you to <i>believe</i> something (as John expects of me), I can only ask you to agree to practice it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 02:10, 29 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wait a minute...I've already told you, <b>everyone has a right to edit and an opinion</b>. But Wikipedia operates under consensus rule; your opinion is just one of many that contributes to the consensus. Now, if this was a dispute with 60-40 in disagreement, you might have a point, but it's more like 95-5. How many people believe the album article deserves this level of minute "nerd gold" as David Gerard put it? Every time you put it on FAC or PR, people complain it's too bloated.

<p>You really are insane&#160;:). I have a complete set of the biographical directories of the state and colonial parliaments, but I am travelling in Asia at the moment so you can't borrow them till I get back in February. You could find them in a public or university library. They are good up to about the 1960s but of course they haven't been updated. Some of the state parliament websites now have historical lists of all MPs, or you could contact the respective parliamentary libraries and ask them to send you one.

<p>Further to this, I know the Queensland Parliamentary Handbook has a very good list of all colonial and state MPs back to 1859, with birth and death dates etc. You could order one from the Qld Parlt and scan the list into a form you could then edit (if you <i>really</i> have several weeks to spare to do it!). <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 10:54, 30 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't have the time or energy to collect evidence of Rienzo's bad behaviour, although I've seen plenty of it. One of the problems of dispute resolution here is that the cases are heard on pages and not as discussions, so that dragging up evidence can be an enormous task. Still, Rienzo's day will come.

<p>What? Rebecca, I never outright reverted Vague even once. Initially I reverted about 80% of what he did; after he complained on talk, I saw some of his points better and restored a bunch of his changes, so now about 70% of them are in the article. I certainly am not engaging in a revert war with him...are you getting your information from someone else? Look at the article history yourself. And look, those subarticles got kept on VfD, so I now consider them to be confirmed by community consensus. I pledge not to create any more of them without first getting consensus, although of course I can't speak for others and I'd love it if someone else did create more, so I can continue expanding the content, but you have my pledge that I won't create any more myself without getting the consent of some other participants in the dispute.</p>
<p>I thought subarticles would fix the problems, at least as far as I understand them. It seems the problem was some people thought there was trivial content. So now that content is gone and it's in other articles, so nobody can attack the main article for having trivia anymore. It seems to me that ought to make both parties happy. I guess it doesn't, so therefore you have the above pledge, but I don't really understand why. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:11, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Huh? Well, if you don't like the prose, work on the prose. I've always been told I write well, but that doesn't mean the prose can't still suck. It seems good to me, but I'm just one person.

I certainly have no objections to improving the prose. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:27, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<p>Surely you agree that anything can be written well, no matter what the subject matter is? So apparently prose has nothing to do with it at all, it's the information you don't like. Well, most of the information you don't like is now in the subarticles, so we don't have to worry about it anymore. So what's the dispute? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:43, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I never can understand what you're arguing. It always seems like the things you want were done a long time ago. The chart data was placed into chart format so there wouldn't be that clumsy prose. So what's the problem with it now? Isn't it fixed? And sure, I'm open to removing quotes; I've added many quotes myself in the past that I later removed. But I think it's reasonable to expect a person to make a proper case for the removal if it turns out to be controversial. (Please don't read into that that I'm saying I'll automatically revert unless it gets my approval, as you tend to do, because that is not what I mean.) Isn't this a tempest in a teacup? My position on this issue is very moderate, not at all hardline as you tend to represent it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 12:57, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am perfectly moderate. Never before seen lengths? An incredible claim, inexplicable...OK, Beck, I promised to limit myself to one revert per day, did I not? And I've stuck to that pledge, even though you falsely accused me of breaking it. I will concede that sometimes my reverts are a bit hasty, because I tend to get pissed off by the utterly massive scale of the changes. So I'll promise to be much more careful about reverting if you (and hopefully others) will avoid making such incredibly massive revisions all at once. Don't you think that in a dispute, it's best to work gradually? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 13:09, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>You never listen to me. I plainly said I was willing to consider the removal of plenty of quotes. There are a few that I'd be pretty hardline about, but there's many that could certainly be summarized or replaced by original writing. I can only work out differences if people are willing to talk with me. We've made a minor breakthrough just now in terms of willingness to discuss content, although that's just scratching the surface, really. Generally "discussion" just involves lectures about my horrible reverting while I desperately try to steer the conversation towards content discussion, rarely with any success. I nominate an article for FAC, don't you think I expect the concerns of others to be addressed? You have this strange idea that I reject all others' views, and yet I nominate it for FAC where I'm entirely dependent on the approval of others. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 13:25, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Contrary to your assertions, I did a great deal of work to satisfy people's objections and thought the nomination had a reasonable chance each time I put it forward. Now I fear that the atmosphere is so poisoned that it may not be possible to ever get it featured, which is depressing and makes me want to quit, because getting it to be a FA has been my main objective for some time, and I don't believe a nomination should be shot down just due to petty politics. Anyway, I look forward to your changes; work gradually. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 13:50, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
