<p>Official Rules 1.0 were finished on March 18, and are available. 1.1, (with no rules changes, but some grammar fixes) is what I'll actually be making the efforts to distribute, and I should have that within a couple days. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Church_b51b.html" title="User:Mike Church">Mike Church</a> 17:11, 2 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Where are the rules available? BTW, I posted a message on your user talk page, but you mustn't have seen it, so I'll repeat it here: Why don't you set up an Ambition page at <a href="http://www.student.carleton.edu/~churchm/" class="external free" title="http://www.student.carleton.edu/~churchm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.student.carleton.edu/~churchm/</a>&#160;?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Summary of prior controversy</span></h2>
<p>Since the time of this article's creation, the card game Ambition has seen considerable success in achieving recognition. While its entry into the gaming mainstream has been slowed by its creator's lack of corporate backing and the financial means that would allow the heavy promotion afforded other games, Ambition is (as of <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_27.html" title="April 27">April 27</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Published in a respected <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japanese</a> puzzle magazine.</li>
<li>Listed on <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_Top_100_Games_List_6fc9.html" title="Internet Top 100 Games List">Aaron D. Fuegi's ranked list of games</a>, and within the top 500. Admittedly, I was a contributor, and cast one of its votes.</li>
<li>A game which has accomplished worldwide <i>respect</i>, if not fame.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there has been previous and present debate over whether or not Ambition deserves any presence at all within Wikipedia. I still maintain that it does.</p>
<p>In the light of Ambition's accomplishments-- which I dare call impressive given its lack of corporate backing, in either a financial or promotional sense-- some have ventured to call this innovative new game "unimportant". An anonymous <a href="../../../i/n/t/Internet_troll.html" title="Internet troll">troll post</a> even referred to me as an "infantile game inventor". I do not take these sorts of extraneous <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flamebait.html" title="Flamebait">personal attacks</a> lightly.</p>
<p>I confess, however, that in some cases I have transgressed, by crossing the line from appropriate use of Wikipedia into outright self-promotion. A recent example of this was my inclusion of a link here on <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassin_%28game%29.html" title="Assassin (game)">Assassin (game)</a> justified with the tenuous connection of both games being popular at Carleton. In that case, I had gotten way ahead of myself, and the link had no right to be there. I apologize for this episode of wrongdoing, as well as other similar episodes. Please accept that I did so out of good intentions, and had merely "gone too far", so to speak. Offending people is not the reason I wrote the card game Ambition, nor my reason for exposing it to public view. I expose my game to public view because, having developed a game of high quality, I feel an obligation to share it with others. I have no commercial or political motivations. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Church_b51b.html" title="User:Mike Church">Mike Church</a> 06:36, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mike, please don't remove the debate, such as it was, and then replace it with your own POV "summary". This page, in full context, is immediately relevent to those that visit the page and wonder what on Wikipedia it's doing here. You've already proven to be a little "creative" in your synoptic capacity. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilotPrecise_6b15.html" title="User:PilotPrecise">PilotPrecise</a> 05:34, 30 April 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I haven't removed the debate. It's in a readily accessible archive page: <a href="../../../a/m/b/Talk%7EAmbition_%28card_game%29_archive1_d1b2.html" title="Talk:Ambition (card game)/archive1">/archive1</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't feel I have the right to remove that debate, even if it may not present Ambition in the best light, since it is completely relevant to this page.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, most Talk pages have some cosmetic work done to them (including placement of previous posts into archives) as they get out of hand. This is done not to suppress or delete information, but to <i>organize</i> it. You've seen how unruly and unmaintained some of these Talk pages are.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Certainly, I have the right to make such cosmetic improvements to the Talk page. I'm also allowed to write my own summarization of prior controversy (others are free to disagree with me). Suppressing or eliminating information is not my goal. I simply want this Talk page to be a readable, aesthetically pleasing website for its Users, rather than a disorganized mess.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, articles are subject to the NPOV rule, but Talk pages, as far as I know, are not. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Church_b51b.html" title="User:Mike Church">Mike Church</a> 05:49, 30 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The main proponents/contributors to the effort are closely associated with Mr. Church (they tend to edit the same pages, have affinity for the same lexemes, use the same semantics, etc. read: he uses aliases to do his dirty work) and, in some cases, admitted confidants in the attempt to use wikipedia to evangelize the game.</li>

<dd><b>Wrong.</b> You don't play it, no one you know (except your mom... wait, you didn't know about that) plays it. That doesn't mean <b>no one</b> plays it. That's the most gigantic leap of faith I've ever seen. Honestly, <i>no one knows</i> how large Ambition's play community is anymore. What I do know is that it's played in some colleges and high schools around the country, and that I receive semi-frequent emails asking me for information on the game. Furthermore, <i>no one</i> is hyperbolic at any rate, since I can name people I have played the game with. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Church_b51b.html" title="User:Mike Church">Mike Church</a> 01:17, 6 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's an opinion, and most intelligent people would say it doesn't hold up.

On top of that, it's no big deal. This is an encyclopedia that's developed the amazing ability to correct vandalism within 10 minutes, probably more than 96% of the time.

<dd>What I said in that bit, on my User Page, is that American corporate society is one where creative talents, and creative people, are <i>squeezed out</i>. Therefore, a creative person (or entity, idea) has to fight (incl. self-promote, sometimes "fight dirty") in order to avoid being marginalized entirely. That's not just a personal matter, either.

<p>Who put forth these theories? They sound like you thought them up one night in an pub, no offense. They are mere conjecture. They are contrived. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 06:09, 7 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7EChef_Lord_c043.html" title="User:Chef Lord">User:Chef Lord</a> put forward those theories, at least here. That's what the edit history tells me (though I edited them slightly, splitting the two items into three). Go ask him. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Church_b51b.html" title="User:Mike Church">Mike Church</a> 07:46, 7 May 2004 (UTC)

<dd>Er....go ask him? My question was to the wikipedia public. So, I've already asked him and anyone else who wants to respond. The bottomline is that Wikipedia is not a platform for conjecture. The article succeeds without listing contrived guesswork. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 22:46, 7 May 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed the supposed banning in a cafeteria in a school because it doesn't sound like it had anything to do with <i>this</i> card game in particular. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">UninvitedCompany</a> 18:36, 7 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>All I know about that case is that:
<ul>
<li>Ambition was played at that high school.</li>
<li>A student lost $200 in cafeteria gambling, leading to the ban of a set of card games including Ambition.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Whether or not Ambition specifically led to the $200 loss that spurred the banning thereof, I do not know. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Church_b51b.html" title="User:Mike Church">Mike Church</a> 19:17, 7 May 2004 (UTC)</p>
