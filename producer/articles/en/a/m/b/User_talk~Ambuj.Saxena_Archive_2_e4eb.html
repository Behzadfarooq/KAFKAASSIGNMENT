<h2><span class="mw-headline">Regarding your query on Customary_measurement_systems</span></h2>
<p>Hi!</p>
<dl>
<dd>You left me a question in your edit summary. See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Customary_measurement_systems&amp;diff=44664058&amp;oldid=44614718" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Customary_measurement_systems&amp;diff=44664058&amp;oldid=44614718" rel="nofollow">This</a> for a quick refresher. I put the stub on it to attract editor attention. I probably should have place a clean on it as well for the same purpose.</dd>
<dd>There is a lot to fill in because most cultures have their own 'peoples measures' like the <a href="../../../c/u/p/Cup_%28unit%29.html" title="Cup (unit)">cup (unit)</a> artilce indicates clearly. e.g. <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_customary_units_40bb.html" title="United States customary units">United States customary units</a>. I placed <i>in line comments</i> within (&lt;!--- ... ----&gt;) <i>to indicate this <b>cultural input</b> was what was needed</i>. Those are visible in the link view as well.</dd>
<dd>Hope this clears it up as I have no idea what the customary units may be for Java, Turkey, Italy nor Pakistan! I'll cross post this to the talk and add a clean tag there. I was rushed that night—most likely 5 to seven edit pages deep that I had to back out of and save as I went.&#160;:) I eventually got to bed, but it wasn;t early!&#160;:(

<p>Hello, actually I am not able to comment on such technical matters. You may also contact 2 / 3 more users who may be able to ascertain the defect, and then the matter may be taken up at a proper forum. I find that you have very long term interest of wikipedia in your mind, and that is a really nice sign. --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 17:05, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh now I understand - the version of the windows you may be using may be "out-dated" perhaps. I am not sure, but when I was away and use some PCs installed with older versions, the problem comes - they do not support indic texts. Though I am not sure of this. --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 17:33, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Now I got it. Oh, now I understood it - yes, you are right. How to get it rectified is the main issue now. We will have to take up this with Wikipedia Foundation or its any other wing - which one? I do not have any clue. --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 17:57, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Haha. Yeah, always feel free to post such things on <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotice_board_for_India-related_topics_28e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Notice board for India-related topics">Indian Notice-board</a>. It's meant for things like these. For sources in the IIT article, if you are convinced that there's no reason the source will be biased, go ahead and use it as much as you want. Meanwhile, keep trying to find more sources, since it's always better to work from a broad base of sources. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 13:00, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh..sorry..now I got what you're saying. People do sometimes put the same ref again and again, but I don't think it adds much to information. I'd rather put some inline comments in the article after sentences that might appear to be needing citation, so that if someone goes into edit mode to add sth like "citation needed", he immediately finds out that it's from the source already cited. But you can actually go ahead and cite the source at 2 - 3 important places. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 14:01, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Peer review</span></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, that's the way it always is with peer reviews. Few people are interested in them. Most people point out problems only at the FA nomination stage. Request on the Indian noticeboard for reviews, and then, after a while, nominate it for FA. There will be lots of objections. That will be the main source of feedback, using which the article could be improved. That's how I've seen it work always&#160;:) <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 16:55, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh. Didn't know about that nomination. Of course, it has to be a while before it is nominated -- it doesn't look like a serious candidate right now. Will provide more inputs soon.

<dd>Sorry for the late response. I'm quite busy these days, so I hardly visit wikipedia. The article is looking good. See if you can expand the lead text slightly more. Of course, there would be minor problems here and there that could be sorted out during the nomination week. You have to be sure that you can devote sufficient time to make any suggested changes during that week. So if you are ready, go for it now! It's a job well done&#160;:) <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 01:25, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hey dude, I'd go for FAC. The article looks fabulous and, in my experience, starting the FAC process accelerates the copyediting needed to tweak it to perfection. (FYI, for what it's worth, my dad's an IIT Delhi graduate, and he's enjoyed the article so much that he's forwarding the link to all his colleagues. Big ups to you.) -- <font color="black" face="Arial"><a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)">Samir</a></font> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/c/cf/Flag_of_Canada.svg/25px-Flag_of_Canada.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_Canada.svg_0783.html" /></a> <font face="Arial Narrow" color="#000000"><small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_5ee9.html" title="User talk:Samir (The Scope)">(the scope)</a></small></font> 03:58, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've found many issues with the article. I'll need some more time before I put up my comments. This article still has someway to go before it becomes featured. I request you to be patient as it may face a host of objections. To begin with please clarify the licences of the images. Not all websites release their pictures free for commercial and derivative use. Secondly, please provide transcripts of "friends" who have released their rights to the images. Thirdly, please use the png filetype for the map.

<dd>I will surely wait. There's no point in rushing if issues can be resolved before the FAC. I have replaced the IIT Image with the PNG one and will put the transcripts as soon as possible. The images that I have used from website includes the photograph of Nehru laying foundation stone of IIT Kharagpur, and the source was IIT Kharagpur's Website. How do I find out if it were free or not? My guess was that since its more than 50 years old and the website does not mention any copyrights, the image is both Fair Use as well as public domain. -<a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.Saxena_7172.html" title="User:Ambuj.Saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbuj.Saxena_ee93.html" title="User talk:Ambuj.Saxena">talk</a>) 17:55, 6 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The issues raised by you have been addressed. I have contacted the original authors and got first-hand transcript of the permission, which now appears in the image summary. The license of the image of Nehru in History section has been modified to {{<a href="../../../h/i/s/Template%7EHistoricPhoto_b1d1.html" title="Template:HistoricPhoto">HistoricPhoto</a>}}, which I believe should be appropriate. The PNG file of the map has been uploaded and link updated. I have even put up the older image for deletion myself as it is now redundant. Hope to hear more from you soon. -<a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.Saxena_7172.html" title="User:Ambuj.Saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbuj.Saxena_ee93.html" title="User talk:Ambuj.Saxena">talk</a>) 06:06, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

One occasionally comes across editors who have thousands of good edits, but because they may not get around as much as others, their contributions and hard work often go un-noticed. Sadly, these editors often leave the project. As Esperanzians, we can help to make people feel appreciated, be it by some kind words or the awarding of a Barnstar. A project the size of Wikipedia has thousands of editors, so there are plenty of people out there who deserve recognition, one just has to find them. The object of this program is not to flood editors with Barnstars, but to seek out people who deserve them, and make them feel appreciated."</i></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">IITs + licences</span></h2>
<p>Hi! I afraid I don't think I'll get much time to deep review the article during this week. If you feel like wrapping things up on PR, go ahead, I'll put my comments on the IIT talk page.</p>
<p>Briefly, the GFDL licence allows a person to do the following: 1. Make commercial use of your image directly or indirectly 2. Make derivatives of your image without necessarily contacting you. However the licence is such that, he MUST credit you as the author, and release any derivatives only under the GFDL licence. If an image is released under GFDL, the licence cannot be revoked. GFDL, however is not very appropriate for images, a more appropriate licence is the <i>CC-BY-SA-[version]</i> (creative commons share alike) licence which is accepted by wikipedia. You can also dual licence the CC and GFDL licences together. Since you are the author of the images, the date taken would be a good addition to the page.</p>
<p>Public Domain images means that the author has given up all rights to it. Any person may make commercial use without crediting the author, and release derivates on his own terms. Such a licence is not legal in India (it is only legal after you go through a lot a red tape... I can explain if needed). Releasing all rights to the image is another term used in <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="commons:">commons:</a>.</p>
<p>IITs are largely known for its engineering services, so a geology department would display another facet of the institute. I'm pretty sure they have a geo-dept.</p>
<p>Regarding IIT-Ro, is it possible to get data from there itself?</p>
<p>Ummm... yes, "preferred IIT" may be considered subjective. How about looking at it from another angle: Which of the 7 IITs are first filled to its maximum capacity? Do you have access to such data? I'm looking at it on the lines of IIM-A.</p>

<li>Still, the reaction mirrors the reservations I had which is why I called the meeting, and many of the ideas are beyond my expectations (You missed many of those with an early post).</li>
<li>Your technical points are well taken and appreciated, but just cutting in the chronology and making some of those events present better (with background) took a couple of days of heavy edits, and I've got other irons in the fire. Most of them have suffered for this trial, and in truth had a higher priority to begin with, but once I started a page, however hastily, it was either carry on with some initial effort, or ask for a speedy delete. I need to think more of these brainstorms outside the heat of an series of related edits. Those redlinks just call to be filled in... and I guess I'm too stubborn to ignore the need as well. Well, that's what the sandbox is for, I guess. I just need to start there first!</li>
<li>On the whole, I wasn't sure how to procede as the concept was to create a sense of <i>what people</i> who heard it that night <i>experienced</i> as it shocked the country into awareness of the dangers. Even with the great ideas thereon now, I'm not sure how to make that encyclopedaic, as it necessarily involves both historical narrative (perspective) and emotionalism— more a literary tool, than one of education per se — this draft version at least can't be attacked as POV, whereas a more textual treatment will have to walk a fine line. As one respondant suggested, beefing it up with a lot of researched cited quotes by others would appear to be the way to go wrt the speech itself and the reaction it had afterwards.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, I'm not sure still how to handle the beginning 'era', for that's the educational value I want to present and envisioned as well— the trick is how to pull it off within guidelines. I could do an essay, but that wouldn't be encyclopedic. That's the rub.</li>
<li>But you were kind enough to take the time and I've not worked with you as I have with most of the others [so far] commenting and as I'm pretty much the sole editor(s) &lt;G&gt; at this juncture, I wanted you to know your time was appreciated.</li>
<li>I wanted diverse reactions for many reasons, esp. because I wasn't happy myself with the presentation as the ideal 'concept' and the technique (as it was set forth) diverged as the (ever growing) length impacted what I <i>felt</i> as a gestalt from the first in my own crystalized knowledge of the era when I reread that text the first time Tuesday or Wednesday night... i.e. before creating a page at all.</li>
<li>I think I'll have it moved off to a user page until I get an even larger project cleared up, but that should wait until next weekend or so to give the other invitees and drop-ins a crack at it.</li>
<li>Many Thanks! <b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User%7EFabartus_bae5.html" title="User:Fabartus">Fra</a></b><a href="../../../f/a/b/User_talk%7EFabartus_c63e.html" title="User talk:Fabartus"><font color="green">nkB</font></a> 05:32, 15 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just wanted to add that I wasn't aware that you'd been editing in the article, at all or so extensively until a short while ago. How's the Intro stub read now? Thanks for the assists.</li>
<li>I've asked the 'quorum' for feedback on the chronology presentation, which I suspect will endup as sub-pages. That might be good, as a WW-II focused sub-page could then be linked into many an article. I've also asked about the whitespace compressed form you did (I think) in one section (1939, iirc) or whether the spaced out version is easier to read. I've also learned tonight that different skins (I'm working in my third tonight) really make a difference on how things look. That's a valuable thing to know. I already routinely zoom in and zoom out to check for 'good vs. best' picture and table placement concerns, but this adds a whole new thing to check for appearance!</li>
<li>Mostly, wanted to say thanks for editing.

<dd>Hi Ambuj, wow thanks ever so much for the quick response and for creating those two audio files. The English pronounciation is perfect, but can we modify the Kannada pronounciation a little bit? It's a little hard to explain, so I'll break it down by syllable. Bangalore in Kannada is transliterated as Bengaluru. The first syllable, <i>Benga</i> sounds exactly like it is written. The "e" in Benga should sound like the "e" in "bet". The last syllable "luru" should be pronounced "looroo". Would it be possible for you to make those modifications, when you get a chance?

<p>I know the Hindi wikipedia is in a bad shape. I tried editing once or twice there. It was so bad that once I had to correct the interwikilink for Russia labelled oddly as <i>stub</i> to <i>roos</i>!</p>
<p>Coming back to the state of affairs: Hemanshu has been inactive for quite a while now (He is one of the earliest Indian admins on en: ). I guess he must have caught up with work and studies. The next course of action would be to list the top 5-10 contributors on <a href="../../../../hi/index.html" class="extiw" title="hi:">hi:</a> and and ask a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/steward" class="extiw" title="m:steward">m:steward</a> (<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">user:Angela</a> is pretty helpful) to promote them as admins since the local b'crat is inactive. The admins can also choose one or two of them to be a b'crat. Hope this is an acceptable solution.

<dd>There seems to be confusion about which cities to include as metros. We could try to get Mega cities of India as featured. It is an official term used by the government.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is about the edit you made by deleting reference to UK from anti-climb paint. I know that prima facie it looks biased and POV, but I have found that its true. I came to this conclusion by extensive searching the web (using Google). I encourage you to confirm it yourself. I will leave the decision to reinstate it or not to you ask ask you to do only if you are 100% convinced. I did it because I was.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Political parties</span></h2>
<p>I have tried to expand the paragraph about political parties by giving the seat details in both the Assembly and the Municipality. The problem is that there are only 2 parties today in Ahmedabad politics (only 1 as things are going on currently). Is that enough, or is more expansion needed? - <a href="../../../a/k/s/User%7EAksi_great_bb76.html" title="User:Aksi great">Aksi_great</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/s/User_talk%7EAksi_great_f9ab.html" title="User talk:Aksi great">talk</a>) 18:51, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
