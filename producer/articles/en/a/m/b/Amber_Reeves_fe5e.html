<p>While at Cambridge Amber began to associate with other young women who shared her intellectual enthusiasms and socialist political leanings, forming a lifelong friendship with Eva Spielmann (later Eva Hubback, who became an educationalist). She became involved in a number of societies, including the debating society. In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a> she led the inter-collegiate debate with <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girton.html" title="Girton">Girton</a>, arguing that "the socialist conception of life is the most noble and the most fruitful, both for the state and the individual" In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a> she founded the Cambridge University Fabian Society (CUFS) with Ben Keeling, a member of the (somewhat inactive) existing Fabian society in the town. CUFS was the first society at Cambridge to enlist women from its founding. Young women met regularly with men as equals and discussed everything from religious beliefs to social evils to sex, which would have been impossible in the conventional atmospheres of their homes. She excelled in her studies. <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilbert_Murray_a6de.html" title="Gilbert Murray">Gilbert Murray</a> once wrote of an address she had given to the Newnham Philosophical Society, "It seems to me quite the best college paper that I have read- I mean as treated by a young person and from a non-metaphysical point of view". A fellow student described her as "intellect personified" after a lecture she gave to the Philosophical Society. <sup id="_ref-fry_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fry" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/b/Amber_Reeves_fe5e.html" title="Edit section: Relationship with H.G Wells">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Relationship with H.G Wells</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../h/2E/g/H.G._Wells_27b3.html" title="H.G. Wells">H.G. Wells</a> had been a friend of Amber's parents and one of the most popular speakers to address the CUFS. After Amber's address to the Philosophical Society it was rumoured that she and Wells had gone to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> together for a weekend. Their appearance together at a supper party thrown for fellow Fabian and <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_of_Jamaica_069e.html" title="Governor of Jamaica">Governor of Jamaica</a> Sir <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney_Olivier_494f.html" title="Sydney Olivier">Sydney Olivier</a> was the first open declaration of the romantic relationship between the pair. Wells claimed that Amber responded to his taste for adventurous <a href="../../../e/r/o/Eroticism.html" title="Eroticism">eroticism</a>, and the "sexual imaginativess" that his wife Jane could not cope with. Wells maintained that their relationship be kept silent, though Amber saw no reason their exciting affair be kept a secret. Once their relationship became well known there were numerous attempts to break it up, particularly from Amber's mother and lawyer George Rivers Blanco White (who would later become Amber's husband).</p>
<p>Amber was anxious not to break up Wells's marriage, though she wanted to have his child. The news that she was pregnant in the spring of <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a> shocked the Reeves family, and the couple fled to <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Touquet_033f.html" title="Le Touquet">Le Touquet</a> where they attempted domestic life together. Neither of them did well with domesticity; loneliness and anxiety concerning her pregnancy, as well as the complexity of the situation drove Amber to depression, and after three months they decided to leave Le Touquet. Wells took Amber to <a href="../../../b/o/u/Boulogne.html" title="Boulogne">Boulogne</a> and put her on the ferry to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, while he stayed to continue his writing.</p>
<p>Amber went to stay with Wells and his wife Jane when they returned to <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sandgate.html" title="Sandgate">Sandgate</a> and on 7 May <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a> she was married to Rivers Blanco White. In her latter life she wrote "I did not arrange to marry Rivers, he arranged it with H.G, but I have always thought it the best that could possibly have happened." Wells wrote a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_%C3%A0_clef.html" title="Roman à clef">roman à clef</a>, <i><a href="../../../a/n/n/Ann_Veronica_bcce.html" title="Ann Veronica">Ann Veronica</a></i> based on his relationship with Amber. The novel was rejected by his publisher, Frederick Macmillan, because of the possible damage it would do; however, <a href="../../../t/2E/_/T._Fisher_Unwin_1ce2.html" title="T. Fisher Unwin">T. Fisher Unwin</a> published it in the autumn of 1909, when gossip concerning Wells was rampant. Wells later wrote that while the character of Ann Veronica was based on Amber, the character he believed came closest to her was Amanda in his novel <i><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1138" class="external text" title="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1138" rel="nofollow">The Research Magnificent</a></i> On December 31 <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a> she bore a daughter, Anna-Jane, to <a href="../../../h/2E/g/H.G._Wells_27b3.html" title="H.G.

<p>Amber was employed by the Ministry of Labour, in charge of a section that dealt with the employment of women. Part of her job was encouraging workers and employers to see that women were capable of a much wider range of tasks than was usually expected. She later took responsibility for women's wages at the Ministry of Munitions. In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a> she was appointed to the <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitley_Council_23ab.html" title="Whitley Council">Whitley Council</a>, but in that same year her appointment was terminated. Humber Wolfe, a public servant, wrote to <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matthew_Nathan_b6ad.html" title="Matthew Nathan">Matthew Nathan</a>, the secretary of the council, pointing out that Amber's termination was chiefly on the grounds that she was a married woman, and that letting her go from the public service was "really stupid". By <a href="../../../1/9/2/1921.html" title="1921">1921</a> her vigour in the women workers' cause had led her to come up against ex-servicemen who exercised considerable power through their associations. She was told a deputation of MPs had approached the minister and claimed that no ex-serviceman could sleep in peace while she remained in the Civil Service. She received a dismissal notice and, aside from time with the Ministry of Labour in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1922.html" title="1922">1922</a>, that was the end of her Civil Service career. She began to work on her book <i>Give and Take</i> which was published in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1923.html" title="1923">1923</a>. Amber didn't take well to being a housewife; at one point she wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The life of washing up dishes in little separate houses and being necessarily subordinate in everything to the wage-earning man is I think very destructive to the women and to any opinion they may influence. It is humiliating and narrowing and there is nothing to be said in its favour... ...Oh how I should like some hard work again that brought one up against outside life."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was some strain in the household due to Rivers being attracted to other women. In their youth they had both adopted positive attitudes toward the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_love.html" title="Free love">free expression of love</a> that were common in the literary, intellectual and left-wing society at the time, but as they grew older these attitudes were beginning to change. Writing of marriage in her book <i>Worry in Women</i>, she stated that if people choose to break ethical codes they had to be prepared to cope with guilt. She also stated that if a wife was unfaithful, she should not tell her husband, writing, "if ever there is a case for a downright lie, this is it"<sup id="_ref-fry_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fry" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Amber Reeves published four novels and four non-fiction works, dealing with a variety of subjects, but all sharing a common socialist and feminist critique of capitalist society. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The Reward of Virtue</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a>)</li>
<li><i>A Lady and her Husband</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/1/1914.html" title="1914">1914</a>)</li>

<li><i>Ethics for Unbelievers</i> (<a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>She also wrote book reviews for <i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harpers_%26_Queen_fcd8.html" title="Harpers &amp; Queen">Queen</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../v/o/g/Vogue_%28magazine%29.html" title="Vogue (magazine)">Vogue</a></i>, as well as articles for the <i><a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday_Review_d1b9.html" title="Saturday Review">Saturday Review</a></i>. For some time she was the editor of the Townswomen's Guild paper <i>Townswoman</i>. Amber also collaborated with H.G. Wells on <i>The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind</i>, for which she researched and put together material on the devastation of the <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubber.html" title="Rubber">rubber</a> trade on the native populations of <a href="../../../p/u/t/Putumayo.html" title="Putumayo">Putumayo</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peru.html" title="Peru">Peru</a>, and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Congo.html" title="Congo">Congo</a>, as well as contributing to a section on how wealth is accumulated by supplying case histories of new powers and forces "running wild and crazy in a last frenzy for private and personal gain". The chapter "The Role of Women in the World's Work" was included by Wells at Amber's suggestion, though after reading the chapter she asked him to include a disclaimer that she did not necessarily agree with what he said.<sup id="_ref-fry_4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fry" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>During the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_general_election%2C_1924_0d47.html" title="United Kingdom general election, 1924">1924 election</a> campaign, Amber was asked to speak on behalf of both the <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_%28UK%29_4ba9.html" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberal</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Party_%28UK%29_3e02.html" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> candidates. She choose to support Labour: "The Liberal audiences were nice narrow decent people. They sat upright in rows and clapped their cotton gloves... But when I got to the Labour meetings in the slums, among the costers and the railway men and the women in tenth hand velvet hats - when I saw their pinched grey-and-yellow faces in those steamy halls, I knew all of a sudden that they were my people". She soon became a member of the party and supported her husband as the Labour Party candidate for <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holland_with_Boston_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_8059.html" title="Holland with Boston (UK Parliament constituency)">Holland-with-Boston</a> in <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincolnshire.html" title="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>. The seat had gone to the Liberals in a by election earlier that year and Rivers failed to win it back. Amber attempted to get her theories on currency, later brought together in her book <i>The Nationalisation of Banking</i>, adopted by the Labour Party, and she and Rivers became responsible for a party publication called <i>Womens Leader</i>. Amber remained active in the Fabian society, and by this time many Fabians agreed that there was a need to work through the parliamentary Labour Party. She stood twice as a candidate for <a href="../../../h/e/n/Hendon_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29_209e.html" title="Hendon (UK Parliament constituency)">Hendon</a>, in <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/3/1935.html" title="1935">1935</a><sup id="_ref-fry_5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-fry" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>For some time Amber taught at <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morley_College_40d3.html" title="Morley College">Morley College</a> in London. Initially invited by her friend from Cambridge Eva Hubback to help out, she became part of a team of lecturers in <a href="../../../1/9/2/1928.html" title="1928">1928</a>, giving twice weekly classes on <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethics.html" title="Ethics">ethics</a> amd <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychology.html" title="Psychology">psychology</a>. In <a href="../../../1/9/2/1929.html" title="1929">1929</a> (the year after the passing of the Equal Franchise Act which gave women the vote) she was was billed by the Fabian society to lecture on "The New Woman Voters and the Coming Election". However, she withdrew from this lecture to work on a by-election campaign for her husband Rivers in Holland-with-Boston. She lectured at Morley for thirty-seven years, regularly revising her courses to incorporate an increased body of psychological thought. In <a href="../../../1/9/4/1946.html" title="1946">1946</a> she became acting principal after the death of Eva Hubback.

<p>In <a href="../../../j/u/l/July.html" title="July">July</a> <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960.html" title="1960">1960</a> Rivers suffered from a stroke which left him paralysed down his right side. Amber was distraught and during the last years of his life she worried a lot and became depressed. She wrote to her daughter Anna-Jane, who was in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Singapore.html" title="Singapore">Singapore</a> at the time, "If there is a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confucious.html" title="Confucious">Confucian</a> temple in <a href="../../../k/u/a/Kuala_Lumpur_b5d7.html" title="Kuala Lumpur">K.L.</a>, you might make a little offering (if he does like offerings)... ...I have more faith in him now than in our own deity who seems to be letting us down all round."
