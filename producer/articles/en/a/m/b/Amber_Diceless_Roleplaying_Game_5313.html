<p>The <b>Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game</b> is a <a href="../../../r/o/l/Role-playing_game.html" title="Role-playing game">role-playing game</a> created and written by <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erick_Wujcik_7456.html" title="Erick Wujcik">Erick Wujcik</a>, set in the <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_universe.html" title="Fictional universe">fictional universe</a> created by author <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Zelazny_9262.html" title="Roger Zelazny">Roger Zelazny</a> for his <i><a href="../../../c/h/r/Chronicles_of_Amber_c454.html" title="Chronicles of Amber">Chronicles of Amber</a></i>.

<p>Amber DRPG was created in the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, and is much more focused on relationships and roleplaying than most of the roleplaying games of that era.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Most Amber characters are members of the two ruling classes in the Amber <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29.html" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">multiverse</a>, and are much more advanced in matters of strength, endurance, psyche, warfare and sorcery than ordinary beings.

<p>The original 256-page game book<sup id="_ref-amberdrpg_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-amberdrpg" title="">[1]</a></sup> was published in 1991 by <a href="../../../p/h/a/Phage_Press_f352.html" title="Phage Press">Phage Press</a>, covering material from the first five novels (the "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chronicles_of_Amber_abbc.html#The_Corwin_Cycle" title="The Chronicles of Amber">Corwin Cycle</a>") and some details - sorcery and the <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logrus.html" title="Logrus">Logrus</a> - from the remaining five novels (the "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chronicles_of_Amber_abbc.html#The_Merlin_Cycle" title="The Chronicles of Amber">Merlin Cycle</a>"), in order to allow players to roleplay characters from the Courts of Chaos. Some details were changed slightly to allow more player choice - for example, players can be full Trump Artists without having walked the Pattern or the Logrus, which <a href="../../../m/e/r/Merlin_%28The_Chronicles_of_Amber%29_dba8.html" title="Merlin (The Chronicles of Amber)">Merlin</a> says is impossible; and players' <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychic.html" title="Psychic">psychic</a> abilities are far greater than those shown in the books.</p>

<p>A 256-page companion volume, <i>Shadow Knight</i>,<sup id="_ref-shadowknight_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-shadowknight" title="">[2]</a></sup> was published in 1993. This supplemental rule book includes the remaining elements from the Merlin novels, such as Broken Patterns, and allows players to create Constructs such as Merlin's Ghostwheel. The book presents the second series of novels not as additions to the series' <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continuity_%28fiction%29.html" title="Continuity (fiction)">continuity</a> but as an example of a <a href="../../../c/a/m/Campaign_%28role-playing_games%29.html" title="Campaign (role-playing games)">roleplaying campaign</a> with Merlin, Luke, Julia, Jurt and Coral as the PCs. The remainder of the book is a collection of essays on the game, statistics for the new characters and an update of the older ones in light of their appearance in the second series, and (perhaps most usefully for GMs) plot summaries of each of the ten books. The book includes some material from the short story <a href="../../../a/m/b/Amber_Short_Stories_041f.html#The_Salesman.27s_Tale" title="Amber Short Stories">The Salesman's Tale</a>, and some unpublished material cut from <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_of_Chaos_4ae5.html" title="Prince of Chaos">Prince of Chaos</a>, notably Coral's pregnancy by Merlin.</p>
<p>A third book, <i>Rebma</i>, was promised and pre-orders were taken, but it never arrived, leading to accusations that it was <a href="../../../v/a/p/Vaporware.html" title="Vaporware">vaporware</a>. Wujcik also expressed a desire to create a book giving greater detail to the Courts of Chaos.<sup id="_ref-pyramid_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pyramid" title="">[3]</a></sup> However, the publishing rights to the Amber DRPG games were acquired in 2004 by <a href="../../../g/u/a/Guardians_of_Order_ee40.html" title="Guardians of Order">Guardians of Order</a>, who took over sales of the game and announced their intention to release a new edition of the game. However, no new edition was released before Guardians of Order went out of business in 2006. The two existing books are now <a href="../../../o/u/t/Out-of-print.html" title="Out-of-print">out-of-print</a>, but they have been made available as <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portable_Document_Format_95a8.html" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</a> downloads.<sup id="_ref-pdf_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-pdf" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>The game is set in the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29.html" title="Parallel universe (fiction)">multiverse</a> described in Zelazny's <i>Chronicles of Amber</i>. The first book assumes that gamemasters will set their campaigns after the Patternfall war; that is, after the end of the fifth book in the series, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Courts_of_Chaos_6d83.html" title="The Courts of Chaos">The Courts of Chaos</a></i>, but uses material from the following books to describe those parts of Zelazny's cosmology that were featured there in more detail. The Amber multiverse consists of <b>Amber</b>, a city at one pole of the universe wherein is found <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Pattern_f38a.html" title="The Pattern">the Pattern</a>, the symbol of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/order" class="extiw" title="wikt:order">Order</a>; The <b>Courts of Chaos</b>, an assembly of worlds at the other pole where can be found <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Logrus_4383.html" title="The Logrus">the Logrus</a>, the manifestation of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos.html" title="Chaos">Chaos</a>, and the Abyss, the source or end of all reality; and <b>Shadow</b>, the collection of all possible <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universe.html" title="Universe">universes</a> (shadows) between and around them. Inhabitants of either pole can use one or both of the Pattern and the Logrus to travel through Shadow.</p>
<p>It is assumed that players will portray the children of the main characters from the books - the ruling family of Amber, known as the Elder Amberites - or a resident of the Courts. However, since some feel that being the children of the main characters is too limiting, it is fairly common to either start with King Oberon's death <i>before</i> the book begins and roleplay the Elder Amberites as they vie for the throne; or to populate Amber from scratch with a different set of Elder Amberites. The former option is one presented in the book; the latter is known in the Amber community as an "<a href="../../../a/m/e/Amethyst.html" title="Amethyst">Amethyst</a>" game. A third option is to have the players portray <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corwin_%28The_Chronicles_of_Amber%29_a278.html" title="Corwin (The Chronicles of Amber)">Corwin</a>'s children, in an amber-like city built around Corwin's pattern; this is sometimes called an "<a href="../../../a/r/g/Argent.html" title="Argent">Argent</a>" game, since one of Corwin's <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heraldry.html" title="Heraldry">heraldic</a> colours is <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver.html" title="Silver">Silver</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/b/Amber_Diceless_Roleplaying_Game_5313.html" title="Edit section: Attributes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Attributes</span></h3>
<p>Characters in Amber DRPG are represented by four <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attribute_%28role-playing_games%29.html" title="Attribute (role-playing games)">attributes</a>: <i>Psyche</i>, <i>Strength</i>, <i>Endurance</i> and <i>Warfare</i>.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Psyche</b> is used for feats of willpower or magic.</li>
<li><b>Strength</b> is used for feats of strength or unarmed combat.</li>
<li><b>Endurance</b> is used for feats of endurance.</li>
<li><b>Warfare</b> is used for armed combat, from duelling to commanding armies</li>
</ul>
<p>The attributes run from -25 (normal human level), through -10 (normal level for a denizen of the Courts of Chaos) and 0 (normal level for an inhabitant of Amber), upwards without limit. Scores above 0 are "ranked", with the highest score being ranked 1st, the next-highest 2nd, and so on. The character with 1st rank in each attribute is considered "superior" in that attribute, being considered to be substantially better than the character with 2nd rank even if the difference in scores is small.</p>
<p><a name="The_Attribute_Auction" id="The_Attribute_Auction"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/b/Amber_Diceless_Roleplaying_Game_5313.html" title="Edit section: The Attribute Auction">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Attribute Auction</span></h4>
<p>A character's ability scores are purchased during <a href="../../../c/h/a/Character_creation.html" title="Character creation">character creation</a> in an <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auction.html" title="Auction">auction</a>; players get 100 <a href="../../../c/h/a/Character_point.html" title="Character point">character points</a>, and bid on each attribute in turn. Unlike conventional auctions, bids are non-refundable; if one player bids 65 for psyche and another wins with a bid of 66, then the character with 66 is "superior" to the character with 65 even though there is only one bid difference. After the auction, players can secretly pay extra points to raise their ranks, but they can only pay to raise their scores to an existing rank. Further, a character with a bid-for rank is considered to have a slight advantage over character with a bought-up rank.</p>
<p>The Auction simulates a 'history' of competition between the descendants of Oberon for Player Characters who have not had dozens of decades to get to know each other. Through the competitive Auction, characters may begin the game vying for standings.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/b/Amber_Diceless_Roleplaying_Game_5313.html" title="Edit section: Psyche in Amber DRPG compared to the Chronicles">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Psyche in Amber DRPG compared to the Chronicles</span></h4>
<p>Characters with high psyche are presented as having strong <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telepathic.html" title="Telepathic">telepathic</a> abilities, being able to <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypnotise.html" title="Hypnotise">hypnotise</a> and even mentally dominate any character with lesser psyche with whom they can make eye-contact. This is likely due to three scenes in the Chronicles: first, when Eric paralyzes Corwin with an attack across the Trumps and refuses to desist because one or the other would be dominated; second, when <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corwin_%28The_Chronicles_of_Amber%29_a278.html" title="Corwin (The Chronicles of Amber)">Corwin</a> faces the demon Strygwalldir, it is able to wrestle mentally with him when their gazes meet; and third, when Fiona is able to keep Brand immobile in the final battle at the Courts of Chaos.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[5]</a></sup> However, in general, the books only feature mental battles when there is some reason for mind-to-mind contact (for example, Trump contact) and magic or Trump is involved in all three of the above conflicts, so it is not clear whether Zelazny intended his characters to have such a power; The combination of Brand's "living trump" powers and his high Psyche (as presented in the roleplaying game) would have guaranteed him victory over Corwin. <i>Shadow Knight</i> does address this inconsistency somewhat, by presenting the "living trump" abilities as somewhat limited.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/b/Amber_Diceless_Roleplaying_Game_5313.html" title="Edit section: Powers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Powers</span></h3>
<p>Characters in Amber DRPG have access to the powers seen in the Chronicles of Amber: <b>Pattern</b>, <b>Logrus</b>, <b>Shape-shifting</b>, <b>Trump Artistry</b>, and <b>magic</b>. A character who has walked the pattern can walk in shadow to any possible universe, and while there can manipulate probability. A character who has mastered the Logrus can send out Logrus tendrils and pull themself or objects through shadow. Shape-shifters can alter their physical form, and Trump Artists can create Trumps, a sort of <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarot.html" title="Tarot">tarot</a> card which allows mental communication and travel. Three types of magic are detailed: <b>Power Words</b>, with a quick, small effect; <b>Sorcery</b>, with pre-prepared spells as in many other game systems; and <b>Conjuration</b>, the creation of small objects. Each of the first three powers is available in an advanced form.</p>

<p>While a character with Pattern, Logrus or Conjuration can acquire virtually any object, players can choose to spend character points to obtain objects with particular virtues - unbreakability, or a mind of their own. Since they have paid points for the items, they are a part of the character's legend, and cannot lightly be destroyed. Similarly, a character can find any possible universe, but they can spend character points to know of or inhabit shadows which are (in some sense) "real" and therefore useful. The expansion, <i>Shadow knight</i>, adds Constructs - artifacts with connections to shadows.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/b/Amber_Diceless_Roleplaying_Game_5313.html" title="Edit section: Stuff">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Stuff</span></h3>
<p>Unspent character points become <b>good stuff</b> - a good luck for the character. Players are also allowed to overspend (in moderation), with the points becoming <b>bad stuff</b> - bad luck which the Gamemaster should inflict on the character. As well as representing luck, stuff can be seen as representing a character's outlook on the universe: characters with good stuff seeing the multiverse as a cheerful place, while characters with bad stuff see it as hostile.</p>

<p>In any given fair conflict between two characters, the character with the higher score in the relevant attribute will eventually win. The key word here is <i>fair</i> - if characters' ranks are close, and the weaker character has obtained some advantage, then the weaker character can escape defeat or perhaps prevail. This concept has been developed further in <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wick_0096.html" title="John Wick">John Wick</a>'s <i>Advantage system</i>. Alternatively, if characters' attribute ranks are close, the weaker character can try to change the relevant attribute by changing the nature of the conflict. For example, if two characters are wrestling the relevant attribute is Strength; a character could reveal a weapon, changing it to Warfare; they could try to overcome the other character's mind using a power, changing it to Psyche; or they could concentrate their strength on defense, changing it to Endurance. This concept is similar to the concept of <i>escalation</i> in <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogs_in_the_Vineyard_b7eb.html" title="Dogs in the Vineyard">Dogs in the Vineyard</a>. If there is a substantial difference between characters' ranks, the conflict is generally over before the weaker character can react.</p>

Amber conventions, known as <i>Ambercons</i>, are held yearly in <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michigan.html" title="Michigan">Michigan</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portland%2C_Oregon_1e41.html" title="Portland, Oregon">Portland</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading%2C_England_9378.html" title="Reading, England">Reading, England</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modena%2C_Italy_cc36.html" title="Modena, Italy">Modena, Italy</a>. Additionally, Phage Press published 12 volumes of a dedicated Amber DRPG magazine called <i>Amberzine</i>. Some <i>Amberzine</i> issues are still available from Phage Press.</p>
