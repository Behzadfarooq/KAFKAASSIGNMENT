<p>about "Unmeasured [soundscape]". As questions shouldn't be in a Wikipedia article, I moved it here. Can anybody define this subgenre of ambient and/or suggest an answer?

<p>In my (and my friends') humble opinion 'conventional' ambient doesn't really make sense. It's just very soft DnB, or soft techno.

<p>I think it makes sense to give new age music its own page, because it is distinct from ambient as a genre. Ambient and new age are 2 separate subgenres of electronic music. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeidimo_ab08.html" title="User:Heidimo">heidimo</a> 21:00, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You are right, it probably doesn't deserve to be considered a subgenre, but these artists should be discussed as part of the history of ambient music, because there is considerable overlap in the styles. Actually, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Age_1b86.html#Music" title="New Age">New Age music</a> does have a separate section. I moved the separate genre back to the history section, because it's really part of the history of the second wave of ambient music than an ambient genre per se.</dd>

<dd>Lexor, it makes more sense now--looks good. I tweaked the language a bit in that new age/history paragraphy in an attempt to make it less awkward. The "new age" link in the paragraph goes to a general new age page, though, and not to a music page, like your link above does. I must admit I'm not fond of that clunky chart, though it does serve a purpose. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeidimo_ab08.html" title="User:Heidimo">heidimo</a> 23:28, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

With all due respect, ambient dub is a different sub-genre than dub. Same goes with ambient house, etc. I see plenty of other minor distinctions in other sections. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeidimo_ab08.html" title="User:Heidimo">heidimo</a> 04:22, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that ambient dub is different to dub, but we did an agglomeration of most of the ambient articles a while ago, since most of the descriptions for the subgenres were sub-stubs, and also ambient dub, <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambient_house.html" title="Ambient house">ambient house</a> articles don't exist as yet. What I plan to do is to add summary information to the main <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambient_music.html" title="Ambient music">ambient music</a>, then add <i>Main article:</i> <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambient_house.html" title="Ambient house">ambient house</a> under the title (see for example the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_music.html" title="Progressive music">progressive music</a> page for an example of how this is done, there wasn't enough info to justify extra articles for progressive house, progressive techno etc. so they appear in the main article, but there was enough for <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressive_rock.html" title="Progressive rock">progressive rock</a>) if the article is more than a stub. I'm sorry if I jumped the gun somewhat and you were about to create those articles. --<a href="../../../l/e/x/User%7ELexor_1be7.html" title="User:Lexor">Lexor</a> 08:31, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Lexor, I was about to create those. I'm a new contributor, so I'm a little unclear about the conventions sometimes. I created a new ambient groove article, but then thought from what you said that it would be more appropriate as part of the ambient article, so I moved it over there. But of course, the link doesn't go there. As far as the list goes, I thought it should be as complete as possible, but link to the sections in the ambient article, rather than individual articles on every sub-genre if that's what you're suggesting. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeidimo_ab08.html" title="User:Heidimo">heidimo</a> 19:36, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm inclined to think these two subgenres are really the same. What do others think? <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeidimo_ab08.html" title="User:Heidimo">heidimo</a> 16:13, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello All</p>
<p>I just had to include other influences, such as; reggae, traditional, world music- all having their role in shaping ambient soundscapes.</p>
<p>Also a little input on the dub masters of old who were first to "play" with post producing sound effects dub-echoe-delay etc. which has greatly influenced the electronic sounds and styles of today. I can add later some contemporary ambient dub artists.</p>
<p>Ben3rdEye 2005/02/02</p>
<p><br />
yep king tubby and all that was good stuff - but they were no way the first experimenting with delay reverb and tape loops and the like. Peop0le like pierre schaeffers music concrete and early radiphonic practitioners ie bbc radiphonic workshop etc were using such effects as early as the 40s .</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/b/Talk%7EAmbient_music_0108.html" title="Edit section: Dark Ambient">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Dark Ambient</span></h2>
<p>There is an entry on dark ambient here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_ambient" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_ambient" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_ambient</a> Which should probably be merged into the ambient definition. Dark ambient is a pretty large subgenre of ambient but it still belongs under the definition of ambient. The article could use some clarifications, mostly about it's origins. Any objections to moving the dark ambient entry over here?</p>
<p>Also, I'd like to add mention of Tangerine Dream. They had huge influences on ambient even if they were never called ambient themselves. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanctum_7a9b.html" title="User:Sanctum">Sanctum</a> 06:24, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Entries I'm going to delete (right now) from the "list of notable albums", and why:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Buttigieg_ca25.html" title="Ray Buttigieg">Ray Buttigieg</a> - Not on AMG, apparently non notable and essentially documented only on Wikipedia and its clones <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Ray+Buttigieg%22+influential+-wikipedia" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Ray+Buttigieg%22+influential+-wikipedia" rel="nofollow">(Google search)</a></li>

<li>True Colour Of Blood/True Colour of Blood - listed at AMG, but for one 2003 album only, without any overview, biography, album writeup, or even full categorization (they say "rock"). It looks like a mere automatic inclusion from a database. (Plus they spammed their URL in lieu of wikilink.) Doesn't seem notable/influential enough with respect to the other entries of the list <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:u0jb7i53g76r~T0" class="external text" title="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:u0jb7i53g76r~T0" rel="nofollow">(AMG entry)</a>.</li>

<p>Entry I'm putting back in -</p>
<p>Chillage People - solid water. I put a lot of the info in this section in on lamonte young, reich, tangerine dream, cage, satie and the like by the way, and I teach music at a university, focusing on electronic music and popular music, in case you are wondering who I am. Since when were amazon and AMG the most important sources out there? This group have been going for many years, before the likes of Lemon Jelly, Alpinestars, appeared. They cross the boundaires between chill out and ambient. They have performed at festivals like Boom in Portugal, and other events that have substantial ambient stages, they are unusual because they perform live. You can buy them on i-tunes, and amazon, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006FX67/qid=1148473042/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/203-6563386-1997504" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006FX67/qid=1148473042/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/203-6563386-1997504" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006FX67/qid=1148473042/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/203-6563386-1997504</a> and on most ambient web based shops <a href="http://www.ambientmusic.co.uk/ambient_planet.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ambientmusic.co.uk/ambient_planet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ambientmusic.co.uk/ambient_planet.html</a> but this is a Basilian record label distrinbuted by a French label. They have perfomred at many of the ambient music events in the Uk such as IDSpiral, the Mellout, Synergy Connective, Liquid. You won't find any of them on Amazon either. So I've put this in as a contemporary active band, rather than armchair home ambientists. We could also do with more contemporary ambient music, such as kumba mela project, sonic state, sons of arqa. Also there is little contemporary electro-acoustic music here either.</p>
<p>I'll leave it as a brief comment though</p>

<dd>It appears that 1 editor is attempting to not-very-subtly subvert the content of this article so that it conforms with his rather eccentric interpretation of what constitutes ambient music, by expunging anything that doesn't agree with his POV - including many important early pioneers in and influences on the genre.

<dd>I'd barely call Constance Demby an ambient artist, much less an <i>important</i> ambient artist. I think you're taking "new age music" and "ambient music" to be synonyms, which they most surely are not. I'm with 62.147.112.136 on deleting her from the list - the list should be important proto-ambient and ambient works, not a place to promote your favorite ambient artist. I also think the Richard Bone entry doesn't belong - he's actually a fairly minor ambient artist and I was able to trace the addition of the entry back to the maintainer of his website. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 18:21, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you Gene_poole for your support of Richard Bone's inclusion to the Ambient Artist list. I will definitely re-add his two most notable ambient recordings. I have only just now realized that P.W.‚Äôs insistence on removing Richard‚Äôs name was simply his POV, and not an attack on me personally for entering that data due to the fact that I run Richard‚Äôs website. Seems to me that the best content is going to come from contributors who have solid information to share. And since Richard‚Äôs latest album was chosen from over 2500 albums as one of five nominees for the Best Ambient Album of 2005 by the industry standard NAR, I have no doubt as to whether or not Richard is more than just ‚Äòa fairly minor ambient artist‚Äô.

<dd>I have no objection, at least, if he really is a notable ambient artist at this point.

I'm not going to argue the significance of Richard Bone in particular, however, I will reiterate that the quality of this article has really suffered from people who are adding the names of their favorite ambient artist to the list of notable ambient artists or to the text of the article, with no regard as to the historic or current importance of the artist in question. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 00:16, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Please note that a few drone sounds that can be heard in "A Saucerful of Secrets" and "More" by Pink Floyd have connections with Ambient music. Anyway, within next weeks I am going to contact WP administrators and a few University experts regarding all these Electronic and ambient music related articles that are here. I understand that for young people below 25, Ambient is one of the music genres that can be listened in nightclubs, but I can ensure that it is not semantically correct. Ambient is mainly Brian Eno, Cluster and their followers in the New Age stream. Slang and young people ideologies are not suitable for encyclopedias. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User_talk%7ESky-surfer_d76b.html" title="User talk:Sky-surfer">skysurfer</a> 17:28, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't say as I agree with your narrow definition of ambient music, and in particular, I take issue with your inclusion of "New Age" music as an important ambient genre. "New age" is kind of a meaningless term embracing all manner of music that is in some way connected with "new age" spirituality. It includes some artists who are clearly ambient-influenced, but also includes soft acoustic music (along the lines of various Windham Hill artists), "quiet storm" jazz, bombastic orchestrated pop (for example, Yanni), and contemporary "middle of the road" instrumentals. New Age, if it can be called a genre at all, is clearly a hybrid genre, not a subgenre of ambient music.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I take also take issue with restricting the term ambient to 1970s artists like Brian Eno. The genre has grown a great deal since then, and the growth of such subgenres as ambient industrial/dark ambient (about which I've contributed several articles), ambient techno, and organic ambient over the last 25 years has been very important. I agree that much of what was called "ambient techno" in the 1990s really strained the definition of "ambient", much of it being essentially dance music - nonetheless, there is a core of techno artists who have been actively producing music over the last 25 years that could genuinely be considered "ambient".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I take some issue with overstating the influence of Pink Floyd on later ambient music - just because an album includes "a few drone sounds" doesn't make it an important influence on ambient. The influence of Pink Floyd on later ambient music is there, but to list every early Pink Floyd album as if it was a vital influence on ambient is simply overstating the case. I really think minimalist composers (such as Steve Reich and Terry Riley) and the more electronically-oriented krautrock bands (such as Popul Vuh, Cluster, and Tangerine Dream) are far more important influences. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 18:02, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
I never stated that New Age music is a subgenre of Ambient Music, I only mean that many New Age musicians of course got inspired by Eno's works, both in style and techniques.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The list of Pink Foyd's album was longer before I edited that, it included Atom hearth mother, that really has no relevance with this article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Brian Eno is still alive and is releasing almost every year an Ambient album credited to himself or as a co-work with other artists. The following (real) musicians, to name a few, are appreciated in many countries and are actively contributing to ambient music (or have done so in last 2 decades), with several remarkable albums: Robert Fripp, David Sylvian, Steve Jansen &amp; Richard Barbieri, Andy Summers, Roger Eno, John Hassell, Holger Czukay, Russel Mills, Michael Brooks, Roedelius, Tangerine Dream.</p>
<p>Youngsters are free to use any slang they want, but should keep in mind that slang doesn't meet the formal standard requirements for an encyclopedia's article. The same applies to the words used by some radio stations and newsmagazines, it is just a temporary <a href="../../../f/a/d/Fad.html" title="Fad">fad</a>; as you noticed none use the words "<a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Wave_music_2b3e.html" title="New Wave music">New Wave</a>" today for Simple Minds, U2, New Order, though in the 80s it was an abused definition. "Ambience" is the most proper word for the works of those artists and deejays that began their careers in nightclubs contexts and/or related audience; they regard themselves as Ambience very often. This article need to be split in two articles, one for real ambient and most relevant subgenres, the other for clubs-oriented artists and deejays. The same should apply to the <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_music.html" title="Electronic music">Electronic music</a> article. Though you contribute with some articles regarding ambient derivative forms, it doesn't give you the right to state whatever you want on well recognized artists or pretend to ignore them, otherwise I have to realize that your real purposes go beyond music.<a href="../../../s/k/y/User_talk%7ESky-surfer_d76b.html" title="User talk:Sky-surfer">skysurfer</a> 13:58, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Quite simply, your narrow definition of "real ambient" vs "ambient techno" is POV. If you want to place some wording in along the lines that some people don't consider ambient techno or ambient with beats to be real ambient music, be my guest - I know based on my reading of forums like the Ambient list that there are others that share that view, but also that there are others that consider ambient techno to be a proper form of ambient music. (The term "ambience music" (as opposed to "ambient music") is one that I've never heard before, and searching for it on Google, I can't find others who are using the term the way you're using it. Can you provide a reference to anybody else who is using the term?) Eno, of course, continues to record, but why that should imply that only artists who are doing music close to his should be treated as "ambient" is beyond me. Splitting up the article or deleting artists based solely on your own POV is simply not called for.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure what your point is about new age music - "Ambient is mainly Brian Eno, Cluster and their followers in the New Age stream" - that seems to imply that present-day new age artists should be considered the mainstream of ambient music, and I would strongly contest that point for reasons given above. The present wording in the article about the relationship between ambient music and new age is adequate, and I see now reason to change it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for your point about "it doesn't give you the right to state whatever you want on well recognized artists or pretend to ignore them" - just how am I doing that? If you look at most of my edits to the article, they've mostly been concerned with the logic, readability, and coherence of this article, which as it stands is in pretty bad shape. The article as its been put together so far has just been a dumping ground for people to plug their favorite artist or album. I have simply paired down the list of "Notable artists" to the more artists that are actually notable within this genre. I've also taken out unnecessary and cumbersome citing of albums in the text of the article. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 15:52, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not personally harrassing you, but all the users that previously edited this article. Techno was born around 1986-88, not more than 20 years ago; FSOL worked on a track with/for David Sylvian &amp; Robert Fripp (Darshana) in 1988 and it's one of first ambient + drumming great song. I am wondering if you all were already born at that time.</p>
<p>I am into electronics, music and electronic music since 1977. I have some college studies in Maths and Physics, and am interested also in Ecology, Medicine, Philosophy, Epistemology and Linguistics.</p>
<p>I agree with you, "The article [..] been put together so far has just been a dumping ground for people to plug their favorite artist or album". But I can't understand why you say that "I really think [...] the more electronically-oriented krautrock bands (such as Popul Vuh, Cluster, and Tangerine Dream) are far more important influences", please note that these artists are alive, are still playing and recording albums and have crowds of listeners worlwide regardless their age. You quote them only as "influential", giving for granted that no longer are in the game. Techno-derivative forms of ambient, or ambience, are very far from this achievement, these artists are mainly listened in UK and USA only by youngsters aged below 30.</p>
<p>Well, its not difficult to reach some NPOV on this matter: let's contact a music university department. If you still are a university student, that should not be difficult for you.</p>
<p>The article is not really bad, but it needs heavy re-editing and a more balanced approach, because most of Ambient music fans (the same applies to Electronic music in general) are proud listeners of the artists that I am mentioning above.<a href="../../../s/k/y/User_talk%7ESky-surfer_d76b.html" title="User talk:Sky-surfer">skysurfer</a> 17:36, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, I've been listening to Brian Eno since the late 1970s as well. I'm quite aware that ambient techno (and ambient industrial) came later than "original" ambient. I simply strongly disagree with your purist definition of ambient music - to say that ambient music is entirely restricted to artists who are working in more or less the same area as Brian Eno and that incorporation of industrial or techno influences entirely disqualifies an artist from being considered "ambient" is quite narrow and definitely POV. I doubt Brian Eno himself would subscribe to this point of view, actually. As for citing Steve Reich and Terry Riley as "influential" - what exactly is wrong with that? They don't call <i>themselves</i> ambient musicians, so I'm not going to force that label on them. (For my part, I consider <i>Music for 18 Musicians</i> to be one of my favorite ambient compositions).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your argument is a bit like saying that the term "<a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_music.html" title="Rock music">rock music</a>" should be restricted to the style that was performed by rock and roll bands from before 1963, and that all styles of rock that came after the early 1960s simply shouldn't be called "rock". That would be regarded by most people as a very narrow and purist definition of rock music.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I've looked at your link to the "Ambience for the Masses" site, and I don't see them using the term "ambience" as a term in any way different from "ambient music" in general.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm unclear about your point, "most of Ambient music fans (the same applies to Electronic music in general) are proud listeners of the artists that I am mentioning above." Exactly which artist are you talking about? And aren't artists like Brian Eno already prominently mentioned in the article? What imbalance are you talking about? If I see any imbalance, its that the article is too heavily weighted towards proto-ambient artists who came before Brian Eno, and not enough from the 1970s and later, when the term "ambient music" was actually in use.</dd>

<dd>I am a graduate student at SFSU, but I don't see the point of contacting a university music department.

In the article too much space is taken by the section "derivative forms...", while recent works by Robert Fripp, David Sylvian, Steve Jansen &amp; Richard Barbieri, Andy Summers, Roger Eno, John Hassell, Holger Czukay, Russel Mills, Michael Brooks, Roedelius, Klaus Schulze, Tangerine Dream, are not mentioned enough; of course no mention for "minor" artists such as <a href="../../../w/%C3%BC/r/W%C3%BCrzel.html" title="W√ºrzel">W√ºrzel</a>.</p>
<p>Please, are you watching the articles <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_electronic_music_genres.html" title="List of electronic music genres">list of electronic music genres</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_Music_3e17.html" title="Electronic Music">Electronic Music</a>?. They are worst than <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambient_music.html" title="Ambient music">Ambient music</a>. I am sure you will agree on that. I am not saying that the derivative forms of Ambient must not mentioned at all, I just think that they deserve less space in this general context and more space in a suitable article. They should be regarded as part of the Techno scene, and also as a fusion, a crossover, between the real Ambient and the Techno, but the context is merely Techno. With regard to names, for example, none states that symphonic rock is classical music or that it is a derivative form of classic music, and none states that it is rock (or rock 'n roll); it is exactly symphonic rock, a subgenre of progressive rock with a strong classic music influence. I hope we can collaborate to make this dozen of articles more consistent. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User_talk%7ESky-surfer_d76b.html" title="User talk:Sky-surfer">skysurfer</a> 20:05, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

Beyond NPOV, I am seeking the "scientific truth" about Electronic Music and Ambient Music. I hope it is of interest for Wikipedia's administrators and users, otherwise I'll say "byebye, nice to meet you mates, it's been a pleasure to co-work with you, see you later", and I'll no longer release any contribute.

<p>In the case of the David Lynch films, "Eraserhead" and "The Elephant Man", I certainly see the relationship between the sound design of David Lynch and Alan Splet to later <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambient_industrial.html" title="Ambient industrial">ambient noise</a> music. I can also see why Eraserhead, in particular, could be seen as an "ambient film".

<p>I'm adding <a href="../../../m/u/z/Muzak.html" title="Muzak">Muzak</a> as an influence to this genre as it is the first widespread form of ambient music. This article refers to it from the liner notes of <i><a href="../../../m/u/s/Music_for_Airports_e13e.html" title="Music for Airports">Ambient 1: Music for Airports</a></i> by <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Eno_1f55.html" title="Brian Eno">Brian Eno</a>, but I believe it is a bit misleading as the liner notes state Muzak both as a strong influence as well the reason why many composers have dismissed environmental music as a worthy artform. It should be noted that Muzak is possibly the most recognisable form of ambient music, and while I firmly believe it is a separate genre, I think it deserves a bit more of a mention here than it gets.</p>
<p>I'd also like to add a small blurb on <i>why</i> the films that have been included in this list are here. I'm going to add it just above the table so people aren't just given a list of movies all of a sudden. At present it's a little confusing. Basically what I'm going to say is that they all feature ambient music in their soundtracks and integrate it into the filmscape in order to enhance the movie experience. Since I didn't add most of them, and haven't seen quite a few, I'd appreciate it if folks who know more about them could add more detail. If nobody steps up I'll rent them and do my best.</p>
<p>Other than that I'd just like to make some minor grammatical edits here and there and try to clean up the overview so it reads more clearly. I'm going to try not to alter any of the information, so this shouldn't be much of a problem. Speaksoft 16:00, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Pink Floyd are one of my favourite bands, I'm listening to them since late 1970s. Their instrumental 'Quicksilver'- album 'More', is very similar to Eno's ambient, though none mention that; actually, the theme of that track is more relevant to psychedelic culture in that context. I guess that the 'context' is still important in music; the meta-content or meta-musical-content, the poetry, the style, the techniques are very important, too. The track "Main Theme" in the same album sounds to me like a sort of prelude of "Oxygen" by J. M. Jarre. These are just my opinions, and if many other people will share that, we can get a NPOV. Some tracks in J. M. Jarre's albums are truly ambient; please don't forget that Ambient tracks are minimalistic, in other words, no melodic parts or aggressive drummings (such music, depending on tunes, harmonies, rythms, context and so on, would be regarded as prog rock or jazz fusion). I guess that a good idea is a new article: List of ambient tracks in non-ambient albums. What do you think? Brian Wilson 15:39, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I want to explain better my starements and removals of inconsistent information: most of modern dance music is produced, written, played with the purpose of make us enjoy clubs and even daily life.</p>
<p>Electronic music, since its beginning was "Electronic" not only becouse of its means, but MAINLY becouse of its content and context. 'The medium is the message' (Im quoting whom? I dont remember now). It was a sort of revolution against academic approach, first; eventually, electronic music become a bit more popular, but those musicians never forgot that their music was a sort of experimentalism. Now, modern synths make us available a large number of editing possibilities, but does that mean that we all are experimenting? It depends on the musician's will and statements.Brian Wilson 12:01, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I suggest merging both the current definition as well as the one you just suggested in that way: <i><b>Ambient music</b> is a loosely defined minimalist <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_genre.html" title="Musical genre">musical genre</a> that may incorporate elements of a number of different styles - including <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electronic_art_music.html" title="Electronic art music">electronic art music</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musique_concr%C3%A8te.html" title="Musique concr√®te">concrete music</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock.html" title="Rock">rock</a>, modern <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_classical_music.html" title="European classical music">classical music</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/g/Reggae.html" title="Reggae">reggae</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditional_music.html" title="Traditional music">traditional</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_music.html" title="World music">world</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/i/Noise_music.html" title="Noise music">noise</a>.</i> I suggest this because while ambient music is very often minimalist it's not always experimental. Also, the current definition seems to say that ambient music draws element from every musical style listed in the opening paragraph, so I'd find it better to reword it so that it says it <b>may</b> incorporate elements from all these genres, like in the opening paragraph you proposed.

<dd>Ambient music is neither exclusiuvely minimalist nor "experimental". Whoever came up with that nonsense clearly has no idea what they're talking about .

<dd>This article should be deleted. It doesn't cite sources. The term <i>ambient music</i> means literally <i>background music</i>. I can't see any relation between the Eno era <b>(twentyfive years ago!!!!!!)</b> and the actual current ambient scene.

<dd>I reverted it again for now&#160;;-) Reason:</dd>
<dd>Many of his edist are easy to revert; some anonymous IP has done so last week or so. So that's no problem.</dd>
<dd>There has already been a few reverts in this article. However , one problem: after Wilson's arrival, some other people have made large contributions and rearrangement to this article I believe, in good faith. I'm not really sure, but I thought the version I reverted to now contained some of those improvements; there are actual many references to modern styles that surely can't be Wilson's work&#160;:-) I believe there may still be too many wilson-stuff in this article , although I'm not sure, but I believe there's some work by other users we can't throw away like that. Note, I'm still nto really sure, we should really check the history very well, but I hope there's something that makes sense here and some contributions of other that are kept now, ...&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimoWreck_58ea.html" title="User:LimoWreck">LimoWreck</a> 19:25, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You should remove any reference to 1970s German Electronic music, to New age and to those artists that B. Wilson put here, such as Sylvian, Fripp, Summers, Hassell, Budd (who the hell are these guys, none is familiar with these names nowadays). Dating from early 1990s, the word <i>Ambient</i> is no longer used in the same context it was used before, therefore these different styles don't share any common <i>background</i>, but that Wilson simply wasn't able to understand this simple fact. Also, feel free to remove any contribution I put here, becouse, who knows, I could be just an alias of Mr Wilson's.--<a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESky-surfer_2e7b.html" title="User:Sky-surfer">skysurfer</a> 21:53, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've re-reverted to the last version which seems to have any coherence to it. Looking at the version I reverted, the intro paragraph didn't actually define the genre, completely ignored its historical origins and rambled on about a whole pile of relatively recent artists and labels for no apparent reason. The remainder of the article was also completely silent on the historical development of the genre, and gave the impression that ambient music sprung into life fully-formed in the 1990s, which is just plain wrong. --<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Poole_836b.html" title="User:Gene Poole">Gene_poole</a> 11:50, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, the problem with that wilson guy was he tried to remove almost all "modern" music, he didn't seem to grasp the concept that musical genres evolve, and the meaning of a genre didn't evolve through the years... In the version before he arrived however it did seem like the music indeed sprung into life out of nothing... I believe Gene Pools edits have been quite balanced on gave justice to the historical backgrounds as well as the modern meaning of the genres, so I trust he's doing a good job here&#160;;-) --<a href="../../../l/i/m/User%7ELimoWreck_58ea.html" title="User:LimoWreck">LimoWreck</a> 20:09, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm probably going to remove, or at least modify, these two sentences:</p>
<p>"However, ambient music is noted for taking a less formulaic approach in its use in film and TV shows."</p>
<p>Statement is <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> and uses <a href="../../../a/w/w/WP%7EAWW_3219.html" title="WP:AWW">weasel words</a>. "Less formulaic" in who's opinion? "Noted" by whom exactly?</p>
<p>"David Lynch's 1984 film Dune, for example, forgoes the epic sci-fi adventure style theme music popularized by Star Wars in favor of a more effective and atmospheric music score by Toto and Brian Eno."</p>
<p>Same problem as the previous sentence, plus, it really strains the definition of ambient music. Certainly, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Eno_1f55.html" title="Brian Eno">Brian Eno</a>'s (brief) contribution to the <i><a href="../../../d/u/n/Dune_%28movie_soundtrack%29.html" title="Dune (movie soundtrack)">Dune</a></i> score is an ambient piece, but the pseudo-Wagnerian contributions from <a href="../../../t/o/t/Toto_%28band%29.html" title="Toto (band)">Toto</a>? I'd say that's much closer to traditional film music than to ambient music. This is not a good example. Better examples might be Brian Eno's scores for <i><a href="../../../s/e/b/Sebastiane.html" title="Sebastiane">Sebastiane</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../f/o/r/For_All_Mankind_42b4.html" title="For All Mankind">For All Mankind</a></i>, or <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Andrews_1bae.html" title="Michael Andrews">Michael Andrews</a> scores for <i><a href="../../../d/o/n/Donnie_Darko_1f86.html" title="Donnie Darko">Donnie Darko</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../m/e/_/Me_and_You_and_Everyone_We_Know_1975.html" title="Me and You and Everyone We Know">Me and You and Everyone We Know</a></i>.</p>
<p>Is there any published work or anything on the web on the topic of ambient film scores? It would help to have a source to draw from so that we're not just doing a bunch of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> here.</p>
<p>Also, I posted about this months ago, but what about the list of "Notable filmmakers"? Exactly what this is doing in the article is never explained. There needs to be something in the text of the article discussing this topic and its relevance to the larger topic of ambient music and referring to the list.

<dd>I agree the notable film-makers section seems a rather strange inclusion.

<dd>Come on, Gene ‚Äì would you honestly call most of the music used in the Dune score "ambient"? I'm not talking about talking about bits and pieces of the musical score (or some of the innovative uses of ambient sound by sound designer <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Splet_1dcb.html" title="Alan Splet">Alan Splet</a>), but the majority of the score. If you're calling that ambient music, I think we're working from some very different definitions of "ambient music". I don't think most of that score can be called ambient (its closer to traditional film music, really), hence its really not a good example to give. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 18:11, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've reworked the table, changed a number of the entries, and retitled it "Notable films incorporating ambient music or sound design". It now makes a bit more sense as to why its in this article. I don't know how to reformat a table to make individual columns wider, even though the table kind of needs that. I will add a text section on "Ambient music in film" once I can settle this difference I have with Gene about whether the <i>Dune</i> score really is the best example one can give of use of ambient music in film. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 19:29, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've just taken a look at the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_music.html" title="Space music">Space music</a> article, and the definitions given there are highly irregular, and certainly not in accordance with generally accepted definitions of what ambient music is and is not.

<dd>There is no commonly accepted definition of ambient music here. Saying that something is loosely defined is not a definition (it's tautologic-ally true). Furthermore, it seems that rave subculture's language believes to be the official English here. Anyway, I wish you a good work. I am sorry, but I am too busy in my life now, and I can't really contribute such articles. I wish that my contribs here in talk pages may be of some interests and use by other wikipedians.

<dd>I couldn't disagree more with the assertion that "<i>space music</i> and classic (ie non-techno/rave) <i>ambient</i> can be seen as being one and the same. Any differences are merely cosmetic." "Space music" is a subset of ambient music (and some space music, for example Constance Demby's work, is often decidedly non-ambient.

<dd>I can't argue with that. Not that I said they were "absolute synonyms" - I said they were "synonyms". I meant that, as you said, in the sense that they are related; that <i>Space</i> is a subset of <i>Ambient</i> (and therefore not antonymous). We can pick out pieces/albums from the artists concerned and poke holes in the ambient/spaceworthiness of the music till the cows come home - cosmetic differences mostly.

<dd>I have come here making questions. I am not the pretentious guy here. I'm not the one that claims to be the only one that has the right to write the first lines of this article. Anyone can see that. If Ambient=Space, then I am right at saying that Ambient Techno has nothing to do with classic Ambient. My only purpose here is to contribute to artists' biographies and discographies. When I have to describe the kind of music of a given work, I have to use common terms, such as music genres, and I have sadly realized that almost all articles related to popular music genres are very badly written. I have no other aims or "agenda" here.

<p>Hello, thank you for re-editing my sentences, I am aware that my English is not perfect. Please note that a few drone sounds that can be heard in "A Saucerful of Secrets" and "More" by Pink Floyd have connections with Ambient music. Anyway, within next weeks I am going to contact WP administrators and a few University experts regarding all these Electronic and ambient music related articles that are here. I understand that for young people below 25, Ambient is one of the music genres that can be listened in nightclubs, but I can ensure that it is not semantically correct. Ambient is mainly Brian Eno, Cluster and their followers in the New Age stream. Slang and young people ideologies are not suitable for encyclopedias. <a href="../../../s/k/y/User_talk%7ESky-surfer_d76b.html" title="User talk:Sky-surfer">skysurfer</a> 17:28, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I can't say as I agree with your narrow definition of ambient music, and in particular, I take issue with your inclusion of "New Age" music as an important ambient genre. "New age" is kind of a meaningless term embracing all manner of music that is in some way connected with "new age" spirituality. It includes some artists who are clearly ambient-influenced, but also includes soft acoustic music (along the lines of various Windham Hill artists), "quiet storm" jazz, bombastic orchestrated pop (for example, Yanni), and contemporary "middle of the road" instrumentals. New Age, if it can be called a genre at all, is clearly a hybrid genre, not a subgenre of ambient music.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I take also take issue with restricting the term ambient to 1970s artists like Brian Eno. The genre has grown a great deal since then, and the growth of such subgenres as ambient industrial/dark ambient (about which I've contributed several articles), ambient techno, and organic ambient over the last 25 years has been very important. I agree that much of what was called "ambient techno" in the 1990s really strained the definition of "ambient", much of it being essentially dance music - nonetheless, there is a core of techno artists who have been actively producing music over the last 25 years that could genuinely be considered "ambient".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, I take some issue with overstating the influence of Pink Floyd on later ambient music - just because an album includes "a few drone sounds" doesn't make it an important influence on ambient. The influence of Pink Floyd on later ambient music is there, but to list every early Pink Floyd album as if it was a vital influence on ambient is simply overstating the case. I really think minimalist composers (such as Steve Reich and Terry Riley) and the more electronically-oriented krautrock bands (such as Popul Vuh, Cluster, and Tangerine Dream) are far more important influences. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 18:02, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with almost all of your comments here, but I question the use of the word "meaningless" to define <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Age_music_5561.html" title="New Age music">New Age music</a>, and I don't agree that all New Age music is conneted with "New Age spirituality," especially since many New Age artists go out of their way to separate themselves from that idea.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't mean to go off topic from Ambient, I just wanted to mention that point because we are discussing this same idea (including references to Ambient) on <a href="../../../n/e/w/Talk%7ENew_Age_music_f7ae.html" title="Talk:New Age music">Talk: New Age music</a> as that article is in the process of a major rewrite. Regarding the connection of New Age music with Ambient, I do agree with you that New Age music is a sort of hybrid genre, not quite a genre in itself since it overlaps so many other genres, and a significant are of those overlaps is with some Ambient music. Some New Age music is Ambient, and some Ambient music is New Age, neither is a sub-genre of the other.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It seems that both Ambient and New Age began to evolve around the same time - late 60's, early 70's - though New Age music was not named as a genre until later. There is no doubt that Enos' work made a big impact on some early New Age music pioneers and that his ideas and methods became integrated into some forms of New Age music.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is also discussion about these relationships happening on <a href="../../../s/p/a/Talk%7ESpace_music_e1a1.html" title="Talk:Space music">Talk:Space music</a> - that genre also seems to be a hybrid or umbrella and to include some of the Amibent music that also overlaps New Age music.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>One more point about what differentiates Ambient from both New Age and Space music. Those other two genres each have a function of creating certain feelings. Spacemusic supposedly creates the feeling of spaciousness or moving through space (internal or external). New Age music creates feelings of comfort and positiveness (some say "spiritual," but I'd say that's a subset). Ambient on the other hand covers a wider spectrum of feelings. While some Ambient music is spacious or comfortable, Ambient can also be dark, strange, challenging, even spooky, or it can be somewhat neutral and environmental like the early Eno works. And of course later, Ambient expanded or branched off to include music that in some ways is not so Ambient yet still keeps some of it's characteristics - for example Ambient Dub has beats and some vocals so it's not obvious that it's Ambient - but then again, it works just fine as an ambient background that can be tuned in or out at will (as it does not have linear songs and melodies intruding into one's awareness) so it can be seen as part of the Ambient lineage while not being purely Ambient. These points can also apply to the many other descendents of Ambient as you mentioned.</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I started to reply with a short comment and then rambled a bit, but I think these are useful thoughts. It's interesting that so many articles about these related but different genres are wrestling with these ideas of how the genres interconnect... <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParzival418_18da.html" title="User:Parzival418">Parzival418</a> 21:39, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems that rave subculture's slang is ending up to become the dominant language in Wikipedia. New Age/ambient/space sounds had a remarkable influence on early 1990s' (mostly British) techno musicians/producers/djs, which self addressed themselves as belonging to the <i>"ambient movement (or scene)"</i> (I have a reference on this). Many songs were just beatless ambience/space electronic (pop) music, most were techno, jungle (d n b) or dub with ambience moods and atmospheres. All this does not mean that Ambient music is a metagenre of the Ambient/Techno scene, or that such music scene is a music subgenre of the so called Ambient music--<a href="../../../d/o/k/User%7EDoktor_Who_a947.html" title="User:Doktor Who">Dr. Who</a> 00:21, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I like this way of looking at it. The relationships between music genres is complicated - it's not linear, it's not like a family tree with parents and kids, siblings, cousins, etc.. There are more dimensions in music. I'd say it's more like set theory or topology, which is why so many widely differing forms and feelings can all somehow be connected.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For example, what is in common between this wide-ranging list of genres? Ambient, New Age, Space music, Techno, Industrial, Trance, Goa, Jungle, Ambient Dub... &#160;? Some elements of those genres could not be more different. But I think I can find something in common - they all create a feeling or sensation of some kind of trance or altered state experience. (I'm not referring to drug use. There is that too with some fans, but the drugs are not required to create the sensation if a person is willing to go along with the hypnotic elements of the music).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not saying at all that Industrial is a form of New Age music (now, there's a thought!), but isn't it interesting that they can somehow have something in common that is not shared for example by Pop music and Industrial, or Hip Hop and Ambient?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here's another example: New Age music and Gothic music have in common that while one specializes in "light" and the other in "dark", they both like to approach "beauty" in some way. Then Gothic with it's darkness can connect with the darkness of Industrial, yet they do not seem to share their way of appreciating "beauty", though they both could be considered "fun" by their fans.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even long ago it was not simple, and now it's more complex. Take for example - American Folk Music. That's a big subejct. Much of that music descends from English, Scottish and Irish folk music, but of course in America influences come from everywhere so there is all sorts of other stuff too. If you forget about the words though and listen to bluegrass, then listen to East Europe gypsy music, or Irish Jigs, they all have in common certain characteristics that show clear descendence and trace the historical movement of the peoples.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But now, with instant worldwide connection, we've moved beyond the family model for relating genres.<a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParzival418_18da.html" title="User:Parzival418">Parzival418</a> 22:10, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Gene, why are you adding this comment here? What action have I taken that would lead you to believe I might be a sock puppet? I am new to editing Wikipedia - only for around two weeks so far. Please look at my contributions list and I'm sure you will see that I have been writing sincerely and carefully. In this particular situation, I happened to agree with the previous editor I was replying to in that particular comment. That doesn't imply I am a sockpuppet. Isn't the point of Wikipediea to edit by consensus? If we can't have consensus because someone who agrees is immediately accused of being a sockpuppet, how can any progress happen?</dd>

<p>It seems to me we need a new vocabulary for discussing musical genres. We need a multidimensional model. <a href="../../../d/o/k/User%7EDoktor_Who_a947.html" title="User:Doktor Who">Dr. Who</a> used the word "metagenres" - that's a cool idea - I've never seen that word before. I've used the term umbrella genres, but I like meta-genre better.</p>
<p>Even beyond that though, we need more dimensions as I mentioned in my prior comment above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The relationships between music genres is complicated - it's not linear, it's not like a family tree with parents and kids, siblings, cousins, etc.. There are more dimensions in music. I'd say it's more like set theory or topology, which is why so many widely differing forms and feelings can all somehow be connected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we think of each musical genre as a mathematical set, we could make descriptions that show inclusion and exclusion, or intersections and unions.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ambient ‚â† Space music</li>
<li>Ambient ‚â† New Age</li>
<li>Space music ‚â† New Age</li>
</ul>
<p>However...</p>
<ul>
<li>Some Ambient is Space music</li>
<li>Some Ambient is New Age</li>
<li>Some New Age is Ambient</li>
<li>Some Space Music is New Age</li>
</ul>
<p>etc...</p>
<p>I haven't this thought through yet, it's just a forming idea. Maybe this should be moved to... <a href="../../../m/u/s/Talk%7EMusic_genre_bd19.html" title="Talk:Music genre">Talk:Music genre</a></p>

<p>to this:</p>
<blockquote>

Space music focuses on, as the name would suggest, space, but also delves into psychological and spiritual themes as well.<a href="http://www.fiu.edu/~mizrachs/ambient-music.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fiu.edu/~mizrachs/ambient-music.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gene immediately reverted my edit with the comment that it was an "unreferenced opinion". I restored the changed text tonight for good reasons as I will discuss here. Then, while I was writing this explanation, Gene reverted my edit again. So now, I am going to restore my new edit, but this time I will add an additional reference, and I will support my edit with discussion here.</p>
<p>Gene - I ask that if you revert my edit again, please discuss your action on this page and provide references for your viewpoint. If you use "unreferenced" as a reason for changing my edits, then surely, you must have references to support your changes. Please provide us with your references.</p>
<p>The modified version is not any more or less "unreferenced" than the prior version, but now since you asked for references, I added a new one. Gene, while you may believe space music is a sub-genre of ambient, after reading your extensive comments about this on the various talk pages, I am not convinced that your approach is NPOV. Probably there is more than one valid POV on this subject, in which case we should explorre them all in the main article. But I don't see how we can completely limit space music to being a subset of ambient, or a synonym for ambient, when there are published examples of more than one person showing music that is space music but is not ambient.</p>
<p>For one thing, the citation that was already in the version you reverted to and that you retained actually contains several comments that opose your position. I am referring to this page: <a href="http://www.fiu.edu/~mizrachs/ambient-music.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fiu.edu/~mizrachs/ambient-music.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. There we find these interesting comments that directly support my edit while directly opposing your position:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we are now seeing an overlapping of definitions as well. some space music can be called ambient. some droning guitar rock can be called ambient. some trance techno can be called ambient. where, then, can one draw some boundaries in an attempt to describe the state of ambient music as it exists today?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>these forerunners of the ambient house movement were more or less accepted by the average stadium rock fan; it was not unusual to hear a Tangerine Dream instrumental space opus sandwiched between tracks by Yes, Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer, or Genesis on prog rock radio of yesteryear. Tangerine Dream is by far the most famous of the electronic rockers. From 1973 to around 1986 they created textural soundscapes with the most advanced synthesizers and effects of the day, much of it customized for their rich timbral explorations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Space Music</b> This sub-genre of electronic rock doesn't see that much action, but fans of space music usually can't get enough of it. Space music is hard to describe. It tends to be repetitive and lengthy, built in gradually multiplying layers, very electronic yet not entirely 'thick' or inorganic. Once you hear a few examples, you'll figure it out. Klaus Schulze, who was briefly in Tangerine Dream before they were using synthesizers, is the most famous space musician.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be sure, that particular reference is not the be-all authority on this. But it is a valid source and it is one that you chose to retain, even while you reverted my edit.</p>
<p>Here is another valid source, which I have added to the article: <a href="http://www.echoes.org/TimeWarped.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.echoes.org/TimeWarped.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. I know you don't respect Stephen Hill, but a large audience does, and he is part of history even if you disagree with him. His program is even listed in the articlle in the following paragraph. So if those statements are valid, his comments here also desrved to be cited:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pink Floyd launched the first space probe in 1967 with "Interstellar Overdrive," an acid-drenched freakout framed by power-chord booster rockets. They inspired a legion of musicians to go beyond rock's four on the floor, verse-chorus-verse-guitar-solo-verse-chorus-goodbye structure. Among the first, and arguably the best to bring that psychedelic ethos into the electronic age was Tangerine Dream. While their 1970 debut, Electronic Meditation, sounded like Karlheinz Stockhausen meeting the Grateful Dead, their later albums essayed the sound that would be the template of space music.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are going to revert my edit again by saying it is unreferenced, please provide references supporting your POV that space music is a sub-genre of ambient (or is identical to it).</p>
