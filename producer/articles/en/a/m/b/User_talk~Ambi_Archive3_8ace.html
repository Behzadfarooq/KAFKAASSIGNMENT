<dd>Again you misstate the facts. I did not 'call" you a bigot, rather I asked you point blank if you are one and you still have not answered. So perhaps I should ask again. Are you?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Further, you did not ask for any apology and you certainly have the ability to speak up if offended. That 3d party was butting in where he should be nosing out - it was not his place to direct me to "apolgize" to yooooou, especially since you did not tell me you were seeking one. Also, based on the distinction between asking a question and making a statement, I still am not peruaded that any aplogy was due you, regardless. Additionally, comments of your nature should be hashed out on our individual pages, not BLASTED across the top of a heavily read discussion page. The placement and tone of you stament, alongg with it's mis-characterization of what my words wre, combine to make it aan ad hominem attack. You should delete that section entirely, it makes you look infantile and abusive of your role!<a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex071404_f742.html" title="User:Rex071404">Rex071404</a> 07:41, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Greetings, Beck. I noticed your ongoing interest in the ODP article, and I respectfully take exception to your implied accusation that I would be the aggresive party in any revert war over that may come to pass over that article. It should be clear to you by now that I am willing to defer to the opinion of a disinterested third party when it comes to the content of any Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>No apology requested or required. All I ask is that you think for yourself and act according to your own conscience. // <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetesq_c7fc.html" title="User:Netesq">NetEsq</a> 09:51, 28 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>In one of our discussions about arbitration as a possible solution, you said, "We could ask for a temporary injunction, which is provided for under the arbitration policy, but to my knowledge, hasn't been acted upon yet." I just took a very quick cruise through <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_policy_10cb.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration policy">Wikipedia:Arbitration policy</a> and I couldn't find authorization for such a step. I'm going to suggest it to the Committee, but if you can provide backup to embolden them in believing that they do indeed have the power, that would be great. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 04:04, 30 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Kerry is however, I am persuaded, an obfuscating waffler who dissembles and changes his story over time to suit the current state of his career. I have followed his career close up for many years (I am in Massachusetts) and I am NOT a Republican. Rather, I am an Independant (in the parlance of MA, it's called "unenrolled", ie; no party affiliation - simply am registered to vote). The pro-Kerry people only THINK I am biased against him due to politics. I am not biased and not due to politics. Rather, it's Kerry's hideous waffling and dissembling over the years that concerns me and the few points in his BIO which I have focused on, if presnted factually, allow anyone who cares to look with an open mind the oppotunity to see that as well. It's regretable you don't see that... <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex071404_f742.html" title="User:Rex071404">Rex071404</a> 20:36, 30 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The heading is in jest, but the request is serious. This is a general question to those endorsing Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Guanaco2. Is anyone prepared to actually <b>certify</b> the complaint along with RickK? If not, RfC policy would call for the page to be deleted soon. If I delete the listing for RickK (which seems likely at this point), I would like to either delete Guanaco's as well, or have a clear basis under existing policy for deleting one and not the other. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 20:10, 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I played the original Exile for Macintosh. My brother and I were both playing it obsessively for a while; he finished the game, but I went back to school and never got back to it. The world is one of the best-conceived I've ever encountered, and the dialogue was great. Playing it was like wandering through a good novel.</p>
<p>The game even had a sense of humor. My favorite bit was probably the well where you could throw a coin in, and it would tell you "Nothing happened this time." I'm imagining Jeff having a great laugh at all the people he just knows are throwing coin after coin and wondering when something will happen.</p>

<p>Is it bad wikiquette to post this here? I see we have some common interests, particularly, Law, activism, public transportation and unrecognized nations. Have you heard of <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sealand.html" title="Sealand">Sealand</a>? Do you know anything about the Sovereign united States - as opposed to the more well-known 'United States of America'? (example: California Republic as opposed to the State of California?)</p>
<p>aside from the above, my main interestis are stopping the deforestation of the last remaining Coast Redwoods <i>sequoia sempervirens</i>, which are being loggedout at an increasingly rapid pace... and corporate environmental pollution.

<p>the term refers to the 'shadow' state, in the case of california republic - pardon my 'no caps' my keyboard is dying- california was a state (nation) before it federated with the other states, which were already 'the united states '...</p>
<p>california had a constitution, enacted by a properly convened and convoked representative assembly.</p>
<p>after joining the union, a constitution was once again enacted,substantially the same except for several 'small' but crucial differences notably the previous constitution was never repealed, disenacted etc.</p>
<p>but the present state , the state of california behaves as if the second constitution holds sway.</p>
<p>state of california is a corporate identity, under corporate law and admiralty law - theirs is the great seal of the state of california</p>
<p>california republic is a political entity, under common Law - theirs is the bear flag which says california republic</p>
<p>the state uses the same flag, but typically displayed as a flag with a gold fringe, symbolising a military entity.</p>
<p>this is poorly known doctrine, but which has been upheld by court decisions.</p>
<p>very short thumbnail sketch of the situation.</p>
<p>Most of the fifty states have a similar thing going.</p>
<p>the united states itself has an even more complex issue, but which similarly plays the original constitution against later amended forms.</p>
<p>I'll show you the article when I get enough together to be coherent, (you might review it before I post it?) you would probably be interested.</p>
<p>yes, sealand is a unique case I agree, but apparently a valid claimant IMO, though a trivial case, and nations are understandably leery of recognising them explicitly, but in the case of the UK, the doctrine of <i>estoppel by acquiescence</i> might prevail, by both not explicitly reserving the right to rule sealand, and by not exercising the right... as "there can be no actual sovereignty without both de facto and dejure sovereignty" is one of the 'checkpoints' of sovereign status.</p>
<p>please delete this when you are through reading, I don't particularly want such an unthorough exposition of these facts around with my name on it.</p>

<p>I don't think you're helping your cause very much by trying to attack Adam's employer, Herschelkrustofsky. Doing so by quoting the files of the CEC is just playing into Adam's hands - and I don't think it'll win you much sympathy from passers-by. Why not take the moral high ground? <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 03:22, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure what you're getting at here. I think that Adam may be essentially a cat's paw for Danby, who has a much longer and more egregious history of slandering LaRouche than does Adam. I have met representatives of the CEC, and I was struck with admiration for them -- a bunch of unusually spunky, altruistic and jolly souls. And I'm not looking for sympathy, though I am looking for the moral high ground, which I have come to believe can be attained by telling the truth as fearlessly as possible. But I will be happy to discuss this further. --<a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerschelkrustofsky_0973.html" title="User:Herschelkrustofsky">Herschelkrustofsky</a> 20:55, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BTW, Ambi -- why do you say I was "quoting the files of the CEC"? I quoted their website, which I linked to my post.

<p>Please take note, yesterday, I posted my version of the facts on this issue as per the page's instructions: "If you disagree with some evidence you see here, please provide counter-evidence, or an explanation of why the evidence is misleading. Please do this under a seperate header, to seperate your response from the original evidence."</p>
<p>However, tonight, <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">Neutrality</a> has twice deleted my statement from that page and instead moved it to the "discussion" page.</p>
<p>I am trying my best to defuse the tense dynamic between Neutrality an myself, but I am at a loss as to what to do.</p>
<p>For example, Neutrality is again jumping all over my edits on <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> and deleted/reversed me me multiple times tonight wihtout discussion. I have left copious notes on that talk page explaining my edits, but Neutrality dos not dialog with me.</p>
<p>I really would appreciate some guidedance on getting Neutrality to give me some breathing room.</p>
<p>Also, please take note, although I am feeling very pressed againg by Neutrality, I am not reverting to my intial method of snide commentary.</p>
<p>Since Snowspinner chastized me several days ago with a 24hr ban, I have reconsidered and am avoiding harsh statements. That being the case, when can I expect Neutrality to be advised to leave me be and not be so agressive to me? <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex071404_f742.html" title="User:Rex071404">Rex071404</a> 01:48, 11 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I thought initially that the listing of proposed benefits to Oz was a little thin, because other than some vague reference to "increased access", I wasn't exactly sure how these benefits were quantified. Do you know anything more about that? But at least the article is shaping up well now, pleasingly. Ps. Glad you decided to stay.

Also, he declined my request for mediation and he is posting messages on Kerry Talk page with swear words in it.</p>
<p>Also, an explicit endorsement emphasizing the "conservative republican" status of the senator is inherently POV. <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERex071404_f742.html" title="User:Rex071404">Rex071404</a> 02:17, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I hope you will take another look at the Rios Montt page. After weeks spent trying to iron out a compromise over the article after it had been placed on lockdown (how to make it more NPOV, etc.), I have tried to make generally accepted changes on the subjects of the allegations against the School of the Americas, etc. (please see the "discussion" boards for the proof that I have not overstepped my bounds).</p>
<p>The discussions on Montt, an attempt to avoid another edit war, have apparently failed, though. 172, largely absent from the compromise talks, has returned to continue his campaign of inserting his political opinion on controversial issues as if it were absolute fact. As I speak, he is once again attacking and reverting any attempt to make the Montt article more NPOV (less overtly anti-Montt, anti-Reagan, anti-American, etc.).</p>
<p>I now believe that we have not had enough time to iron out what is and is not acceptable in the article. To keep 172 from spreading his propoganda as fact (untempered by the beliefs of others) in a hopefully fact-based Encyclopedia, I ask that you ONCE AGAIN...</p>
