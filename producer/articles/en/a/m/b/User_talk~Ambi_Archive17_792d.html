<p><a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> there seems to be two trains of thought on this area and others are buying in because it is an important area to reach consensus. I guess I can understand why you (even as an administrator) don't want to advise me on the complaint process. My research reveals that I should get your consent for mediation so I can then contact the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_Committee_9b92.html" title="Wikipedia:Mediation Committee">Wikipedia:Mediation Committee</a>. Do you give your consent? I will post this question here and on your user page so there is no chance that you might miss it - as you appear to have archived all of the debate on this. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve">VirtualSteve</a> 07:49, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Request for mediation now filed at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_mediation_71be.html#Users_Ambi_and_Virtual_Steve_-_Issue_Redlink_Reduction" title="Wikipedia:Requests for mediation">Users Ambi and Virtual Steve - Issue Redlink Reduction</a> Please feel free to add your comments. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve">VirtualSteve</a> 12:57, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Ambi for your information - I have responded to the request from Essjay by the following. Also will you please respond with your formal consent to go through the mediation process?
<ul>
<li>Hi Essjay. I did notice you churning very progressively through the large list of mediation requests. I appreciate the effort and time you and the mediation committee take on these issues. I would be happy to reformat and will do so in a couple of days if that is okay as I am away for that time and will have hardly any time to get to wiki. I will pass this message on to my co-protagonist also. On that basis can you give me a week say to finalise the new process? Thank you in advance. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve">VirtualSteve</a> 22:50, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

</dl>
<p>I note your comment on request for mediation and appreciate your agreement that you were a <i>a bit rude in communicating things</i>. I understand your point on valid redlinks - I do have an issue with the time that those redlinks remain valid but that can be dealt with outside of the mediation forum. I also note that others are involved in a series of revert actions in terms of the clause that you are still trying to remove. I will be happy to end my request for mediation if you (a) leave that clause alone and let it work itself out through consensus or perhaps policy formulation, (b) and you agree to supportively discuss those redlinks I (and perhaps others) remove rather than wholesale reverts of anything I change with threats of blocking etc (especially where I created the redlink myself). From my side I will more carefully consider the changing of redlinks and where contentious put up a discussion point in the edit. Is this something you could agree to? If so I will contact the RfM group and delist. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve">VirtualSteve</a> 22:22, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

I am not asking you to discuss every edit I am asking you to discuss any reduction that you don't like rather than you go through all of of my previous edits and even articles where I created the redlink in the first place - without looking at them and reverting wholesale. A bit like I have been going through some of your (otherwise fabulous) articles and picking up typo's, grammar etc and then leaving you a positive edit message. For me that is what a <i>long term contributor who proudly states she has contributed 1000's of articles and is an administrator</i> should be doing. Administration is partly if not largely about support - but that is up to you. As for the clause, well I defend it in the same spirit that it seems many others do - have a look at all of the other administrators that are reverting your revert. Put simply to not have a clause at all is far, far worse than any misinterpretation, or just a wholesale removal of that part of an attempt to establish consensus when one doesn't like the action of others. Anyway I want to move on - I have put the proposition to you and I'm not sure if you have answered it - for me it is like playing a sport, say netball, or being in a court of law - usually we can't be players and umpires too. I am happy to move on with the above understanding or I am happy to stand by the umpires (mediation committee) decision. Can you just tell me which process you would prefer? <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve">VirtualSteve</a> 05:45, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Ambi, I was wondering what you think about the 'other sitting MPs' section. There are 14 Greens in parliaments around Australia currently (4 federal, 4 Tassie, 3 NSW, 2 WA, 1 ACT), with substantial possibilities for increasing Green representation in the near future (a couple in Victoria in November, probably one in SA in March, up to 2 extra in Tassie, 1-2 extra in NSW in March 2007). Is it practical to include all sitting MPs? I thought five was a nice round number. The main reason for that is so that we can see when MPs are approaching the 'top ten', although currently Lee Rhiannon is three years away from breaking into the top 10. If we are including Paul Llewellyn and Deb Foskey, then we should probably also include Sylvia Hale and Rachel Siewert. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBraue_8793.html" title="User:Braue">Ben Raue</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBraue_14e3.html" title="User talk:Braue">Talk</a>) 03:53, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">User:Ambi</a></p>
<p>I reconsidered doing the list of former MPs. It'll probably take too long to get the full list together. I think from now on, I'll just put the relevant "members for xyz" table in the relevant articles and pull in party information manually. This will probably be faster.</p>
<p>I thought I'd do one example first and ask if what I've done is okay with you. The example is <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electoral_district_of_Bankstown_37e7.html" title="Electoral district of Bankstown">Electoral district of Bankstown</a>. Here I switch format from "lastname, firstname" to "firstname lastname" like the Albury article. Then I removed the days and months from the dates leaving only the years. Then I put in the party information.</p>

<p>"<i>You have a wonderful quote on your user page about the importance of freedom.</i>"</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First of all, our interpretations of freedom are very different. Yes, freedom is important. Human beings deserve to be free to think, to speak, to commute publicly without the fear of being shot at or persecuted, and especially to worship any god(s) of their choosing. However, there are stipulations to what we call 'freedom.' Absolute anarchal freedom constitutes chaos, which in turn infringes on the freedoms of society as a whole.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>"<i>Yet how can this not include a woman's right to choose if she wants to go through the pain of pregnancy, a refugee's right to go somewhere where they are not at constant risk of being murdered or tortured, or a Muslim's right to practice their religion without fear of being persecuted for it?</i>"</p>
<p>1. Well, I'm sorry, but if a woman doesn't wish to go through the pain of a pregnancy, then maybe she and/or her partner should have used a condom or contraception of some sort. Maybe she just should have thought about that before she had sex? Because we aaaall know the consequences of intercourse - a responsible adult is fully capable of controlling him or herself enough to not 'do it' without applying some sort of preventative measures beforehand. There is no excuse for casual abortion. I admit there are certain cases where it might be best for the mother that she terminate the pregnancy. And I might add that if she is not prepared to raise a child then she needs to stop being stupid and having common unprotected sex. It's disgusting and it spreads diseases that kill or at the very least make her partner very miserable for the rest of their lives. For example, why shouldn't people who knowingly spread AIDS be thrown in jail for life or even given the death penalty? I'm getting off-topic though.) Abortion is murder - there is no exception. When clinically defined, life begins shortly after an egg is fertilized. A few moments of pain, however severe, is insignificant next to the life of a living human. No excuses.</p>
<p>2. If you are referring to the waves of millions of Mexicans flooding across our southern borders, then you are sadly mistaken. They are not refugees. They smuggle contraband of all types, drain our medical and educational subsidies and social welfare, among other things. Bottom line - they are breaking international law, and should be rounded up and taken back to Mexico or worse. It's unfair to those Mexicans who patiently await their turn to legally emigrate and become an American citizen.</p>
<p>3. Oh, this one is funny. So you think that we should let fanatical Muslims practice their religion of death without hinderances of any sort? Absolutely not. NOT on my soil; in my FREE country. Given, if every American had the attitude you have about Islamofascism, your children would eventually come to live in a culture where they would have the <i>right to choose</i>. I know 'choice' is what you're all about, right? =) Well, that's a good thing, because they would give you two choices: convert to Islam or suffer death by beheading. And you can forget about abortion, and all those other things that you liberals like to pout over. Fundamental Islamic theocracy offers very little freedoms at all. Think about the uproar that we've witnessed over the publishing of some silly cartoons. You can try and talk to and use diplomacy with people like that, but don't expect to live through it.</p>
<p><i>Methinks your definition of freedom...yada yada,</i></p>
<p>Look, your philosophy of freedom is warped. I'm sure you think the same about me, so I won't try and rationalize. Tolerance can't solve all the evils of the world, and neither can violence. Human nature is intelligently entropic, so there has to be a balance maintained through the application of justice. Of course, one can still enjoy a wide variety of freedoms as long as those freedoms do not endanger the peace. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalva31_5bf5.html" title="User:Salva31">Salva</a> 16:47, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Ambi, the editorial process at this article has been drawn to my attention. I have also been apprised of, shall we say, some suggested reasons for your interest in this subject. This creates a slightly difficult situation for me, since my relations with you have always been cordial and I don't like to draw party matters (either interparty or intraparty) into my editing at Wikipedia. I have no grounds for complaint at present, but I just thought I'd let you know that I have added the article to my watchlist and will be keeping an eye on developments. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 05:52, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Greetings. Ambi, I'm a fan of yours, but threatening a revert-war is really inappropriate and out-of-character for you. Why do you want dates linked so badly that you'd revert another editors changes over it? I know Bobblewik edits quickly - I edit quickly too (see my contributions log). And I know you don't think the date-linking issue has been resolved (even though it's listed as official policy), but still. . . Like I said, I think you're a great Wikipedian, and I hate to bring this up, but this is starting to reflect badly on you. All the best, – <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuadell_cd19.html" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuadell_8ab2.html" title="User talk:Quadell">talk</a>) (<a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_board_8f83.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty board">bounties</a>)</sup> 13:27, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have to second this. The date issue is now official policy and this kind of revert warring is simply disruptive.

<p>Recently a user went to User:Cameronian for assistance. User:Cameronian rendered a judgement regarding the circumstances. The judgement that User:Cameronian rendered sort of came out of nowhere in the discussion, so I began investigating the manner. Initially User:Cameronian represented himself as a member of the Mediation/Arbitration committee. That assertion wasn't backed up and now I understand he is a member of the Advocay committee. Odd circumstances surround the events. The user who went to him said she found him on the mediation page. He is listed on the Advocacy page, which isn't all that strage - newbie's can get the bits confused. However, the logs show Cameronian was listed on the Advacates page only after he was contacted by the user. This is complicated by Cameronian having changed his name from MikeRoberts, but the change of name was done by a user UninvitedCompany. and it appears that user UninvitedCompany had been reprimanded for his behavior in the past. The concern I have is that the Cameronian login is being used in some illegitimate way in regards to mediation. At the least, Cameronian did not follow the protocols as a User Advocate. Could you look into this? Thanks. <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 15:31, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ah, my apologies, I should have made clear that I have recently changed my username, my old username was still on the Advocacy comittee until recently. It is also worth pointing out that changing username is completely legitimate. Cameronian 16:07, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I should also make clear, as I have stated far too many times already, my intention was only to give informal mediation. I am happy to proceed to formal mediation if you give me the go-ahead. Cameronian 16:13, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>(I have posted the following to Kd4ttc, just letting you know what has been said) Any member of Wikipedia is entitled to act as a mediator in any case, whether they are a member of a comittee or not. If you look carefully under informal mediation, you will see that anybody is entitled to come in and give an opinion on the matter. I was approached, as far as I was aware, to give this sort of informal mediation, not to act as an advocate. There was no need at the time for a formal mediation or advocacy, as rules and policy had been broken, therefore the changes sarastro made were valid, and the revertions were not. However, due to the events which later transipred, I found it necessary to start a more formal mediation, again, something which any user who has no involvment in the article itself has the right to do. I also considered the reverts to be bordering on vandalism, as I have a qualifications in both biology and medical ethics, and I saw sarastro's edits as useful to people who had the condition or were researching the condition. I hope a satisfactory conclusion can be drawn from this mediation, and that all users will be able to work together to produce a high quality article. This will be my final comment until you (Kd4ttc) recieve a reply from the co-ordinators of the mediation and advocacy comittees. Thank You. Cameronian 11:48, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, I expect you missed my previous note. The guidance in question syas "Do not use one-click rollback on edits that are not simple vandalism, not even to reverse a mistake of your own making. Please use manual rollback with an appropriate edit summary."

<p>Am concerned about you reverting what feels like practically every contribution I make to Wikipedia. I am working hard on them, particularly adding information on areas of interest to me. I am - unlike you - not an anonymous editor operating a pseudonym and I suspect you have an interest in the areas you edit that you do not disclose. If true, this is very unfortunate.

<p>Ambi, honey, it's me, the Good Commander hisself, Commander Cool (this time Part Deux! Twice the fun, twice the action, and twice the...the...duality...)!! Yes, indeed, Ambie, I have not forgotten you during my long sojourn into the OutWorld (known also as, the non-Wiki world). Yes, Beck dear (er...Ambi...), this fine-looking American fellow has one saying he lives by: "Never forget the old when you bring in the new." Yes, my Ambi-dextrous delight, I, in my graceful return to WikiLand return to bless this page with the awe of my presence. Though I return as the pheonix from the flame, I will always remember my old friends and enemies (and Ambies). That's what this US of A born-and-bred fella knows best. I hope you remembered me as I remembered you during my dark departure from the 'Pedia. But, now that I'm twice he adventure, twice the comedic amount, and twice the wordiness (this is longer than I intended), you can be assured that I'm twice the Commander, which can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>Feel free to check out ye olde homepage for me <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Cool%2C_part_deux_933b.html" title="User:Commander Cool, part deux">here</a>, if it's not too much to ask, from one old friend to another.</p>
<p>By the way, my main paragraph above is written in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiasmus.html" title="Chiasmus">chiasmus</a>, or at least my own poor attempt at it. Did you notice?</p>
<p>Oh, and, please try not to delete this little message. The old Commander's heart couldn't take a shock like that. Senor Cool (as the Spanish call me) may just have to depart from Wikipedia for a SECOND time, and the website just wouldn't be able to withstand that.</p>

<p>I am not going to get involved in editing this article, but it is undeniable that the Nunawading by-election debacle was one of the more important episodes in Batchelor's career.

If you don't want people to think you are an SL operator, you shouldn't revert true material from articles about SL politicians. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 02:25, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, if your defence is that you don't know much about Batchelor (and if you don't know that he's in the SL and that the Nunawading by-election was a major disaster both for him and for the Cain government, then you indeed don't know much), I suggest you leave the article alone. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 05:30, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree that in the context of the total article the Nunawading paragraph is disproportionate, but that's because the rest of the article is deficient. As you know I no longer edit on currently serving politicians, so someone else will have write a better article. But any article on Batchelor will have to have a major section on Nunawading. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 05:47, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This whole business of Nguyen being "overlooked" for a Ministry is POV. How do you know he sought one? It's this sort of thing that gives me serious concerns about your edits on political subjects. Let's just leave out the negative language from the article unless its warranted.</p>

<p>There are probably many categories of backbenchers: 1) don't wannabes 2) never gonnabes 3) wannabes and nearly there 4) wannabes but too young 5) wannabes but no factional support 6) wannabe but offended the leader 7) too dumb to notice what they wannabe 8) the whip/Speaker wannabes 9) accidental MP's</p>
<p>Perhaps we could have a color shaded chart and allocate people as we see fit. The serious point is I think it's very difficult in an encyclopedia to make a call. OK, many people would say Sang is in category 7. I would say he's more like category 1 because he is more community leader than policy wonk. How do we know? I have no way of scientifically telling you, I just know. Lidia is probably in category 5 and maybe also 9. The issue goes to us commenting on whether people are duds, ambitious, well supported, not liked etc. And I think it's all a bit too hard that's why I think terms like <i>overlooked</i> are not really worth using because we just don't know or in my case I might know but cannot prove my assertions about why people are backbenchers.</p>
<p>Equally Ministers could be categorised separately: 1) running the state, 2) running the numbers, 3) running scared, 4) running out of time and luck and my favourite group 5) running off at the mouth.</p>

<p>It's not an encyclopaedia's job to provide a commentary on who ought or ought not be in the ministry, although other people can be quoted to this effect.

<p>You just reverted MoS edits by somebody. The MoS says: <i>Avoid overlinking dates</i> If the date does not contain a day and a month, date preferences will not work, and square brackets will not respond to your readers' auto-formatting preferences. So unless there is a special relevance of the date link, there is no need to link it. This is an important point: simple months, years, decades and centuries should only be linked if there is a strong reason for doing so. See Wikipedia:Make only links relevant to the context for the reasons that it's usually undesirable to insert low-value chronological links; see also Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)#Internal links. <i>{{subst:unsgined2|10:45, 10 March 2006|Jclerman}}</i></p>

<dd>I trust that Ambi believes, as do I and quite few others, that the rollback button is just an easy way to revert changes and need not be limited to reverting vandalism, except where some additional edit summary is required. I have rolled back this change and a few other pages on my watchlist, and I see that several others have done the same.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, Ambi, I think your automatic rollbacks are at least as "bad" as (actually, worse than) Bobblewik's delinking. Have you read each of these articles to check whether the delinking makes sense in context? Bobblewik is trying to improve these articles, however misguided you think he is - do you really think that you are improving these article by putting back useless links to years and months? I estimate that you did over 400 edits in about 20 minutes in your rollback spree this morning (that is, around maintaining a rate of around 20 edits/minute - I counted <b>nineteen</b> for 10:29, 10 March 2006 and <b>thirty one</b> for 10:28, 10 March 2006, but I could have missed a few out). This rate is far greater than the rate at which a bot flag is required. Please desist, or ask for bot permission at <a href="../../../b/o/t/WP%7EBOT_8b0e.html" title="WP:BOT">WP:BOT</a>, or at the very least get some consensus for your mass reversions. - <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 13:27, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<pre>
Rollbacks should be used with caution and restraint. Reverting a good-faith edit may send the message 
that "I think your edit was no better than vandalism and doesn't deserve even the courtesy of an explanatory 
edit summary." It is a slap in the face to a good-faith editor; do not abuse it.
If you use the rollback feature other than against vandalism or for reverting yourself, be sure to explain on the 
talk page of the user whose edit(s) you reverted.

<p>Ambi, I've unblocked that user based on the fact that he/she/it has a squillion good contributions, is helping the encyclopedia and isn't in clear violation of any policy. The sock puppetry policy does not explicitly prohibit role-accounts, only says that they are not "officially sanctioned," whatever that means.

<p>Why did you remove factual information from the page on Jack Sarfatti?</p>

<p>From: Tony Smith &lt;f75m17h@mindspring.com&gt; Date: March 2, 2006 10:15:23 PM PST To: walrod@mpc.com.br Cc: czarlosromanov@yahoo.com, sarfatti@pacbell.net, woit@math.columbia.edu, f75m17h@mindspring.com Subject: Waldyr's reply</p>
<p>Waldyr, thanks for your reply a copy of the text of which is set out below my signature. There was a large attachment called THEREVIEW.doc that I was not able to read because it crashed the mac translator that I use for .doc windows documents, so I have not included it and I do not know what it said. From context, I guess that it was a sample of math reviews using "very hard words".</p>
<p>I still stand by my previous message but here are a few additional comments based on your reply:</p>
<p>Pertti Lounesto did in fact point out errors and ambiguities in many math works, such as for example the book Spin Geometry by Lawson and Michelsohn, but he did not use such severely personally abusive terms as "self-delusion", etc.</p>
<p>You are also correct that "very hard words" have been used in criticism of math papers in Math. Rev. and Zentr. fur Math., but I consider such "very hard words" to be a very bad characteristic of the math community, and one that is harmful to progress. (For example, consider the difficulty faced by de Branges in getting recognition of his proof of the Bieberback conjecture.)</p>
<p>However, Jack is NOT writing MATH papers. He is writing PHYSICS papers, and in PHYSICS it is the PHYSICAL IDEAS that are important, far more important than correctable math technical misstatements.</p>
<p>The only PHYSICS criticism that I understand in your criticism of Jack's paper is that you say "... that he deduced Einstein's equations from his theory ... is self delusion or Jack is a great joker ...".</p>
<p>I have discussed that part of Jack's model extensively by e-mail, and it seems to me that his path to Einstein's equations is just as physically realistic as the well-known MacDowell-Mansouri path to Einstein's equations. Therefore, in my opinion, your PHYSICS criticism of Jack's paper is invalid.</p>
<p>Of course, Jack's PHYSICS ideas go beyond the MacDowell-Mansouri mechanism in interesting ways that may even allow exploitation of the Dark Energy that constitutes almost 3/4 of the stuff of our universe. Your statement that Dark Energy / Dark Matter "... is simply an hypothesis, and I [Waldyr] am sure it is a very bad one ..." is only an expression of your personal opinion, and therefore is NOT a refutation of Jack's ideas.</p>
<p>It would be a great loss to human culture if math nit-picking "very hard words" impeded the development of physics technologies to control Dark Energy.</p>
<p>Finally, you say "... the 'dozen' ... are important men that ... will not loose the opportunity to ... eventually cause some damage to some of my [Waldyr's] students. This is not a very beautiful 'game', of course, but it is a game which is being played since ever. I [Waldyr] am quite sure that lawyers play games even ugly than this one. ...".</p>
<p>NO !!! I have practiced law (criminal and civil) for decades here in the USA, and I can say that lawsuits are NOT "games ...[as]... ugly" as the game that you and "the 'dozen' ... important men" are playing against Jack.</p>
<p>In a lawsuit, you have a known adversary and you can ask direct questions and the court can compel the adversary to answer the questions. Here, Jack does not know who are "the 'dozen' ... important men" who are acting against him, and you can (and do) refuse to answer the simple, direct questions: Who are they and what have they said ?</p>
<p>So, please do NOT insult the lawyers of the USA by saying that they are on the same low level as you and the others who are attacking Jack.</p>
<p>If this disgusting episode has one silver lining, it is that it makes clear that lawyers are not the lowest scum of the earth, because it is now clear to me that the math/physics community occupies that exceptional place in human society.</p>

<p>Status: U From: "Waldyr A. Rodrigues Jr." &lt;walrod@mpc.com.br&gt; To: "'Tony Smith'" &lt;f75m17h@mindspring.com&gt; Subject: RES: dozen Date: Thu, 2 Mar 2006 14:16:24 -0300 MIME-Version: 1.0 X-Priority: 3 (Normal) X-MSMail-Priority: Normal Importance: Normal X-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V6.00.2900.2527 X-Virus-Scanned: by amavisd-new at mpc.com.br X-ELNK-AV: 0 X-ELNK-Info: sbv=0; sbrc=.0; sbf=00; sbw=000;</p>
<p>Dear Tony,</p>
<p>The "DOZEN", in fact with their jokes[1] only alerted me that something needed to be done.</p>
<p>I do not consider that my paper is a personal attack against Jack, indeed I consider it as an advertisement of a real friend, and indeed if you read my paper carefully you will find that I wrote: '... In any case, we would like that he be aware that in writing it we found also inspiration in Aristotle [who in his Nicomachean Ethics, book 1,</p>
<pre>
Chapter 6 said in a similar situation where he could not agree with
</pre>
<p>the presentations of some of his friends on a given subject that: `...piety requires us to honor truth above our friends'], and also in our (late) friend Pertti Lounesto that enlightened us for many years with his posters on errors and counterexamples to 'theorems´ found in the literature on Clifford algebras.'</p>
<p>Moreover it is quite common for mathematicians to write reviews for Math. Rev. and the Zentr. für Math. denouncing the very bad mathematics of many published papers, and using very hard words. I am sending attached a small sample (read at least the ones written by Dieudonné).</p>
<p>Also, I said to Jack in a previous e-mail: 'Your Mathematics is almost completely wrong, but if your physical ideas are correct, what I doubt, they will be vindicate some of these days, and if this happens I while I am still living I will write a note to my arXiv paper gr-qc/0602111 stating that fact.'</p>
<p>Now, the only physical prediction of Jack's paper is: detectors will not detec dark matter.</p>
<p>Well, a simple explanation for this would be experiment is: dark matter does not exist. And indeed, dark matter and dark energy are 'products' of the supposedly validity of GR for the dynamics of the Universe as a whole. But this is simply an hypothesis, and I am sure it is a very bad one. Indeed, there some more autentic explanations for the phenomena suposedly expalined by the existence of dark matter, as, e..g., the Mond theory (<a href="http://www.p-i-a.com/Magazine/Issue18/Physics_18.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.p-i-a.com/Magazine/Issue18/Physics_18.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.p-i-a.com/Magazine/Issue18/Physics_18.htm</a>)</p>
<p>Finally I would like to comment on your stamtent: '2 - If the attack is successful, and Jack's reputation is destroyed, they you will be a hero for protecting the children of the world from "self-delusion" physics.'</p>
<p>I think that with the modern internet the only one that can damage Jack's reputation is himself. This will certainly happen (if it did not already happened) if he continues to write statements like the one that he deduced Einstein's equations from his theory. Or this is self delusion or Jack is a great joker.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p><br />
Waldyr</p>
<p><br />
[1] As you probably know I wrote in the last few years several very critical articles, explicitly saying that their authors did not know what they are talking about, that they used nonsense mathematics, etc. So, the 'dozen' could not leave in blank the opportunity to say: you forgot your Mathematics, etc. Why did I consider this dangerous? Simply because they are important men that in reality did not like me very much ( I have been hard with some of them also ) and I am sure that they will not loose the opportunity to mislead my contact with Jack and eventually cause some damage to some of my students. This is not a very beautiful 'game', of course, but it is a game which is being played since ever. I am quite sure that lawyers play games even ugly than this one. ...</p>

<p>Waldyr, you say "... I [Waldyr] never said that I was being threatened. ...", and "... I [Waldyr] received dozen of mails &gt;from all around the world asking things like ... If I did not post my notes I would produce real damage to some of my students that are asking for financial support to continue their studies.".</p>
<p>The second quote is obviously a statement of fact that you (and your students) WERE IN FACT BEING THREATENED.</p>
<p>Whether you ever SAID that you were being threatened (that is, the first quote) is irrelevant.</p>
<hr />
<p>You also said "... of course, I am not going to say to you who wrote to me and what exactly those persons said ...".</p>
<p>Do as you feel is best for your interests, but consider:</p>
<p>1 - The "dozen" who in fact threatened you and your students are using you to attack Jack Sarfatti.</p>
<p>2 - If the attack is successful, and Jack's reputation is destroyed, they you will be a hero for protecting the children of the world from "self-delusion" physics.</p>
<p>3 - However, IF THE ATTACK FAILS AND JACK IS VINDICATED BY HISTORY, then YOU will be seen as one who killed Jack with hemlock and History will condemn you as certainly as those who killed Socrates (to protect the children from his ideas) are now condemned, and IF YOU DO NOT NAME THE "DOZEN", THEY WILL GET OFF SCOT FREE, HAVING HIDDEN BEHIND YOUR NAME, AND ALL OF THE "DOZEN" WILL JOIN IN THE CONDEMNATION OF YOU.</p>
<p>You, Waldyr, should act according to your conscience, but I just want to be sure that you take the above factors into account.</p>
<p>If you decide to send me copies of the messages that you received from the "dozen", I would be happy, but the decision is yours.</p>
<p>Tony</p>
<p><br />
PS - For what it is worth, I am familiar with Jack's physics ideas, and with his limitations in math technicalities, and if I were a betting person I would bet that HISTORY WILL VINDICATE THE SUBSTANCE OF JACK'S PHYSICS IDEAS.</p>

<p>In that case my apology. From the history of the Jack Sarfatti page it appeared that you removed some factual material that gave the proper context for Waldyr Rodrigues's remarks cited there. For example Rodrigues wrote: "As you probably know I wrote in the last few years several very critical articles, explicitly saying that their authors did not know what they are talking about, that they used nonsense mathematics, etc. So, the 'dozen' could not leave in blank the opportunity to say: you forgot your Mathematics, etc. Why did I consider this dangerous?

<p>When I expressed outrage at <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetta_Bubble_dc7b.html" title="User:Metta Bubble">Metta Bubble</a>'s complete failure to mediate, and encourage a civil discussion, his response is to make a flip statement ("Shame really.") and then give me a formal warning.

<dd>As you can see, I am quoting YOUR OWN POLICY and it seems to say pretty clearly that there are no exceptions.

<p>I also added this, which provides more context:</p>
<p><br />
You know:</p>
<ul>
<li>I was the one who caught the <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">weasel words</a> used by Gbambino in the Ethnicity section and got them excised thanks to Ground Zero</li>
<li>I was the one who identified the Motek Sherman incident which was ultimately used and verified in the Ethnicity section</li>
<li>I was the one who pointed out that <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cookie_Monster_c348.html" title="Cookie Monster">Cookie Monster</a> was not the school mascot and succeeded in convincing Gbambino to take it out</li>
<li>I was the one who came up with the idea of even having a separate section on Ethnicity</li>
<li>I was the one who forced this Gbambino to source EACH and EVERY statement in the Ethnicity section... now it has real substantive heft</li>
<li>I was the one who forced Ground Zero and others to take a careful look at the syntax of the Ethnicity section to ensure a Neutral Point of View</li>
</ul>
<p>Before I came along, this is what UCC had to say about Ethnicity:</p>
<p>(under the "Today" section}</p>
<p><i>Unlike many other Canadian independent schools, UCC has a long history of ethnic students since its founding. The first black student appeared in 1831, the first Jewish student in 1836 and the first aboriginal student in 1840. Today, students from about 18 countries attend UCC, and comprise a substantial quantity of students in each of the offered years.</i></p>
<p>--&gt; OMG, the bias in this previous version is sickening to me personally. It totally lacks any sourcing. The data is cherry picked to present one fringe radical view on ethnicity at UCC. Ugh.</p>
<p>This is what the new Ethnicity section says now: Ethnicity</p>
<p><i>UCC began admitting ethnic minority students early in its history. The first black student enrolled in 1831, the first Jewish student in 1836 and the first aboriginal student in 1840; some graduates from the Ojibway peoples of Upper Canada going on to study at Dartmouth College and Harvard University. [10]</i></p>
<p><i>Diplomat James George, a student between 1926 and 1936, said upon reflection about his time with other UCC graduates in the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs: "If UCC really was a womb matrix for a bunch of WASP patriots, why did it produce so many internationalists?" [11]</i></p>
<p><i>UCC has maintained a reputation as a "bastion of WASP privilege." [12] Some students recall experiencing anti-Semitism; Graham Fraser, the Globe and Mail Washington Bureau Chief, who attended UCC between 1960 and 1964, recalled: "Anti-Semitism was generally an unspoken undercurrent at UCC, but a couple of times I witnessed overt anti-Semitism.... Before 1960, Toronto was a pretty narrow, close-minded, little Victorian town and Upper Canada College reflected that reality." [13]</i></p>
<p><i>Foermer Prep School Headmaster Richard Howard said in his book Upper Canada College, 1929-1979: Colborne's Legacy, published in 1979: "The growth of the enrolment has increased the number of boys from a wide variety of backgrounds and decreased the ratio of those from old Toronto families. The address list now reflects Toronto's ethnic variety and resembles a small United Nations." [14]</i></p>
<p><i>Motek Sherman, the editor of the school's yearbook The College Times in 1990, wrote an editorial stating that while UCC was no longer "a white-bread, right-wing fortress: it has become much more multi-cultural and (dare I say it?) liberal.... In my years at UCC I have faced anti-Semitism, ugliness, stupidity and bureaucracy." [15]</i></p>
<p><i>In 2002, student Adam Sheikh created the Diversity Council to celebrate the cultural diversity of the school's student population. This council, a body of students independent from the school administration, organizes celebrations of Chinese, Jewish, Christian and Ukranian cultures. [16]</i></p>
<p><i>Today, students from about 18 countries attend UCC. The international students typically come from among the wealthiest families in the countries of their origin.</i></p>
<p>--&gt; Wow, what a change! It's balanced. It's neutral. It's verified. Sweet!</p>

<p>I find it ironic that a supposed "user advocate" would label me a "sock puppet" when an administrator (Ground Zero) who was involved in a lengthy dispute on the UCC talk page expressly stated that he or she didn't believe me to be a sock puppet or troll. What User 66 says above about my registration is completely true and I would encourage Metta Bubble to pursue any investigation he or she deems appropriate. I do not feel that it is at all fitting that Metta Bubble continue to hold him or herself out as a "user advocate" and I intend to take whatever steps are necessary to remedy this situation. For the record, Metta Bubble, posting the kind of comments that you did above is liable to get you labelled a *dick*.<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlunders_of_the_third_kind_970a.html" title="User:Blunders of the third kind">Blunders of the third kind</a> 21:44, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Wikipedia policy on names makes sense, but I don't have sources on the information required to enter the most commonly used names. When I see a name that's different, and it doesn't have an existing page or sources, I can't be sure if it is correct. I still think it is proper to temporarily use the officially recorded name until someone writes an article about the politician or until someone can provide sources indicating the most commonly used name.</p>

<p>I am relatively new to Wikipedia (only a few months) but have recently found myself involved in a debate in which I have no vested interest purely in the interests of the upholding of policy (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Innatheism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Innatheism" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:NicholasTurnbull#Premature_closing_of_AfD" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:NicholasTurnbull#Premature_closing_of_AfD" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, and [Deletion_review#Innatheism]), and this is why I thought I might be well-suited to advocacy. I am only a secondary school student, but I have a strong interest in Law. I wondered, therefore, if I might be able to "shadow" an advocate for a while (where this is compatible with client confidentiality, of course) to see whether I would be suitable for advocacy. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Mestel_2c0e.html" title="User:David.Mestel">David.Mestel</a> 21:48, 18 March 2006 (UTC) btw, I wrote the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Litigation_bc58.html" title="Roman Litigation">Roman Litigation</a> article --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid.Mestel_2c0e.html" title="User:David.Mestel">David.Mestel</a> 21:58, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks. I'm trying to find more information (and specific sources), but there's nothing in the way of literature (well, for now at least) and I can't get onto Factiva! Good luck with the effort regardless.

<p>I don't know who you are or why you think you can simply edit away the additions I recently made to the page about A. O. Neville. I am studying the man in a University course at the University of Melbourne and would not have made additions that I did not think had verifiable sources. I find it very aggravating and somewhat paternalistic that you think you should be the person to delete my additions simply because <i>you think</i> the conclusions are not supported by evidence. I am quoting Neville's own speeches, easily found in archival research, and he indeed did write Australia's Colored Minority, and yes, it DOES call for the gradual mixing of the races so that aboriginals will disappear. I suggest you do a bit more of your own research before making rash decisions about topics you clearly do not know much about.</p>

<p>Ambi, could I ask that you don't revert the edits Quadell has made? I believe he has agreed not to do any more for a day or so, and people are trying to hash out some sort of compromise on the MoS talk page. It would be good if there could be a laying down of arms so that feelings aren't running so high.

<p>I am mildly sorry you are offended, but I do not see why. I did not say she wrote it herself. And it still looks like a puffy piece to me. It contains next to nothing about her views, if any, and remains utterly unsourced. The fact that <i>you</i> find her notable is not, I would think, reason why everyone else would. How about we compromise and add something about the Labor Party's increasing domination by middle class former student politicians with no experience outside politics? Not a law student at Flinders by any chance? <a href="../../../l/a/o/User%7ELao_Wai_79b4.html" title="User:Lao Wai">Lao Wai</a> 11:44, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ambi, to respond to your comment on my talk page, no one <i>does</i> criticise me for wanting to remove trivial year links that have nothing to do with the auto-formatting function. I don't delink en masse, in any case, as you appeared to assume.</p>
<p>All I wanted to know was: why are you so fervent about these links? You haven't once explained why; I was hoping for a list of reasons. It's a mystery to me that a writer as good as you (going by your FAC a while ago, which was excellent) would take the stance that you have. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 08:03, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
