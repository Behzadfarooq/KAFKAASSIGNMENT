<p>Rebecca, I changed some of the info you had initially added to <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergei_Bagapsh_baef.html" title="Sergei Bagapsh">Sergei Bagapsh</a> last year based on what I found at rulers.org. It lists him as the fourth, not the second prime minister, and says his time as PM ended in Dec. 1999 rather than June 2001 (which it says is when his successor's term ended). I don't want to be guilty of getting anything wrong, though, so I'd appreciate it if you could take a look and make sure. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 21:34, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Once again, thanks. Something else to ask of you: Autobiography album design was deleted some time ago, probably in early December. I don't see anybody's name listed as having deleted it, but obviously someone did. I don't contest that, the vote was pretty clearly against me, but I'd like to see it restored and redirected to <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobiography_%28album%29.html" title="Autobiography (album)">Autobiography (album)</a> so that the content will exist in the history. Since there were a number of votes to merge, I don't think this would be too radical of a thing to do. I'm afraid to do it myself because someone might say it's abuse of admin powers. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 14:37, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I figured you just hit restore. I'm not sure I've ever actually done it myself before, though. The reason is that I want the content available to people if they search through the history, so that it isn't gone forever. Of course, I do have it saved in my user space, so it's not that big of a deal. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 15:12, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi&#160;:) If you have a few minutes it be great if you could have a look at West Papua and the re-name proposal at the bottom of its discussion page. Any input, edits, or opinions be great. I've always tried to ensure there was an abundance of supporting evidence before adding content, and avoid emotive wording; I welcome different opinions, just wish they would explain what it is they disagree with. All Best&#160;:)</p>
<p>P.S. Help, My mistake, rather than just moving the article back to its original English name, I went to the discussion page first. And Wik's associate has just noticed my return and is back with another person to do his old "revert" trick.</p>

<p>With regard to the Pulitzer Prize article on which you've done a good deal of work, I'm confused over "explanatory" reporting/journalism. On the one hand "explanatory reporting" is included in the 2004 list.On the other hand "explanatory journalism" is listed as a discontinued category. Was it discontinued and then resumed under a slightly different name, then? --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristofurio_ba82.html" title="User:Christofurio">Christofurio</a> 13:18, Feb 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've found the information I wanted at the Pulitzer website. I wouldn't call the older name, a "discontinued category," when all that happened was a modest name change. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristofurio_ba82.html" title="User:Christofurio">Christofurio</a> 13:57, Feb 3, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. I've decided that the term "discontinued category" does no real harm, so long as its explained, and I've added an explanation. Also, I created a new article for the older <a href="../../../p/u/l/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Explanatory_Journalism_5cf8.html" title="Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Journalism">explanatory journalism</a> prizes, listing the winners there. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristofurio_ba82.html" title="User:Christofurio">Christofurio</a> 00:46, Feb 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, they can be angry if they want. I honestly don't understand the negativity. What baffles me more than anything is that everybody here is a <i>volunteer</i>—why would someone devote his or her own precious time to doing something here that's not constructive? I mean, we're not talking about vandals here; they're all serious contributors, but I don't understand what drives them. What gives a person such zeal to eliminate information? I have zeal to build an encyclopedia, not deconstruct it piece by piece. But I certainly know my zeal isn't going to run out any time soon.

<p>Your user page says you're away, but the deletion log shows you're here. &#160;:-) I just came across Text of the Attribution-ShareAlike License and am puzzled. It doesn't look like something for Wikisource, but it isn't a WP article either. It doesn't qualify as a CSD. Does this really need to go to VfD? I'm looking for a second opinion.

<li>It appears that Utcursch has marked it for transwiki to Wikisource. I've never worked with Wikisource before, but I went browsing to see if there was a section with this type of material.

<p>I hate these deletion decisions when it's someone with a common name. Unless you are deeply familiar with the person being deleted (which is almost impossible - if they were well known, then their article probably wouldn't have been deleted), it is very difficult to tell whether the "what links here" is showing a valid link to an as-yet unwritten article or was a "spam" link made by the same people who contributed the article.</p>
<p>Knowing that this might be a problem because it's such a common name, I tried to be careful to document the question on each article's talk page. I honestly don't know what I could have done differently.</p>
<p>The backlog in cleaning out VfD/Old is monstrous. I give each one as much time as I can but we have too many people nominating articles for community review and not enough people helping to close the discussion. &lt;/rant&gt;</p>

<p>I was surprised to find that I was a little disappointed that you accepted the case against me in arbitration.</p>
<p>I don't like you and I don't like your approach to the encyclopaedia, although I do respect the work you do on Australian subjects, but I've always thought you were a stickler for policy, and reasonably fair, despite your antagonism to the more liberal elements here.</p>
<p>I haven't actually done anything wrong at <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clitoris.html" title="Clitoris">clitoris</a>. I refer you to <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>:</p>
<p>"Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Apparent bad faith edits that do not make their bad faith nature explicit and inarguable, are not considered vandalism at Wikipedia."</p>
<p>"Bullying or stubbornness Some users cannot come to agreement with others who are willing to talk to them on an article's talk page, and repeatedly make changes opposed by everyone else. This is a matter of regret—you may wish to see our dispute resolution pages to get help. However, it is not vandalism."</p>
<p>Not only is stubbornness protected by this policy -- this is the reason Raul could not make a block stick and Snowspinner opened this arbitration -- but I have not "disrupted" anything. I have discussed the issue with the other side, at great length. We have neared consensus some times, although of course as is common the majority don't really feel they need to accommodate the minority, and have often said so. My accuser at arbitration, Snowspinner, did not even respond to a suggestion that we mediate. I'm not surprised. Neither he nor Raul has <i>ever</i> discussed this page with me, nor have either of them discussed it with any opponent of the image except to insist that they will not even consider a compromise. Is this what we're about now? You get a majority and then you no longer need to bother discussing anything with anybody.</p>
<p>I don't expect a fair hearing at the arbitration committee -- from what I can see it backs admins, even rogue admins, against anyone it doesn't feel is toeing the line, and it has been unafraid to make ad hoc policy where there was none it felt it could use to do that. You've already done so in fact, by accepting the case brought by a person who has <i>never</i> shown any willingness to even discuss the issue in question, refused mediation and abused policy by using a fraudulent reason to block another user to push his POV against a person who has been very involved in discussing the issue, offered to mediate and has stayed at all times within the policies of Wikipedia.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 23:07, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Danny, I'm a bit confused about this project. I just had a look at the history of the last page, which is marked as done, and there's still quite a lot of red links there. I thought the links were meant to be blue before they were removed?</p>
<p>Also, is there any chance you'd be able to archive your talk page? The size of it is a bit nasty for those of us who have to pay by the megabyte for our bandwidth. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 03:35, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

If I remember, I'll give Parliamentary Services a ring on Monday and see if there's some way I can get my hands on one. <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">Slac</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>speak up!</small></a> 21:30, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In November 2003, there was a VfD debate over <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunset_High_School_%28Portland%29_6fd2.html" title="Sunset High School (Portland)">Sunset High School (Portland)</a>. The debate was archived under <a href="../../../s/u/n/Talk%7ESunset_High_School_%28Portland%29_65ea.html" title="Talk:Sunset High School (Portland)">Talk:Sunset High School (Portland)</a>. What to do with the article is still being contested and has been recently re-nominated for VfD at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Sunset_High_School_%28Portland%29_1a08.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Sunset High School (Portland)">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Sunset High School (Portland)</a>.</p>
<p>I am writing to you because you have participated in such debates before. There still does not exist a wikipedia policy (as far as i can tell) over what to do in regards to articles about specific U.S. public school. My hope is that a real consensus can come out of the debate, and a real policy can take shape. Take part if you are so willing. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 02:41, 12 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>User Chinasaur moved comments from Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Tkorrovi vs. Paul Beardsell, remaining his there and moving mine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration/Tkorrovi_vs._Paul_Beardsell&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=12190358" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration/Tkorrovi_vs._Paul_Beardsell&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=12190358" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, just after I put a link on an evidence page to that page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Tkorrovi_vs._Paul_Beardsell/Evidence&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=12176066" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Tkorrovi_vs._Paul_Beardsell/Evidence&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=12176066" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> because it contains important information. Also, he moved a question about his nationality to my talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration/Tkorrovi_vs._Paul_Beardsell&amp;diff=12190358&amp;oldid=12190152" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_arbitration/Tkorrovi_vs._Paul_Beardsell&amp;diff=12190358&amp;oldid=12190152" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>.

<p>That's very kind of you, but Darwin's still a fair way from completion. Starting at such an early point in a city article has giving me some ideas for improving the Adelaide article. But the thanks really should be going to you! Hopefully the clean-up and your motivation will end this stagnate period, and get Aussie Wikipedians contributing where they can.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> 08:16, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
