<p>Talk about a quick response. Thanks for showing up. And your question about Shivaji, check Todd's book, Shivaji is a descendant of Ajaisi, the youngest son of Maharana Ratna Singh who died duirng the siege of CHittor by Khilji (The story of Padmini), also you can check up on the Royal Family of Mewar website <a href="http://www.mewarindia.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.mewarindia.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mewarindia.com/</a> , or even the descendants of Shivaji who are still politically active in Maharashtra.</p>

<p>Thanks for answering my article. It,s breife but little jumbling.I have some facts to made clear. 1) I will never ever proclaimed to be the cleverest, One and only founder or superman. That dose mean that i have't discovered something ground breaking or blockbuster in the world of history. And nither should you must call yourself the first discoverer in the history that Marath,s history written by non Maratha historian is full of false statements and vandalism. The true Maratha history is yet to be written correctly and put in a proper, true , good manner. So my dear freind , my brother , my fellow , you should pleas not that nither you nor me are the discoverer that the big Vandalism in Maratha history is going on for a long long time. I tell you why . Read my next Point</p>
<p>2) You have told that you live in Britan. God knows if it is true or false.But i tell you a very very important thing that every commen ,average,rational Maratha person in Maharashtra or in India knows that Vandalism in Maratha history is going on by non Maratha people specialy by Bramin cast (( I am sorry to pointing a cast but i had to do it for you . Forgive me )). As you should know that every person of our Maratha society knows that we , the maratha's are looted, underestimated,hated,diffrenciated by other cast and religion of the world.The awerness may verry ,diffrent by person to person but my statement is true.</p>
<p>3) Our work is that we shoul put the history in proper manner and rectify it. My very important personal statement is that our forefathaer (( The Maratha )) , How were they , what qualities they had , what is their greatness , why should we cherish them, off what origin they belong , what is our history.,, And all these other factors should be written , discovered ,putt before the worl by a Maratha historian like me.</p>
<p>4) Nobody should be claim to be the first one or the discoverer of the Maratha history .. But what is important is that the correction , rectification should be made . My aim is to advertise general awairness among our fellow Maratha brother as wll as all the world.</p>

<p>It is very surprising and encouraging at the same time to see a 16 year old being so involved with his/her origin. I am in a similar situation. However, It has been 8 years since i have visited my homeland and hence have never got the chance to know about my origins. My father himself does not know a great deal about where my family comes from or from what Maratha clan are we from. He has no clue. I have been trying to get answers for quite some time now, but since my source is only the internet, it is very difficult to successfully find any. My craving for information about myself increases each time i read articleas about Marathas here and there. But I have never found direct clues as to which part of that great history do I come from.</p>
<p>It would be of great help if you could suggest ways about how i could find out more about my family and ancestors. It is an urge of mine to know who I really am, and if you could help me with it, i would be able to find this missing piece. Even the slightest detail will help quench my thoughts until i get a real chance to go back to India and know for sure. The only one thing I know from what my dad told me is that before we left for the U.S. from gujarat, about two generations before my father, i.e his grandfather had come to gujarat from a place called Kher in Maharashtra. That is all I know. If you can help me, please do reply at inds911@hotmail.com</p>
<p>Indrasen Pasale.</p>
<p>Well Idrasen... Since Pasale is pretty uncommon name i wont be able to pinpoint ur clan. The best way to learn aboput ur origins ofcourse is to visit ur home village. That how i found out about my ancestors.</p>
<p>BTW Could you be more specific about the location of this place Kher. I cant find it on the map...</p>

<p>Hi, I have reworked the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Maratha</a> page to reflect mainstream history (not a PoV rant on the alleged non-marathi antecedents of the marathas) and I hope this will meet your concerns. Also, can you let me know what you think of the list of 96 clans and <i>Gotras</i> found on the page? The list seems to be distinctly brahminical -- the names of the <i>gotras</i> are brahmin, at any rate. Please compare with the list found on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha_Clan_System_5da8.html" title="Maratha Clan System">Maratha Clan System</a> and let me know your views.

<p>Well firstly theres no way they are gonna demote dab. To make a strong case we need days of research into his other contributions as well. Secondly i wish to apply for an admin, cant risk being called for "troll behaviour" by dab. We need more Indian admins here.</p>

<p>We should do this research. If someone calls it a troll behavior let them call it. Key is you cannot compromise on your principle. The moment you do it once next time is around the corner. Remember Shivaji. I am sure there are plenty of Indian admins around but they are not ready to upset the apple cart by getting involved in a dispute related to India. Once you are on the inside lesser chance you will get to express yourself.</p>
<p>Is there anything common between solanki marathas and solanki rajputs? I know maratha is an all encompassing term which has kshatriya marathas and brahmin peshwas.</p>

<p>Well... some Maratha clans Rathods, Sisode (corruption of Sisodia) and Salunkhe (corruption of Solanki) have some Rajput ancestry it seems though Marathas are a mizture of various people from Yadavs to Rashtrakuts. Well i'm helping Shiv file RfC against Zora.</p>

<p><br />
Amay Go ahead and put your name on that RFC. Also somebody has claimed there is some formatting error on bachman's RFC. Please fix that also.</p>
<p>There are more common clans like Chavan and I am sure there are Deora also in Maharashtra. Deora are chauhans. Possibly these guys retained the name of there original clan.</p>
<p>You belong to a brave and proud race. Don't expect favors from people like Bachman etc.</p>

<p>Hi! <a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">User:RN</a> moved the article to <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_numerals.html" title="Arabic numerals">Arabic numerals</a> despite 28 votes favoring the title "Hindu-Arabic numerals" and only 17 favoring "Arabic numerals." He argues that if we don't count voters with less that 150 (or sth like that) edits, only 56% voters "support <b>changing the title to</b> Hindu-Arabic numerals", while at least 60% support votes are required. However, it was agreed between all parties in the beginning of the vote that the proposal is to move the article <b>to</b> "Arabic numerals" <b>from</b> "Hindu-Arabic numerals." It was also agreed (though I thought it was very unfair) that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those <i>opposing</i> the move have the advantage that it won't be moved unless there's a 60% majority</li>
<li>Those <i>supporting</i> the move have the advantage that the person proposing the move can do the *short* opening statement.</li>
<li>For all the rest of the voting procedure both parties are equal. (quoting <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancis_Schonken_676e.html" title="User:Francis Schonken">Francis Schonken</a> from 21:04, 18 December 2005 (UTC))</li>
</ul>
<p>I would definitely have preferred it the other way round, since I think an opening statement makes a HUGE difference, since many people just read the opening statement and understandably don't bother with the discussion below the votes. The present situation was accepted with the agreement that the article will be moved to "Arabic numerals" only if more than 60% voters favored that title. Thus, only 40% oppose votes were sufficient to retain the title "Hindu-Arabic numerals." In the present situation (with over 60% voters opposing the change), I find the move to "Arabic numerals" ridiculous, besides being completely unjust and unfair.

<p>Well, I am trying to help out as you told me but my schedule won't relax until March. The Rajput article seems to be getting hijacked by the Pakistanis and Wikipedia is looking more and more like a JIHAD propaganda site rahter than an attempt to provide information with reliable sources.</p>
<p>Its amazing that the Pakistanis are being allowed to say whatever they want without citing any sources or evidence and yet the Hindus are being asked to provide sources, which they do, and even though these are reliable sources, they are still treated as if they are the criminals.</p>
<p>I didn't understand before when one of my University Professors told me not to contribute to Wikipedia since I will be facing a lot of immature idiots who will simply argue the facts without a proper basis.</p>
<p>I am not sure what to do about the Rajput article. Just thought I should let you know.</p>

<p>Hi AMbroodEY, thanks for the offer. It would obviously be better if someone else nominated for me rather than myself. However, perhaps if you want to nominate me, could you wait for a couple of weeks? I am not sure whether I do enough admin-related work on Wikipedia yet. As an <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditcountitis_b262.html" title="Wikipedia:Editcountitis">editcountitis</a> sufferer, I would feel more comfortable when I have past 4000 edits by a fair way.

<p>Hi Ambroodey, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shivaji.html" title="Shivaji">Shivaji</a> certainly looks like something good to work upon -- it really has improved over the past few days, but there is still work to be done, including creation of 'daughter' pages (I'm a great one for "branching out" of articles). It will keep one busy for 2-3 days at the very least. Actually I have been off WP of late because I have a MAJOR exam later this month, but I am very serious about taking it up asap. I'll probably do what I did for the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Maratha</a> article: work on it on my portal and than present a ready page, so it can be debated in its entirety.

<p>Hi NRS!</p>
<p>I've seen Marathas being referred to as Indo-Scythians over the internet, MS Encarata says they are descendents of Sakas. Thats what the original article which was started by me, reflected. But Impu insists that Marathas are or Dravidian stock. Even though i'm a Maratha myself, i'm not knoledgeable since i've been born and broughtup in UK. Looking forward to you take on this.</p>

<dd>Hi <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAMbroodEY_dc79.html" title="User:AMbroodEY">अमेय आर्यन DaBroodey</a>, thanks for looking up on the Maratha origins issue. As far as I know, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Marathas</a> are of mixed descent, but majority of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Marathas</a> are of either <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythian.html" title="Scythian">Scythian</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a> descent. I know there are people of other descents like <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunnic.html" title="Hunnic">Hunnic</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidian.html" title="Dravidian">Dravidian</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sino.html" title="Sino">Sino</a> or even <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parthia.html" title="Parthia">Parthian</a> origin in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Maratha</a> community. But, that has not been too much researched into. But we all know that many <a href="../../../s/a/k/Saka.html" title="Saka">Saka</a> rituals have been absorbed into the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Maratha</a> culture. And we Marathas use the <a href="../../../s/a/k/Saka.html" title="Saka">Saka</a> calender as well. This is a fact. And as far as <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a> descent is concerned, com'on, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi.html" title="Marathi">Marathi</a> is an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Aryan_3705.html" title="Indo-Aryan">Indo-Aryan</a> language. Certainly, <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythians.html" title="Scythians">Scythians</a> did not start the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi.html" title="Marathi">Marathi</a> community, but they were an important factor in the origination of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Maratha</a> clan. The claim that <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Marathas</a> are <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidian.html" title="Dravidian">Dravidians</a> is a big joke. When <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi.html" title="Marathi">Marathi</a> itself is an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Aryan_3705.html" title="Indo-Aryan">Indo-Aryan</a> language, how can one say that Marathas are <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidian.html" title="Dravidian">Dravidian</a> ? Also, why should one feel bad about having <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythian.html" title="Scythian">Scythian</a> origins. The whole issue raised by ImpuMozhi is personal opinion and POV. I have observed the development of a few articles esp. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Maratha</a> and [{Scythia]] closely and I felt that ImpuMozhi and others of his ilk have been trying to disassociate the words <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythian.html" title="Scythian">Scythian</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a> from the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Maratha</a>. I don't know why. Perhaps, because ImpuMozhi seems to be a <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidian.html" title="Dravidian">Dravidian</a> (Just check his User Page, he calls himself a native speaker of <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil.html" title="Tamil">Tamil</a> or <a href="../../../t/e/l/Telugu.html" title="Telugu">Telugu</a> or some other Dravidian language I dont remember), he wants all the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Marathas</a> to be called <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidian.html" title="Dravidian">Dravidians</a> or indigeneous people (in his opinion). As far as I believe, it means that nobody is indigeneous. Does this mean that certain <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistanis</a> are foriegners in their own land, does this mean <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americans.html" title="Americans">Americans</a> are foriegners in their own land, does this mean <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mestizo.html" title="Mestizo">Mestizos</a> are foriegners in Mexico, does this mean <a href="../../../h/i/s/Hispanic.html" title="Hispanic">Hispanics</a> are foreigners in Latin America ???? This argument of being a foreigner is totally flawed. And especially when you're talking about migrations of people who roamed the world more that two millenia ago. Why even the <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidians.html" title="Dravidians">Dravidians</a> did migrate from somewhere. They were not just born onto the earth. And at a time when we all believe that all races did emanate from a single race, this proposition just doesn't hold. Isn't it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I know you'd started the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Maratha</a> article with traditional and historical accuracy. And I also know that some people have vandalised and corrupted it. And at a time when everyone knows that <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Marathas</a> are <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryans</a>, isn't it a regression that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> doesn't state this and instead makes us believe that <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Marathas</a> are <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidian.html" title="Dravidian">Dravidians</a> ?? I've nothing against "being of <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidian.html" title="Dravidian">Dravidian</a>". Why, even some of my own relatives or ansectors may be of <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidian.html" title="Dravidian">Dravidian</a> descent. But the whole question is about historical and cultural accuracy. Tell me, why aren't there as many <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dravidian.html" title="Dravidian">Dravidian</a> elements in <a href="../../../m/a/h/Maharashtrian.html" title="Maharashtrian">Maharashtrian</a> culture as there are <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythian.html" title="Scythian">Scythian</a> elements ? It's because, majority of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Marathas</a> are of <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythian.html" title="Scythian">Scythian</a> or <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a> origin.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But, I must say that I do not agree with the statement that "because the rajputs were scythians, the marathas must have been white huns". This is certainly a statement that would've hurt the nationalistic sentiments of all the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Marathas</a>. Well, even I am disappointed. Then what about the so-called nationalistic hawks. We don't need any James Tod to speculate on who we are, especially when it becomes, "who we are, we are, because we are not what others are or because others are what we are not".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Either way, the article on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Marathas</a> has been severely morphed with all the references to <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a> and <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythian.html" title="Scythian">Scythian</a> origins cleaned away. It has been done in a constitutional manner (as opposed to the vandals). We need to revamp and rewrite that article again. I guess you can work on it. I've given you the necessary information on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Maratha</a> origins, and also explained the perceptions and prejudices of certain minds. You do start the revamp soon. I will add any information that I have to the article.

Hi Ambroodey, thanx for leaving a message on my talkpage referring me to this discourse. Well, here is my two cents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nowhere and on no page have I said that the 'Marathas' are of the Dravidian race. Kindly point out where I have said so. Amazingly, this accounts for something like half the volume of criticism above.</li>
<li><i>"we all know that many <a href="../../../s/a/k/Saka.html" title="Saka">Saka</a> rituals have been absorbed into the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Maratha</a> culture"</i>
<dl>
<dd>This is a statement that cannot possibly be accepted just like that -- where did that come from? Even the <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythia.html" title="Scythia">Scythia</a> page is remarkably sparce on rituals and customs. I totally agree that little can be definately said about "people who roamed the world more that two millenia ago" and so we should not claim such cultural continuity.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><i>"we Marathas use the <a href="../../../s/a/k/Saka.html" title="Saka">Saka</a> calender as well. This is a fact."</i>
<dl>
<dd>Another definite fact, which you can confirm: The whole of <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andhra_Pradesh_0379.html" title="Andhra Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karnataka.html" title="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> use the "Saka calender". That is also the lunar calender used in <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_Nadu_d7a5.html" title="Tamil Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> and <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerala.html" title="Kerala">Kerala</a> for most religious purposes. The Saka calender is <i>not</i> used anywhere in north India or Gujarat (they use the Vikram samvat). So who-all are Scythian and who-all are not? And I have not even touched upon what the word "Saka" means in the context of this calender.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><i>"And as far as <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan.html" title="Aryan">Aryan</a> descent is concerned, com'on, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi.html" title="Marathi">Marathi</a> is an <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indo-Aryan_3705.html" title="Indo-Aryan">Indo-Aryan</a> language"</i>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed it is, and I have worded the sentence in the opening paragraph to say exactly that. Whether that also implies that <i>all</i> Marathi-speaking castes are of purely Aryan blood is at least disputable; consider that so many of us who are from India and have lived all our lives in India have already taken to English in a big way (within just 200 years, despite having <i>so much</i> excellence, cultivated over millenia, in our native languages and scripts).</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><i>"Certainly, <a href="../../../s/c/y/Scythians.html" title="Scythians">Scythians</a> did not start the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi.html" title="Marathi">Marathi</a> community, but they were an important factor in the origination of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Maratha</a> clan."</i>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry? I don't get it -- can you clarify?</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><i>"I know you'd started the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Maratha</a> article with traditional and historical accuracy. And I also know that some people have vandalised and corrupted it."</i>
<dl>
<dd>I wonder if Ambroodey agrees? Because I am largely responsible for giving that article its present shape, and Ambroodey was good enough to award me a Barnstar for the effort</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><i>"But, I must say that I do not agree with the statement that "because the rajputs were scythians, the marathas must have been white huns". This is certainly a statement that would've hurt the nationalistic sentiments of all the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Marathas</a>."</i>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for agreeing with me. Can you also let me know why the nationalistic sentiments of the Marathas would be hurt by calling them "White Huns" but the same sentiments are not hurt by calling them "Scythians"?</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><i>"We don't need any James Tod to speculate on who we are, especially when it becomes, "who we are, we are, because we are not what others are or because others are what we are not".</i>
<dl>
<dd><b>Bravo</b>! One hundred times Bravo! I am completely with you on that point, and I gather that you have read my comments on the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Talk%7EMaratha_fa68.html" title="Talk:Maratha">talk:Maratha</a> page to quite the same effect, although alas, my style of writing is nowhere near so pithy.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from these sentences, the rest of the critique largely concerns itself with my Dravidian background and my alleged interest in calling the Marathas Dravidian. My regards to both of you, <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpuMozhi_e030.html" title="User:ImpuMozhi">ImpuMozhi</a> 15:55, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Not at all -- I do not feel insulted in any way; far from it, this exchange is among the more decent 'identity disputes' on WP, from what I see. Also, <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Tod_2303.html" title="James Tod">James Tod</a> definitely does not assign the Marathas a Scythian origin; he seems to have developed a dislike for the Marathas, perhaps under the influence of his Rajput patrons.

<dd>Actually Amey, the 'Scythia' issue is a maratha issue only by adoption. The matter began with James Tod speculating (he himself is very clear that his ideas are only speculation) that the <b>rajputs</b> are of Scythian origin. In the late 19th / early 20th century (very recently in history), <b>some</b> Marathas, for various reasons, began to draw a connection between themselves and rajputs, claiming to be descended from important rajput dynasties. So the logic goes: if the rajputs are descended from Scythians, and marathas are descended from rajputs, then marathas are descended from Scythians. The Scythian-Rajput connection is itself tenuous; the rajput-maratha connection is totally a fabrication. As far as I know, <b>there is no scholarly book out there, written by a reputable author, which ascribes a Scythian origin to the Marathas</b>. <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpuMozhi_e030.html" title="User:ImpuMozhi">ImpuMozhi</a> 20:15, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Amey,</p>
<p>It's nice to know that Kolhapur-born Wikipedians have already done such good work. I've browsed a few articles related to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maratha.html" title="Maratha">Marathas</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">history</a>. There are a few discrepancies in some of the articles, which, being a history professor, I'd like to rectify. Glad to know you were born in Shivaji Peth. I am not originally from Kolhapur. I was born in Malvan. But I've now made Kolhapur my <i>karmabhoomi</i> after marrying a Kolhapuri girl. You can tell me which other articles you want me to work on. Bye for now.</p>

<p>Hi Broodey,</p>
<p>I reverted some of the vandalism but it wasn't from an anon IP. It seems you've been having a hard time of this not only from IP users but also three different registered users who I would suspect are sockpuppets because they seem to have been popping up as soon as another is blocked. The more-or-less standard procedure for vandals is to warn them four times (three at a pinch, if it's clear vandalism) and then block them. Non-admins can go to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> and list the vandal(s) and a reason, and an admin will come along and take a look.

<dd>P.S In retrospect i may have been too personal with you. I'm sorry for that. But you are obviously feeding subtle-POV, half-truths on purpose or you are putting in what you believe to be the truth. You must appreciate other side's POV, such unilateral editing defeats the purpose of Wikipedia.</dd>

<p>With all due respect, I am not "trolling Indian related" articles. Kashmir is a ongoing issue between Pakistan and India since 1947. Both Pakistan and India have their own perspective on history, disputes and solutions. I respect Indian posting their views on this dispute and hope that Pakistan's views will also be respected. I am not complaining about "Indians trolling Pakistan related" articles. Hopefully you will realise that both views have to be respected and presented in Wikipedia.</p>

<dd>From Pakistan's perspective there is a freedom struggle in Kashmir and from Indian perspective there is terrorism in Kashmir. That is the main reason for two articles. The South Asia is better geographical term than "Indian Subcontinent". There is "South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation" (SAARC) and it use South Asia. There is no corresponding geo-political term in the world. Brazil dominates South America but it is not called Brazilian sub-continent, or Russian sub-continent or Chinese sub-continent. It was a political term used during British colonial rule and is also favorite among some Indians. If you want to use that term then please also include a note that "Indian subcontinent" does not include Pakistan in any shape or form.</dd>

<p>You're absolutely correct, <i>Siddiqui has been a nightmare</i>!</p>
<p>By the way, you may be interested in a new category for Wikipedians that I've just created. It's unusual &amp; you may find it questionable. If so, feel free to ask me about it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Veej&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Veej&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">here</a> &amp; I'll try to explain my motives more clearly. Please have a look at it's description at Category:Wikipedians_censored_by_Islamist_editors. The category is for Wikipedians who feel that they have been censored/bullied by <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamists.html" title="Islamists">Islamists</a> on Wikipedia regarding valid/fair/worthy additions to articles. This is <b>NOT a political category</b>.</p>

<li>You’re right. That category was a foolish idea.
