<p>I'm reasonably familiar with the Ambisonics literature, but am not familiar with John Hayes' contribution. Could someone fill me in? Duane Cooper should probably be listed as an inventor well. My understanding is that Cooper, Fellgett, and Gerzon each independently came up with the idea of using spherical harmonics to represent the sound field.--AJH 21:54, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Duane Cooper was one of the developers of Nippon Columbia's UD-4 quad system. The UHJ system of coding Ambisonics relies on some aspects of his work and on work done by the BBC on Matrix H. The "U" ("Universal") in UHJ is apparently a reference to UD-4. I've added this to my contribution on UHJ on this page. John Hayes was at speaker manufacturer IMF, which released a very early decoder and was involved in aspects of the original Soundfield microphone. The company also released some very early 2-channel Ambisonic LPs. see <a href="http://imf-electronics.com/Ambisonic/index.html" class="external free" title="http://imf-electronics.com/Ambisonic/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://imf-electronics.com/Ambisonic/index.html</a> <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7ERelen_8fea.html" title="User:Relen">Richard E</a> 16:34, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Should John Hayes be listed as an inventor of ambisonics at all?

<dd>As he says, "We formed a team, myself, John Wright, David Brown, Prof. Felgett and Michael Gurzon <i>(sic)</i>. I remember spending many hours in the anacoic chamber working on the surround sound microphone..." then I would say, definitely, yes he should. However, one could reasonably ask that if Hayes is in, then Wright should also be in. I never knew David Brown, but essentially the above listed names constitute the original Ambisonic research group. I'll look at it. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7ERelen_8fea.html" title="User:Relen">Richard E</a> 15:08, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The difficulty is in deciding at what point the act of invention takes place. As Ambisonics can exist without reference to the Soundfield microphone, is working on the microphone part of the invention?

<dd>I think this is bound to be a bit arbitrary. I've now listed the complete original Ambisonic team, which did a good deal more than developing the SFM of course. The way I've written it slightly credits Gerzon with the original work (probably accurately) but only slightly. Fellgett has to come next, and after that you have the IMF guys who did all the original dev hardware and early production stuff (such as a decoder) before Calrec came on the scene and produced production gear. The "second wave" of researchers includes Geoff Barton, who came in via being at Reading under Fellgett, and I suppose some might consider me (and Pete Carbines and George Chkiantz, aka the "Ambisonic Mixing Group") as part of the second wave too - we were certainly doing mixing research, implementing Gerzon's original panpots etc, very early on. Geoff did originally get a credit in the main article but he may now only appear in the UHJ article. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7ERelen_8fea.html" title="User:Relen">Richard E</a> 15:28, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there - why is it ever impossible to decode G-Format to horizontal-only B-Format? Didn't want to change the page because I might be missing something, but... why? Cheers&#160;:-)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In two words, "shelf filters". The person creating the G-format can decide to apply shelf filters beforehand, and doing so will improve the listeners' experience. Unfortuately, shelf filters are not standardised, so how do you remove them to get back to B-format? (If they were standardised then it would be easy.) Martin.leese 04:55, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is possible to envisage a G-Format structure that allowed for height information, but one does not currently exist. G-Format is "defined" (if that's not too strong a term) as decoding a B-Format signal to a "conventional" surround array in the studio, and distributing the resulting speaker feeds via a conventional multichannel medium. While there are agreed standards for planar surround (5.1, 7.1, 10.2, whatever nonsense you want to come up with in the ultra-inefficient world of one channel:one speaker), there is not a standard for carrying height information in a conventional surround system. Several people and companies have suggested or used methods of doing this with conventional 5.1 layouts, primarily by reallocating arguably less-important (CF) or unnecessary (LFE) channels to carry height information: Chesky reallocates the 5.1 CF and LFE as a pair of elevated speakers halfway down the array; Telarc has used the LFE as an overhead. MDG and some others have used "2+2+2" which includes a height pair at the front (why the front? Don't ask me). While there is a special 2+2+2 flag in DVD-Audio (and thus presumably in other MLP-based systems on HD discs, ie TrueHD), there is <i>not</i> a "standard" for including height information. One might emerge in the context of HD disc formats and if so, one could decode 4-channel with-height B-Format to a G-Format that included height capability. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7ERelen_8fea.html" title="User:Relen">Richard E</a> 09:53, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And to finally answer the question: Were one to use a system like that described above <i>and</i> you didn't use shelf-filters in the decode (or you used shelf-filters that were in some way reversible - I have had mixed messages on this, some say you can do it, others that you can't - comments?), then you could recover periphonic B-format from full-sphere G-Format. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7ERelen_8fea.html" title="User:Relen">Richard E</a> 13:08, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The section below was written by me in answer to the question above. Martin has queried its necessity and is probably right. It's here in case anyone wants to review it and make any suggestions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is entirely possible to create G-Format recordings that include height information. However, while there are "standards" for conventional planar surround (5.1, 7.1 etc) there is currently no recognised standard for the inclusion of height. This being said, there are several techniques around, the most common taking one or two channels of the 5.1 signal (typically LFE, or CF &amp; LFE) and using them to drive elevated loudspeaker(s). It would be possible to decode an Ambisonic with-height recording to configurations like this and release the result as described.</p>

<p>Might it be worth updating the page a little to mention some of the software that's out there? The page reads as if all Ambisonics is done on valve amps. I'm pretty sure more Ambisonic encoding and decoding is done in software these days than any other way. I've about 40GB of B-Format and FMH material that's never been anywhere near a tape player, let alone a "traditional" "2-channel disc" (what's one of these?). The history is cool - perhaps we should reorganise the page a little so there's a "then" and "now" section?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have partially addresed this by adding a new section "Downloadable B-Format files". Martin.leese 08:14, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Also, it might be worth mentioning explicitly how Ambisonics differs from other surround sound techniques and some cases where famous musicians have used it (I've a feeling both Orbital and Pink Floyd have played with it, but that could be apocryphal).</p>
<dl>
<dd>A "traditional 2-channel disc" includes something like a Compact Disc, still the most popular music distribution format.&#160;:-) However the point is valid. I've been meaning to write up a section on plugins etc but have not had the chance yet.

This is because I maintain the Web page on which the FAQ sits.</p>
<p>The Ambisonic Surround Sound FAQ is a major resource for <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambisonics.html" title="Ambisonics">Ambisonics</a>; it should be, most of the people who <i>created</i> Ambisonics have contributed to it.

<p>I completely agree with Martin. Before I brought my Ambisonic.net site on-line, and to this day, Martin's FAQ makes a valuable central contribution to the documentation of this system.

<dd>Later. I question the value of including decoding equations at all. Different decoder designs -- there are at least three -- use different equations.

Martin.leese 05:56, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps we need a full section on decoding. Note that this equation was put in by me ages ago and is basically the simplest decode you can "get away" with. I should have been more explicit about that but I seem to remember that it was all done in a rush when I found the original Wikipedia Ambisonics entry - which at the time was not particularly good. I'm not sure why there is confusion about the terms in the equation, since it does say that
<blockquote>
<p>where N is the number of speakers, n is the speaker under consideration, k is a constant which can be between 1 and 2 and θn is the angle at which the speaker is located on the circle.</p>
</blockquote>
for the horizontal case and

<p>I was an enthusiastic Ambisonics supporter for almost two decades, and contributed a three-part article to <i>Audio Amateur</i> on the subject (which Peter Fellgett thought well of). I've also made my own B-format recordings, using both discrete mics and the <i>SoundField</i> mic.</p>
<p>Martin Leese has invested a huge amount of time in creating and maintaining the Ambisonic FAQ material. Making it available through Wikipedia would not only enhance Wikipedia with an article on one of the most important advances in sound recording and reproduction since Edison's phonograph, but it would make knowledge of this technology widely available.</p>
<p>Though Martin and I have mildly disagreed over a few philosophical points, I've found his FAQ material to be both correct and comprehensive. As Martin almost always knows what he's talking about, and has no financial interest in Ambisonics (that I'm aware of), I see no conflict of interest.</p>

<dd>Thank you for your kind words, William. The essence of Wikipedia is that articles are community efforts, so I would not wish to create the article. For good or bad, it must be a joint effort.

</dl>
<p>To my knowledge, <i>nobody</i> has any direct financial interest in Ambisonics these days with the exception of Dr Geoffrey Barton and his Trifield system (a 3-speaker stereo rendering system based on Ambisonics). Apart from this and the so-called "Vienna" decoder design for decoding to irregular arrays, virtually all Ambisonic IP is in the public domain.</p>
<p>My employers, Meridian Audio Ltd, include Ambisonic decoding in their surround processors but its presence or absence doesn't impact sales.</p>

<p>I deleted the following section:</p>
<p>==FMH-Format==</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FMH-Format is a "second order" format for Ambisonics, using nine channels rather than the four used by B-Format. Significantly more spatial information is captured in this format. At present, "real" recording techniques using this are in their infancy, however it is straightforward to compose synthetic recordings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no format called "FMH-format". The section seemed to describe second-order Ambisonics; this is still called "B-format", same as first-order. Also, higher-order systems are mentioned in the <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambisonics.html#Current_developments" title="Ambisonics">Ambisonics#Current developments</a> section.</p>
<p>Martin.leese 05:38, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Later. It now occurs to me that the poster may have been thinking of the Furse-Malham Higher Order Format. However, this is a set of coefficients for creating second-order B-format channels.

(The only reason we didn't go higher than third-order is because the number of channels is used to uniquely define the order, and after third-order ambiguities creep in. For fourth-order and above, a new file format will be needed.) Martin.leese 07:44, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Speaking as one of the originators of the term FMH, which does indeed stand for Furse-Malham Higher order format, this was (is) applied to the 2nd order format that Richard Furse and I derived back in '99 (see <a href="http://www.muse.demon.co.uk/3daudio.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.muse.demon.co.uk/3daudio.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). Its use is intended to indicate that weightings were applied to the channels such that all the coefficients have a maximum value of 1.0 (or minus 1). This makes them not quite kosher in mathematical terms but better in engineering terms. FMH in turn was a development ( read "fix") of the strange hybrid variant that appeared in my 1999 ICMC paper. Richard and I thrashed it out between the submission of my paper for publication and the actual conference so I was able to announce it as a correction at the conference. I, personally, am not particularly bothered if the term vanishes into obscurity but I thought you might like to know where it came from.</dd>
<dd>Although the published version was only 2nd order there was an implication that this normalisation to 1 (apart from W's 0.707) was to be continued to higher orders.--DGMatic 12:33, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ah, interesting. Now I look at the pages, I can see that the "FMH" term isn't particularly prominent, but it is used and does work - I've pieces by a few people in the format. It may be a bit obscure for presentation - I'll leave that with other folk! (Richard F)</dd>

<p>Obviously I was a little heavy handed, but I don't believe we want different names for B-Format at different orders. The whole business of higher orders is complicated enough as it is. The FM set <i><b>is</b></i> second-order as far as everyone is concerned. Any chance of the second-order pieces being made available on Ambisonic Bootlegs? I haven't checked all 75 pieces there, but suspect that they are all first-order. Martin.leese 02:36, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Also, should we be dictating the use of the Furse-Malham set in the <a href="http://www.ambisonicbootlegs.net/Members/mleese/file-format-for-b-format/" class="external text" title="http://www.ambisonicbootlegs.net/Members/mleese/file-format-for-b-format/" rel="nofollow">".amb" specifiation</a>. In a sense B-Format is an an abstract concept, but the ".amb" file format isn't; that's concrete. If I have understood things correctly, we would also have to define what to do with the W channel for the mixed-order cases (6, 8, and possibly 11 channels).

<p>Is not the following:</p>
<p>"The W channel is the general mono level of the signal, corresponding to left + right + front + back (+ up + down where present)."</p>
<p>more-or-less gibberish? It would surely be simpler to say "The W channel is a non-directional mono signal (as output by a perfect omnidirectional microphone)", and leave out the stuff about directions - which in any case could be taken to imply that W is different if Z is absent! Similarly, the X, Y, Z components could be additionally described as like the outputs of three perfect figure-of-8 microphones.</p>
<p>These changes would help relate the signals more directly to people's experience, and would form a basis for a mention of "native" B-format microphones such as the Halliday-Nimbus, if this was felt appropriate (I was surprised not to see one).</p>

<dd>I don't think it's gibberish (obviously - I wrote it!&#160;:-)) but I am happy if someone wants to rewrite it better - I'm trying to cover a lot of ground on this at present and I'm not focusing on all of it at the same time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The reason I added the sum and difference signal descriptions is that they are really important when it comes to understanding the relationship with stereo techniques based on the same principles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And yes, W is effectively different if Z is absent! You could have a 'native' mic that included a microphone that was only omnidirectional in the horizontal plane and had no vertical pickup at all, but this would not work if you needed height.</dd>

<p>I prefer your revised wording, though I'm still struggling to find any purpose to the description of the signals in terms of some undefined directional components. I guess you're building them up from a notional set of six cardioid mics, but why this is more useful than the other description escapes me! <a href="../../../p/w/h/User%7EPwhodges_f1aa.html" title="User:Pwhodges">Paul Hodges</a> 13:33, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, no, I'm building it from a notional set of three figure-8s and an omni! Perhaps I like the sum and difference description because the sum-and-difference-like-Blumlein was the original description of B-Format that I was given, I suspect by Gerzon (who also gave me a mathematical description but the sum-and-difference version is more use to recording engineers). It's aways struck me as simple, elegant and easy to understand. Anyway, it's there for people who find it useful, and now hopefully does not obscure alternative explanations that might be more useful to others. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7ERelen_8fea.html" title="User:Relen">Richard E</a> 13:47, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm surprised if recording engineers would find "front + back + left + right + up + down" a useful definition of omnidirectional and "front - back" a useful definition of figure-8, as these are terms they are already familiar with. But I'm sure you know more of them than I do. I can see possible value in relating the signals W+X and Y to M and S in an MS microphone setup; but this should perhaps not be right at the point of the initial definition of B-format. <a href="../../../p/w/h/User%7EPwhodges_f1aa.html" title="User:Pwhodges">Paul Hodges</a> 14:02, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>At the risk of circular reasoning, I would say that the average recording engineer is certainly aware of the nature of omni and figure-8 mics in practical terms: they will also be familiar with the idea that coincident stereo recording employs sum and difference signals. The "traditional" omni coincident with a left-facing figure-8 yields two signals, L+R and L-R respectively. Obviously, these are matrixed together to generate left and right channels by adding them in-phase: (L+R)+(L-R)=2L and out of phase: (L+R)-(L-R)=2R (I'm including these in case other readers don't know them). I believe the knowledge that B-Format works the same way in three dimensions and its implicit link back to Blumlein to be helpful. They may also know of the same technique formerly used in some broadcast recording systems to minimise the effects of tape azimuth variations. Meanwhile, to most recording (as opposed to audio) engineers, the concept of describing a soundfield in terms of spherical harmonics remains, I am sure, utterly alien. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7ERelen_8fea.html" title="User:Relen">Richard E</a> 14:40, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>While you were writing that, I've removed the part I think adds nothing, and added a separately headed sub-paragraph relating coincident techniques to B-format - I'm sure you'll say if you don't approve. My intention was to remove the complication of relating the B-format signals to the familiar ones from the "pure" description of them. <a href="../../../p/w/h/User%7EPwhodges_f1aa.html" title="User:Pwhodges">Paul Hodges</a> 14:45, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>No problem with the new section, but I really would like to retain the sum-and-difference description of B-Format. I've reinstated it in shortened form and in your new Coincident Stereo section (which I think adds useful information but does not cover the ground my description did previously). Hopefully you will not have any further difficulty with the inclusion of this information, especially as it is now separated from the initial introduction of B-Format. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7ERelen_8fea.html" title="User:Relen">Richard E</a> 14:51, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aha! I didn't know you were Manx! My apologies for any inadvertent incorrect assumptions. The use of English variants in Canada is very interesting. My wife is Canadian and a Commonwealth Lit professor so this comes up quite a lot. Many staff in Canadian universities are British and while there is obviously a popular cultural pressure for US English, both variants are well-known, acceptable and available to Canadians. So, for example, she and I just had a discussion about which pronounciation of "Renaissance" was "correct" in Canada: quite a lot of people use the US "REN-iss-aunce" but the English "Re-NAY-sonce" is perfectly acceptable. Many US English spelling variants were cooked up by Noah Webster, who travelled the US encouraging printers and publishers to spell words differently to the English way as a pro-Independence statement. In Canada you can avoid one sort of cultural imperialism - as long as you endorse the other.&#160;:-) I'll go a-hunting for the reference about using US English myself - when I saw you had Americanized the spelling I thought that you might have found a Wikipedia policy that suggested it (the English Wikipedia is hosted on US servers and run by a US corporation, after all) but instead I found the above. Having been a US resident for 12 years I am happy with and used to working in either medium: my policy when editing articles for international journals has always been to leave them in the variant in which they were written - we decided this at the Climate Action Network and it always seemed to work fine. In addition, languages have to grow and evolve and that means taking on board new usages, spellings and words.

<p>I am not sure what to do about the Decoding section. It was me who added the three sub-sections on the different decoder types. Obviously I hoped that somebody would complete the other two.

<p>However, I notice that when I now edit the whole thing, it gives me a warning about its length. I would suggest, therefore, that to limit the length we delete the existing equations and combine the three sub-sections into the main "Decoding" section.

Yes, only 2- and 2½-channel UHJ have ever been used practically; however 2-channel UHJ is of current interest due to at least one series of current record releases using 2-channel UHJ as a source of G-Format. It is not helpful, I would suggest, to remove the background to UHJ as a whole as it is necessary to understanding the context of the 2-channel variant which is in current use. In addition, there is valid content there which has been written: consigning it to the bin is a little demoralising for contributors (me in this case) who have put a lot of effort into it.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It would be possible to summarise UHJ and link to a new article containing the existing UHJ content, more or less as has been done with the Trifield material - I will have a look at that possibility. Indeed the entire article could be turned into a summary with separate pages taking the place of each section, with a bit of thought. See <a href="../../../s/u/m/Wikipedia%7ESummary_style_1b75.html" title="Wikipedia:Summary style">Wikipedia:Summary_style</a>. Note also that the 32KB nominal size-warning limit is designed to limit <i>readable content</i> to this length and is "no longer a binding rule". Markup (eg the tables and equations) can cause an article to exceed 32KB where the readable content in fact does not.

<dd>Pulled UHJ section into its own page and included summary and link at previous location. Anyone want to do this with the decode equations? <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7ERelen_8fea.html" title="User:Relen">Richard E</a> 13:13, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's exactly what I had in mind. I didn't mean to be demoralising - The UHJ section was excellent, and preserving it in a separate article seems a very good solution. <a href="../../../p/w/h/User%7EPwhodges_f1aa.html" title="User:Pwhodges">Paul Hodges</a> 13:24, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Inevitably, I have either published articles or material on <a href="http://www.ambisonic.net/" class="external text" title="http://www.ambisonic.net/" rel="nofollow">my site</a> (most, but not all of which have been published in dead-tree editions) that covers a lot of the practical side of Ambisonics. If anyone feels like linking specific items to my articles, either the original printed reference or the on-line version or both (<i><a href="http://www.ambisonic.net/ambimix.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ambisonic.net/ambimix.html" rel="nofollow">Ambisonic Mixing - An Introduction</a></i>, Studio Sound magazine, September 1983, pp??-??, is a good example, as is <i><a href="http://www.ambisonic.net/ambi_AM91.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ambisonic.net/ambi_AM91.html" rel="nofollow">Whatever Happened to Ambisonics?</a></i>, Audiomedia, November 1991, pp??-??), then please do feel free. I don't think it's something I can justifiably do myself, but if <i>you</i> do, please indulge yourself on my behalf.&#160;:-). <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7ERelen_8fea.html" title="User:Relen">Richard E</a> 14:56, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't see how anybody could object to you including references to articles in mainstream publications which you happen to have written. (I <i>can</i> see an objection to refs to websites, which is why I got clobbered.) On this point, I believe we need more references; Wikipedia is big on content being verifiable.

<dd>On this topic, I foresee a problem with a statement now on the <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambisonic_UHJ_format_e232.html" title="Ambisonic UHJ format">Ambisonic UHJ format</a> page. I will use Talk over there to discuss it. Martin.leese 23:23, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And talking of references, I have added some detail to the <a href="../../../n/i/m/Nimbus_Records_9db4.html" title="Nimbus Records">Nimbus Records</a> page. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7ERelen_8fea.html" title="User:Relen">Richard E</a> 15:01, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have taken the manual references and inserted them with 'ref' tags in the text to generate a list of references in the refs section. This can probably be done better and more precisely but at least I've started it. Please feel free to do this rather better than I have so far. <a href="../../../r/e/l/User%7ERelen_8fea.html" title="User:Relen">Richard E</a> 16:50, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
