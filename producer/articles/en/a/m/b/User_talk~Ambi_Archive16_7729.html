<p>I was curious which state's politics you were interested in, then I thought: you should add, or whichever state you're in. For one thing, you'll hear about meetups.

<dd>I'm already easily distracted enough, and I don't follow the details of NSW politics. I could give you my opinion on politicians... Arthur Chesterfield-Evans, Lee Rhiannon = very admirable. Scully = bastard. NPOV would be much harder.

<p>I suppose it's a little like the <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douglas_Corrigan_9e08.html" title="Douglas Corrigan">Douglas Corrigan</a> page on FAC here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Douglas_Corrigan" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Douglas_Corrigan" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> sometimes there is just not enough information about a figure to make a Featured article. I know this is not the answer you want, but I do feel a biography has to be just that not just a brief "What made her famous". Since the Corrigan page failed FAC <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> has dug about for ages and found all sorts of new stuff, and I think that page is almost there. I hope you can do the same. Perhaps others will not agree with me and the page will sail through.

<p>I'm not entirely sure, either, except that, at present, the article is short-ish for an FA, so perhaps a few contextual sentences as you go along would help. For example, in your note on my page, you gave me some sense of where the women's sport is in Australia. There may be a way of integrating that kind of material into the article without alienating readers who know the sport well. For example, "Even though netball is one of the most widely played sports in Australia, the players rarely reach the level of celebrity found in participants in other sports, and when, in 2001, Cynna Neele scored....." Something along those lines, so fans get a sense of, "Gosh, we should have paid more attention" and outsiders get information. Anyway, I'm not at all sure that this is helping, but I am trying to help.&#160;;-) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:45, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll re-read the article and see if I can think of more. However, one thing that does come to mind is placing her in the context of her sport as well. For example, is it usual for the players to be college students or unusual? If usual, you can work that into an introductory clause ("Like most of the national team players, Neele was a full-time student..."), and if unusual the same ("Unlike the other players on the team, Neele played while still a university student"). Then some context of the sport itself: putting her into great games, great achievements, and whether her work was surpassed quickly or slowly -- just stuff to explain what makes her special. I will, though, see if there is more I can suggest. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:56, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ambi, I was perusing the ArbCom elections pages and noticed you cited the lack of questions for <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_January_2006_Vote_Nandesuka_b654.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections January 2006/Vote/Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> as one of your reasons for your vote.

<dd>Perhaps I didn't make myself quite clear. As I stated in my questions section, I meant that we need to use topical bans at first. I think that in some cases it helps good editors calm down and focus on something else, but if that fails, then we need to use hard bans.</dd>

<dd>The problem is that using hard bans right away might make good editors go away as well, if they've been caught in an unfortunate dilemma. Also, it doesn't seem like many of the trouble makers were assigned to mentors or anything, which might help as well.</dd>

<p>Hi Ambi. When we were working up a frenzy with canberra Suburbs, i seem to recall that you expressed an interest in shopping centre articles. Could you please take a look at the latest discussion at Talk:Newcastle, new South Wales. There are a lot of mentions of shopping centres in the Newcastle article which probably don't belong there (IMO) but since the information is already there, it might be transferred to an articl about shopping centres in Newcastle or something. Could you please take a look and perhaps leave your comments if you have any ideas.

<p>Hi Ambi: When most people log on they are taken to the Main Page, and the ArbCom vote link should be on EVERY article, putting it on watchlists marginalizes it, and if you have a rule that users need to be active for a few months then their vote won't be registered regardless of what page they come from. At this stage it's more important to educate new users and the public about an important vote taking place within Wikipedia than to have the request for MONEY on every page which makes Wikipedia look greedy after they just raised around $300,000, don't you think? Get rid of the merchandising and commercializing junk and mention the ArbCom stuff that is more to the core of what Wikipedia is about, a participatory effort and not just a scheme to raise money. Some of us are having trouble writing and editing articles with that flashing "Dollar sign" on top of every page. I hope you understand the importance of this. It's about the kind of image Wikipedia wants to project about itself, and someone has made a bad decision here lately it seems to me. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 18:23, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

And the problem occurs for <a href="../../../m/e/m/Category%7EMembers_of_the_Western_Australian_Legislative_Assembly_31ed.html" title="Category:Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly">Category:Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly</a> versus article <a href="../../../m/e/m/Members_of_the_Western_Australian_Legislative_Assembly_7e96.html" title="Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly">Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly</a>, and the same for the Legislative Council category and article, and probably also for the other states.</p>
<p>My proposal for fixing this is</p>
<ol>
<li>rename articles Members of the Whatever to List of Members of the Whatever;</li>
<li>rename articles Members of the Whatever, 2000-2005 to List of Members of the Whatever, 2005-2005;</li>
<li>rename <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_parliaments_5194.html" title="Category:Australian parliaments">Category:Australian parliaments</a> to Category:Lists of Members of Australian Parliaments (Adam, there is a proposal to recycle <a href="../../../a/u/s/Category%7EAustralian_parliaments_5194.html" title="Category:Australian parliaments">Category:Australian parliaments</a> into a category that would hold <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Western_Australia_6b20.html" title="Parliament of Western Australia">Parliament of Western Australia</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_of_Queensland_ba97.html" title="Parliament of Queensland">Parliament of Queensland</a>, etc, under discussion at <a href="../../../a/d/z/User_talk%7EAdz_Parliaments_5466.html" title="User talk:Adz/Parliaments">User talk:Adz/Parliaments</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>I realise that Ambi has written a lot of Members of the Whatever articles and that it would take a while to fix it. If you are happy with this proposal, I am happy to do the work. Alternatively, are there any counterproposals?</p>
<p>Since I've posted this message on three talk pages, I'll post it on my talk page too, and I suggest we hold this discussion there.

But yeah I would certainly appreciate some relevant advice on what should be included in an article on an Australain electorate.

The fact is, the only reason those articles will not be deleted is because you all but accused me of being a troll, and Wikipedians on AfD are notoriously distractable by ad hominem attacks. Otherwise those would even now be well on their way to being absorbed back into the aether of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 03:45, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The only waste of time, apparently, is trying to make some sort of peace with you. I edit. You edit. We don't see eye to eye on the battery of Australian convict articles. We can disagree about these things without you accusing me of aspiring to waste your time. All that I'm asking is that you don't make this personal, but that seems to be chief among your goals. You don't know me, you've never worked with me, and yet you're willing to instantly tell me what my motives are. Such hostility is far more counter-productive than anything I've done tonight. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 04:10, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

While I did vote support a particular candidate with the comment "Because if he's elected, Arbcom will be destroyed", it is because the arbcom is such a disaster - it was a protest vote at its most basic, not a form of genuine support at all. And "someone who defends trolls and banned users all the time" is a bit weird, as I've never defended a banned user, and the only person who may be considered a troll for whom I have voiced my support is, for better or worse, deeceevoice. Indeed, I have taken issue with other admins in the past for unblocking certain users (specifically Linuxbeak's unblocking of Brandt, Marmot, etc...). If you were not talking about me, then I apologize and give you permission to hit me over the head as many times as you wish with a large, blunt object in the event we should ever meet. If you were talking about me, I only wish to set the record straight for both our benefits. I am not wishing to start anything, and come to you in good faith. Thank you for your time. --Jeffrey O.

<p>Could you please inform us at <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> where the ArbCom said something about allowing Neto to work on meta-templates, because I have been unable to find it?

<p>Ambi, I note that you have (twice) deleted <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Alexander_%28cartoonist%29_3a38.html" title="Patrick Alexander (cartoonist)">Patrick Alexander (cartoonist)</a> with the reason "per VFD consensus to delete".

<dd>No. Your close was so flagrantly out of process that I entirely justifiably re-deleted it. There was near-unanimous support for it being deleted (with only the author and one other person voting keep), most of those being entirely informed voters who agreed that it was indeed vanity. You then decided that you knew better than all of the Australians who voted (and thus decided that he "must" be notable when you had no idea) and attempted to override the very obvious consensus. There isn't even the slightest bit of grey area here. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 06:13, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Ambi. I am attempting to jusdge general opinion on the addition of 3D images to wikipedia.

<p>Thanks for uploading <b>Image:Candybroad.jpg</b>. The image page currently doesn't specify who created the image, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is therefore unclear. If you have not created the image yourself then you need to argue that we have the right to use the image on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the image yourself then you should also specify where you found it, i.e., in most cases link to the website where you got it, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the image also doesn't have a copyright tag then you must also add one. If you created/took the picture then you can use {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL_bb04.html" title="Template:GFDL">GFDL</a>}} to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. If you believe the image qualifies as fair use, please read <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a>, and then use a tag such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFairusein_19b9.html" title="Template:Fairusein">fairusein</a>|article name}} or one of the other tags listed at <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html#Fair_use" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use</a>. See <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_f6dd.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags">Wikipedia:Image copyright tags</a> for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.</p>

<p>Ambi, for what it is worth I am endorsing you as the candidate for the new <i>Coordinator</i> for the <b>Association of Members Advocates</b>. I have looked over the candidates and I think that you will do the best job as someone who is sensitive to the needs of members and aware of the difficulties faced by advocates; I hope you can help the organization grow and are not faced with the same frustrating apathy from members that I experienced on many occasions when I tried to suggest improving the roles and training of advocates. More than anything else this is something I felt was the most important priority for the usefulness of the group and something I see you understand as well. I do not think it is any coordinator's job to "supervise" advocates but to guide them gently if they need to be sent in a particular direction; I hope whomever becomes coordinator finds a way to acheive that purpose. If you need me to publish an endorsement statement somewhere else, (or wish to quote me during your campaign) let me know. Of course, if you wish not to use this endorsement in any way, that is fine too. Good luck and I hope you win. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex756_a868.html" title="User:Alex756">Alex756</a> 20:49, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ambi, what exactly is your problem with PROD, and why are you speedily deleting all articles marked as "prod"? That is <i>not</i> the intent of the proposal (nor is it anything resembling PWDS). Several articles have already been cleaned up or merged as a result of PROD. Please give us a chance to try this alternative, after all the comments from the Board and Jimbo that AFD is too negative for its own good. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 02:07, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>PROD is not inteded for borderline AFD candidates. PROD is intended for <i>obvious</i> deletion candidates that aren't speedies (which accounts for about 70% of AFD, and another 10% are obvious keeps). Controversial discussion goes on AFD, routine issues go on PROD. PROD also encourages people to merge/redirect/copyedit the page (as opposed to AFD, which specifically disallows merging/renaming, and encourages people to start lengthy debate rather than improve the article). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 02:13, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Anything speedily deletable is still speedily deletable, regardless of whether it's on PROD or not.

<li>So? The process gets speedily-deletable stuff deleted. If they weren't here, they'd be in <a href="../../../c/s/d/CAT%7ECSD_4339.html" title="CAT:CSD">CAT:CSD</a> with the same result. Speedy does not mean "now immediately", it means "without requiring further discussion". The process also gets articles improved, whereas AFD frequently doesn't (because it focuses people's energy on the debate instead). The point of Wikipedia is to improve articles, no? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 02:29, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Copied from my talk page.<br />
Ambi - Please don't use the word vandalism with me again - that's very rude! The full wiki policy does not refer to trivial topics it doesn't even use the word trivial it says <b>What not to link</b> <i>Subsidiary topics that result in redlinks <b>(links that go nowhere)</b>, such as the titles of book chapters and the songs on albums, <u>unless you're prepared to promptly turn those links into real ones yourself by writing the articles</u>. It's usually better to resist linking these items until you get around to writing an article on each one.</i> Subsidiary topics are secondary topics. Redlinks are clumsy, they read like a <b>wish list</b> and assume that people will choose the topic name that exists in Wiki space so that everything links together eventually. There is of course nothing wrong with linking to other topics it is one of the important facets of wiki, but the correct way to edit is as I suggested - ask someone to write the article in the discussion pages, or write it yourself and then link it back to the original article - promptly. It is not correct to create a redlink farm or to justify it's existenc. I am happy to discuss this further of course your point of view is valid but do not suggest that what I am doing is vandalism again please <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve">VirtualSteve</a> 03:49, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Wow - you must be right. That is an interesting method for removing things that aren't quite up to where you like them to be - chop the section out of previous development of consensus! How about you wait until after the policy is considered by others - after all that was your suggestion?<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve">VirtualSteve</a> 04:11, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There are 38 for the policy partially or totally as it stands and 17 against - taking partially or totally your view. Can you leave the edits on articles that I and others have been editing for some months alone now?<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve">VirtualSteve</a> 05:05, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ambi - I have put my views on the talk page at this stage I do not see yours. I respect your need to be assertive but you simply do not have consensus on style or links. Your debate on the issue of style and links and subsequent cutting out of whole sections, then your mass reversion and edit war appraoch, plus the threat of blocking is not appropriate. I note that you are receiving similar discourse in <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#Is_it_permissible_to_implement_the_guidance_in_the_Manual_of_Style.3F" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)#Is_it_permissible_to_implement_the_guidance_in_the_Manual_of_Style.3F</a> in the issue concerning <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobblewik_fbc0.html" title="User:Bobblewik">User:Bobblewik</a>. Some of your reversions today are in fact redlinks that I created in the first place - are you seriously suggesting that these redlinks can't be removed by me or anyone else? Please move on by being a part of wiki putting your point forward and then seeing what the consensus is before you threaten, mass revert, block etc. I will be happy to agree to the consensus but not to your threats and methods of editing as that really isn't productive. And is it appropriate for an administrator to make personal remarks - what is the 'creep' bit on your edits?<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve">VirtualSteve</a> 05:41, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Okay your the administrator you win - obviously today was the day you needed to cut out the previous redlink policy but you can put your gun away. I have my hands up. I do appreciate you clearing up the creep comment. I'll send you a quick little request everytime I want or need to remove a redlink if that's okay? Then when you say it's okay I'll do it but only then.

<dd>This is the very last time I am going to ask you - if you do not want to do answer say so. You appear to be making yourself out as an administrator and you do not have the right to cut large chunks out of pages that have a heading which says <b>This page is a style guide for Wikipedia. The consensus of many editors formed the conventions described here. Wikipedia articles should heed these rules. <u>Feel free to update this page as needed, but please use the discussion page to propose major changes</u>.</b> I do not mind being wrong but be very clear I am not attempting to, as you put it, mess up good articles. I am removing redlinks - proper live links that do not go to empty pages can be put in there when the time is right. Now I am not interested in your views on this debate any more. I have asked you now three times - you say you are an adminstrator - my intention is to lodge a formal complaint against your administration technique - Again my question to you is - What is that process? If you do not want to answer say so and I will add that to my complaint. If you are not an administrator then say so. Then I will lodge the complaint myself. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirtualSteve_38d8.html" title="User:VirtualSteve">VirtualSteve</a> 07:22, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, calm down. You might notice that it does <i>not</i> say "This is a static page. Discuss every minor change on the talk page." I chopped out a minor, little-used clause that was being misinterpreted and justified it, which is all one need do on Wikipedia. What you're proposing is indeed a major change, which is why it does need to be discussed. I know I can be terse at times, but Martyman's advice is probably wise to take. And for the record, I am an administrator, but this has nothing to do with anything, as everything I've done here can be done by anyone. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 07:28, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. The list of collaborations on the Community Portal is by far more complete. Yet both versions of the list were maintained independently, therefore creating differences in the lists. By combining them into a single list, the now complete list can be serviced from both locations. This shouldn't hurt the archiving, since the list was being archived doubly before anyways (the full list in Community Portal's history, and the half-list on Goings-on archive section. Now the archive for collaborations will be in the template's history, but we can provide permanent links to the various page versions at any archive location desired, such as at the end of the Going's-on page, if you like. --<a href="../../../g/o/_/User%7EGo_for_it%21_6ef5.html" title="User:Go for it!">Go for it!</a> 07:06, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
