<p>I'm new here. This seems like the place to discuss the article, but the previous discussion, what I see, is not a lot. I take it that the DMC logo question and answer is all there is.</p>
<p>Anyway, it bothers me that there are only a few sentences about what an ambigram is and then 30-some lines of links to corporate ambigram logos. It's a nice collection, very interesting to me, but is it on point? I do think the external links are useful (mine included!) because a subject that is so graphical in nature needs a lot of pictures to help explain it. The logo list, though, seems pretty low bandwidth, providing just one example ambigram per click. I'm not sure all those links really help someone understand quickly and easily what an ambigram is.</p>
<p>Druthers: I'd rather see definitions (or examples along the lines of that explain the differnet classes of ambigrams. (I'd provide the examples, but I don't do all classes. I only do rotationally symmetric ambigrams, and only dabble in a couple of other classes.)</p>

<dd>Welcome!</dd>
<dd>Perhaps a short section at the top describing the general properties of anagrams, and then a subsection for each type, with one picture (animation where needed) and more detailed description of it, and the processes involved in making it. And then at the end of each subsection we could have a list of logos that fall under that catagory (not line-wrapped, with external links only where appropriate (as in, clicking the link will immediately show you a page where an amibgram logo is visible)).</dd>
<dd>We could start by making a list of subsections (having "mirror" be the first, because it is the simplest and also because the wiki ambigram is somewhat appropriate for the top), and then fill them in. Maybe Robert Mailand could be persuated to contribute to the "How to do it" section of some of the more obscure ambigram classes.</dd>
<dd>I can think of at least one more ambigram type to add (not on Robert's list), the 3D ambigram, where a mass of shapes or lines in 3d appears as different words from different angles. This can be easy with just two or three words from 90 degree differences; the trick is to do it with only very slight rotations. I don't know of any examples that would work good in 2d, except maybe as complex animated gif. <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplarka_6b4f.html" title="User:Splarka">Splarka</a> 22:43, 10 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Personally I'd rather have links to logos that are ambigrams than pages of people making their own. It shows that they are more notable this way. A lot of the external sites with lots and lots of ambigrams are mostly rather poor ones, which show that if you squint really hard and read what the words under the image say you might see some text there that reads the same coming from another direction. I think we should have more examples on the page of the article, logos preferably. And that animated one really has to go, because it's incredibly annoying and demonstrates what should be obvious if you read the description. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 23:24, Apr 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm afraid that I disagree entirely. I believe that the whole spirit of an ambigram is a word that doesn't naturally fall into a symmetrical design. Most logos that are ambigrams have been drawn that way by the designer because the word is symmetrical (or almost) - this seems to me to be exactly the opposite of the definition by Douglas Hofstadter. I would like to see a major overhaul of the this page, including the removal of most of the logo links. I'd like to see a few of the external links removed too as there are some with low quality designs that do not illustrate the subject well. <a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEntirety_0166.html" title="User:Entirety">Entirety</a> 23:30, 11 Jul 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The logo list is once again growing. Too many of them do not illuminate the subject, do not contribute to undertstanding, being either just poor ambigrams or uncreative ones. Here are the ones I'd like to see gone, at a minimum: Opodo - just a name that is rotationally symmetric; xpedx - just a name that is rotationally symmetric; nuxnu - just a name that is rotationally symmetric; CIVIC - poor, it reads 'CIVID'. Does anyone feel strongly that they should be kept? --01101001 18:41, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that those are poor ones, but when they've all faced the chop the section will be very small. Is this section really necessary now that the entire article is much longer than it was intially? There aren't too many notable ambigram logos out there as a logo needs to be simple and easily readable (neither of which a typical ambigram is). In my opinion, the only truely notable ones are "Sun", "GEB" and "Angels &amp; Demons" (which isn't really a logo at all, it was a book cover that is no longer available). --<a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEntirety_0166.html" title="User:Entirety">Entirety</a> 01:32, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Trying to revert the vandalism (which removed all the external logos and links) I got a message informing me that one of the sites linked to ( www.01101001.com ) was banned. What to do? <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemo_c252.html" title="User:Demo">demo</a> 11:17, 2005 May 18 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi. 01101001, here. How did I -- or my site -- become banned? Did I do something wrong? How do I find out? Anything I can do about it?</p>
<p>Separately, I think, what is the vandalism about? From comparing versions, it seems like someone removed all the external links, and later Demo tried to replace them. It seems like they still aren't there in the current version, though the history tells me they are. If you can't tell, I am confused. Anyway, Demo, thanks for attempting a repair.</p>
<p>So is the vandalism linked in any way to my banning, or are they just coincidental? Anyone know? --01101001 09:31, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm guessing that the vandalism was coincidental, ant the banning of external sites doesn't effect existing pages. Pages are checked against the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/spam_blacklist" class="extiw" title="meta:spam_blacklist">meta:spam_blacklist</a> when they are saved. The spam blacklist includes <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regexp.html" title="Regexp">regexp</a> (#\.[0-9]+\.com(/|:|$) #domain is only numbers) to catch websites with only numbers in the domain, which seems to be why your site is banned. Check the blacklist talkpage which seems to include request for removal. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemo_c252.html" title="User:Demo">demo</a> 14:23, 2005 May 21 (UTC)</p>
<p>Overzealous spam-blacklisting's got to be it. I'll pursue whitelisting of www.01101001.com, or begging for a change to the regexp. Thanks. By the way, the current article looks good to me; the external links are back; I must have been looking at an old cached version of the current that didn't have the links. I'm relatively happy and much less confused.--01101001 20:33, 21 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>My opinion is that it must be the same word when rotated/flipped/mirrored, and that the life/death tatto is not an ambigram.</p>
<dl>
<dd>No, it doesn't have to be the same word. See many of the examples on the external links like Kim's or Langdon's; or just read the article. <i>"Douglas R. Hofstadter describes an ambigram as a "calligraphic design that manages to squeeze <b>two different readings</b> into the selfsame set of curves." ... The word spelled out from the alternative direction(s) <b>is often the same, but may be a different word</b> to the initially presented form. ... the spaces between the letters of one word form another word. ... "</i> See also the 3-D picture examples. I'll clarify the mirror section so it doesn't suggest that mirror ambigrams have to read the same both ways: I have one on the glass of my door which reads "Welcome" from outside and "Farewell" from inside&#160;:) <a href="http://www.toothycat.net/~hologram/random/FarewellWelcome.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.toothycat.net/~hologram/random/FarewellWelcome.png" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://www.toothycat.net/~hologram/random/WelcomeFarewell.png" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.toothycat.net/~hologram/random/WelcomeFarewell.png" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexChurchill_813e.html" title="User:AlexChurchill">AlexChurchill</a> 15:41, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Because of the amount of spam and poor links that have been added, I've been very harsh on removing external links unless they are discussed here first.

<dd>That is correct - no coincidence about it. However, I started editing the article quite a while after the first person linked to my site. I simply care deeply enough about the subject (I wrote most of it) to try to keep the article links as relevant as possible. Given that it is the second highest result in Google for "ambigram", I believe that it provides information (e.g. a tutorial and user gallery) that cannot be accessed elsewhere. If you believe that the site is non-notable then by all means remove it, but only do so with valid reason, not simply because it's my site.

<p>Because apparent gravity is less in space, it is difficult to tell whether one is "upside down". In fact, the concept of "upside down" is mostly useless in very low gravity. I believe it is for this reason that logos of space ventures (both fictional, such as <i><a href="../../../f/u/t/Futurama.html" title="Futurama">Futurama</a>'</i>s <a href="../../../d/2E/o/D.O.O.P._c6ac.html" title="D.O.O.P.">D.O.O.P.</a>, and real, such as <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="../../../g/o/e/GOES_1ceb.html" title="GOES">GOES</a>) are often rotational ambigrams. Has anyone heard this from a reliable source? -<span style="font: small-caps 14px times;"><b><a href="../../../s/w/i/User%7ESwitChar_b02e.html" title="User:SwitChar"><font color="#FF0000">Swi</font><font color="#000000">tch</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/w/i/User_talk%7ESwitChar_3e09.html" title="User talk:SwitChar"><font color="#005500">t</font></a></sup></b></span> 10:07, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I doubt there's any sort of link, but it's an interesting concept nonetheless. They just make good logos! --<a href="../../../e/n/t/User%7EEntirety_0166.html" title="User:Entirety">Entirety</a> 20:25, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
