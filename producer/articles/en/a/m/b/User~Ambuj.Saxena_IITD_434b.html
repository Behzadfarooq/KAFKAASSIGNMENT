	    <p>With the students, faculty and staff residing in side the campus, IIT Delhi is a residential campus. Since its inception the institute has place accent on providing an invigorating and creative environment, which promotes independent thinking and introspection. The students there by become aware of the consequences of their own actions. Through participation in various activities, the student extends his intellectual and aesthetic horizons far beyond the realm of the hostel and institute. The staff assisted by the students and faculty manages the hostels. Overall management of hostel is carried out according to the provisions of the Board for Hostel Management (BHM). BHM is one of the Boards constituted by the Students Affairs Council (SAC). SAC is a joint student-faculty senate committee, governed by its own constitution, which was approved by the senate of the institute.</p>
<p>BHM has its own constitution and it is responsible for policy formation and review of all matters relating management of the hostels. At the hostel level a House Working Committee (HWC), organizes and manages the hostel and is recognized by the BHM.</p>
<p>The quality of house depends on the abilities of members of HWC. The active members can change the quality of food and surroundings and overall living conditions of house. The amount of mess charges very much depends on the efforts of the mess secretary and committee. The Residents are requested to demand good quality of work from these elected members.</p>
<p>Another important input to the quality of life in the house is cooperation of the residents. The creative and intelligent resident can generate new ideas towards making the house a better place.</p>
<p>One of the fascinating features of IIT hostels is in house cybercafe called computer Room. At present there are seven Pentium PC’s which are on IIT LAN which itself is connected to high speed VSNL line. Every Araite will have special account to enjoy untiring computing. All the rooms have internet ports and students are encouraged to use their own PCs for unlimited surfing and computation. Activities leading to Cyber Crime are strictly prohibited at the IIT Campus. Students found involved in these activities will be punished severely leading to expulsion from hostel and institute.</p>
