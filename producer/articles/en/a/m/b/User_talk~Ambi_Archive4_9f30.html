Please change to the titles to ones that you are are more appropriate, if i have mislabelled them.

<p>Thank you!!! Finally, someone is willing to step up and do the right thing regarding this bozo. PLEASE block the range and let me know when you do. These things keep coming and well-meaning users aren't doing anything more than formatting them. No good contributions have ever come out of these ranges.

<p>Oh, this is wonderful! Months of this crap are coming to an end and I have you to thank for it.</p>
<p>I got the ranges on a "whois" search and posted them verbatim at User:B-Movie Bandit. I'm signing out for the night, but <i>please</i> let me know what happens. Ambi, I just cannot thank you enough! Best, Lucky 6.9 05:13, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Is it possible just to block each of the IPs within the Bandit's range and be done with it or can you just do a <i>de facto</i> block of the provider itself? I realize thats a tall order, but the darn things just keep coming in via the same IP. - Lucky 6.9 14:32, 31 Aug 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Ambi,</p>
<p>Thank you for your quick response to my previous posting, re: the pending orthogonal Request for Comments case.</p>
<p>I have posted a relevant statement I found from another "SysOp" by the name of James F., in the case file for the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_comment_orthogonal_03dd.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for comment/orthogonal">orthogonal Request for Comments</a>. I have also provided a brief analysis of the implications of this SysOp's statement for your consideration.</p>
<p>James F. appears to be a person of some importance around here, so I'm not sure if a pending Request for Comments case is worth imposing on his time for additional comment regarding his previous statement.</p>
<p>If I may ask, how long does the Request for Comments stay in a pending state before it is summarily rejected for lack of certification?</p>
<p>My initial search for an answer to this question came up empty, so if you would be so gracious as to provide a link to where I could read the policy on how long pending Request for Comment cases are allowed to sit pending, I would be most grateful, as I am eager to see a rapid resolution of this matter.</p>
<p>(I believe it should be a basic right for the accused to have a speedy ruling, to avoid the stigma of a pending case permanently attaching itself to the accused, regardless of guilt or innocence.)</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>

<dl>
<dd>Ambi, thank you for your patience and valuable time in this matter. I know we would all rather be editing or creating articles than spending time on this matter, but there is a fundamental principle of fairness at stake here that justifies some additional effort to reach a consensus.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I found a statement by another SysOp named "Angela", who has stated flatout on her own user talk page that an IRC dispute is "...a dispute that has nothing to do with Wikipedia (Wikipedia is not IRC)".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Upon further review, I also noticed that the user "Fennec" was only participating in Snowspinners Request for Comments on the basis of incidents on IRC.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This combined with James F's statement that IRC is "beyond the scope of the Arbitration Committee" leads me to think that the IRC issue is irrelevant.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, the certification of Snowspinner's Request for Comments is in dispute.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the case that Snowspinner is trying to build against orthogonal can not be made without any mention of IRC, there really is a basic question of fairness to the entire proceeding.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I understand your disdain for "procedural squabbling", and your eagerness to focus on the facts of the case, but in this case, there is a serious procedural issue that threatens to taint this entire proceeding and make it fundamentally unfair to orthogonal.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I argue this point because I would not want to be in orthogonal's shoes when the odds of receiving a fair hearing were stacked against me in such a way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is not a fine point or a technicality - there must be fairness in the conduct of the proceeding before the merits of any case can be neutrally considered.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I would appreciate any additional thoughts you might have on this matter.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Respectfully,</dd>

<p>Ambi, you are terrific. I'm currently at odds with another user who seems to think these stubs are sacrosanct, but he doesn't do more than format them. I owe you a bunch o'Barnstars! - Lucky 6.9 00:19, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ambi, I need your help with something. I was responding to your first note on my talk page when you edited over it with your note that's currently there. I have this long-standing -- call it a fetish for lack of a better name -- about not removing anything from my talk page, in the interests of openness and transparency.</p>
<p>I've made note of this in the header to my talk page for about 10 months: "The dialogues are preserved as written (except where repliers have interpolated their responses); not one word has been altered or omitted by orthogonal and [elide out-of-date date] orthogonal knows of no alterations by others (other than the aforementioned reply interpolation)."</p>
<p>So I'm in a quandary: if I leave your original comment edited over, I can't make this guarantee anymore. On the other hand, if I replace your comment, I may be mis-representing your intent.</p>
<p>My own practice is to note make any edits, even to correct typos, if another edit has since been made. You followed this, as I was still working on my response when you entered your new note, but now I have a response to something that's no longer there.</p>
<p>My first though was to replace your original comment, and in square braces explain what had happened, and then respond only to your second comment. But then I realized that might offend you, or seem as if I was saying "aha! here's what Ambi originally said and see how she changed it".</p>
<p>I'm probably wasting more sweat on this than is warranted, but I've never edited <i>anything</i> on my talk page except to archive it, and I'm always archived in strict chronological order.</p>
<p>Please advise. Thanks. <a href="../../../o/r/t/User%7EOrthogonal_2fa0.html" title="User:Orthogonal">-- orthogonal</a> 09:58, 1 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>You made some accusations on <a href="../../../s/t/y/User_talk%7EStyle_a632.html" title="User talk:Style">my talk page</a> about my changes to this page, namely that I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abused wikipedia revert policy. I didn't, I followed it. You abused policy by not summarizing your reverts.</li>
<li>Am biased. Yet, I'm trying to add some balance to an incredibly biased page, and you are doing your best to stop me. You are the one with bias.</li>
<li>Use "Weasel words". You don't even understand this one; no weasel words were used at all. A simple, accurate term was used (militant).</li>
<li>Marked my changes as minor. This is a flat-out lie, as you can clearly see from the history. Besides, all your changes are marked as minor, so you are even more guilty of this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Justify the slander on my talk page, or I'm going to delete it. Furthermore, my attempt at adding balance to the page is, predictably, being reverted. Your lack of interest in the extreme bias against the Palestinian POV shows your own bias on this issue. --<a href="../../../s/t/y/User%7EStyle_c7dc.html" title="User:Style">style</a> 22:30, 2004 Sep 2 (UTC)</p>
<p>You just don't get it, do you? "Militant" is not a weasel word any more than "soldier" or "policeman" is. All three are just as capable of committing terrorism, yet describing any of them entirely as "terrorists" is imprecise, uninformative and judgemental and not worthy of a news agency (as Reuters realizes), let alone an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>BTW, I'm not "having a go"; this is my response to a personal attack on my talk page. If you can't take it, don't dish it out.</p>
<p>You claim my change was "controversial". However, the only person who has raised objection to it is <i>you</i>.</p>
<p>The page in question is disgustingly biased, pointless and often racist. This is obvious to anyone with a degree of neutrality. I don't have a pro-Palestinian POV; I have an informed neutral POV. If that strikes you as pro-Palestinian, it reveals your own bias. Your support for the page and it's original wording shows a lack of any integrity, perspective, insight and understanding of the real situation in Israel/Palestine. --<a href="../../../s/t/y/User%7EStyle_c7dc.html" title="User:Style">style</a> 08:04, 2004 Sep 3 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was just doing the late-night wiki rounds before hitting the sack (I'm at UTC minus 7) when I thought I'd look at the Bandit page. Saw your note...and let out a yell of pure joy. By all means, <i>please</i> block the Bandit's range. Even Jimbo Wales agrees the stubs are just useless. Blocking the B-Movie Bandit for good after all these months will greatly add to my enjoyment of this site. I'm certain it will for others as well. THANK YOU for your courage and conviction. I simply cannot express how grateful I am to see someone step up and do the right thing. Good night! All my best, Lucky 6.9 08:15, 5 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

Someone reverted a speedy deletion notice with the excuse that it wasn't eligible for a speedy.

<p>I am again in your debt. I'm on Earthlink if that helps. As far as this latest "contribution" is concerned, we now have a slightly expanded and wikied substub that tells absolutely nothing about the movie. I'm about to go really militant on these by reverting them to the original posting and then putting on the notices.

<p>Noticed what you did with <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Playford_cad9.html" title="Thomas Playford">Thomas Playford</a> IV. I went with "Sir Thomas" to differentuate him from the three other Thomas Playford's mentioned in the article, at least one of whom (his grandfather, Thomas Playford II) is due for an article himself. Indeed, as Thomas Playford I started his own breakaway church, he may be worthy for an article himself (and whether Thomas Playford's V &amp; VI become famous enough in the life of Wikipedia to deserve articles may also need to be considered). To make a long and tedious story short, would perhaps calling Sir Thomas "Thomas Playford IV" be the ideal option under these circumstances or would that be as confusing as keeping him as "Thomas Playford"? --<a href="../../../r/o/i/User%7ERoisterer_ae8b.html" title="User:Roisterer">Roisterer</a> 21:54, 7 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your welcome. I have a user id (Ruszewski) but sometimes forget to login.</p>
<p>I worked for Bougainville Copper in Paguna for 3 1-2 years back in the 1970s, hence my interest in the area.</p>
<p>As you are an admin perhaps you could advise me on this problem with categories: In the ARTICLE "Queensland" there is a reference to "List of Queenslanders" which has about 42 names on it; but in the CATEGORY "Queensland" the List is not mentioned but there is a reference to "Queenslanders" which has only 1 name in it (Peter Beattie) plus a sub category "Queensland Politicians" which also has only 1 name (Joh Bjelke-Petersen). This is not an isolated problem: in "Australia" there are separate lists of "Mountains IN Australia" and "Mountains OF Australia" with different entries and no reference from one to the other. I suspect it is a general problem throughout the encyclopedia. The whole field of CATEGORIES needs supervision, but for the immediate problem how to fix the Queensland entries? If this is not your concern could you tell me who to consult to try to get it fixed.</p>

I hope also that the current reappearance of this botTroll - or whatever it/he/she is - can be dealt with so as to not unnecessarily discourage other contributors feeling the heat from our most unwelcome guest. I am not a Wikipedia expert by any means, but losing good contributors to forces of evil like this one is so disheartening. There just has to be a way to deal with it.

<p>I don't know whether you still have much interest in the Rex071404 arbitration. The committee is now considering the following as one of its proposed findings of fact: "The compaining witnesses in this matter, because of their numerical majority, felt that Rex071404 did not represent a point of view which had a magnitude of importance equal to theirs, despite its societal significance." I got pretty cheesed off at this. The short of it is that we're being unjustly criticized, without even being told that there was a complaint against us. The long of it is <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Rex071404_Proposed_decision_42f3.html#Objection_to_proposed_finding_of_fact_about_the_complaining_witnesses" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Rex071404/Proposed decision">here</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Rex071404_Evidence_c503.html#Evidence_against_one_version_of_item_5_in_.22Proposed_findings_of_fact.22" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Rex071404/Evidence">here</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Rex071404_Evidence_c503.html#Rex071404_replies_to_JML.27s_.235_concerns_.28above.29" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Rex071404/Evidence">here</a>. It's produced a pretty typical exchange between Rex on one side and Gamaliel and me on the other. I mention all this only because the ArbCom is considering a proposed finding that, IMO, reflects badly on you, so I thought you ought to know about it in case you want to get involved. If you have more will power than I do and can resist the temptation to keep wasting time on this stuff, more power to you! <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 08:42, 13 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your note. I was very glad to see what you wrote to the ArbCom. I can understand it if they don't want to imply that <i>all</i> the blame was on one side, but it does seem to me that the effort to appear even-handed is leading them to be too harsh with the people who've complained about Rex. I hope your comment will help them realize how this proposed finding looks from our perspective. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> 10:29, 13 Sep 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Great idea about the Oz noticeboard, let's hope it catches on. As for the AFL, there's some POV floating around, and a general lack of info, so I was going to make it my next project. I was planning on creating articles for the current players (well at least for <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collingwood_Football_Club_b05a.html" title="Collingwood Football Club">Collingwood</a>&#160;:P), and was also wondering whether it was worth creating articles for each of the seasons, e.g. AFL season 2004, AFL season 2003, with stats, the ladder, the GF outcome, as an extension of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Australian_Football_League_premiers_4c34.html" title="List of Australian Football League premiers">List of Australian Football League premiers</a>; though it'd be a <i>hell</i> of a lot of work.

<p>Ambi - glad you like the Breaker piece. But I've just noticed that there's a large chunk missing from the end of the Morant article -- I'll try and retrieve that later today.</p>
<p>re: my editorial position -- I've hopefully not presented Morant as an unequivocal 'hero' and have taken care to state that he was probably guilty of some crimes, but I do agree with the prevailaing pro-Morant view that he was 'scapregoated' by the British as a means of appeasing the Boers and covering up Kitchener's responsibility for the 'no-prisoners' decree. So shoot me!&#160;:P Anyway, if you want to create a more balanced feel that's fine by me.

<p>Ambi,</p>
<p>Please don't modify the page for Occulapation of Palestine. I've called a time-out. I'm a admin in good standing, no personal involvement with the page.

<p>After you posted this on my talk page:</p>
<dl>
<dd>As I said on the talk page, I strongly disapprove of the way you've handled this. Firstly, your presence certainly wasn't requested. Secondly, the message you posted on the page itself (Since this page is being mistreated by a bunch of people) verges on a personal attack. Thirdly, you have no right to jump in and start telling the parties what they may or may not do.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Once again - you had no right to go in, slap an insulting message on the page, preserve a page that lost a VFD vote, call an "edit truce" (after one revert), and then start playing the role of arbitrator. The one reason I'm not reverting that again is out of respect to Ed, because he's been so conciliatory. I appreciate that it may have been in good faith, but if you're seriously interested in helping with disputes, I suggest you take a leaf out of Ed (the master mediator)'s book and look at his handling of past disputes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Ambi,</p>
<p>First, I bear no ill-will against you or anyone else. I just want all of use to get along. My presence was requested. A call for an admin was made in the mailing list. I came.</p>
<p>I tried to make the message as simple as possible so people understood what was going on. I did not make any attack on any individual.</p>
<p>I do have a right to ask people kindly to do something. I never gave orders. I just asked people not to.</p>
<p>I've been with wikipedia seveeral years and I have been quite involved in many disputes and resolutions. I usually work behind the scenes with personal emails.</p>
<p>I would like to remind you that I was acting as a mediator, as outlined under the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution</a> dispute resolution guidelines.</p>
<p>In any case. I appreciate the work you have done in this area. Take care not to become overburdened. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Mahan_d78e.html" title="User:Christopher Mahan">Christopher Mahan</a> 06:33, 26 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am going to expand it. Have you seen how many links I created to the page today?
