<p>Hi! I notice you've added a BGGID parameter to {{<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_Game_11f8.html" title="Template:Infobox Game">Infobox Game</a>}}. I'm uneasy about this for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a duplication of effort, given the {{<a href="../../../b/g/g/Template%7EBgg_f20c.html" title="Template:Bgg">bgg</a>}} family of templates.</li>
<li>It's inflexible; many games have different BGG IDs for the different editions, and some articles cover families of games rather than the games themselves.</li>
<li>There are a few wikipedians who regard BGG links as linkspam - see <a href="../../../c/o/u/Wikipedia_talk%7ECounter_Vandalism_Unit_Archive_3_8162.html#HELP.21" title="Wikipedia talk:Counter Vandalism Unit/Archive 3">Wikipedia talk:Counter Vandalism Unit/Archive 3#HELP!</a>. I'm not one of them, and I for the moment the consensus is against them, but promoting the BGG links outside the external link section might fuel their arguments.</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't reverted your edits; instead I've matched the style against the equivalent IMDB ID section from {{<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_film_b504.html" title="Template:Infobox film">Infobox film</a>}}, whose existence is probably the best argument in favour of the parameter. But, given I'm among the most pro-bgglink wikipedians and I'm uneasy about it, I think it's probably best to discuss this on <a href="../../../i/n/f/Template_talk%7EInfobox_Game_2f33.html#bggid" title="Template talk:Infobox Game">the template's talk page</a>.

<dd>Your changes make sense. I like the idea of matching the style with the equivalent IMDB ID section from {{<a href="../../../i/n/f/Template%7EInfobox_film_b504.html" title="Template:Infobox film">Infobox film</a>}}. I personally don't buy any of the arguments against it, and even if they had merit, I'd counter that the usefulness of providing the link outweights the objections. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbientArchitecture_e2b2.html" title="User:AmbientArchitecture">AmbientArchitecture</a> 13:11, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What's the reasoning behind the 'sup' change, whatever that is? This again seems to radically decrease usefuless. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbientArchitecture_e2b2.html" title="User:AmbientArchitecture">AmbientArchitecture</a> 14:31, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Now what you did originally -- and your arguments about "inflexibility" and "duplication" -- makes more sense to me. It's not really a different mode of use, but different functionality altogether. What your doing is more akin to citations or a jump to a list of references, while what I was trying to do was simply to provide the BGG ID for the game specified in the title of the article, along with a like to the corresponding article on BGG as a convenience. You should continue to evolve the latter as you wish (as <tt>bggxrefs</tt>), I've reinstated the former (as <tt>bggid</tt>) as I originally intended it. I've also reduced the importance of both by making them smaller and putting them at the end with <tt>footnotes</tt>, which seems more in keeping with some of the issues you brought up initially. (See <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carcassonne_%28board_game%29.html" title="Carcassonne (board game)">Carcassonne</a> for an example of both in use.) <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbientArchitecture_e2b2.html" title="User:AmbientArchitecture">AmbientArchitecture</a> 17:51, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there. I'm the author of the article <a href="../../../c/a/y/Caylus_%28game%29.html" title="Caylus (game)">Caylus</a>. Why did you change all occurrences of Ẏstari Games to Ÿstari Games?

<dd>It's a compromise: Y with <a href="../../../d/o/t/Dot_%28diacritic%29.html" title="Dot (diacritic)">dot above</a> appears as a box in most browsers.

<dd>On second thought, we could also use {{unicode|Ẏ}} (<span class="Unicode">Ẏ</span>) to force Internet Explorer to use the correct font.

<dd>OK. I created {{Ystari}} which emits {{Unicode|Ẏ}}stari Games when called with no parameters, and {{Unicode|[[Ẏstari Games]]}} when called with any parameters.

<p>Sorry, I should have left an explanation on the discussion page. I just thought it made the infobox more readable to have footnotes left-aligned rather than a center-aligned.

<p>Fair point about distinguishing between pigs, builders and others, but this is an encyclopaedia article rather than a ruleset - it's of no real use as a means to resolve obscure ruleset disputes, so any careful avoidance of "follower" seems misplaced. I think it's reasonable to sacrifice some logistical clarity in order to keep the article in line with the game's official wording, and to maintain an encyclopaedic tone. (It feels a bit like opening an article about mosquitoes by saying that they're colloquially known as "mozzies", and then going on to refer to them as that throughout.) --<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcGeddon_9720.html" title="User:McGeddon">McGeddon</a> 03:38, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Meeple <i>is</i> a colloquialism - if the rules never use it, then it should be easy enough to write an encyclopaedic article that doesn't use it either. And it looks like we're getting there if we only really need to use the word once, outside of quote marks. I've only played Builders and Traders a couple of times, so don't really know the game well enough to make any bold edits, but how about changing "placing player's meeple" to "basic follower of the placing player"? --<a href="../../../m/c/g/User%7EMcGeddon_9720.html" title="User:McGeddon">McGeddon</a> 05:36, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Try thinking of it this way: if the game rules refer to the peice as a "follower", then somebody who hadn't played any of the expansions would be confused by the wored "meeple" appearing in its place. Also, if they are indeed different only in the rules and are physically the same piece, wouldn't it be easier to avoid this whole conflict and add a footnote stating that "The followers are often referred to as "meeples" because of minor rule differences between expansions."? <a href="../../../a/h/u/User%7EAhudson_d3d7.html" title="User:Ahudson">Ahudson</a> 18:23, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure the policy you cite applies. I simply asked an informed community to contribute to a discussion that was clearly uninformed. I have no stake in this other than improving the quality of Wikipedia and my purpose was simply to engage a group that has relevant information. My purpose was not "to stir up debate, in order to attract users with likely known views and bias" but simply to encourage people with relevant and informed views to have a say. The question at hand is, after all, "what do people call these games" -- this seemed a pretty straightforward way to answer that question. If it is truly Wikipedia policy to prohibit such discussions, then, I will certainly post a message on <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/115813" class="external text" title="http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/115813" rel="nofollow">the thread</a> on BoardGameGeek asking users there to withdraw their posts. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbientArchitecture_e2b2.html" title="User:AmbientArchitecture">AmbientArchitecture</a> 14:35, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's my belief that it is - note that the policy states "It is considered <i>highly inappropriate or unacceptable</i> to externally advertise Wikipedia articles that are being debated, <b>or</b> where..."; your intentions are not at issue - buty all means seek <a href="../../../t/h/i/Wikipedia%7EThird_opinion_ae73.html" title="Wikipedia:Third opinion">another opinion</a>. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPercy_Snoodle_b005.html" title="User:Percy Snoodle">Percy Snoodle</a> 15:04, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However I agree the "hurry up and stop them" does kind of make your case a bit of a challenge. (Sorry.)

<dd>No need to apologize. My post was indeed provocative; but its intent was to get knowledgeable people involved, not to influence the outcome (there's no way to do that on BGG, as both the contributions here and the thread you cite demonstrate). If my intent had truly been to violate the rules that <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPercy_Snoodle_b005.html" title="User:Percy Snoodle">Percy</a> cites, posting on BGG would have been one of the last things I'd have tried! <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbientArchitecture_e2b2.html" title="User:AmbientArchitecture">AmbientArchitecture</a> 14:27, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello; I am writing to offer a <a href="../../../3/o/_/WP%7E3O_1830.html" title="WP:3O">third opinion</a> on this matter. To the best of my recollection I have never previously conversed with either Percy Snoodle or AmbientArchitecture.</p>
<p>Advertising a Wikipedia debate <i>is</i> highly inappropriate (and sometimes unacceptable), regardless of the intended crowd the advertisement is meant to draw.</p>
<p>Had the original post read something to the effect of "this discussion is in need of informed opinion from both sides of the issue", then this matter would likely be a non-issue. However, the "hurry and stop them" post was quite inappropriate, and a violation of <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a>.</p>
<p>AmbientArchitecture: I believe it would be appropriate, as you offered initially, to write a follow-up post indicating something to the effect that your initial post was in error and that if anyone wishes to contribute anything further to the debate, he/she should be fully aware of Wikipedia guidelines and policy <i>first</i>. If you are willing to do this, I feel that no further action needs to be taken in this matter. --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:02, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Done: I've amended the original post, so that readers see the warning from the start. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbientArchitecture_e2b2.html" title="User:AmbientArchitecture">AmbientArchitecture</a> 21:45, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
