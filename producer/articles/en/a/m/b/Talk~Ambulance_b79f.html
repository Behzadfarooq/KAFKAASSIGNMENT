<p>Anyone that can write something about why the text "Ambulance" is mirroredreversed on front of ambulance vehicles?</p>
<dl>
<dd>So when viewed in a rear-view mirror, it will appear as it does normally.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While reading "Ambulance" in the rear-view mirror may not provide any useful information to the public (as the lights and sirens should be enough to get them to pull over), the label is useful to commanders of large scale incidents. While sitting in a command vehicle attempting to coordinate incoming units, being able to quickly identify the ambulance is useful to quickly direct it to the patient.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know; I have to go with the first answer here because officers will not necessarily be sitting in a command vehicle. For smaller scenes, command officers will be fulfilling multiple duties (somtimes including patient care) and will frequently not have the luxury of waiting in a vehicle. Further, there is no gaurantee the the ambulance will approach the scene from behind the command vehicle. At larger scenes, the liklihood of a staging officer spending a lot of time in a vehicle and using her mirrors to identify incoming units is pretty remote. She's going to be out on her feet, directing traffic, collecting and coordinating information, etc. Apart from everything else, working with all of the organizational paperwork of a large scene is difficult to do in the front seat of a vehicle (and again, her vehicle is not gauranteed to be facing the same direction as any incoming units). Finally, the staging officer will likely want to know whether the incoming ambulance is ALS or BLS (where both service levels exist, which admittedly is not everywhere); merely knowing that a unit is an ambulance doesn't provide her with enough information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But, given your point about the lights and sirens being enough to make people pull over, why do ambulances wear a backwards label on their front ends? Many drivers are not very observant, and fail to notice an emergency vehicle until it is close behind them. Once an ambulance is close behind another vehicle, the driver of that leading vehicle may not be able to see the ambulance's flashing lights (or hear the siren, if the leading vehicle is well insulated, the radio is on, the heater is blowing at full blast, etc). Seeing "ambulance" in the rear-view mirror - written forward, when everything in the mirror is expected to be backward, can make an impression on that driver, prompting him to let the ambulance by. Or then again, maybe not; some people pull over, others simply refuse to do so. &lt;sigh&gt;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A question I don't have the answer to is <i>why do ambulances have a backwards label on their front ends, but other emergency vehicles don't?</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And, I think it should be pointed out that while I know that the USA places this label on thier ambulances, not everyone does.</dd>

<dd>I've seen a fire engine with "fire" mirrored on TV once, but more common on ambulances here in Denmark too. Maybe it's concidered the most important vehicle?</dd>
<dd>Also many "civil" vans use the trick - i.e. craftsmen and other company vehicles high enough to be seen thru a rear view mirror <a href="../../../g/%C2%AE/i/User%7EG%C2%AEiffen_9496.html" title="User:G®iffen">G®iffen</a> 19:39, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I came across this article while doing an NPOV-check. An anon IP had blanked the graf about the Israeli armoured ambulance. Since that is likely the cause of the NPOV tag, I restored that graf. I also corrected the NPOV tag... since the dispute is likely related only to that section, I changed the tag to {{SectNPOV}}, which is the correct tag in this case. <a href="../../../f/e/c/User%7EFeco_e36a.html" title="User:Feco">Feco</a> 19:35, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I am highjacking this item to say that I found an NPOV section tag on the "private ambulance company" section. I think it should have been an accuracy tag, and perhaps a last-person-to-edit-doesn't-speak-English-very-well tag. As ambulance services are something that I happen to know a fair bit about (in the U.S., at least), I have slightly corrected and noticeably expanded the content, fixing the minor grammar bits as I went. If anyone thinks it still deserves the NPOV tag that I removed, then please post WHY in this space.</p>

<p>Some 'medics may consider this term to be derrogatory, but I haven't met any who do. Personally, I'm not a fan of "vanbulance," but there it is. I've changed the comment so that it continues to reflect the dislike that some folks have for the term, but also indicates that this feeling is not universal. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadger151_2fa2.html" title="User:Badger151">Badger151</a> 23:19, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The term 'bus' is actually commonplace in the metropolitan New York City area. I revised this comment to add this information, because Fire, Police, and EMS workers in the NYC area use this term frequently with no derragatory connotations (e.g., if you listen to the NYPD radio, you may hear "We need a bus over here...", which is their radio lingo for "Send me an ambulance..."). --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirerescuelieut_3824.html" title="User:Firerescuelieut">FireRescueLieut</a> 06:15, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Defibrillation may be the best example of a skill once reserved for medics that is now a BLS skill (actually, if you go all the way back, doctors thought that not even 'medics could be successfully taught to defibrillate.) A large part of this is due to the development of the AED, but at least as far back as 1999 the state of Rhode Island licensed me, and many others, as <i>Basic</i> EMTs, to <i>manually</i> defibrillate adult patients and to intubate adult patients as well - see their protocols; I expect that Rhode Island still does this. Practicing these skills required the successful completion of optional classes beyond the standard EMT-Basic curriculum, but we were still Basics; becoming an Intermediate required even more schooling, and granted additional skills. Many Basic EMTs can also give medications - epinephrine (adrenaline) for anaphylaxis is a common example (see the protocols for New York State or Rhode Island, or I expect for many other states, too.) Nebulised albuterol is another example. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadger151_2fa2.html" title="User:Badger151">Badger151</a> 04:38, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The structure of this article is somewhat haphazard - e.g. private and voluntary-run ambulances in the UK are dealt with in the section on ambulances in the UK, not in the separate private ambulances section, while that section reads very much as if it was written solely from the US perspective with a little info on France tacked on later.</p>
<p>I think the whole page needs a good tidy up to more carefully distinguish US and non-US information and to make it easier for people to (i) find info relevant to their location and (ii) add info for countries not already covered without having to worry about whether the info should all go in a country-specific section or be split between various headings.</p>

Here's an image of a museum model of an earlier Israeli medevac vehichle. It sports a Red Star of David (althogh faded) and a machine gun, though the main turret has been removed. The red star of David is not actually recognized as an Emblem of the Red Cross, so its use on an armed vehichle might not be technically illegal, but I certainly see a huge potential for confusion here, and I don't like it. --<a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunnarRene_e013.html" title="User:GunnarRene">GunnarRene</a> 15:04, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's face it. Does any of Israel's enemies care if any vehicle is an ambulance or not? In the recent <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict_7601.html" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict">2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict</a>, tanks were frequently used as ambulances and no one bothered to paint any emblem on them. Otherwise, FWIW, the red star of David is now a recognized emblem while included in the humiliating <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Crystal_b75c.html" title="Red Crystal">Red Crystal</a>.--<a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShuki_ea5a.html" title="User:Shuki">Shuki</a> 21:06, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Right. I've read up on the Red Crystal before asking the above. So in essence, the exterior of a medevac Merkava is mostly the same as other Merkava variants? But how do Israeli soldiers know the difference? Is there a tactical marking on it, or do they just know which tank numbers in their units are medevac?</p>
<p>It's hard to prove a negative; I've looked through lots of Merkava images, and found none with the MDA marking on them. But untill there is authorative information that the armed Merkava are not marked with the MDA or Red Crystal, I think the article still can't categorically state that they ARE NOT marked. The earlier version seemed to imply that Israel was doing something wrong by medevac'ing in an armed vehichle, but that happens all the time when there's no regular ambulance around. (If somebody in the platoon gets injured they'd be taken back in a normal tank, M113, Hummer or other armed vehichle and transfered into a proper ambulance.) There's no law against using an armed vehichle for medevac, what's illegal is to mark it with the protected symbols. --<a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunnarRene_e013.html" title="User:GunnarRene">GunnarRene</a> 21:27, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not sure what the issue is. If the plain red star of david is not a 'protected emblem' then what is the difference of painting this on a tank or painting a red smiley&#160;:-). What would be illegal about this? I would understand the <i>illegal</i> painting of a red cross on a combattant vehicle, and I can assure you that there are NO merkavas with red crosses painted on them. As for identifying them, I cannot vouch for the reported turret-less tankbulance outfiited with medical equipment, but rather the regular tanks that have much of their ammo removed to make space internally for medical personnel and casulaties. These are regular tanks for all intents and purposes. --<a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShuki_ea5a.html" title="User:Shuki">Shuki</a> 22:01, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, this is turning into me expressing myself instead of improving the article. If there was some source who categorically said that they did not mark the armed medevac vehichles, then that would be good. But what the article says now is fine in either case.</dd>
<dd>I've only seen model shots of the medevac Merkava. Those converted for medevac remain fighting vehichles too.</dd>
<dd><small>The issue is that Israel wants to use the red star as an official symbol, and although it is not an official Red Cross emblem, the red star is still recognized as the common emblem of the Israeli national society. So if Israel continued to use the red star on armed vehichles it would create confusion about the nature of the vehichles.</small>--<a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunnarRene_e013.html" title="User:GunnarRene">GunnarRene</a> 22:19, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Example: The French ambulance on the right. This ambulance has a large Red Cross on its back door (barely visible because it's open), but observe the tactical marking to the right of the door. That is the standard unit marking of a medical vehichle (though it would look slightly different if it followed NATO standard <a href="../../../a/p/p/APP-6a_c4ef.html" title="APP-6a">APP-6a</a>).

<p>I'm not an editor, and I'm not sure if this is encyclopedia-worthy, but should there be a section on the term bambulance? A quick google search should reveal the meaning and origin.

<p>This page seems well developed so I'm just wondering if anyone has suggested adding more on the history of ambulances? My understanding is that often undertaker vehicles were first used for ambulances...didn't take much of a google search to back that up Found the following on this page <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/ems/overview/history.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.toronto.ca/ems/overview/history.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.toronto.ca/ems/overview/history.htm</a> The first use of ambulances for civilian purposes did not occur until after the American Civil War, when returning veterans began to provide this service to their communities on a voluntary basis. In Ontario, communities often relied on the local undertaker for this type of service; the undertaker often having the only transportation in town in which one could lay down. --<a href="../../../m/a/z/User%7EMazzmn_e9a1.html" title="User:Mazzmn">Mazzmn</a> 13:43, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Scoop and Screw</i> (<i>Scoop and Carry</i>, if you prefer) doesn't apply to all ambulance calls; in some cases we <i>Stay and Play</i>. The belief that all calls involve scooping the patient up and speeding off to the hospital is a common misconception, but hasn't been true for many years due to advances in the level of medicine that can be provided in the field.

<p>This article is including a lot of information that pertains to EMS, not to ambulances <i>per se'</i>. I've also noticed this tendency in some of the other EMS related articles. What do people think about creating country-specific EMS pages that discuss the details of each system, and removing this type of information from the <i>Ambulance</i>, <i>EMT</i>, etc pages? Doing so would allow for discussions of the tools of the trade without creating articles of extreme length. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadger151_2fa2.html" title="User:Badger151">Badger151</a> 21:13, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>These are the reasons why we are suggesting that the Air Ambulances &amp; crest be removed. 1) The Ambulance page is 48 kilobytes long and according to the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticle_Size_b98c.html" title="Wikipedia:Article Size">Wikipedia:Article Size</a> guidelines we need to try to keep the articles under 40 kilobytes. 2) Pictures of Air Ambulances belong on the <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Ambulance_2f6b.html" title="Air Ambulance">Air Ambulance</a> article. That is like putting a picture of a Ford vehicle on the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chevy.html" title="Chevy">Chevy</a> article just because it's a vehicle.</dd>

<p>The page is headed <i>Ambulance</i>, not <i>Ambulance (Vehicle)</i>. The Aircraft are <i>Ambulances</i> in their own right. Yes, I agree, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_Ambulance_2f6b.html" title="Air Ambulance">Air Ambulance</a> is the place for more descriptive pictures of ambulance aircraft, BUT with the main <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambulance.html" title="Ambulance">Ambulance</a> page, there should be shown some examples of each type of Ambulance , NOT just the road vehicles. Lets see what other people think.<a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScancoaches_0975.html" title="User:Scancoaches">Scancoaches</a> 02:14 7 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that this is an <i>Ambulance</i> page, not an <i>Ambulance (automobile)</i> page - all ambulance vehicles: planes, trains, automobiles, motorcycles, ships, and helicopters are covered by this page's title. I believe that the reason that this page is so long is because it contains so much EMS info that does not directly pertain to ambulances: the differences between the skill set of a paramedic and that of an EMT are irrelevant for this page, for instance. Much of the country-specific information could be moved to country-specific pages, and probably should be. I've made similar observations on the EMT and EMS talk pages, as they are similalry overloaded.</dd>
<dd>As for deleting a helicopter picture, which one? Each helicopter picture is present not as an example of an air ambulance, but of an air ambulance belonging to a specific service. The same goes for the crests, though in this case, I suppose I could see removing both, rather than one, as being appropriate. I would also nominate the following images for removal, starting at the top of the article:
<ul>
<li>The <b>Star of Life</b> - I like having it there, but it doesn't add to the reader's understanding of the subject, and a link is provided. If we're removing images simply to free up space, then, I'd cut it.</li>
<li>The "<b>Modern Day Advanced Life Support Ambulance</b>" - The Mexican ambulance is, for our intents and purposes, modern and up to date, making this "Modern Day" image redundant. Also, the "Modern Day" image was the most recent to be added, and, in chosing between the two images, I'd rather go with the Mexican ambulance to represent more of the world.</li>
<li>If there's only going to be one image under <i><b>Private Ambulance</b> Companies</i>, then it should be a modern ambulance that is shown, not one from 1967.</li>
<li>The "<b>typical "squad truck" design for a fly car</b>" depicts a fly car, not an ambulance. Agina, a link is provided, and the image is unneccessary.</li>
<li>The "<b>Medium duty type ambulance</b>" needs to be better tied into the text of the article. Compare its caption to those of the Type I, II, and III ambulances above it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadger151_2fa2.html" title="User:Badger151">Badger151</a> 02:21, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I agree with what you've said Badger151 and made a start. I've moved one of the Helicopter pictures and made it an example picture and not specific to a particular service. Of the 5 pictures you pointed out as unnecessary, I agree 4 should go but the <i>Star of Life</i> should stay as its rather a nice page <i>header</i>. As for the crests, I agree that, if one must go, then both should.<a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScancoaches_0975.html" title="User:Scancoaches">Scancoaches</a> 12:48 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>There appears to be some confusion regarding which style of English should be used on this page. When I first found the article, it appeared to be mostly written in US English; this also appears to be true for most of the article's history - though I admit that my sense of what falls into US and what falls into UK English is not the best. My intent has been to keep the article consistent. Recently, another user believed that the article was written in UK English, and perhaps saw my edits as an attempt to change the article into a US-English article, and so reverted the changes I had made. I expect that he did so in good faith, and would have let things lie, except that he accidentally also reverted <a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunnarRene_e013.html" title="User:GunnarRene">User:GunnarRene</a>'s edits at the same time. Rather than manually recreate GunnarRene's edits, I simply reverted the article back to what it had been after his (GunnarRene's) edits (the only other intervening edits were vandalism, and the reversion of that vandalism). --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadger151_2fa2.html" title="User:Badger151">Badger151</a> 05:27, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
