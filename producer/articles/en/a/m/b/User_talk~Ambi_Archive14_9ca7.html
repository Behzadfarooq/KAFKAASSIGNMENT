<p>Hi Beck,</p>
<p>This is David from Georgia. I just wanted to say thanks for the welcome message and for your offer. Anyway, I haven't used this talk page before so I'm not sure how this works exactly but I wanted to let you know that I'll try to edit the pages regarding Georgia as much as I can (or at least what I know:)). I've edited some of the articles before but I did not have an account up until now. Thanks again and you can e-mail me or send me a message if you have comments or questions.</p>

<p>Becky, I really resent your vote and comment. I'll be booting you out of my Patrick White group as soon as I get onto my normal computer. It's a bit late to try to offer kind words now. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 12:49, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, I was nonplussed by your attitude to my changes to the Patrick White page, and upset that you refused to discuss it. (Bad form, in my view.) I'm further offended by your no vote here. You've really left a bad taste in my mouth. I'd be pleased not to communicate again. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 13:00, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is entirely inappropriate Tony. RfA is a community process, where individuals are entitled to have their own opinions.

<p>Hi Ambi. I was not aware that rents in Canberra where high. In fact in recent years house prices have far outpaced the increase in rental prices. Did you have any references that might be useful if this was going to be included in the Canberra article? The only info I can find mentions that Canberra has a very low rental vacancy rate, but doesn't mention prices. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<span style="font-size:90%"><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></span> 03:24, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you very much for that. I just happen to stumble across this template for Thursday nights in the US and I just loved it. So I created some Aussie ones.</p>
<p>I haven't created one for Saturday nights as it's rear for a series to be shown on a regular Saturday night primetime timeslot (the only one I can think of is <i><a href="../../../h/e/y/Hey_Hey_It%27s_Saturday_30bb.html" title="Hey Hey It's Saturday">Hey Hey It's Saturday</a></i>). Usually family films are the norm. Also I have only included the three commercial stations and from 7:30 PM to 10:30 PM. Do you think that these should include <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation_9631.html" title="Australian Broadcasting Corporation">ABC</a> or even <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Broadcasting_Service_6f2b.html" title="Special Broadcasting Service">SBS</a> and should these go all the way to 11:30 PM?

<p>Re. your snide mocking of my contributions to Brumby site.<i>I wonder if I should put the above quote from Eric on Wikipedia:Bad jokes and other deleted nonsense</i> Ha Ha. I hope you got some small, but pleasant, enjoyment out of it. All my contribs are in good faith. Sneer away if you want but it would the adult thing to engage in argument, compromise and agreement. I notice that my contributions to Brumby site have stood. Do I get an apology? Or is it a matter of 'do as I say but not as I do'?<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_A._Warbuton_2073.html" title="User:Eric A. Warbuton">Eric A. Warbuton</a> 05:43, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>From your cheerless response I see that it is ok for you to mock myself and my, always goodfaith, edits. How small of you to then complain of my behaviour. I dont get it. You broke a fundemental wiki rule in mocking another contributor but you wont admit to it. Hmm. Theres a word for that.

<p>Since you have maligned me at 'Brumby' thus:</p>
<p><i>silly edits for the sake of it; instead of trying to contribute legitimately, Eric has a history of running around making silly edits to annoy people and then acting like he'd just written the Magna Carta</i></p>
<p>Can you list <b>any</b> 'silly' edits of mine? And provide evidence?</p>
<p>Can you list <b>any</b> edits where I havent tried to contribute 'legitimately'&#160;?</p>
<p>Can you list <b>any</b> edits where I make 'silly edits to annoy people'&#160;?</p>
<p>And when have I 'acted' as though I have 'just written the Magna Carta'? (This is especially amusing)</p>
<p>And I notice that my considered and legitimate edit at 'Brumby' is still, of course, standing. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEric_A._Warbuton_2073.html" title="User:Eric A. Warbuton">Eric A. Warbuton</a> 03:28, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is my understanding that not only are the pictures in the public domain, but furthermore the National Library has corresponded with User:Martyman (and perhaps others) and allowed that we could use the images on Wikipedia from the website as they are in the public domain. Is your objection based on copyright principles or aesthetics? Copyright seems not to be an issue. If aesthetics is the issue, then I feel that the footer attributes the source of the image and, although I acknowledge the source in the summary associated with the image, it is not appropriate to delete the source of the image on the image itself. Happy to consider a reasonable argument to the contrary.

<dd>You will note of course that I have not merely lifted them from the web without much thought.

There are at least five copies (not to mention the 'Geelong' variants) At the moment I not in the mood to a typological analysis of competeing texts.

<p>What a nerve. You have the only typed copy of the text. I, now, thanks to your theft dont possess a copy(and I dont know how to retrieve it).Do you expect me to to retype it?

<p>Hey, I know-you told me so many times. Funny I cant find it at Wikisource? So where is it? Return the text where I initially put it.

<p>Oh I see -if was to remove your text without warning and agreement it would be rightly described as vandalism but if you do the same thing its what? Acceptable? Put it back.

<p>I dont care what you call it 'source text' or 'three day old chips' for all I care. You treat people on wikipedia with respect. I suggest that its ultimate resting spot is at least within my agreement( which is very different than control). I am so tempted to treat yourself and your 'texts' as you have treated myself.

<dd>I thought so too, but people kept commenting on the duplication of information between the history and notable places section.

<p>I have re-added the brickworks to the notable places section and expanded the details about it in both places. Hopefully it doesn't feel like repeated text now.

<p>Hi Ambi, I could maybe go another shot at FAC. I'd want to make some updates first to bring it more into line with Waterfall Gully (which is very well laid out), and also to find a bit more info to fill in some holes (e.g. one of the unaddressed queries from before was more info about one of the churches). Give me a few weeks to get around to that, and then I'll take another shot at it. Now get back to studying, and good luck with your exams! I've failed a subject due to procrastination because the studying was so tedious, but believe me when I say from experience that it's better to work like a crazy for a week than to have to repeat a sucky subject&#160;;-) -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 05:00, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's incorrect to describe Macklin as "useless." She's a competent performer and would be a perfectly competent minister. She isn't as sharp as Gillard, but that's a useful quality in a Deputy Leader. Her real problem is that as a member of the SL she holds Old Lefty views on education that are unacceptable to key demographics in key marginal seats. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 12:47, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Adam, she's been a failure as Deputy Leader. A decent portion of the the electorate think Gillard is DL . And even elements of the SL wants to dump her as education minister. Not to mention that she has consistantly failed to manage to make education an issue. Admittedly, this isn't all her fault or fair to her, but in politics perception is reality. --<a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERaiderAspect_b3e0.html" title="User:RaiderAspect">RaiderAspect</a> 01:07, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>What is the criterion for "success" as a Deputy Leader? The DL's job is mainly to support the Leader, which Macklin has loyally done for all three leaders (none of whom belong to her faction). She should not be competing with the Leader for the spotlight. I think she has been a perfectly competent DL, and a competent parliamentary performer. Her main problem is with her ideology on education, not her performance. Ideology would still be a problem if Gillard were DL (remember Medicare Gold?), with the added problem that she would be upstaging the Leader all the time. An ambitous Deputy is usually seen as a liability. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 03:42, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, to me it has appeared that the <i>majority</i> holds those ideas. But instead, let's go section per section and discuss it:
<ol>
<li>" less than three months of activity" → "limited activity": I don't object too much on this one, but the fact is that three months is seen by some as the bare minimum. However, I wouldn't make a fuss if it stayed off the page.</li>
<li><b>General advice</b> section. I don't see why any of these should be deleted: it lists several criteria that should be considered, and it states that all of them should be taken into account. In a way, I think it helps to end that dreaded <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditcountitis_b262.html" title="Wikipedia:Editcountitis">editcountitis</a>.</li>
<li><b>Recommended behavior</b>: I don't see why any of these points is objectable, but I'd like to hear your opinion on this section.</li>
<li><b>Edit RfAs properly</b>: the first two points and the final one are recommendations that should not be deleted in my opinion. The rest... well, recommending against <b>Extreme Lesbian Support</b> seems too <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/instruction_creep" class="extiw" title="m:instruction_creep">instruction creepish</a>.</li>
<li><b>The dreaded numbers</b>: I talked over with a bureuacrat on IRC (<a href="../../../r/d/s/User%7ERdsmith4_389f.html" title="User:Rdsmith4">Rdsmith4</a>) about these, and he explained that while bureaucrats are free to determine their own definition of consensus, these numbers are pretty accurate.

<p>I'm sorry, I'm new to the whole dispute resolution thing, but why is it wrong to start a survey discussion (that it merits me being compared to a banned user?) The RFC page referred me to <a href="../../../s/u/r/Wikipedia%7ESurvey_guidelines_ef72.html" title="Wikipedia:Survey guidelines">Wikipedia:Survey guidelines</a> and I was just following instructions there.

<dd>hey Ambi, thanks for clearing that up. I was wondering about the absurd amount of instruction creep that that page required.

<p>Hi Rebecca, I'm a journalist with The Sunday Times here in Perth. I'm keen to write an article on Wikipedia, with a WA angle. I've been making contact with a few WA Wikipedians, and I asked one if there were any women in WA who are active on the site. He said he didn't know of any - in fact he thought you were the only woman in Australia who is doing the Wikipedia thing. I would like to interview at least one woman for the article - would you let me call you, or ask questions via email? Yours sincerely, David Cohen dcohen@amnet.net.au 0414 780 441</p>

<p>Hi Rebecca, please tell me why are you constantly reverting my edits regarding the "Unrecognized sepparatist region of Transnistria which is part of Moldova"? You can't just revert without any explanation and your last answear didn't convince me or anybody that you're right. As long as it is not recognized internationally by a country we have to add this information that region is not "republic" in the way others are. Otherwise we just mixed up some things and confuse the readers.

<dd>Dear Beck. Thankx for your help. But as I said before we have to emphasize even more the facts. And the facts are that they are not recognized by any country in the world. No country has embassy there. I've seen you study law. It is very nice but you should know by now even better than others that if it is not in the acts, papers, agreements recognized officially "it doesn't exist". It is just a unrecognized region of Moldova named Transnistria. Even more when now USA and EU and partly also Romania is a part of negotiotions about the future status of this region is too much to say that it is a "republic". Just take a look on the State Dept. of USA and please see that USA recognize the integrity of Moldova. Until it is not recognized we have to call it simple: <b>Transnitria - Unrecognized sepparatist region of Moldova</b>. And about my strong thaughts is just that we have to defend the truth otherwise we just complicate and confuse others. Anyway I wish you all the best and please support the truth.<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonaparte_0e16.html" title="User:Bonaparte"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="background: maroon;">&#160;Bonaparte&#160;</font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/n/User_talk%7EBonaparte_ba39.html" title="User talk:Bonaparte"><small>talk</small></a> <small>&amp;</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bonaparte_0181.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bonaparte"><small>contribs</small></a></dd>

<dd>Let's continue our work please. About <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transnistria.html" title="Transnistria">Transnistria</a> I agree to write at the page as in the case of <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>. There it is stated only KOSOVO. It doesn't appear republic or state. Not to mention that is recognized by a country (Albania). So we have to reedit and to state only Transnistria. This is very neutral. Otherwise it is not. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonaparte_0e16.html" title="User:Bonaparte"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="background: maroon;">&#160;Bonaparte&#160;</font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/n/User_talk%7EBonaparte_ba39.html" title="User talk:Bonaparte"><small>talk</small></a> <small>&amp;</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bonaparte_0181.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bonaparte"><small>contribs</small></a>

<dd>Beck please, pay attention to the followings: you said you're trying to maintain that article neutral. Fine that's sound perfect to me. But at the same time you said some arguments to maintain the article in this situation. If I proove you're wrong will you accept my point of view? Let's try. I told you this is a similar case as <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>. You said it is not. I tell you it is. You said "Kosovo does not claim independence". Wrong. It does claim independence. Link: (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo</a>). It is recognized internationally as a serbian province called Kosovo. Yes, like Transnistria, it is internationally recognized as a Moldovan province called Transnistria. Link to US State Dept. USA recognize the territorial <a href="../../../i/n/t/Integrity.html" title="Integrity">integrity</a> of Moldova (Link: <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5357.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5357.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5357.htm</a>). So I am just asking to stress the order in another approach. It must be first said it is a part of Moldova and so on, sepparatist region of T., and only after this to say that they tried to declare independence with the help of 14th Soviet Army but nobody has recognized them and even more they are under EU restrictions. In this way both views are very good represented and a neutral view is gained. I hope this time you'll have a better option.<a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonaparte_0e16.html" title="User:Bonaparte"><font color="#FFFFFF" style="background: maroon;">&#160;Bonaparte&#160;</font></a> <a href="../../../b/o/n/User_talk%7EBonaparte_ba39.html" title="User talk:Bonaparte"><small>talk</small></a> <small>&amp;</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bonaparte_0181.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bonaparte"><small>contribs</small></a></dd>

<p>Hi Ambi, Thanks for your comments. the categorisation of universities in Australia is not correct - with extensive knowledge in this area, browsing through the categorisation, it is currently a mess. There are some universities in one category and not another and vice versa. Others are in incorrect categories. Some are categorised by city, state, etc. There are no more than forty Universities in Australia, either the category universities in Australia should not exist and the current articles within it should be recategorised to their applicable sub-categories (Universities by State) or instead of having subcategories with no more than ten articles in each, move them all into the major category universities in Australia. The subcategories "universities in Melbourne" is essentially a duplication of "education in melbourne". Could you advise me on how to fix this; so that there is a measure of conformity.

<p>Hiya - what makes you say Olexander is an uber-conservative? Isn't he a relative wet if compared to say Doyle or Wells?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe I'm biased in his favour simply because he's a poofter like me, bur I had thought he was middle of the road or if anything on the progressive side of the Libs (insofar as there is such a thing). But I can't point to a reference - can you? Either way, 'more' vs 'most' is not something I'd die in a ditch over although I do feel the former is more NPOV even if we were to agree he's an uber-conservative.
<dl>
<dd>I've already acknowledged I may have made some biassed assumptions, although this is really more a matter of opinion than fact - like I said, most vs more is not a big difference so not really worth arguing over. You are however factually incorrect on Aden Ridgeway - source provided as requested.
<dl>
<dd>Without necessarily saying you're wrong on Olexander (and it really *is* in the eye of the beholder on something intangible like whether someone is conservative), can you point me to any examples that lead you to that conclusion? I'm now genuinely interested in exploring where I got the contrary view from. By the way, some of the other Dems articles may need that piece of history rectified since Ridgeway actually never faced the membership in a leadership ballot <a href="../../../e/n/d/User%7EEnder3057_42a1.html" title="User:Ender3057">Ender</a> 12:57, 2 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Cool. I've picked up another error on the Meg Lees page: NSD and Bartlett did in fact cross the floor to vote against the GST. Have edited the page accordingly.
<dl>
<dd>No worries. Being able to admit that one is or might be wrong is a necessary virtue here on Wikipedia&#160;:) I'm still interested though in any sources you can point me to re Olexander. It occurs to me that I did indeed leap to the conclusion that because he was gay (and attacked the Libs for their conservatism on that particular issue) he must be a relative moderate. Thinking about it, some of the only public material I've seen him put out was his attack on somebody over a drug-related issue in which he did indeed take quite a reactionary conservative position (although no worse than I'd expect from most Libs).</dd>

<p>User:Fir0002 states he is 16 on his user page, and that information seems commensurate with his activities. I find the actions of fellow Canberra editors in the recent debate heavy handed and lacking the assumption of good faith, and I find also the debate seems to lack respect for the sensitivities or the feelings of a user who is making the best contributions to the wikipedia he can.</p>
<p>Of the 8 criteria at <a href="../../../c/s/d/Wp%7Ecsd.html#Articles" title="Wp:csd">Wp:csd#Articles</a>, I do not reach the same interpretation as you that "An article without any text is a clear speedy deletion candidate." Criterion 3 is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No content whatsoever. Any article whose contents consist only of links elsewhere (including hyperlinks, category tags and "see also" sections), a rephrasing of the title, and/or attempts to correspond with the person or group named by its title.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pictures are content in my view although obviously that is a matter of contention. However, since there is a list of things that are included as no content and they do not include pictures, I do not believe others would regard an article as without content if it merely had pictures.</p>
<p>Tilba is a verifiable place. It is very easy to add some content as Astrokey44 has done. Given the debate that was happening at the Canberra wikiproject, your deletion of the article was insensitive. You had drawn attention to it in your comments of 9:47 on 4 December. My comments of 10:57 said "We will get to Tilba Tilba and add some text" - in my view clearly indicating that I , if no other editor, would add some text in the near future. It was obviously clear that content needed to be added. An approach instead of speedy deletion might have been to alert Fir0002 that text should be added, else the article would be considered for speedy deletion, and allow him, or other editors, some time to respond.</p>
<p>Whether or not you were acting within the rules is open to question. I believe you were acting insensitively and there were options open to you which would have shown more respect for the registered user who has made valuable contributions to the Wikipedia and is without a doubt acting in good faith.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 23:19, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Ambi<br />
I'm sorry but the only photos I have of Canberra are of those landmark places. If you read my userpage it says that I'm in East Gippsland Vic, and at 16 I can't go driving anywhere I want.<br />
I am acutely aware not everyone has broadband because living in the country means I suffer with dial-up. Even so I take the consideration of saving all my photos for web (unlike some users) and the image additions do not make the page load up too slow. As previously mentioned (and I guess I'm pretty much alone on this one) I think all wiki articles should be well illustrated. Remember a picture is worth a thousand words, and a lot of people will get their intial value of an article by the accompanying photos.<br />
If you took the time, you'd see that <i>I do</i> upload all of my images on the commons and make pages for them there. Have a look. As someone who has a little talent in photos, I honestly think the photos I replaced where inferior. The way most people are leaning over the Parliamentary Triangle photos I know can't be taken as a general representative of all the pix, but I think it at least says that I am acting in good faith.<br />
Anyway I hope we can reach an understanding which will make the Canberra articles better. --<a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFir0002_4967.html" title="User:Fir0002">Fir0002</a> 06:31, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for doing that. Two minor points:</p>
<ul>
<li>"challenged the preselection of seriously ill Senator and former Cabinet minister Peter Cook." I'm not certain that Cook's illness was public at the time of the pre-selection. This makes it sound like Sterle kicked Cook when he was down. That may be so, but it should be checked.</li>
<li>"Since taking his seat in July 2005, he has tended to be fairly a low-profile figure." Should read "a fairly low-profile figure." It might also be said that most new members and senators are fairly low-profile while they learn how things work here. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 08:43, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I did a little better in contracts than I did in crim, the same as last semester, which was actually a little disappointing since I want to practise crim after I finish.

<p>Photos of the Rosstown Railway reserves won't be a problem. I'll get cracking on them. I'm no professional photographer but that's why digital cameras have <i>delete</i> buttons right? If you are doing the article on Ross himself I can get other local photos too if needed. The sugar beet factory site and <i>The Grange</i> are now just suburban estates but the swamp that the mill took water from (and that Ross took away from local farmers) is a sports ground and reserve now. Can also get a shot of the Rosstown Hotel perhaps?

<dd>Well I kicked off the Rosstwon Railway article and expanded the Carnegie, Vic article. Ross himself was next on my list but I didn't want to start until I had some solid reference material under my belt so collaborating on these articles would be excellent.

<p>Hi, Ambi! I want to thank you for voting to support me in my RfA, and also for your kind words. I know I'm very late thanking you, but I've been a bit caught up with college work. I hope I'll live up to the expectations of those who voted for me. I look forward to working with you as a fellow admin (though I note from your user page that your activity is going to slow down after you move house). Thanks again. Cheers. <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMusical_Linguist_4a5e.html" title="User:Musical Linguist">AnnH</a> <a href="../../../m/u/s/User_talk%7EMusical_Linguist_ef7d.html" title="User talk:Musical Linguist"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:57, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry about the red links. I am currently creating station succession boxes for the Australind, Prospector, Avonlink and Indian Pacific train services, and having nothing more than a succession box in an article wouldn't be worth it. Once the articles are written, I (or anyone that notices) can move the succession boxes onto the station article.

<dd>That had occurred to me also.

<p>Who's wikistalking who? You seem to make it a personal agenda to revert all my edits minutes after I've effected them, and as a so-called "moderator," you display a heavy bias towards the activists working on the entry rather than the person who has no stake in the matter. As long as we're talking honestly, let me just lay it out as well: you're extremely and heavily biased yourself. "David and Goliath" refers to your favorite clothing line rather than the Biblical legend?

<p>Hi, you seem to have an interest, like myself, in all things Australian, and I'm sure one of those interests may include <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_rules_football.html" title="Australian rules football">Australian rules football</a>. Just wondering if you could check out <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_AFL_0b3a.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject AFL">Wikipedia:WikiProject AFL</a>, where I've compiled quite a list of stuff to do. I'm quite surprised that there is little information on the sport in this encyclopedia, and also such deatils on players are hard to find over the internet. Also, while I'm asking, how would I notify more people about this project without making it seem like advertising? There are many people with a great knowledge of AFL around.

<p>Why, may I ask, did you revert my edits?</p>
<p>Or is the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> page simply off-limits for fear of it actually containing <i>relevant</i> information?</p>
