<p>Ambi, you voted support, stating that it was a protest of my opposition. For what it's worth, I have now changed my vote to neutral, which is something I had intended to do after reading Jaxl's last response to me, but hadn't yet gotten around to it because I wanted to write a response to that response, etc. and had been too busy at the time to do so.</p>
<p>So anyway, feel free to protest my neutral all you want. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 16:51, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>hi Ambi,why did you keep reverting other's contributions to the article,Shepparton, Victoria?</p>
<p>The article will not develop if you keep deleting other's contributions.</p>
<p>If you think that others' contributions are not relevant,why don't you conduct an indepth research on Shepparton before deleting others' contributions.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to do so, please stop deleting things.</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/a/i/User%7EWai_Hong_0beb.html" title="User:Wai Hong">User:Wai Hong</a> 2 October 2005</p>
<p>I am well aware of my own grammar and punctuation. They are not as horrible as you mentioned. Stop being so proud of yourself and stop commenting about others' grammar and punctuation just because English is your first language.</p>
<p>Besides,I wrote about other topics regarding Shepparton too.You deleted them anyway.</p>
<p>I think that you just don't like people editing articles which you wrote.Create your own encyclopedia, then!!</p>
<p>If you did not understand anything from the shepparton article,your English is not as good anyway.That article was based on a formal leaflet produced by the university.</p>
<p>I find your act of searching through all the articles that I have made contributions to. I can sense a lack of trust in you-Wai Hong-3 October 2005</p>
<p>Dear Ambi, If you wish to be the editor of every sentence that I wrote on Wikipedia,go ahead.I have no problem with that as long as you do not delete important things. I do strive to produce quality writings ,in contrary to your belief.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbi_Archive13_36c8.html" title="Edit section: New Zealand political lists">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">New Zealand political lists</span></h2>
<p>By "political lists", I assume you're talking about things like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_members_of_the_Australian_Senate_62d4.html" title="List of members of the Australian Senate">List of members of the Australian Senate</a> and <a href="../../../4/6/t/46th_New_Zealand_Parliament_f621.html" title="46th New Zealand Parliament">46th New Zealand Parliament</a>. To start with, there's a bit of trouble in that there are many different styles applied to the New Zealand lists, as I've changed my mind a lot over time. (Mostly attepting to make things more like what I see other people doing, although not always successfully.) The newest lists are ones like <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_New_Zealand_Parliament_9fcd.html" title="19th New Zealand Parliament">19th New Zealand Parliament</a> and <a href="../../../4/8/t/48th_New_Zealand_Parliament_5016.html" title="48th New Zealand Parliament">48th New Zealand Parliament</a>, and eventually, I hope to have most other New Zealand lists looking much the same.</p>
<p>What, in particular, do you suggest should be done? I'd quite like to keep the little coloured boxes, for example — they're already in extensive use on pages relating to the recent New Zealand election, and it seems that many British election results are also using them. If you're talking about writing "Helen Clark" instead of "Clark, Helen", I have no objections. Anything in particular? It would be nice to get some standardisation, although I suppose there will still be disjunction between Australia/NZ and the rest of the world. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVardion_fde2.html" title="User:Vardion">Vardion</a> 20:20, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

Starting with an odd Afd (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_DoYouDo_2046.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/DoYouDo">DoYouDo</a>) which led to another afd (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_ECRUSH_2217.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/ECRUSH">eCRUSH</a>). In both of these I failed to compel the crowd, dispite some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/DoYouDo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24287477" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/DoYouDo&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=24287477" rel="nofollow">disruption</a>. So perhaps it's just my vindictive nature that make me smell something here:</p>

<p>Hi Ambi after all this time, I have not got around to finding my Franklin photos yet! Oh the railway issue that I put to you all that long time ago, got sorted by someone from some part of the great cultural imperialist nation which calls them railroads.. As for chidlow, ok it was low standard. Geeze I'm very impressed by ScottDavis and some of the other cleanerupperers around. Still trying to get a handle on some things though.. Best Wishes.

<p>Hi.

<p>Hi Ambi</p>
<p>I'm wondering about one thing. You were one of the certifiers of Tony Sidaway's RFC's based on his deletion debate closes.

<p>Hi. Each of the current candidates in the Arbitration Committee election now has a subpage for people to ask questions and have a discussion with the candidate. It's linked to below your statement on the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2005_Candidate_statements_e6ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2005/Candidate statements">candidate statements</a> page. Hopefully, this format will be more productive and less disruptive than the "endorsements/disendorsements" approach that caused so many problems last year.</p>
<p>I took the liberty of copying your candidate statement unaltered to your subpage. Feel free to elaborate on it at whatever length you wish, without the concern of space restrictions as on the main candidate page. I encourage you to put your subpage on your watchlist and discuss arbitration issues with the community as part of your campaign. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 04:01, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I hardly deserve all of the credit.

<p>I missed the earlier discussion regarding Sealand and Seborga. Thanks for pointing that out. However, Minerva is a special case. They had a population and were invaded by Tonga. They recently picked a new prince. Their official website calls for ending the "30 years of military occupation". <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreestylefrappe_d689.html" title="User:Freestylefrappe">freestylefrappe</a> 18:30, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

I haven't made much of an effort to create a lot of new pages though. The disambig pages you make look better than I tend to manage. Watching you and others, it looks like creating the disambigs is easier once most of the towns/suburbs have articles (eg in the ACT, Sydney suburbs), so I'd like to make more effort to get more town and suburb articles created too, especially for South Australia. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottDavis_99e4.html" title="User:ScottDavis">Scott Davis</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScottDavis_9428.html" title="User talk:ScottDavis">Talk</a></sup> 15:17, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Rebecca,</p>
<p>I've been thinking for a while about starting a <a href="../../../b/o/u/Wikipedia%7EBounty_Board_56c3.html" title="Wikipedia:Bounty Board">Wikipedia:Bounty Board</a>, where people put up monetary bounties for articles to become featured, but where the money all goes to the Wikimedia Foundation if the conditions are met. I have a draft at User:Quadell/bounty.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the positives would be that it would encourage donations and encourage the creation of featured articles, and it would fill a gap - that people tend to look for a psychological "reward" when they've worked hard for Wikipedia. But my questions are: 1, Do you think there are any legal problems with this? 2, Do you think this goes against the Wiki philosophy? And 3, Do you see any other problems? (I'm asking several long-term and knowlegeable Wikipedian about this.)</p>

<p>Never, Law student maybe, but no git. What you did in your summary is what I was trying to get others involved in, but the big problem with most of the edit persons for Perth, they are born 1980+ and have a very poor understanding of what has gone before (snottygobble and a few others are shining examples of otherwise), and as a consequence their edits in fact are in no way NPOV - as they have very limited understanding of the context of their edits. As I was trying a complicated answer to you and boochan, your correction (adelaide indeed) over-rode my edit - I lost it, and I really think your suggestion would simplify my idea really well, and keep it in a manageable form.
