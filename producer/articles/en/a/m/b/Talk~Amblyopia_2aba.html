<p>It was quite ironic that <b>Amblyopia</b> is one of the very few diseases that is not tamed enough by the human intelligence. It almost go unnoticed at the very age of the victim, when it can be best controlled. It is good that children are lucky enough to have wonderful treatment regimens available to them these days, if only, when detected in time, that is in their very early years, but the stigma and pain that is associated with <b>Adult Amblyopia</b> is particularly unbearable. I came to know that I am one of the very few people who fell to this seemingly innocuous disease(rather poor vision condition - doctors won't give up to call it a disease) when I was first disqualified in 'Army Selections'. That was a blow to my career as I always dreamt of becoming an 'Officer in Uniform' right from my childhood. Then started my ordeal, <b>it</b> forced me to change my goals, take up unplanned ventures, constantly irritated me now and then, and more than anything else, I am very much depressed to imagine the fact that one day I will become a <b>one-eyed jack.</b></p>
<p>While it is extremely painful to learn that there is no proven treatment for the adults, the plight of the people like me in the <b>still developing countries</b> is un-imaginable, where nothing is being done effectively, even the diagnosis of this bloody disease( let me vent my anger).</p>
<p>My Dear Brothers Of The World Who Are In The Same Boat With Me: We share the slogan with the victims of the most dreaded disease(or&#160;???condition) on this earth <b>AIDS:</b></p>
<p><b>DOCTORS OF THE WORLD: DO SOMETHING AND SAVE US</b> before it is too late.</p>

<dd>This seems rather over-wrought. I have had amplylpia since early childhood, did the patch thing without any results, and have lived with it since age 5, now I am 60. Other than in a few situation involving hand-eye coordination, it has never been a bother. Unfortunately (IMO), it did not keep me out of the Army, infantry, or Viet Nam.

<dd>I agree, Wschart. I do not have amblyopia, but i work in a lab researching it. The amblyopes who come into the lab seem to be <i>irritated</i> by their poor vision, but comparing it to AIDS is just ridiculous and frankly offensive. That blog has nothing on it anyway, so I removed the link... <a href="../../../f/a/m/User%7EFamousdog_bfbc.html" title="User:Famousdog">Famousdog</a> 14:50, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Same as Wschart, I have had it since early childhood. Did the patch thing as a child, tried a contact lens for a while (no noticeable difference, and while there were very slight improvements I did not feel it was worth it). Whenever it comes up I talk about how it seems like I can see through sides of objects. I do sympathize with people pursuing professions in which eyesight matters, good luck with your new plans and don't let external circumstances drag you down. <a href="../../../p/o/m/User%7EPomte_3bc0.html" title="User:Pomte">Pomte</a> 18:27, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does Amblyopia have anything to do with Ocular Dominance?<br />
Ocular Dominance Wikipedia link: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocular_dominance" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocular_dominance" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocular_dominance</a></p>
<p>Amblyopia has a lot to do with ocular dominance, though not necessarily in a clear-cut way. Monocular occlusion during development is a well-known way to cause amblyopia, and causes the ocular dominance columns of cortex for the dominant eye of the amblyope to dominate that of the amblyopic eye. Behaviorally, amblyopia-which has a poor medical definition-exhibits symptoms that suggest information loss in transmission from eye to cortex because of poor development. That information loss could be caused by the mechanics of the screwed up distribution of ocular dominance cells, which extends in a loop from the eye through the lateral geniculate nucleus, and into the cortex, as well as into the pons which controls certain automatic tracking activities.&lt;spetz&gt;.216.175.188.98 22:17, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>About the deletion lazy eye or tense eye. WIkipedia also has the policy of a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. That means when there are substantial bodies of opposing opinions, they all need to be presented. The formula is "A says B about C." You can't say in the article "mainstream medicine is bunk." You can't say in a vague sort of way "Bates supporters think mainstream medicine is bunk." You <i>can</i> say "so-and-so, in his book <i>Thus-and-such,</i> says on page 234, 'mainstream medicine is bunk.'".Seeyou 18:50, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Look your vague references to eyes being 'tense' as opposed to 'lazy' or 'poor' suggest that you don't know what amblyopia is, so I'm removing this stuff as its just an attempt to promote the Bates method, not an attempt at 'neutrality'. When they use the term 'lazy eye', ophthalmologists don't mean the eye is actually 'lazy'. Or, indeed, that it is 'tense' and equally meaningless comment. <a href="../../../f/a/m/User%7EFamousdog_bfbc.html" title="User:Famousdog">Famousdog</a> 17:59, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>&gt; <i>Look your vague references to eyes being 'tense' as opposed to 'lazy' or 'poor' suggest that you don't know what amblyopia is.</i> Why is the reference vague, please explain. suggest that you don't know what amblyopia is&#160;? That is your opinion&#160;!</p>
<p>&gt; <i>I'm removing this stuff as its just an attempt to promote the Bates method, not an attempt at 'neutrality'</i> It is an attempt to give valueble information about amblyopia.. I am quite sure a lot of people will find this information very interesting not an attempt at 'neutrality' Again that is your opinion Objective people will say you are not neutral by removing this information.</p>
<p>&gt; <i>When they use the term 'lazy eye', ophthalmologists don't mean the eye is actually 'lazy'. Or, indeed, that it is 'tense' and equally meaningless comment. don't mean the eye is actually 'lazy'.</i> I do understand why ophthalmologists call amblyopia lazy eye. It looks like a ambliopic eye is lazy from the ophthalmologists point of view. But when you really understand and know the cause, a far better name is tense eye. Now ophthalmologists give on a subjecitve level false information that the eye is not working hard enough. And make it very hard for the public to find the real reason and solutions. In other words This is very valueable information with a reference everybody can check, When you think the ophthalmologists are right and the natural vision improvement movement is wrong about the cause (?) you are not neutral. Do ophthalmologists say something about the cause of amblyopia by the way&#160;? Or are they vague&#160;? Seeyou 22:06, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>1) Because you haven't defined what 'lazy', 'poor' and 'tense' mean and what they refer to. 2) This information is "valuable" only to people selling useless products supposed to help that only have anecdotal evidence to support their use, not valuable to people with amblyopia. 3) "Tense" is not a better word that "lazy", because neither of them are helpful or descriptive. Ophthalmologist have found out lots of things about the causes, development and nature of Amblyopia and what they have found out certainly isn't "vague". Mainstream ophthalmology and neuroscience (my own particulart interest in this topic) haven't found a cure (yet!), but I believe they one day will. The "natural vision movement" hasn't found a cure either but gives false hope to people by selling its books and tapes on purely anecdotal support rather than proper science. <a href="../../../f/a/m/User%7EFamousdog_bfbc.html" title="User:Famousdog">Famousdog</a> 14:50, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1. Again, why is the reference vague&#160;? Please explain.with arguments&#160;?</p>
<p>2. Fact&#160;: Objective people will say you are not neutral by removing this information. True or untrue&#160;?</p>
<p>The name lazy eye makes it very hard for the public to find the real reason and solutions. In other words This is very valueable information with a reference to a book everybody can check when they are interested, When you think the ophthalmologists are right and the natural vision improvement movement is wrong about the cause (?) you are not neutral. We should be very happy wikipedia can allow this information to reach the public.</p>
<p>Q&#160;: 1) Because you haven't defined what 'lazy', 'poor' and 'tense' mean and what they refer to. I have not defined anything&#160;! A&#160;: I have given a citation from a book with a opposite point of view. ( A lazy eye needs to work harder, a tense eye needs relaxation. )</p>
<p>This information is "valuable" only to people selling useless products supposed to help that only have anecdotal evidence to support their use, not valuable to people with amblyopia. A&#160;: That is your opinion. There also people selling glasses and making a lots of money. This is no argument.</p>
<p>"Tense" is not a better word that "lazy", because neither of them are helpful or descriptive. A&#160;: Tense is far better than lazt because is gives information about the cause and the solution. Lazy describes only the symptom</p>
<p>Mainstream ophthalmology and neuroscience (my own particulart interest in this topic) haven't found a cure (yet!), but I believe they one day will. A&#160;: I don’t think they will find a cure. They have got the wrong starting point, but you never know they might read this.!</p>
<p>The "natural vision movement" hasn't found a cure either but gives false hope to people by selling its books and tapes on purely anecdotal support rather than proper science. A&#160;: That is your opinion. My opinion is the opposite.</p>
<p>I don’t think we will ever come to an agreement. Let’s ask others what they think about the referenced information lazy eye or tense eye&#160;:</p>

<dd>When people are told they have a bad, poor or lazy eye, the assumption is made that the problem is occuring because the eyes are not working hard enough. In truth the opposite is the case – there is to much tension in the visual system. Bates said many types of amblyopia are caused by strain <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</dd>

<dd>(sigh...) Aguing over whether "tense" is a better word than "lazy" doesn't help anybody. Recommending "relaxation" or "swinging of the eyball" is useless. Amblyopia (in laymans' terms as much as possible) is caused by blurred images on the retina during the development of the visual areas of the brain. This can be as a result of strabismus (squint), anisometropia or deprivation of visual input in one eye. The half of the visual system that deals with input from the effected eye develops abnormally, with poorer contrast sensitivity and insensitivity to high spatial and temporal frequencies - probably a direct result of the blurred image during development. There is evidence of "higher-level" deficits such as global motion perception and undercounting of visual features. Whether these high-level deficits are a downstream result of the initial contrast impairment or a result of separate deficits is currently under investigation by several labs, mine included. Thousands of researchers have contributed to this detailed picture of the impairments occuring in amblyopia. Citing Bates' pseudoscience does their work a huge disservice! In conclusion: The Bates Method is based on outdated, spurious research and the flakey opinions of just one man. It has only anecdotal evidence in its favour and <i>I have already wasted far too much time discussing this</i>. <a href="../../../f/a/m/User%7EFamousdog_bfbc.html" title="User:Famousdog">Famousdog</a> 14:29, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

There is also considerations about how much weight is placed on Bate's methods; it appears to me that a wikilink is enough, and a section of a paragraph would give it <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUndue_weight_9fd9.html" title="WP:Undue weight">undue weight</a>. It doesn't matter if Bate's method is true or not, Wikipedia is not the place to debate what is true and what is false, but to report the facts (as <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a> defines them) and POVs as POVs to the extent of the significance of those who take them (of course, you can add as much stuff about Bate's method in the article of that name, but not on this page). I suggest anyone wanting to add the section back to revise Wikipedia policies first. <font size="1">RB<a href="../../../r/b/9/User%7ERB972_9879.html" title="User:RB972">9</a><a href="../../../r/b/9/User_talk%7ERB972_036f.html" title="User talk:RB972">7</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RB972_e3ca.html" title="Special:Contributions/RB972">2</a></font> 23:42, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
