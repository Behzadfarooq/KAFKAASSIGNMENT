<p>Thanks for the advice on my talk page, Ambi. I have now requested comments on the issue (<a href="../../../p/n/a/PNAC_a34d.html" title="PNAC">PNAC</a>). Unfortunately I really think this guy is just a very bad Wikipedian who wants to do more than present his argument - he wants to remove evidence of opposing viewpoints from existence!

<p>FWIW, I got a mail from that guy I banned for vandalizing <a href="../../../u/s/t/Ustase.html" title="Ustase">Ustase</a>. He said how he can see why his commit would be considered provocative, but he thought our article was even more provocative. It particularly irked him that it wasn't just our article, but that a Google search on "Ustase" comes up with almost a dozen Wikipedia mirrors, and he accused us of promulgating a new "sacred truth" through our "minion network". And then there was several paragraphs of ranting on the topic itself.&#160;:) I tried to explain the concept of Wikipedia mirrors and pointed him to Talk:Ustase. --<a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_7c18.html" title="User:Joy">Joy <small><small>[shallot]</small></small></a> 17:30, 30 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good afternoon, Ambi. Apologies if what I said came across as trying to circumvent you. I am quite frustrated right now that so many people are complaining about the deletion process in so many separate discussions but no one is taking the initiative to actually do anything. (Except <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> who put a lot of time into the Managed Deletion proposal. Which appears to be failing.) I think that current practice has drifted badly away from the clear intent of the speedy process. As you say, I have failed to get enough interest in the discussion yet. That's all I'm trying to do. Drum up some interest in the discussion.</p>
<p>I also know that I've failed to convince you of my arguments and so far you've failed to convince me of yours. That's okay. That's why I think we need more minds working on the problem. By the way, I did not intend to imply that your reversion of my proposals was necessarily a bad thing. I meant it as a statement of fact to illustrate the question - again, a lever to try to get others to join the discussion. I've let myself get a bit sleep-deprived lately and if I worded my comments badly, I apologize. I know that we share the same goal - a high quality encyclopedia. I do value your opinions even when we disagree. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> 15:26, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've already <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_in_updating_pages_1d2f.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages">been bold</a> and added a few lines in the speedy case list (clearly marked as Proposed). I think polls on the other scenarios make sense though we may want to put more work into the Managed Deletion precedent pages first. Much vanity is an obvious delete but every few weeks we get a "vanity" article that is just poorly written material about a notable person. (Most recently, that martial arts instructor.) Ads suffer the same problem. The Wikispam and webdirectory listings have to go but Lawson is a Fortune 500 company. Without very clear guidance, we will lose important articles. If we can expand on the precedent pages first, the polling might be clearer. Thanks. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> 15:44, 2 Oct 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I removed stations that I do not regard as being on the North Shore line. Yes trains that travel on the north shore line ALSO travel on to those other stations, but that is AFTER they have left the shore line. I also removed the list of Syd suburban stations, because there is another link to that list nearby. <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThortful_c682.html" title="User:Thortful">Thortful</a> 14:09, 3 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing out that I'm illiterate... I'll go ahead and claim that I was under the impression that months in Australia go backwards, since it's on the bottom of the world (kinda like how water goes down the drain backwards, and summer/winter are reversed from the way God intended them to be).

<p>I didn't remove the case from RfA--I just moved the discussion to one page: I moved everything to one page to keep everything from getting too confusing, as I noted in the edit summary: <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Anthony_DiPierro_0ede.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Anthony DiPierro">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Anthony DiPierro</a>.</p>
<p>Contrary to your assertion, I looked at what DiPierro did.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if your feelings are hurt, but I don't believe anyone's behavior in a request for arbitration should be called "trolling ways", "obvious garbage", or "nonsense". Please just stick to specific evidence rather than using negative characterizations. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Cunctator_a9b6.html" title="User:The Cunctator">The Cunctator</a> 19:53, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's admittedly debatable whether demeaning someone's actions is equivalent to demeaning that person. Don't feel singled out. You're right that I'm not like other members of the arbitration committee. What of it? All people are unique. If I think that people's behavior merits criticism, I'll say so. You're certainly free to ignore it, though I'd hope you wouldn't. So far as I can tell, Anthony has been exceedingly careful to abide within the (arbitrary) rules of the baroque deletion-undeletion fiefdom. Is it not true that several of the deletions he questioned did not follow the guidelines? In my opinion, it is those who break the rules that should be criticized, not the whistleblowers.</p>
<p>Wikipediahimsa says that it is as wrong to find offense where there is none as to cause offense.</p>
<p>I am sorry that you feel personally attacked by me. It is not my intention or desire. I just think it's wrong to call other Wikipedians' actions "obvious garbage". --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Cunctator_a9b6.html" title="User:The Cunctator">The Cunctator</a> 16:06, 6 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Embi. I have added some information to the ANU page. Hopefully it is written well enough and doesn't have too many typos and spelling mistakes in it. With your list of Canberran Suburbs I notice you have linked to "Suburb name, Canberra" some other places around wikipedia I have seen "Suburb name, State" used, which is the more accepted form? Did you need some help creating suburb stubs like for Melbourne? Some useful webpages for suburbs might be the following: <a href="http://203.15.126.40/cgi-bin/search.pl" class="external free" title="http://203.15.126.40/cgi-bin/search.pl" rel="nofollow">http://203.15.126.40/cgi-bin/search.pl</a> for the naming origin of each suburb and <a href="http://www.suburbs.canberra.net.au/html/fsregion.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.suburbs.canberra.net.au/html/fsregion.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.suburbs.canberra.net.au/html/fsregion.htm</a> for a good map of the location of the suburbs, though by the look of your list you may have already used this. Technically Hall and Tharwa, and possibly Oaks estate, the forestry settlments and HMAS Harmon (not too sure about these ones) are not part of Canberra but are located in the ACT.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a> 22:39, 5 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>My idea is to get the lists up, then the articles, and then go back and create prose from all the information people have added to the articles. I think the small intro about uniqueness and isolation is probably enough for now.</p>
<p>I think <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Australian_birds_73ec.html" title="List of Australian birds">List of Australian birds</a> is a good example of how crap it looks if you go straight into prose.</p>
<p>Hopefully at the end of it (which is likely several months away) we should have both a general <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_fauna.html" title="Australian fauna">Australian fauna</a> article and a host of List of Australian Native Species, List of marsupials, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Australian_spiders_5fc2.html" title="List of Australian spiders">List of Australian spiders</a> etc. Or perhaps they'd be better served as categories.

<p>Thanks so much for your supportive comment! I sometimes feel I'm in a lonely battle, attacked both by the familes of sockpuppets on one hand and, on the other, by those who call me an edit warrer or worse for protecting these articles from ruin. Now, with Adam Carr quitting (and TDC on break?), I may literally be alone on the Cambodia articles, the frequent center of it all.

<p>The problem is that just because LaRouche is a total nutter (And I agree wholeheartedly that he is) doesn't mean that his views don't need to be addressed and represented fairly and impartially on <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_LaRouche_df0c.html" title="Lyndon LaRouche">Lyndon LaRouche</a>. That's what NPOV means. That even views from nutters get included sometimes. Especially when those views are really important views for an article, which for <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lyndon_LaRouche_df0c.html" title="Lyndon LaRouche">Lyndon LaRouche</a>, the views of LaRouche pretty clearly are.</p>
<p>To my knowledge neither article got a bunch of unsourced material added. If there is a chunk somewhere, though, please point that out on a talk page. I will ask Herschel and company to go tag it with source information. Because that's what should be done.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree that the article Herschel wanted to write was problematic. It was pro-LaRouche trash. The problem is that Adam's proposed article was just as bad. And whereas, in the end, Herschel has been willing to try to leave the article in a form that presents all the facts, sourced to each side, Adam was not.</p>
<p>I find this unfortunate, and if the article is biased towards LaRouche right now, frankly, the degree to which the LaRouche opponents were unwilling to accept any compromise or inclusion of the LaRouche POVs bears a lot of responsibility for that.</p>
<p>But NPOV is about mustering all the facts and evidence for all sides of an argument and laying it out. Frankly, Herschel has been more willing to do that than Adam. And so, while I think Adam is the better writer, the smarter person, the person I agree with more, and the person I'd rather go for a drink with, I have to say, on this matter, Herschel is being the better Wikipedia contributor. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 15:53, Oct 10, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd say the accusation is less that the PNAC <i>per se</i> exploited 9/11, but Bush and some PNAC members did. (A hair, to be sure.) My understanding is that the PNAC itself is fairly inactive right now, since its main members got actual jobs. But yes the exploitation of 9/11 is a common accusation and deserves to be mentioned, perhaps in this very article. Many other valid criticisms could be added in, such as the costs of the project, the dangers of relying on might, the importance of allies, and so on and so forth. But instead this crowd is trying to base their entire case on a fluke mention of "a new Pearl Harbor" in the midst of one 80+ page report from the PNAC, which means in context nothing like what they say. That's why I say this is tabloid-worthy.</p>
<p>This offhand comment is not noteworthy at all (and indeed was removed from the article for a while), <i>except</i> perhaps to mention that it has been widely (mis)quoted. My impression there is that some lefty zine noted it, reported it without explanation to scare its readership, and through the usual routes the non-story spread. All the while there is <i>serious</i> criticism out there which would be informative and thought-provoking.</p>
<p>The survey is a joke. It's a laundry list of their quibbles with "my" version (actually proposed as a compromise) along with tortuous reasoning for why it's so important, with the survey laid out in a way so that one <i>cannot</i> oppose just some of the statements. The "inherently POV" part was silly, as Bryan conceded, but he kept it anyway. Meanwhile, none of my objections to the other version are even suggested. For instance, there is the sheer illogic of the structure, "A said X would bring about Y. Critics say X later occured." (I like my "In 1999 the Florida Weather Service announced that a Category 3 hurricane could cause extensive damage to ship docks on Miami Beach. Critics of the FWS have suggested that Ivan was just such a hurricane." the best.) Of course, what they're trying to do is use slippery logic to make a prediction into the announcement of a devious plan. Anyway, to stop my own rambling, the point is my concerns weren't addressed.</p>
<p>(There is also the matter of imputing to "supporters of the PNAC" what <i>anyone</i> who read the report could plainly see. My analogy was, "Supporters of Bush say that there is no scientific evidence for the existence of <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reptilian_humanoid.html" title="Reptilian humanoid">reptilian humanoids</a>.")</p>
<p>Anyway, Shorne is trolling the page (he's stalking me now), but other than that it, like most surveys, is getting ignored. The meaningless and one-choice-only questions are not even going to be answered. They'll declare victory anyway and we'll wind up in arbitration, where the ArbCom will ignore us for a month or so and then, well, who's to say?</p>
<p>Sorry this is so long.</p>

I used to pay no attention, but now I see that some people have believed him and I want to stop this. "Nikola tends to ignore talk". This is lie, of my last 500 edits 58 were on article talk pages, while, for example, you, have 26 (I'm not saying that you don't talk enough, just that I do). "He's even admitted in chat that he systematically promotes a certain positions on things (i.e. Serbian hard-line one)." <b>You</b> were also following that chat session and you know that I said of no such thing.

<p>Oh what a load of self-serving nonsense you just wrote (on my talk page). There is absolutely no doubt whatever about the primary rule that governs naming here: i.e., <b>use the simplest, most common unambiguous name</b>. This is the convention your proposed change breaks. The second thing you are doing wrong is barging ahead without any attempt to consult withother users or gain a consensus for change. And the third is hurling accusations at me which, in fact, have no merit whatsoever. It is <i>you</i> who has gone on the renaming spree, and it's high time the community stepped in and put a stop to your high-handed and anti-social behaviour in this matter. Now, if you want to change the naming rules, that's fine. I don't agree with your proposed change, but I will bow to community consensus <i>if</i> and <i>only if</i> you can demonstrate it. So far, you haven't even tried, simply hurled mud at me. <a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETannin_d034.html" title="User:Tannin">Tannin</a> 08:12, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have always felt VfD works magnificently. When something is proposed for deletion and listed as "not notable" the debate that follows is on whether the subject of the article is notable or not, not on whether notability is a valid reason for deletion.

<p>I've been familiar with his work long enough to say that the first recording of his that I bought was on LP. I even managed to attend one of his concerts when he visited Vancouver. I still buy his records when they sporadically show up at the stores, but I'm sure you have more available where you are. I confess to a perverse delight for inserting casual allusions to relatively unknown individuals like Bogle in my mailing list comments.

<p>Why are you trying to remove cited information and the cite itself? Please justify your revert on talk. <a href="../../../s/t/y/User%7EStyle_c7dc.html" title="User:Style">--style</a> 09:09, 2004 Oct 26 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you dispute that Israel used cluster bombs against civilians in the war, then provide evidence (preferably cited) that Israel did not use cluster bombs. Qualification is only needed when there is there is real dispute about a fact. You are not supposed to write, for example, "Person X claims the sky is blue". And Fisk is an internationally acclaimed, award-winning veteran war reporter. Accusing him of dishonesty is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.</p>
<p>Regardless, there is no justification whatsoever for removing the cite, which gives the page number as an aid to readers.</p>
<p>And why do you continually abuse admin rollback, which is meant for vandalism? You are only hurting Wikipedia by ruining the edit history with automatic summaries. <a href="../../../s/t/y/User%7EStyle_c7dc.html" title="User:Style">--style</a> 09:38, 2004 Oct 26 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>I justified my reverts to you.</i> No, you didn't.</p>
<p><i>You know perfectly well why I'm reverting - and you know perfectly well why that paragraph isn't neutral.</i> No, I don't. Facts are facts and opinions are opinions. The two should not be treated like the other. It is a fact that Israel used cluster bombs against civilians, unless you have evidence otherwise.</p>
<p><i>If the cite is so important, add it in without trashing the article's neutrality.</i> Yes, cites are essential, particularly in controversial articles like this. As stated in the <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditing_policy_7a1c.html" title="Wikipedia:Editing policy">edit policy</a>, the obligation is upon editors not to delete important information: <i>whatever you do, try to preserve information.</i>.

<p>Several things. Remembering that the circumstances in which Nettle was elected are similar to that of Steve Fielding of FF, that is through a lot of preferences. Democrat preferences would have gone to Nettle in 2001, but in 2001 many of these preferences won't be there because there won't be many Democrat voters. With the knowledge that the Libs picked up a Democrats seat the Greens were meant to have won because of their "increased vote", it would be harder for Nettle to be re-elected in 2007. In Brown's case, true, he most likely would be re-elected, but remembering that Tasmania's vote is ampliphied in the Senate.</p>
<p>On the topic of Alison and Stock-Despoja. It is not that likely that Alison will lose her seats to the Greens, as her votes aren't <i>all</i> going to the Greens. You also should remember that the minor parties do not have a big presence in Victoria, and many people who have previously voted Democrats for Senate and Lib/Labor for the lower house will just vote straight lib or labor. Stock-Despoja could be replaced by a Green, but the same was said about Meg Lees. <a href="../../../e/v/o/User%7EEvolver_of_Borg_d229.html" title="User:Evolver of Borg">Evolver of Borg</a> 21:00, 2004 Oct 26 (UTC)</p>

<p>What we have here is a very complicated situation. There appears to have been a copy and paste move done between <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist_Revisionism_a7f4.html" title="Zionist Revisionism">Zionist Revisionism</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revisionism_in_the_Israel-Palestine_Conflict_e3f1.html" title="Revisionism in the Israel-Palestine Conflict">Revisionism in the Israel-Palestine Conflict</a>. I am quite happy to merge the two and setup a redirect, however because Zionist Revisionism is on VfD at the moment I don't want to do anything like this right at this moment. Also, it is further complicated by the fact that there is <i>another</i> article called <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_history_denial_a513.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian history denial">Israeli-Palestinian history denial</a>, that's almost exactly the same as the other two. I'm sending a message to all participants so far, requesting their comments on what they think we should do. My own preference is to merge into a more appropriately named article, something like Historical perspectives of Israelis and Palestinians (as that's what this is all about), but I'm flexible. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 12:16, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi Ta bu shi da yu, Zionist Revisionism was the original article. I had moved it to Revisionism in the Israel-Palestine Conflict in an attempt to NPOV it, but Alberuni undid the changes and the move, without redirecting the other article. I have since redirected the 2nd article to another page.--<a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYoshiah_ap_db0d.html" title="User:Yoshiah ap">Josiah</a> 19:35, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Good idea, or you could just merge all three into <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revisionism_in_the_Israel-Palestine_Conflict_e3f1.html" title="Revisionism in the Israel-Palestine Conflict">Revisionism in the Israel-Palestine Conflict</a>. As long as you merge information rather than deleting it, as some have a habit of doing. Don't worry about the VfD entry for <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionist_Revisionism_a7f4.html" title="Zionist Revisionism">Zionist Revisionism</a>; it is invalid. Josiah has, yet again, failed to provide valid reasons for the listing. <a href="../../../s/t/y/User%7EStyle_c7dc.html" title="User:Style">--style</a> 13:01, 2004 Oct 26 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yet again? You obviously don't watch anything I actually do, as 1) That was the first page I had ever put up for deletion - the fact that I had done it wrong should be proof of that, and 2) I and others listed perfectly good reason on the VfD page.--<a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYoshiah_ap_db0d.html" title="User:Yoshiah ap">Josiah</a> 19:35, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would avoid POV titles that are bound to be challenged. As for the VfD entry, it is perfectly valid to list the article for VfD, and the entry will be dealt with via the usual VfD process. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> 15:18, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>I would suggest not to use the word "revisionism" in the title at all. It it nothing but an allusion to historical revisionism (a.k.a. Holocaust denial). Since none of the holders of these views on either side consider their views "revisionism", it would be better if the title did not contain this word. Finally, the potential for confusion with te unrelated <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revisionist_Zionism_b013.html" title="Revisionist Zionism">Revisionist Zionism</a> is enormous. More seriously, I also cannot see how any such page would contain anything but POV fights. Is that really what we need? Does it make sense to keep a list of historical points were Alberuni disagrees with Jayjg? Is that encyclopedic? <a href="../../../g/a/d/User%7EGadykozma_c7d7.html" title="User:Gadykozma">Gadykozma</a> 03:14, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)
