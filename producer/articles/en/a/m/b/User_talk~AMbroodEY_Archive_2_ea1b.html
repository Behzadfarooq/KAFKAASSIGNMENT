<p>I feel for you, I really do, but I have no words of wisdom. The tools we have at our disposal for fighting POV-pushers are the RfC and the Arbcom, and the abuse has to go on for a long time and be really blatant before something happens. Sometimes, if others care, you can tag-team revert until the POV-pusher goes away -- but that requires other people and lot of time and energy, and it's not a NICE thing to do. I'm seeing a bunch of people whom I regard as ill-intentioned doing it to someone who does not deserve the treatment and boy, it looks ugly from the other side.</p>
<p>I'd help you but I'm swamped. I've taken on too much.</p>

<dd>Talking of that species -- take my advise, don't feed the matter. I concur with you, and I now have grave doubts about the veracity of the maratha clans page, but we have nobody of lucid intellect to reason with. His interests are confined to that page, which is anyway dubious, so let us humour him on that and limit him there. Nobody invited him to create an account, but he has, and I prefer not to have the nitwit abusing me at every turn -- I already have my full share of such pains. Do not interpret any message of mine as being endorsement of him or his comments -- how likely is that, I ask you?

<p>I agree it is not personal. This temporary misunderstanding is due to India and Pakistan version of events and history that has been taught and ingrained in their respective citizens due to 59 years of conflict. I was not aware of the deep resentment that has was created due to my edits. South Asia/Indian subcontinent issue can be resolved. Don't worry be happy. RfC is acually proving to be a good thing since it has given oppurtunity to everybody to discuss the issues. I think informing both parties in a RfC should be part of Wikipedia process. When somebody files a RfC against another user then it should be Wikipedia that should inform the accused person and give him/her the instructions how to proceed and where and how to present his/her pint of view. You did the right thing by inviting all the people that had conflict with me and now they have presented their point of view and listened to mine and hopefully all the bottled up resentments will calm down. <a href="../../../s/i/d/User%7ESiddiqui_f1da.html" title="User:Siddiqui">Siddiqui</a> 14:44, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dude,</p>
<p>Yes I am related, a lot of Indians don't realise that Rajputs is not a race but a caste. I am related to the Scindias as well as the other Peshwas, since they gave their daughters to my family and we gave our daughters to them, now everyone is a cousin.</p>
<p>I feel really frustrated about the Rajput article and am thinking of giving up on it all together. Shivraj may have not known how to write an encyclopedic article but he knew his history. And all this crap about the necessity of mentioning that there are Muslim Rajputs is quite ridiculous since every muslim on the subcontinent was once a Hindu.</p>

<p>I think what you said about "acting as if other people didn't exist" is the key. I'm not sure that other people <i>are</i> real to S. I just had a look at his contributions and they're staggering. He seems to spend his whole life writing articles about Pakistan: places, people, etc. It's as if he had a gazeteer of Pakistan in front of him and he's trying to make an article about every proper noun in it. Obsession, tuning other people out ... read the article on <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger%27s_syndrome.html" title="Asperger's syndrome">Asperger's syndrome</a>. I'm familiar with the subject because I might be a borderline "Aspie" myself. It's common among computer nerd types. So I say this from a certain position of sympathy for the bloke, not as a "he's just nuts" dismissal.</p>
<p>I realize, from looking at the list, that I have had an interaction with him -- over the articles <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamshid.html" title="Jamshid">Jamshid</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamshed_Town_ef23.html" title="Jamshed Town">Jamshed Town</a>. He was exactly the same there as you describe him for the Indian history articles -- determined and uncommunicative. But we eventually worked something out, once we got his attention.</p>
<p>I'm coming round now to agreeing that perhaps a ban from <i>some</i> articles might be the best way to deal with the problem. Articles re the Ahmediyya, for sure. Some of the articles re Indian history IF you can demonstrate that there's someone else who's taking the Muslim perspective and will make sure that the articles don't turn into pure Muslim-bashing. Then just let the guy proceed with what he does best, making articles about every mountain peak in the Hindu Kush! <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 18:23, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>AMbroodEY, I don't underestimate the sheer emotion roused by communal issues in South Asia. Ever since I read Vikram Seth's <i>An Unsuitable Boy</i> and got pulled into the world of filmi, I've been watching and reading depictions of communal violence and the Partition. My personal take on the issue is "A pox on both your houses". I have equal disdain for RSS thugs and jihadi killers. That said, I'm not sure that you're as free of POV as you think you are. Of course women and children were abducted and enslaved. But it is also true that many conversions to Islam were made by Sufi pirs, and that many low-caste Hindus converted to a religion that didn't stigmatize them (as much -- still distinctions between the ashraf and the common people). I think you have to distinguish between the violent advent of Islam and the subsequent centuries, during which people settled down to a live-and-let-live arrangement. I don't approve of idealizing the Muslim raiders -- they were much more motivated by loot than religious zeal, IMHO -- but they aren't the whole story. On the one hand, Mahmud of Ghazni ... on the other, Kabir. Or perhaps to pick a modern example, one that I find moving -- the scene in <i>Lagaan</i> where the villagers gather in front of the Hindu temple and pray for victory. The hero is played by a Muslim (Aamir) and the music was written by a Muslim (A.R. Rahman). If you just listen to the lyrics, and don't pay any attention to the picturisation, the song could just as well be a Sufi song.</dd>

<dd>When you get angry at Muslims, think of that song. (Goes for me too -- after all, I'm a kill-on-sight American to some jihadis.) <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 08:02, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it would have been preferable to inform me also of your reorganization of that page. My answers to the allegations have been moved. May be it was not organized according to Wikipedia standard from the begining but we could kept the same existing format until this RfC would have reached a conclusion.

<p>Actually, I have not read the RfC. I went to it, commented on how disorganized it was on the talk page, and refused to <i>try</i> and figure it out.

<p>DeBroodey, you said you had Freddie's definitive biography. Is he labeled there as Persian or Indian Parsi? Because all the Officail internet biographies call him Persian (as in Iranian), with the exception of a few that have decided to stick to the truth. I would like to know. The more I read that he is Persian in these official sources, the more I begin to believe it for some reason. -<a href="../../../a/f/g/User%7EAfghan_Historian_d035.html" title="User:Afghan Historian">User: Afghan Historian</a></p>

<dd>by odd coincidence, i've been doing a lot of research on freddy mercury in the last few days. i've been under the impression that he was indian. from what i've read, his parents were parsis, which from what i've heard are mainly indians. from what i hear, parsis are a type of zoroastrians. <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGringo300_19ab.html" title="User:Gringo300">Gringo300</a> 00:42, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<blockquote style="border: 1px solid blue; padding: 2em;">
<p><b>Hindi wikipedia invites and welcomes Wikipedians to contribute for the cause of spreading knowledge and the Hindi language.</b> This page contains guidelines for writing a wiki-article on any topic at the Hindi Wikipedia, with special recommendations for writing in Hindi (Note: The script/font-family for Hindi is <b>Devanāgari</b>; the script/font-system for English is <b>Roman</b> script, also, the Hindi spelling system is not completely standardized). This article is yet in English language (mostly), in order to encourage even non-native/foreign people who have learnt/are learning Hindi to contribute to the Hindi wikipedia, and native Hindi speakers who normally write in English. The examples given below are only for explanation. Recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly for proper viewing, it is recommended to keep all links NOT-UNDERLINED. Otherwise the मात्रा below the Hindi alphabets might get partly hidden behind the underlines. For this, please go to My Preferences (मेरी पसंद) at the top of the page, then click Misc., and then choose "underline links -&gt; Never". Save your settings. Also, do not click yes for "justify paragraphs", otherwise on some browsers, the devanagari script will appear highly distorted.</li>
<li>All users are requested and encouraged to contribute articles here, especially, to create new articles on general topics. They are also encouraged to expand the existing articles, and improve upon them. A non-user can also do the same; it is recommended but not required to register yourself as a wikipedian user at the Hindi wikipedia. As far as possible, each article should be written with a Neutral Point of View (NPOV)—no nationalistic or partiality or hatred based articles are welcome. The articles should be based on <i>facts</i>—and appropriate references should be provided as and where needed. See the English wiki's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Help%7EContents_Editing_Wikipedia_f2e1.html" title="Help:Contents/Editing Wikipedia">help page for editing in general</a>. Almost all the general wiki-features are available for editing on Hindi wiki too. Guidelines for the content matter is mostly the same as given in English wiki.</li>
<li>Since the Hindi wiki is at its initial stages, users are welcome to take introduction and basic points from the English (or another) wikipedia's corresponding article and translate them for small articles. An in-page link to the English wiki's article will be deemed sufficient for references (a template might be created stating this). For longer articles, it is recommended to mention the references separately.</li>
<li>Since most computer users in India and elsewhere have the standard Western-type keyboard, it is best recommended (but not necessarily required) to use the virtual (software) keyboard like the one of <a href="http://malayalamkeyboard.com/hindimozhi.htm" class="external text" title="http://malayalamkeyboard.com/hindimozhi.htm" rel="nofollow">Hindimozhi</a> or <a href="http://bangla.name/isis/" class="external text" title="http://bangla.name/isis/" rel="nofollow">of ISIS (Tavultesoft Keyman)</a>—which are freewares. These are advantageous because the contemporary Hindi-speakers in India often write messages/chat using Hindi words but written in Roman (English) script, and the layout of these keyboards is quite the same that such people use. For example, using the "normal" keyboard with this software, typing <i>ga</i> would give ग and <i>ghaa</i> would give घा.</li>
<li>Create the article with its name written in Hindi (devanagari script). Always take care to include the nukta (dot below) for foreign / Urdu loanwords wherever it occurs in the standard spelling. For non-Indian names, use that spelling (for article name and other words) which is commonly encountered in Hindi newspapers, G.K.-books, Hindi-dubbed TV documentaries and Hollywood films and magazines. e.g., America-अमरीका (या अमेरिका), China-चीन, French-फ़्रांसिसी. For English acronyms/short-forms, use the initials in Roman script, and again create a full form in Hindi and redirect it to the short form. e.g. <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_96f8.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</a> (अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय ध्वनि वर्णाक्षर); <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_Organization_e65b.html" title="United Nations Organization">UNO</a> (संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघ). Doing the opposite is also fine. But creating the article with the Hindi short form, as सं०रा०सं०, is not recommended. Also, the article proper must be written with the proper nukta, as फ़ारसी, and then, a non-nukta (mis-)spelt version फारसी should preferably be created to redirect to the correct spelling.</li>
<li>Hindi wikipedia strongly recommends the users to write articles in everyday common Hindi in the खड़ीबोली dialect (Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu, i.e., बोलचाल वाली हिन्दी, which may include many loanwords from Persian and Arabic). The use of शुद्ध संस्कृतनिष्ठ हिन्दी is in general neither required nor recommended. E.g., use: वजह instead of कारण, ख़ास instead of विशेष, वगैरह instead of इत्यादि, लेकिन instead of परन्तु etc. However, for <i>technical</i> and <i>specialized</i> vocabulary, the use of शुद्ध संस्कृतनिष्ठ हिन्दी is recommended and usually mandatory. Thus: <i>upper House of Parliament</i>—संसद का उच्च सदन, but not Urdu—मजिलिस का ऐवान-ए-बाला&#160;; <i>Foreign Minister</i>—विदेशमन्त्री, but not Urdu—वज़ीर-ए-ख़ारिजा&#160;; <i>knowledge/science</i>—ज्ञान/विज्ञान, but not इल्म. Use spoken Hindi's ये and वो instead of यह and वह / वे. Do not use the title of respect जी after names, it is unencyclopedic. Thus: कृष्ण / श्री कृष्ण but not कृष्ण जी. Use the आप form and its corresponding 3rd person verbal conjugation for writing about respectable persons. Thus: श्री वाजपेयी मध्य प्रदेश में जन्मे थे. But not: वाजपेयी मध्य प्रदेश में जन्मा था. But do not use the pronoun "आप" itself in-text in biographies.</li>
<li>English should be used sparingly, only when required; i.e., if the corresponding शुद्ध हिन्दी word is too "difficult and not generally encountered", or if it is a proper name of non-Indian person/place/terminology/title, or if the user is highly unsure of the proper translation. It is recommended (but not required) for English-to-Hindi translation while writing articles, the <a href="http://www.shabdkosh.com" class="external text" title="http://www.shabdkosh.com" rel="nofollow">Shabdkosh online dictionary</a> should be used. For each English word, that alternative should be used which is generally encountered in everyday spoken Hindi, and also fits well into the context. Use of intelligent guesses for newly encountered words is also allowed, and so are translations encountered in Hindi-dubbed TV documentaries, Hollywood films, Hindi-translated books, etc. e.g., दमपिशाच for <a href="../../../d/e/m/Dementor.html" title="Dementor">en:Dementor</a> (used in dubbed HP films).</li>
<li>If used, it is recommended to use the English words within the articles using the English (Roman) alphabets rather than devanagari (or better, the devanagari transliteration should be used in the sentence, followed by the English word in Roman alphabet in parentheses). Such words should be italicized and not put in quotation marks. Preferably, there should be an in-page interwiki link (like&#160;:en:) on the word to the English wikipedia. If the word comes as an integral part of a sentence, so as not to break the continuity, the <i>en:</i> prefix should be hidden by writing the word again after the pipe sign (piped link). Thus, recommended: <code>हैरी पॉटर ने ''[[:en:Pensieve|Pensieve]]'' के अन्दर ''[[:en:Little Hangleton|Little Hangleton]]'' गाँव में लॉर्ड वोल्डेमॉर्ट की माँ ''[[:en:Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]]'' को देखा. ''[[:en:Resplendent Quetzal|Resplendent Quetzal]]'' पक्षी के ऊपर एक मेक्सिकन पादरी डा० ''[[:en:Pablo de la Llave|Pablo de la Llave]]'' ने काफ़ी शोध किया था.</code> Whence,
<ul>
<li>हैरी पॉटर ने <i><a href="../../../p/e/n/Pensieve.html" title="Pensieve">Pensieve</a></i> के अन्दर <i><a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Hangleton_cdda.html" title="Little Hangleton">Little Hangleton</a></i> गाँव में लॉर्ड वोल्डेमॉर्ट की माँ <i><a href="../../../m/e/r/Merope_Gaunt_20de.html" title="Merope Gaunt">Merope Gaunt</a></i> को देखा</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Always start the first 1 or 2 lines of the article giving its definition (from any standard dictionary/other wiki) or suitable introduction. Thus, recommended: <b>ललिता सहस्रनामन</b> हिन्दू धर्मसुधारक <a href="../../../%E0%A4%86/%E0%A4%A6/%E0%A4%BF/%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BF_%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF.html" title="आदि शंकराचार्य">आदि शंकराचार्य</a> द्वारा रचित देवी <a href="../../../../hi/%E0%A4%A6/%E0%A5%81/%E0%A4%B0/%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%BE.html" class="extiw" title="hi:दुर्गा">दुर्गा</a> को समर्पित एक पूजा-मन्त्र है, जिसे कई हिन्दू रोज़ श्रद्धा से जपते हैं । But not: <b>ललिता सहस्रनामन</b> मन्त्र जपने के लिये लड्डू-पेड़ा, ताम्बुल, सिन्दूर, लाल चुनरी के साथ नित्य इस मन्त्र का पाठ करें, तो जल्द ही गड़ा हुआ ख़जाना मिलेगा । Recommended: <b>वैमानिक अभियान्त्रिकी</b> (<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeronautical_engineering.html" title="Aeronautical engineering">en:Aeronautical engineering</a>) <a href="../../../../hi/%E0%A4%B5/%E0%A4%BF/%E0%A4%AE/%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8.html" class="extiw" title="hi:विमान">विमानों</a> (<a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft.html" title="Aircraft">en:Aircrafts</a>) की अभिकल्पना, निर्माण और प्रचालन करने का विज्ञान, कला और कार्य है । (<i>translated from Eng. Webster's New World Dictionary</i>). But not: आजकल वैमानिक अभियान्त्रिकी के लिये देशभर में कई कॉलेज खुल गये हैं, जिनमें अग्रणी स्थान यूटोपिया स्थित लालू-यादव टेक्लिनक कॉलेज का है ।</li>
<li>For names of countries, cities, places, languages, people, books, films, technical vocabulary, mythology, etc, start the article like this:
<ul>
<li>1. <code>The name in bold ('''अपोलो''')</code></li>
<li>2. <code>starting parenthesis, then English name in Roman script, in-page interwiki-linked to English wiki ff. by semicolon ((अंग्रेज़ी : [[:en:Apollo]];)</code></li>
<li>3. <code>The native name(s) if applicable in the italicized native script, preferably followed either by its italicized approximate Hindi pronunciation or non-italicized</code> <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonetic_transcription.html" title="Phonetic transcription">phonological transcription</a> <code>within / /, ff. by closed parenthesis (यूनानी : ''Aπollων अपोल्लोन''))</code></li>
<li>4. <code>the rest of the definition or introduction (प्राचीन [[यूनानी धर्म]] (ग्रीक धर्म) और प्राचीन [[रोमन धर्म]] के सर्वोच्च देवता थे ।)</code> For country names, only the standard short form of the name is needed in the first line. If there is a common name for a difficult word in Hindustani, also mention it. Whence: <b>अपोलो</b> (अंग्रेज़ी&#160;: <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo.html" title="Apollo">en:Apollo</a>; यूनानी&#160;: <i>Aπollων अपोल्लोन</i>) प्राचीन <a href="../../../../hi/%E0%A4%AF/%E0%A5%82/%E0%A4%A8/%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%80_%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE.html" class="extiw" title="hi:यूनानी_धर्म">यूनानी धर्म</a> (ग्रीक धर्म) और प्राचीन <a href="../../../../hi/%E0%A4%B0/%E0%A5%8B/%E0%A4%AE/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8_%E0%A4%A7%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE.html" class="extiw" title="hi:रोमन_धर्म">रोमन धर्म</a> के सर्वोच्च देवता थे । If you don't give the interwiki English/another language link (which would be deemed to be the default reference), then you MUST provide an appropriate reference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Please leave no article without an appropriate category. See the list of created categories <a href="../../../../hi/c/a/t/%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B7%7ECategories_b9c2.html" class="extiw" title="hi:विशेष:Categories">here</a>; you can also make a new category (pref. in Hindi). Please leave no article without at least <b>ONE</b> off page (like en:) interwiki link. E.g., the user can check the article name (say Apollo) on the finally redirected English page and append to the Hindi article (<code>[[en:Appolo]])</code>). These interlanguage links will help a bot to update all interwiki links for that article in all wikipedias. The category and the aforementioned link should be typed at the end of the article. If the article is very small, mention it as a stub/substub.</li>
<li>Use of templates is welcome. See the list of templates <a href="../../../../hi/t/e/m/%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%A3%E0%A5%80%7ETemplates_cb0d.html" class="extiw" title="hi:श्रेणी:Templates">here</a>. If creating a template, name it pref. in Hindi.</li>
<li>Use पूर्णविराम ( । ) instead of a period (.) for ending statements. The पूर्णविराम, semicolon, colon and dash (but not comma) must come after one space after the word to prevent ambiguity. Use the international form of the Hindu-Arabic numerals (1,2,3 instead of १,२,३), as used by the Constitution and the Government of India (even for Hindi). There is no need to use the हलन्त at the end of Sanskrit words wherever it occurs. Hence, prefer: संसद over संसद्; अथर्वन over अथर्वन्. Use the proper quotation marks “” from the Insert toolbox, not "". Write dates as 2 मई 2006 (ईसवी or ईसापूर्व). Write time as 3:45 pm. Separate common suffix-words like शास्त्र, विज्ञान, ज्ञान with a hyphen. Thus: रसायन-शास्त्र. For most others, leave both the words of the noun-cluster free. Combine them into one word only if it is very common to do so. Thus: सामवेद.</li>
<li>The use of <b>ज़</b> for the <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiced_alveolar_fricative.html" title="Voiced alveolar fricative">en:voiced alveolar fricative</a> (/z/, as in <b>z</b>oo, ro<b>s</b>e) is fundamentally wrong. Its nearest counterpart is the <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiceless_alveolar_fricative.html" title="Voiceless alveolar fricative">en:voiceless alveolar fricative</a> /s/ (as in <b>s</b>ea), and not Hindi ज (<a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiced_palatal_plosive.html" title="Voiced palatal plosive">en:voiced palatal plosive</a>). Hence, it is suggested and recommended that for the sound /z/, whether it comes in English (etc.) spellings (z) for while pronunciation otherwise, should be transcribed as <b>स़</b> (स with a dot below, available in the Insert toolbox). Hence: Reason <b>रीस़न</b>, not रीज़न&#160;; Roses <b>रोस़ेस़</b>, not रोज़ेज़. But common Hindi words borrowed from Persian/Arabic (so-called Urdu words) are allowed to continue with ज़ spelling. Thus: ज़रा, नज़र, तर्ज़. The <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiced_postalveolar_fricative.html" title="Voiced postalveolar fricative">en:voiced postalveolar fricative</a> (/ʒ/ as in trea<b>s</b>ure), inexistent in Hindi, can similarly be transcribed with <b>श़</b>. Thus: treasure <b>ट्रॅश़र</b>. The nukta (dot) available in the Insert toolbox can be combined with various consonants to suggest a more exact phonetic devanagari rendering of foreign sounds. E.g., since phonetically, English Think and this are not equal to थिंक and दिस, a better transcription could be <b>थ़िंक</b> and <b>द़िस</b>. <b>Please take care of the dot below in so-called Urdu words, otherwise the Hindi spelling is deemed incorrect</b>.</li>
<li>For the following English vowels m<b>e</b>t, m<b>a</b>te, m<b>a</b>t, transcribe as मॅट (short vowel), मेट (not मेइट), मैट (not मॅट, as popular in Marathi). However in contemporary Hindi and here, it is acceptable to use ए instead of ऍ. Thus: अमेरिका is more popular than अमॅरिका. For c<b>o</b>t, c<b>oa</b>t, c<b>au</b>ght, transcribe as कॉट, कोट, कॉट (not कौट). Transcribe English /t/ and /d/ as ट and ड.</li>
<li>Use half-न before त, थ, द, ध, न, instead of anuswaar अं. Use half-म before प, फ, ब, भ, म. Use the anuswaar before all the rest of the consonants (not half-ङ, ञ, ण). If the मात्रा is not above the alphabet, use chandra-bindu, but only for <b>nasalization</b>. Thus: अन्दर, not अंदर&#160;; अन्त, not अंत&#160;; हिन्दी, not हिंदी&#160;; सम्भव, not संभव&#160;; पंचमी, not पञ्चमी&#160;; अंडा, not अण्डा&#160;; कंठ, not कण्ठ&#160;; लैंड, not लैण्ड&#160;; आँख, not आंख. However, both forms are acceptable in contemporary Hindi as well as here; the prec. are just recommendations.</li>
<li>When proceded by another vowel, use the pure vowels instead of य (unless the य is clearly articulated while pronouncing). Thus&#160;: जाएँ, not जायें (not जावें)&#160;; आएगा, not आयेगा . However, both forms are acceptable in contemporary Hindi as well as here.</li>
<li>Please pay careful attention to the masculine/feminine gender (and singular/plural) in adjectives and verbs, else the sentence becomes ungrammatical.</li>

<p>Thanks!!Unfortunately our most time is spent combating with these Kannadi vandalists!!But I am taking it lightly as <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaon.html" title="Belgaon">Belgaon</a> article is locked.Currently I am working on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marathi.html" title="Marathi">Marathi</a> article.</p>
<p>Btw u embarrassed me by giving word to word translation of my talks with Arya!I hope our dear admin wont bash me for that&#160;;).Seriously those so called Kannadi editors cum vandalisers are going on my nerves.They wisely choose their sources which will help them to market Kannada and Karnataka.If u have any knowledge of <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashtrakuta.html" title="Rashtrakuta">Rashtrakuta</a> plz do check if that article is fine.<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 14:43, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for ur reply.I actually liked Sawai Raja's posts as it is a experience we all Maharashtrians undergo.U may call it nihilism,perhaps we are a bit jingoist here but blame it to present socio-political-economical conditions.We are not like this by birth,our fellow Indians have made us this way. Thanks for ur concern about anti-Bramhinism stuff,but believe its hardly in the minds of common Marathas.I have talked about it with my Maratha friends openly and they surely are not that red with anger as this Sambhaji Brigade comrades.Morever,it hardly matters if anyone taunts Bramhins as I dont consider myself as a Bramhin,I consider myself a Maharashtrian first.</p>
<p>Compromises are the biggest mistakes,we have done,according to my opinion.Had we reacted sharply like this Kannadis or Northis,we wouldnt have taken for a ride in the name of National integration.If India and our 'Indian brothers' ahve no love or respect for us,I dont think I should 'compromise' and let my language die.Frankly speaking 'Indian first' is an illusion in Indian.No one here is Indian first.And going thru many bitter and inflammatory experiences in my life(im just 21 and so much oppression!)I dont think I shall be Indian first.Sadly I cant relate and feel secure by considering myself one.But,I hope in spite of that,we shall bond to improve Marathi/Maharashtra related articles. <a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 18:52, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah!But our unrest is not on this issue.As I mentioned earlier it has complex socio-political-economical reasons!Consider this-When I leave go on the streets of Mumbai,capital of my state Maharashtra,I cant speak in my mother-tongue and official language of my state,Marathi.We are dominated in ALL ways by these outsiders.We are reduced to mere 25% in our state-capital.I hate these outsiders from the depth of my heart.<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 19:15, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>U said it!Maharashtrians should get economic power.I guess ur not that ignorant about conditions here. About my hatred,see this moron <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">User:Sarvagnya</a> unneccessarily badmouthing me everywhere to impress admin and issuing nonsense warnings for no reasons.BTW isnt calling names permitted on talk pages!</p>
<p>Hey,I have one more querry.Suppose I photograph a copyrighted image,is that thing allowed on wikipedia?Note that the images I have uploaded until now arent copyrighted.I mean,if such tricks are valid,I can upload many images!<a href="../../../m/a/h/User%7EMahawiki_4ad2.html" title="User:Mahawiki">mahawiki</a> 19:38, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi AMbroodey, good to know that you are half-Marathi. Well, I am not badmouthing Kannadi people just like that, it's because they instigated me. See the talk page of <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaon.html" title="Belgaon">Belgaon</a> and you will know.</p>
<p>As far as Sawai Raja's commment is concerned, I agree with everything he said except the one comment about Marathi Brahmins. I don't like casteist uotfits like Sambhaji Brigade although I am a Maratha. Marathi Brahmins have been extremely good to me in personal life as well. We often dine together. In fact, anyone who is Marathi, I consider them my brothers. So caste &amp; religion doesn't come in between. We Maharashtrians are an ethno-linguistic group. So there must be no internal conflict.</p>
<p>As far as anti-Marathi prejudice is concerned, you are not aware of it as you stay in UK. But here in India, it is one of the worst prejudices faced by any community in this region. I think even Muslims and North-Easterners are not prejudiced this much. Sikhs, Bengalis and South Indians are stereotyped but never discriminated against. Maharshtrians are not just stereotyped, they are "looked down" upon. Just check out any Mumbai English language newspaper, you will find anti-Marathi bias alarmingly regular. As it is, many non-Marathi owned colleges in Mumbai, were set-up after Maharashtra Government gave them land on discounted &amp; subsidized prices. But these colleges rarely admit Maharashtrian students as they have quotas for their own people. And this is a fact. The state of Maharashtrians in <a href="../../../m/u/m/Mumbai.html" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgaon.html" title="Belgaon">Belgaon</a> is very bad. As mahawiki said, in Mumbai, we have to speak in Hindi. Only the other day, there was a dispute between two people and I saw one of them seaking Marathi and the other guy was repeatedly telling him to speak in Hindi, <i>kyun ke yeh Mumbai hai, yeha Marathi nahi chalta&#160;!</i> Another day, I was travelling in a Taxi and the cab-driver, a Bihari, not aware that I am a Maharashtrian, was ranting against Maharashtrians, for seemingly no reason ata all. I gave him a good one on what Mumbai is and whose is it. So, it is not a hear&amp;say, but we have experienced it. I can give you umpteen examples of anti-Marathi bias, but then the comment would become ten times bigger than even Sawai Raja's comment.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for your concern. Bye and take care.</p>

<p>We have not corresponded before, but I appreciate your words in my Arbcomm. I have noticed your edits on wikipedia articles before and was impressed by many of them. I was wondering if you would resume your contributions or whether you wish to continue your wikibreak.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, I'm not actually Bene Israel (though your statements concerning them were correct). I am, in fact, a Baghdadi Jew by matrilineage, though my dad comes from a fairly long line of Maharashtrian Mumbaikars. My mom's family was originally from the middle east (Baghdad, hence Baghdadi) who emigrated to India about a century and a half ago (not unlike the famous <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Sassoon_9133.html" title="David Sassoon">David Sassoon</a>), fleeing anti-semitism in the middle east.Thus, my mom was born in Mumbai only, making me essentially a full Maharashtrian/Indian + a Jew. Needless to say, I am not a happy person (jes' kiddin'&#160;:) ) .<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a></p>

<dd>Well done on your comments. I especially liked your blog entry. Something has to be done about this. Hindutva is mentioned with a negative undertone all over Wikipedia. If you go to a page and say you are a Hindutvavadi you lose your credibility. This is NOT how things should be. To be Hindutva is not to be Hindu fundamentalist. Hindutva is simply based on pride in the Hindu Dharma, now is that a crime? <b><a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkblue">Noble</font><font color="darkorange">eagle</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENobleeagle_accc.html" title="User talk:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">[TALK]</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nobleeagle_dfb1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">&#160;[C]</font></a></sup> 04:09, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
