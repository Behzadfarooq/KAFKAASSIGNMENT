<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambling.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2>
<p>The amble was particularly prized in <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horses_in_the_Middle_Ages_decc.html" title="Horses in the Middle Ages">Horses in the Middle Ages</a> due to the need for people to travel long distances on poor roads. As roads improved and <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carriage.html" title="Carriage">carriage</a> travel became more common, followed later by <a href="../../../r/a/i/Railroad.html" title="Railroad">railroads</a>, riding horses that trotted became more popular in Europe; the dominant uses of riding horses came to include <a href="../../../l/i/g/Light_cavalry.html" title="Light cavalry">light cavalry</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_hunting.html" title="Fox hunting">fox hunting</a> and other types of rapid travel across country, but of more limited duration, where the gallop could be used. The amble was still prized in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/Americas.html" title="Americas">Americas</a>, particularly in the southern <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> where <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plantation.html" title="Plantation">plantation</a> agriculture required riders to cover long distances every day to view fields and crops. Today, ambling or gaited horses are popular amongst casual riders who seek soft-gaited, comfortable horses for pleasure riding.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambling.html" title="Edit section: Types of gaits">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Types of gaits</span></h2>
<p>Some ambling gaits are lateral gaits, meaning that the feet on the same side of the horse move forward one after the other, (for example, a footfall pattern of left rear, left front, right rear, right front) others are diagonal, meaning that the feet on opposite sides of the horse move forward in sequence (for example, left rear, right front, right rear, left front)</p>
<p>Not all horses can perform an ambling gait. However, many breeds can be trained to produce them, and there are several breeds of horses who inherit the ability to perform these gaits either naturally from birth or with a minimal amount of training. In some cases, horses without natural gaited ability can be taught an ambling gait by being slightly restrained at a trot or pace while the length of the stride is kept long, but the rider will ask the horse to alter its balance so that the two strides break up in such a manner to produce a four-beat gait.</p>
<p><a name="Running_Walk" id="Running_Walk"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambling.html" title="Edit section: Running Walk">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Running Walk</span></h3>
<p>The Running Walk is a four-beat gait with footfalls in the same sequence as the regular walk, but characterized by greater speed and smoothness. The horse retains a regular 4-beat cadence but the running walk is characterized by an extreme overreach of the hind foot (often being placed as far as 24 inches ahead of where the front foot landed) and speeds of up to 10 mph. It is a distinctive natural gait of the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee_Walking_Horse_1665.html" title="Tennessee Walking Horse">Tennessee Walking Horse</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambling.html" title="Edit section: Slow gait">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Slow gait</span></h3>
<p>The <b>slow gait</b> is a general term for several slightly different gaits that follow the same general footfall pattern as the walk, in that lateral pairs of legs move forward in sequence, but the rhythm and collection of the movements are different. The common thread is that all are smooth gaits, comfortable to the rider. Terms for various slow gaits include the <i>stepping pace</i> and <i>singlefoot</i>. Some slow gaits are natural to some horses, while others are developed from the pace or the trot. All are very smooth; the stepping pace is said to have been used at times to transport wounded soldiers from battlefields.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambling.html" title="Edit section: Rack">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rack</span></h3>
<p>The <b>rack</b> or <b>racking</b> is a gait that is also known historically as the "Virginia Single-foot Gait," with many breeds of horses capable of producing this gait, but most commonly associated with the Five-Gaited <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Saddlebred_094f.html" title="American Saddlebred">American Saddlebred</a>. In the rack, the speed is increased to be approximately that of the pace, but instead of being a two-beat gait like the trot and the pace, it is a four-beat gait with equal intervals between each beat.</p>
<p>The rack, like other intermediate gaits, is smoother than the trot because the hooves hitting the ground individually rather in pairs minimizes the force and bounce the horse transmits to the rider. To achieve this gait the horse must be in a "hollow position". This means that, instead of a rounded back as seen in <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dressage.html" title="Dressage">dressage</a> horses and those that work off their hind quarters, the spine is curved downward. This puts the racking horse in the best position to rack without breaking into another gait. If the rider sits back or leans slightly back, this will cause the hollow back, or the back to curve downward. This allows the legs to trail and makes the rack easier for the horse. The downside of this is that this position weakens the back and makes the horse less able to carry the weight of the rider without strain.</p>
<p>A speed racker can be as fast as a canter. The ride is smooth, and the rider appears to remain motionless as the horse racks. The horse itself maintains a fairly still head and most of the action is in the legs.</p>
<p>The rack is a genetic trait in a breed called the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racking_horse.html" title="Racking horse">Racking horse</a>. A racking horse can rack as easily as other horses trot or canter. At <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse_show.html" title="Horse show">horse shows</a>, the Slow gait and the Rack are required gaits for the Five-Gaited <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Saddlebred_094f.html" title="American Saddlebred">American Saddlebred</a>, who also performs the walk, trot and canter.</p>

<p>The <b>fox trot</b> is most often associated with the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri_Foxtrotter_eeaa.html" title="Missouri Foxtrotter">Missouri Foxtrotter</a> breed, but is also seen under different names in other gaited breeds. The fox trot is a four-beat diagonal gait in which the front foot of the diagonal pair lands before the hind, eliminating the moment of suspension and giving a "no bounce" ride. The foxtrot is a comfortable gait for trail-riding. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>The <b>Tölt</b> (also, less correctly, <i>Tolt</i>) is a gait that is often described as being unique to the <a href="../../../i/c/e/Icelandic_Horse_ddd3.html" title="Icelandic Horse">Icelandic Horse</a>. In its pure form, the footfalls are the same as in rack, but the <a href="../../../i/c/e/Icelandic_horse.html" title="Icelandic horse">Icelandic horse</a> is bred for more freedom and liquidity of movement. The most prized horses have a very long stride and high lift with their forelegs.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> Icelandic Riders will demonstrate the smoothness of a tölt by going at the speed of a gallop without spilling a drink they hold. However, some horses have a tölt that is considered imperfect, and may be described as a "trotty tölt" or a "pacey tölt".<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>The majority of Icelandic horses can also pace, and are thus called "five-gaited". Their five gaits are walk, trot, canter, tölt, pace. Good pacers are held in high regard in this breed, but for a pacer to stand out he has to be able to perform the pace at a high speed.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> Slow pacing in Icelandic horses is considered a major flaw. A horse that goes at a slow pace, or "piggy-pace," is called <i>lullari.</i></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambling.html" title="Edit section: From the 1728 Cyclopedia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">From the 1728 <i>Cyclopedia</i></span></h2>
<p>Historically, ambling was a topic of considerable discussion amongst horse trainers in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>. The <i>1728 Cyclopedia</i> discussed one form of the gait (the type derived from the pace) and some of the training methods used to create it in a horse that was not naturally gaited:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Ambling, in <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horsemanship.html" title="Horsemanship">horsemanship</a>, is a peculiar kind of <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pace.html" title="Pace">pace</a>, wherein a horse's two legs of the same side move at the same time. The ambling horse changes sides at each remove, two legs of a side being in the air, and two on the ground, at the same time. An amble is usually the first natural page of young <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colt_%28horse%29.html" title="Colt (horse)">colts</a>, which as soon as they have strength enough to <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trot.html" title="Trot">trot</a>, they quit. There is no such thing as an</i> amble <i>in the manage,</i> (a riding arena for schooling horses) <i>the riding masters</i> (early practitioners of <a href="../../../c/l/a/Classical_dressage.html" title="Classical dressage">Classical dressage</a>) <i>allowing of no other paces beside <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walk.html" title="Walk">walk</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trot.html" title="Trot">trot</a>, and <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse_gait.html#Gallop" title="Horse gait">gallop</a>. Their reason is that a horse may be put from a trot to a gallop without stopping him, but not from an</i> amble <i>to a gallop, without such a stop, which interrupts the justice and cadence of the manage.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Faulty methods</b></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>There have been various practices and methods of discipline for bringing a young horse to amble. Some choose to toil him in his foot-pace through newly-<a href="../../../p/l/o/Plow.html" title="Plow">plowed</a> lands, which naturally inures him to the stroke required in the amble. Its inconveniences are the weakness and lameness that such disorderly toil may bring on a young horse. Others attempt it by sudden stopping, or checking him in the cheeks, when in a gallop; and thus putting him into a confusion between gallop and trot, so that losing both, he necessarily stumbles on an amble. However, this is apt to spoil a good mouth and <a href="../../../r/e/i/Rein.html" title="Rein">rein</a>, and exposes the horse to the danger of an hoof-reach, or <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinew.html" title="Sinew">sinew</a>-strain, by over-reaching, etc.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Others prefer ambling by weights as the best way. To this end, some overload their horse with excessively heavy shoes, which is apt to make him interfere, or strike short with his hind feet. Others fold <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead.html" title="Lead">lead</a> weights about the <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetlock.html" title="Fetlock">fetlock</a> <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastern.html" title="Pastern">pasterns</a>, which are not only liable to the mischiefs of the former, but put the horse in danger of incurable strains, crushing of the <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronet.html" title="Coronet">coronet</a>, and breeding of ring-bones, etc. Yet others load the horse's back with earth, lead, or other heavy substances, which may occasion a swaying of the back, overstraining the <a href="../../../f/i/l/Fillet.html" title="Fillet">fillets</a>, etc.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Some endeavor to make him amble in hand, ere they mount his back, by means of some wall, smooth pale or rail, and by checking him in the mouth with the bridle-hand, and correcting him with a rod on the hinder hoofs and under the belly when he treads incorrectly. However, this is apt to drive a horse to a desperate frenzy, ere he can be made to understand what they would have of him, and to rear, sprawl out his legs, and make other antic postures, which are not easily stopped again. Others think to effect it by a pair of hind shoes with long spurns or plates before the toes, and of such a length that if the horse offers to trot, the hind foot beats the fore foot. But this occasions wounds of the back sinews, which often bring on incurable lameness.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Some attempt to procure an amble by folding fine, soft lists (flanks of pork) straight around his <a href="../../../h/o/c/Hock_%28zoology%29.html" title="Hock (zoology)">hocks</a>, in the place where he is gartered for a <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stifle.html" title="Stifle">stifle</a> strain, and turn him thus to grass for two or three weeks, and afterwards take aways the list. This is the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spain.html" title="Spain">Spanish</a> method, but is disapproved, for though a horse cannot then trot but with pain, yet the members must be sufferers, and though the amble is gained, it must be slow and unsightly, because attended with a cringing in the hind parts.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Proper method</b></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In effect, ambling by the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trammel.html" title="Trammel">trammel</a></i> (a type of leg restraint) <i>appears the nearest to nature, the best and most assured way. There are diverse errors usually practised in this method, such as, that the trammel is often made too long, and so gives no stroke, but makes a horse hackle and shuffle his feed confusedly. It may also be made too short, which makes him volt and twitch up his hind feet so suddenly that by custom it brings him to a string-halt, from which it will scarce ever be recovered. Sometimes the trammel is misplaced, and to prevent falling put above the knee, and the hind hoof. In which case, the horse cannot give any true stroke, nor can the fore leg compel the hind to follow it. If, to evade this, the trammel is made short and straight, it will press the main sinew of the hind leg, and the fleshy part of the fore thighs, so that the horse cannot go without halting before, and cringing behind.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>As to the form of the trammel, some make it all of <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leather.html" title="Leather">leather</a>, which is inconvenient, in that it will either stretch or break, and thus confound the certainty of the operation. In a true trammel, the side-ropes are to be so firm, as not to yield a hair's breadth; the hose soft, and to lie so close, as not to move from its first place; and the back-band flat, no matter how light, and to descend from the fillets so as not to gall.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>When the horse by being trammeled on one side, has attained to amble perfectly in the hand, it is to be changed to the other side, and that to be likewise brought to rule. When, by this changing from one side to another, with a half trammel, the horse will run and amble in hand, readly and swiftly, without snappering and stumbling, which is ordinarily done by two or three hours labour, the whole trammel is to be put on, with the broad, flat, back-band, and both sides trammeled alike.</i></dd>
