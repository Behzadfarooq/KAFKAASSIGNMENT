<p>Ambi, I keep revising the entry for 'Gwen Araujo' due to the fact that the person who initially posted it made it a politically correct transgendered issues diatribe, and by no means was it a fair depiction. It is a political footstomp that assigns motivation using a very psuedo-psychiatric term 'Transphobia' -a term that seems to have no real meaning, and is not a disorder that I am aware of. The bottom line is that a trial is still in process and the defendants have yet to be judged. This author is making assumptions of motivation and concluding that this is a "hate crime" without knowing what actually happened! An Encyclopedia isn't the place for manifestos, and my revisions were minor. I resent that you seem to be faulting me for attempting to revise a piece that is clearly in breach of wikipedia's rules! Thank you!</p>

<p>Hey Ambi,</p>
<p>I'm in major trouble. I'm a student in the UK, and I'm involved in the Oxford Union, a major student society. I very stupidly posted a wikipedia article about the Union's last round of committee elections (it's called Oxford Union Hilary 2005 Elections), and I've since found out that I'm not allowed to have done that, under the Union's rules. I've requested an article delete, because if it stays online, I could get thrown off committee or fined a lot of money. However, some of the other Oxford people have been going onto the delete page and requesting that we keep the article - I think so that they can get me into trouble -- is there any way I can just get this thing deleted? It's got me seriously worried, I should never have posted it. And I should never have gone into student politics. Help!</p>

<p>I think sufficient evidence has been added for arbitration to continue. Do you think you can review your decision in the arbitration of Yuber?</p>

<p>I don't want to rush you, but you made a promise to review your verdict when new information was to be presented. New information has, but you have failed to fulfill your pledge. Yuber is still vandalising pages, and your inadvertant stonewalling is drawing out the preliminary case longer than it needs to be. At least reply to my requests so I know that there are legitimate reasons for your inability to act.</p>

<p>Ambi, have a serious issue on <a href="../../../z/o/r/Zoroastrianism.html" title="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a>. It says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Traditional Jews and Christians typically seek to place Zoroaster's life at as late a date as possible, so as to avoid the conclusion that much of the theology and morality of the non-Torah parts of the Old Testament derive from Zoroastrianism, the ideas having flowed into Judaism during the Babylonian captivity which happened shortly after 600 BC.</dd>

<p>You do realise that it was not me making changes from BCE/CE to BC/AD. All those articles started off on consistent BC/AD notation before SC visited them. He then systematically changed them to his preferred notation. I, and a number of other editors then reverted them back.</p>
<p>The manual of style permits both styles. Slrubenstein put forward a proposal to ban BC/AD notation. Despite the flaws in his vote and the one-sided nature of it, he failed even to garner a majority, let alone gain the consensus necessary to gain a consensus. Despite that, and in full knowledge of that and egged on by Slrubenstein, SC changed articles as though that proposal had passed. He was reverted.</p>
<p>It seems strange that ArbCom is deciding on what is effectively a content matter that SC is right to make his changes and right to insist on them despite the community clearly not accepting Slrubenstein's proposals. The ArbCom is then going on to find me guilty of what SC and Slrubenstein have been doing - ie changing one perfectly permissible style to another one, despite opposition, and reverting aggressively to enforce their change.</p>
<p>May I ask you to reconsider your votes in the light of these comments? Kind regards, <a href="../../../j/g/u/User%7EJguk_6c2f.html" title="User:Jguk">jguk</a> 12:33, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Ambi. What's with the update tags? I took a look at the article history for <a href="../../../g/e/e/Geelong_railway_line%2C_Victoria_96ca.html" title="Geelong railway line, Victoria">Geelong railway line, Victoria</a> and I'm thinking it must be another article you refer to? I did begin this article and return later to stub it later. Was it another maybe?</p>
<p>You might be referring to a situation I remember of a few days back where a local rail related article mentioned a future <a href="../../../g/r/o/Grovedale.html" title="Grovedale">Grovedale</a> line extension. As I'm living in Geelong, I knew the information in the article to be long out of date, and I didn't know the current track or line situation at hand to update it. (I don't use rail transport all that often, so rather than leave the article out of date, my update tag said 'hey, this is wrong, somebody knows, please fix it if you can). If you came along to update it later, the goal was acheived, and thank you. I don't like the look of those god awful templates at all but they do work and acheive their purpose.</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/o/i/Going_Home_3e12.html" title="Going Home">Going Home</a>? The article needed wikifying, to link all actors in my opinion, and thats exactly the tag I placed on the page. I could have done it myself sure, but not being a big television watcher either, a 2 second edit for yourself might become a 10 minute edit for myself to verify a list of actors I'd never heard of before, and to determine whether or not they were career actors or just people sitting on a train luckly enough to be included in a film, and if they're deserving of a link at all. I see now they're all red links so I suspect a few of them might be somewhat unknowns?</p>
<p>Both edits in my eyes achieved the end result of the article being improved. Overall, I'm here to improve Wikipedia, and if a 2 second edit, or a 20kb article comes from my keyboard, they're all movements towards providing a useful, informative encyclopedia. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> | <a href="../../../l/o/n/User_talk%7ELonghair_0f2b.html" title="User talk:Longhair">Talk</a> 22:31, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Ambi.

The page outline is a copy of the WikiProject Australian law, and has yet to be completely customised - partly because I am unsure as to what the Project should cover.

<dd>I'm terribly sorry! I haven't lost interest, just my memory… I read your comments, intended to respond, but was then sidetracked. I've been half-revising for exams, and half-monitoring/editing Wikipedia - although I really shouldn't be. But back to the topic at hand, your suggestions (here and at the Project page) are sensible. It does seem ridiculous to have an article counter when the number of associated articles is ever-growing. I have doubts that a COTW would be maintained (look at the Australian one!), but the article adoption programme seems reasonable. I noticed that was a scheme used at the WikiProject Melbourne. Has that been successful? Also, would priority be given to certain articles, or would the adopter just choose. A COTW would probably be more successful (in drastically expanding articles), but it would require numerous dedicated editors (like you).</dd>

<dd>Additionally, we need to set the scope of the project and identify areas of particular need. This is something you’re going to know a lot more about than me – I’ve somewhat neglected my initial wish to edit Australian politics articles. I’ve just created an empty Open Tasks template for the Project. I’ll transfer my (related) comments to the Project talk-page, for further discussion there. After further modification of the Project page, I’ll “launch” it (place it on WikiProjects, the Wikiportal and AWNB).</dd>

<p>Ambi, quite concerned that the Franklin article lacks an important nomenclature issue. The HEC bless their little socks never specifically referred to the Franklin dam as such. So the article has me in a quandary. They called it the Lower Gordon Power Development Scheme and never really called it the Franklin.

I did what <i>any adult Wikipedian</i> would have done. Deleting it was never a question.

Burke and Wills are probably most well known for that fateful expedition, but they're also entirely notable in and of themselves, and deserving of seperate articles. The redirects discourage people from writing those articles, so I deleted the redirects, as part of cleaning up a list of Australian biography articles we don't have, in the hope that someone will indeed write them. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 06:21, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ambi, darling, baby, sugarcakes...</p>
<p>Maybe we got off on the wrong foot.</p>
<p>You see, Commander Cool isn't a hater. He's a cool guy (just look at his name).</p>
<p>All this benevolent personality wanted was his own little nook on the Internet, where he and a privileged few would be able to sit and have a good time at the expense of no one.</p>
<p>Well, maybe Kirstie Alley...but I can rescind that, if you wish.</p>
<p>In this crazy, mixed-up world we live in, wouldn't it be nice if, every now and then, people had a little area to go to for rest and relaxation from their troubles and woes? (I am reminded of the TV show "Cheers." But I don't know if they got that in Aussie land, so maybe you aren't as reminded as I am). That's all the <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommander_Cool_Commander_Cool_e7fa.html" title="User:Commander Cool/Commander Cool">Commander Cool personal article</a> ever offered.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is probably the last you'll hear from me (never shall it be said that the good Commander pesters those who would rather not be pestered!). Oh, and it ripped the good Commander's heart just the littlest bit to find his previous comment erased from your archive...perhaps this poor, meager attempt at communication will find a more lasting place in your infinite mercy.</p>

<p>Ambi, would you do me a quick favour?

<li>Very sorry to have confused you. After I left you the above message, I discovered that it is now possible to move an article to a new title that already has an article, provided it is a redirect to the old article and has no history. So I was able to perform the move myself. When I returned here to withdraw the above request, Wikipedia locked for editing for a day or so.

<p>Ambi, I want to apologize for my behavior during Eequor's RfA. You stated that oppose voters were being subjected to a hostile interrogation, and as I reread over the page, I understand your feelings in this matter. I was upset and frustrated by the way the RfA was going, and by accusations that were made regarding my intentions.

<p>I am sorry to see your rebuke of my statement to Secretlondon. I understand that you have positive sentiments for her, and maybe she is a great person to you, and IRL. What I know is that <a href="../../../c/h/a/Talk%7EChav_d891.html#Celebrity_Chavs" title="Talk:Chav">she chose to ignore my citations, insult my knowledge based on my nationality, as well as make a personal attack</a> (accusing me of having been "trolling" 12 months ago), all in a very short period of time. This from a person who made me very angry 12 months ago due to her egocentric emotionalism against Jimbo, and by my perception against americans in general, during her exit. Frankly, I feel she is a bigot, and that her bigotry manifested in such a manner as to harm the project.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean i can't behave civilly towards her, but it does mean my threshold of tolerance for rudeness on her part is extremely low. I hope this doesn't somehow cement whatever bad feelings you might have towards me. In the past I thought rather highly of you, seeing you as both possessed of a keen sense of humor (the name "ambivalent hysteria" amused me to no end) and a focus on neutrality (your defense of <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_removal_candidates_Political_correctness_9d78.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article removal candidates/Political correctness">Wikipedia:Featured article removal candidates/Political correctness</a> struck me as a good example of this). In summary, you can have as positive feelings as you might like towards a given wikipedian, and as negative of feelings towards myself as might possibly develop, but I would ask you to preserve the level of neutrality and rigour which I came to respect you for.

<p>Dear Ambi, I chose to address you among other sysops with this request because, on one hand, you might be aware of goings on in the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transnistria.html" title="Transnistria">Transnistria</a> article (you edited it and the talk page at some stages) and, on the other hand, you have no reason to be partial to either side of the dispute that goes on there.</p>
<p>I request the article <b>protected</b> not because I disagree with it and not because I think it is POV. And not even because several editors refuse to compromise and keep reverting changes or alter the article frivolously only to avoid the 3RR rule. I still think that the article being allowed to develop on the long run is the best thing to let it evolve to an acceptable quality.</p>
<p>The only reason why I would like to resort to such an extreme measure as to have it protected is the persistent removal of POV tag by several users in spite of the fact that the reasons for the tag were elaborately stated at the talk page with the proposed corrections specifically stated not once. Corrections, when placed into the article, are reverted on sight or frivolously edited out as I stated earlier.</p>
<p>I warned the tag removers at the article talk page (see <a href="../../../t/r/a/Talk%7ETransnistria_bbdf.html#Persistent_removal_of_POV_tag_without_answering_the_concerns_raised_will_result_in_filing_for_the_article.27s_protection" title="Talk:Transnistria">Talk:Transnistria#Persistent removal of POV tag without answering the concerns raised will result in filing for the article's protection</a>). The warning was ignored. On that same page you may easily look for the latest development of the dispute about neutrality where specific reasons are stated carefully and still ignored. The only response I got was a frivolous call from a user to "bring sources". That's a joke. Sources are there. If you have time, please also look at the earlier issues (still not addressed) at <a href="../../../t/r/a/Talk%7ETransnistria_archive_1_653f.html" title="Talk:Transnistria/archive 1">Talk:Transnistria/archive 1</a>. You may not have patience to read all of it, just looking at TOC at the archive and checking several chapters briefly would be sufficient.</p>
<p>To summarize briefly, I view that frivolous editing and bad faith arguing at the talk page may be the reason for RfC but not the protection. Protection is requested because the users remove the POV tag clearly in a bad faith and there is nothing else that could be done about it. Protection would allow emotions to cool off and changes discussed at talk, while the POV tag would warn the unfamiliar users to treat the article with caution. Thank you for your consideration. -<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> July 4, 2005 19:21 (UTC)</p>

<p>Greetings from freezing west coast australia, disambiguated. Rather than people for consensus, i have set up a bibliography in a new heading, West Coast Tasmania - Convict Heritage. I do hope you might see why I still feel the mhps has a minority when it comes to publisheing history<a href="../../../v/c/x/User%7EVcxlor_b6bb.html" title="User:Vcxlor">vcxlor</a> 6 July 2005 09:04 (UTC)</p>
<p>I Have also acknowledged on the MHPS aka sarah island acceded to the fact that the MHPS is the entry, and sarah should be either excluded or stay a redirect. and anyways clarkk has been through most of my west coast entries like a tornado anyways... <a href="../../../v/c/x/User%7EVcxlor_b6bb.html" title="User:Vcxlor">vcxlor</a> 6 July 2005 13:12 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Ok, the problem is now your having redirected from the wct-ch which clarkk had revised - I am unable to recover the removed entry to ressurect part of it against/into the mhps entry. could you possibly let me know how to do such as i did not have a backup of the entry that i created. i would appreciate an answer on this one. needless to say i disagree with your redirect, as having been west coaster tassie person in past - there is something different about the place - otherwise there wouldnt have been all those books in the first place. <a href="../../../v/c/x/User%7EVcxlor_b6bb.html" title="User:Vcxlor">vcxlor</a> 6 July 2005 14:41 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ok, the problem is such: Tassie in 1900 or so had lonnie (Launceston), Hobart and west coasters - all equal political and economic power. Tassie in 2005 has lonnie and the southerners, west coast is a mere ghost of itself.</p>
<pre>
The problem is that 
</pre>
<p>despite their reduced numbers West coasters still have an attitude. as late as the mid 70's the canberra pollies and the hobart pollies were still courting the votes.</p>
<pre>

The convict issue in the state is sorted easily out by chronology - and the main hist of tassie line - west coast first, then east coast, pretty simple. both with legacies. sorry about digressions, used to live on west coast and some decades later with hindsight and a lot of academic things - etc...<a href="../../../v/c/x/User%7EVcxlor_b6bb.html" title="User:Vcxlor">vcxlor</a> 6 July 2005 15:16 (UTC)</p>

<p>the main entry for wiki assumes railway companies (american bias perhaps?) while for huge chunks of times in many nations there have been government authorities not companies.

<p>OK I'll try again. watching what happens to some of my entries re west coast tas, and noting you seem to be one of the regulars on changes etc. I thought you might have an idea. The main wiki entry for legal entities controlling railways around the world are identified as 'companies' - whereas in many countries it is in actual fact the legal entities are government departments. I still seem to be getting the hang of some wiki things, and even if it is not your area of interest I was wondering how you would resolve what seems to be a bias in such an entry. Or is it better to leave you be, shut up, and be bold and go for it anyways?<a href="../../../v/c/x/User%7EVcxlor_b6bb.html" title="User:Vcxlor">vcxlor</a></p>

<dd>The Council is the "upper house" and the Assembly the "lower house". Diagrammatic representations of the structure of the parliament always have the council on top for this reason, so I thought it logical to have the Council on top in the succession box.

<p>Thanks for withdrawing the objection. Like I said, I was too close to this one. What happened was that I wrote 90 Kb <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustan_literature.html" title="Augustan literature">Augustan literature</a>, then bishonen did a quick split of the prose section. I then went over <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustan_prose.html" title="Augustan prose">Augustan prose</a> for quite a while to make sure it didn't duplicate. Then I did the splits of <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustan_poetry.html" title="Augustan poetry">Augustan poetry</a> (with a new thesis and new material), and then I did <a href="../../../a/u/g/Augustan_drama.html" title="Augustan drama">Augustan drama</a>, with three new paragraphs and a new section. The point is, it was about 4 weeks of pretty solid involvement, with a lot of proofreading (not enough, of course, because I left mistakes that others have found). I also wrote from the very start with getting references for things that I knew. In the past, I've written and then found the references that said what I knew to be commonplace in scholarship. This time, I went the proper way. Anyway, that's why I was more raw nerved than usual.

<p>Further to your message on my talk page, I removed this statement from the Holbrook article: - <i>A railway branch line connected it to the main railway line at <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Rock%2C_New_South_Wales_8821.html" title="The Rock, New South Wales">The Rock</a></i>. My reason was that the statement was a propos of nothing - ie no context. There are many ex branch lines all over Australia and such a statement may belong in an article about now defunct branch lines or in a section within the Holbrook article on lines of communication. There are many many more important things to say about Holbrook than former railway branch lines which have left little evidence on the current make-up of the town. I note also that the sentence was hard to translate - it could be expressed more clearly as <i>Holbrook was formerly connected to the main Sydney - Melbourne railway line by a branch line from the Rock.</i> That such a line existed is evidenced by <a href="http://www.railpage.com.au/f-p231934.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.railpage.com.au/f-p231934.htm" rel="nofollow">this Railway archaeology page</a>. I am not sure when the service was suspended (not recently) but that fact should definitely be included too and perhaps whether the branch line carried passengers or freight - if freight, what kind? - has the produce of the town changed thus leading to the closure of the line .... The present article doesn't even mention the wool industry which seems to be very important to the town's economy and is represented by a museum in the main street.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">AYArktos</a> 21:51, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>392.

<p>The <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester_United_F.C._7c41.html" title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United F.C.</a> page is impressive.

Many AFL club entries are very poor however.</p>
<p>It wouldn't take much to develop a similar club infobox that could be used for AFL clubs, or indeed any kind of sporting club. With regard to the template at the bottom, a similar template is already being used on all of the AFL club pages as far as I know. I'm pretty sure the NRL entries are also catered for in this regard.</p>

Most AFL clubs are over 100 years old and pages like this are a good way (I think) of prioritising the individuals worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia. Personally I reckon anyone to have played an AFL/VFL game is worthy of inclusion but as that is currently not feasible I'd suggest giving priority to coaches, captains, best-and-fairest winners, leading goalkickers, members of premiership sides and Brownlow medallists.</p>

<p>Hey Ambi, thanks for your kind words on my Talk page. But no I'm not resuming work here at present, not after the way I was treated by the supposed pillars of this community - although I admit to being nearly sucked in when I see so much that needs fixing and doing! But the (disgraceful) ruling of the ArbComm is like a "sword of Damocles", a constant threat of pretexts for blocking. I don't need the stress anymore than I needed the abuse.

<p>I was surprised by the vehemence of your vote on that page... you don't owe anyone an explanation, least of all me, but I am curious about your reasons if you would care to share them. --<a href="../../../s/k/u/User%7ESkud_4737.html" title="User:Skud">Skud</a> 09:42, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi - you were expressing interest in an article on what you termed "straight cruising". I'm pleased to be able to tell you that there is something which might be up your street - see <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogging.html" title="Dogging">Dogging</a>. It doesn't have a list of areas, but there are links on the page which take you to sites which might help. Hope this is useful --<a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 18:10, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Ambi: Can you please research and re-open the ridiculous move by <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">User:Sjakkalle</a>. I have sent him this message: Hi Sjak: Kindly explain your math please at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Religious_persecution_by_Jews_59c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Religious persecution by Jews">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Religious persecution by Jews</a>: 34 "keeps" is better than 66 "deletes"...the "deletes" had almost DOUBLE the votes and <i>you</i> decide against them? This makes no sense! I will call on others to object to your dictatorial move! <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 10:49, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">User:Danny</a> has called for the VfD to be re-opened. See Talk:Religious persecution by Jews#Reopen debate, please voice your opinion. Thanks, and be well. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 12:15, 28 July 2005 (UTC)Hi Ambi. I know you strongly disagreed with my closure of that VFD debate, but I am a VFD closer who sticks fairly close to a "two-thirds" guideline and who declares a "no consensus" result when the debate's delete votes fall short of a two-thirds majority, after discounting sockpuppets of course and I discounted three of the keep votes. I suggest asking a couple of other experienced VFD closers (SimonP and Rossami) for advice, can you please respond to that suggestion? Finally, I assure you that I was <i>not</i> trying to abuse my position as administrator to keep an article because I wanted it kept. The subject is one which I have very limited knowledge about, and I don't know what I would have voted had I participated in the debate. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 12:51, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
