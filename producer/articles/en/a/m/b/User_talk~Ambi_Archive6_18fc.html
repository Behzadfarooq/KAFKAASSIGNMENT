<p>Hey, Ambi, could you protect the <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_terrorism.html" title="State terrorism">State terrorism</a> article. I, and others, have made DETAILED points in talk, and it keeps getting reverted by people with an agenda. They have no leg to stand on, they've been repeatedly proved wrong (go to the bottom of talk and see "Big edit, reasons why", and note they think that 170 MILLION people have died due to TERRORISM (by states) in the last 100 years -- It's patent nonsense). Anyways, take a look, please. Thanks. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrapin_076e.html" title="User:Terrapin">Terrapin</a> 14:02, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>My intention was for the two to <i>complement</i> each other, eg. the WikiProject page as a simple list of topics and the notice board for any and all discussion (eg. coordinating efforts, discussing article formats, categories, etc.) I just think the notice board page could get unwieldy really fast if we try to do everything on one page. If people feel it's too duplicative, though, then I'll delete the other page. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 05:59, 27 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Ambi, I've run the Link Suggester tool on the Lake Burley Griffin article, in both selective and exhaustive modes (the real thing will only use selective). The exhaustive list is very very long and is probably 95% wrong or not worth linking to - I only included the exhaustive list in case it was of use, so don't hesitate to delete it straight away if it's not useful.

In violation of the mediation process, he attempted to effectively add a new version of the Joan of Arc entry in the Cross-Dressing article  - while claiming that he was allegedly preserving the entry from modification rather than vice-versa. You can see that his "reverted" version (at 19:44:16 on 30 Oct) included a new addition, added by an anonymous user today and conveniently retained by AlexR's "reversion", which included text designed to cast doubt on the historical evidence (this time using a different specious argument). Since the new version was consistent with AlexR's basic views, it would seem to have been an attempt to add new material on the sly while mediation is supposed to be underway. This was accompanied by a flood of revisions to both "Cross-Dressing" and "Joan of Arc" by two other names (JohnBaptist and Switisweti) posting one right after another in both articles. This is either a remarkable coincidence, or classic "sockpuppet" activity. 
</pre>
<p>I have therefore reverted it back to the form it had at the beginning of mediation, and I would ask that you please protect the article against further tampering after reverting whatever additional vandalism these users might engage in. Frankly, I think it's also time to finally ban AlexR as a "troll", as another admin suggested, given this type of behavior. <a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAWilliamson_c1f7.html" title="User:AWilliamson">AWilliamson</a> 22:44, 30 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Ambi, I don't think I've had the pleasure of writing to you before. I really apreciate the fact that at least you expressed the reason for opposing me and in a way I understand. I see that your a very good administrator and I hope you become a good lawyer. The only thing that I can say about the Joaquin Phoenix saga is that it was a misunderstanding on my part but, it was solved with everybody becoming friends in the end. I guess it was a case of beginners ignorence. I hope that you can count me among your Wikipedian friends, I would like that. Take care.</p>

<p>I believe you will eventually be an arbitrator. One of the decisions we made at the beginning of establishment of procedure was that deliberations would be in private. I opposed that, advocating public deliberations. We simply never implemented that decision and there are the proposed decisions for you and everyone else to comment on. Obviously there are starts and stops and wrong turns as the various arbitrators bring their perspectives to the table. One of my failings is to give second and third chances to someone and then when they don't come though after a long effort to reform them, throw the book at them. Other arbitrators have different approaches. I'm trying a new approach and giving a pass to those who got sucked into committing offenses themselves as they tried to deal with this very troublesome user by referring to their infractions as "petty offenses". In the past we have applied mild sanctions such as a one day ban. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 14:11, Nov 5, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You do understand that "troublesome" users, if they have a large supply of disparate IP addresses can simply re-incarnate themselves, yes? Wouldn't it be a gas if "Rex" has long since already re-joined under a new name and already has 1,500+ edits and has taken a more subtle approach? What will everyone do if they find out three months from now, that this new (unknown to us) editor (or re-incarnation/sockpuppet whichever term you prefer) is already earning accolades from many long-timed editors with such comments as "good job on that, thanks", etc? What would the Wiki cabal do if indeed they unkowingly promote one (or more) Rex alter-ego(s) to Admin?

<dd>I think Fred's right about your future role. Thanks for the note at the Gene Poole case. I had foolishly moved too quickly yesterday, and had thought there wasn't enough evidence concerning <a href="../../../m/i/c/Micronation.html" title="Micronation">Micronation</a> -- there was, though the complainants had done an iffy job of presenting it -- thank goodness Fred invested the time to explain more thoroughly. I don't see complaints on the evidence page for any other article, though -- if Gene has a problem at <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sealand.html" title="Sealand">Sealand</a> or any other micronation article, I don't know about it. Anyway, I guess I'll go back to pondering what a good decision is -- between the two sides involved in that case, I've been "feedback"ed into a corner. :-) Best of luck on your exams, <a href="../../../j/w/r/User%7EJwrosenzweig_7ca4.html" title="User:Jwrosenzweig">Jwrosenzweig</a> 15:05, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not interested in the content of his edits. I am interested in establishing that he is an unfit person to be editing articles on Australian history (or indeed anything else, but I am no longer involved with anything else here). In fact his original Spence article was just another attempt to promote the LaRouche / Herschelkrustofky "American system" fantasy. I would be quite happy to debate biographical issues with any legitimate editor, but not with a LaRouche liar and propagandist like Herschelkrustofky. Promoting LaRoucheism is the <i>only</i> reason he writes Australian articles (apart from trying to annoy me). <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 03:18, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Someone added a partial paragraph on the <a href="../../../c/e/c/CEC_5724.html" title="CEC">CEC</a> page listing personages in Australian history that the CEC looks to as its philosophical forbears. I noted that many of them did not have Wikipedia articles, so I decided to at least put some stubs up. Why do you ask? BTW, I am happy to see Adam expanding them, although he also seems to be deleting some of the perfectly legitimate material I put in my stubs. He seems to desire that any indication that these figures may have been anti-British, or pro-American, be suppressed in the articles.

<p>1) The above findings of fact show that <a href="../../../a/v/a/User%7EAvala_c557.html" title="User:Avala">Avala</a> has often worked against consensus and majority opinion. We therefore rule that Avala must follow the <i>majority</i> opinion of the users involved concerning any controversial edits that Avala makes. One specific consequence is that violations of the three revert rule are not permitted. This probation period will last for one month.</p>
<p>2) For a period of 3 months, should a serious dispute arise between Avala and other users with respect to editing of an article Avala is required to cite substantial authority supporting the position he is taking and either enter the dispute resolution process regarding the matter or drop the matter. A serious dispute is defined as one in which any party to the dispute has reverted the other 3 times or more. After Avala makes his third revert he shall cease editing the article with respect to the disputed matter until completion of the dispute resolution process. Resolution of the dispute in his favor shall require verification that the authority cited adequately supports the information he advocates including in the article. With respect to matters of taste such as size of templates he is required to defer to majority opinion.</p>
<p>3) Given the fact that Avala is now editing at a low rate, we reserve the right to revisit the conduct issue of this user once/if Avala starts to edit at an increased rate again and other users complain about Avala's conduct. This probation would last one year.</p>

<p>No one is trying to lynch this editor. I don't think it's a good idea to remove talk-page discussion. I think the wiki way is to discuss it with the editor concerned and if they accept your view that you should not have veered off topic, then you can remove the material concerned. I don't believe LGagnon should be given special powers if his/her position is that it's okay to simply impose your view on other editors. You and I clearly disagree on some issues (you are, after all, a leading deletionist, while I'm for keeping more rather than less) but I was perfectly courteous to LGagnon, have asked him/her not to conduct a vendetta and invited him/her to remove any comments he/she felt prejudiced his/her election or were unfair. I have also said that if he/she is renominated and has shown more willingness to discuss these issues with other editors (which he/she most certainly has not, you might have noted), I would vote for him/her next time. I think describing this as trying to lynch him/her is a little unreasonable. Perhaps you would reconsider and refactor your comment? I feel I should note that one of the editors you are accusing is standing against you in an election. I do not suggest <i>whatsoever</i> that I believe your comment was motivated by this but you know that the whole election has seen vicious behaviour -- particularly that directed at Shane King -- and you ought not perhaps to allow the possibility of the accusation.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 02:40, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your reply. I don't call for LGagnon's head. I think he/she will be an unsuitable admin is all, for the reasons I gave. I bring Shane into it only because there has been a whispering campaign against him on account of his endorsing one of the editors who opposed LGagnon.</dd>
<dd>I've blocked the two editors in question because they write very long, harassing messages to me, which I asked them not to, and in a few days they will have cooled down and forgotten I exist. We are asked to minimise conflict and that's one way of doing it: turn away and not continue. I think it's fair enough not to allow other editors to troll me on my talk page. They're not hoping to discuss anything with me, only to cause upset.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 02:56, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, if someone will get Xed to stop pulling this passive-aggressive crap, I'll gladly come back to an active role in the project, but I'm not going to do work just to have him revert it. What's the point? And he certainly won't listen to me, and almost no one else seems to be telling him to knock it off. I feel I've done my share of standing up to him, but no one particularly backed me up. It's very heartening to hear that others share my concerns (that is said without a trace of sarcasm), but does anyone have any ideas for how to deal with his behavior?

<p>Ambi, I'm beginning to feel that people aren't really concerned with article content here, that they're just out to get me. Maybe that's crazy, but what conclusion am I supposed to draw? After I did all those revisions to the article (granted, they've now been mostly destroyed by Reene's reverts, but they're still in the history), you tell me the concerns haven't be addressed? For God's sake, how? I invite you to contribute something to the talk page, to help me negotiate compromise by dealing with specific points. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:15, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't know if you're being sarcastic or not, Ambi. You know Reene's edits are utterly unacceptable to me, and I'll vote against it for featured if they stay. In the meantime, however, I've proposed a compromise (about my fifth one since this whole thing started, I think, but whatever) on the article talk page that I urge you to read; I need to build support for it, else this revert war could drag on forever. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 04:34, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, well, with Reene's "contributions" it is now very far away indeed. Nevertheless, I feel my compromise is a good one, and it's about as much as I'm willing to concede. If you don't want to endorse it, however, that's fine; you need not take part in conflict resolution that doesn't directly involve you anyway. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:11, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>And furthermore, Ambi, it seems to me that you're completely ignoring all the work I put into the article myself fixing objections. Why is it that I am treated like crap about this? You say it still had all the same problems as before. In fact, it had none of them: I created a reference section, I reworked the general critical review paragraphs, and I removed a redundant quote and several bits of minor detail (the last being against my better judgment, I might add). And yet I get no credit for that at all, while Reene, who is nothing but a troll with a personal dislike for Ashlee Simpson, gets praised for demolishing the article. I'm just at a loss, I don't know what to think about this anymore. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:38, 28 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know we continue to clash heads on this, but could you please avoid changing options for votes in the Australian City disambiguation process. Instead could you create a new option for people to vote for. I am going to create two new options, one which allows capital cities to remain [[City]] and another which allows all cities larger than our smallest capital Darwin to remain [[City]].--<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a> 02:57, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)&lt;/nowiki&gt;</p>
<dl>
<dd>I actually just started out with the two simplest options. Disambiguate all, or don't disambiguate unless necessary. I thought nobody really appreciated a complicated system (given that "larger than Darwin" was more popular than "just capitals"). By repeatedly switching it around, it is just going to get confusing, so I am going to leave it. But next time someone sets up a vote you could show consideration before modifying options that have already been set up.--<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a> 05:49, 30 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>HistoryBuffEr started an RfC against me, and I responded in the Response section. Several other users endorsed the Response. HistoryBuffer commented on the various users' endorsements in the same section. It seemed to me that the Response section wasn't the place for the complainant to make further accusations or other statements, so I moved these comments to talk.

<p>Hi Ambi. I have been working on Yarralumla to try to address Jeronimo and your objections, and would like to discuss the options.</p>
<ol>
<li>a) I thought the lead section did a reasonable job of sumerising the main points of the article. Can you see any more information from the article you think should be included?</li>
<li>b)I don't like the idea of combining the <b>Notable places</b> section into parragraph form. I have had a quick go at it, visable at <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_Sandbox_5e09.html" title="User:Martyman/Sandbox">User:Martyman/Sandbox</a>. Most of the "main articles" linked in the current version I actually spun off of the Yarralumla article when I thought that they where starting to get too long. Also your suggestion and Jeronimo's for the section seem to be suggesting oppisite things. What do you think?</li>
<li>c) I still have to put some work into making the amenities section read better. It was born out of several smaller section that where more closely related to the Summer Hill sections to begin with, but they lacked enough content so I combined them into it's current form. I would rather avoid having to break it up again if possible.</li>
<li>d) The references are now in the accepted wikipedia standard (not something I could say for summer hill).</li>
<li>e) I added some local political issues in the politics section. I don't think adding too much info here is wise as the electorate involved covers half of Canberra and should be dealt with seperately.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ok, I will have a go at sumerising more of the article into the lead section. I just had a closer look at the Summer Hill lead section, and it is not in fact a lead section at all... It is not a summary of the article, it is just a suburb trivia section, none of which is mentioned later in the article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>From what I can see the difference between Yarralumla and the places you have linked too (ie. <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarajevo.html" title="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshall%2C_Texas_b27f.html" title="Marshall, Texas">Marshall, Texas</a>) is that Yarralumla is quite a small suburb in a city. No I wouldn't expect the Yarralumla landmarks to warrant this much (if any) text in the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a> article, but if this is the only place in Wikipedia they are going to be mentioned than they should be given decent treatment. Landmarks that I have spun off onto seperate pages I have culled down to around around 2 sentences. Yarralumla is notable amoungst Canberra suburbs in that it has any landmarks of note at all. Most Canberra suburbs have no history and no notable buildings or places.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The way you describe splitting up the amenities section sounds almost exactly like the way I had the article before I re-arranged it. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Yarralumla%2C_Australian_Capital_Territory&amp;oldid=7832527" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Yarralumla%2C_Australian_Capital_Territory&amp;oldid=7832527" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I re-arranged it after <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">User:Petaholmes</a>'s comment here <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Canberra_372b.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Canberra">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Canberra</a>. I prefer the way it is now, rather than re-creating small sections like <i>education</i> and adding the bus route info back into <i>transport</i> I can't see a <i>Charateristics</i> section being very useful.</dd>

<p>I'd like to write up an entry about it, precisely because there seems to be so little information about it on the Web. It rarely even appears in tourist brochures - I only head about it through word of mouth when we visited Tasmania in 2000. It's on the Tasman Peninsula, it's a convict mining settlement. Apparently the convicts who were too troublesome for Port Authur were sent here. If you ever head down there, make sure you check it out - it's totally undeveloped, you get there via a poorly marked dirt track, but it's well worth the visit. <a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 22:19, 2 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Luverly. Looks Like I dont have to worry aboutcreating my own.</p>
<p>Two things</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't think extra sub pages^ should exist in the complet todo list (the idea is it is <i>Complete</i>). Brownlow medallists and their ilk belong in genuine lists. And unmade articles added to redlinks+People category.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A section for Australian substubs (like <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portia_DeRossi_f09f.html" title="Portia DeRossi">Portia DeRossi</a>) near Requests for Expansion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Extra categories - <b>Annual Events</b>, <b>Explorers</b>, <b>Crime</b> (might add more as the come to mind)</p>
<p>^except "Pages needing images" that could be a subpage, that wya people can just add that section to their watchlist.</p>
<p>Other than that I'd support it replacing the current one. I like the tendency to focus on redlinks. --<a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZayZayEM_e31a.html" title="User:ZayZayEM">ZayZayEM</a> 08:50, 3 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I was thinking <b>Pages needing Images</b>, <b>Pages needing review</b>, <b>Requests for expansion</b> could be subpages inserted using the {{page/subpage}} technique I was dabbling with, as these are slightly different from the general todo, and particular people might specifically want to watch for changes to these lists.</dd>

<p>because the senate is exactly 3 years and the house is 3 years or less, they get out of sync and at some stage will become so warped as to force a double dissolusion. that is why, since the last double dissolusion in 198-? the years started the same, but are now changing. e.g. this years election was for this years house but for next years senate. understand? or am i all over the place? <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 02:59, 4 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>a double dissolusion by definition means that all senators are up for election.</dd>
<dd>if there was a double dissolusion in 1983, the senate sitting in 1984 would be from the 1983 election.</dd>
<dd>double dissolutions dont have to wait the 3 years that you have to for a regular half senate election.</dd>

<dd>i believe that a in double dissolusion, since both house are dissolved (normaly the senate is prorogued - check that in a dictionary) the senate no langer exists and rather than waiting till the next july to sit again they start straight after the election.</dd>

<p>I'm glad you're working on cleaning up those articles, but I don't think it's a fair test to ask that most of the pages on Random page are great, or even good pages. I think wikipedia will always have a lot of pages that are just starting out, even if they will get more and more esoteric (and/or VfD fodder) as time goes on. I think the Random page feature will always come up with a lot of such pages. A corallary to that is that <i>all</i> of wikipedia should not be distributed in any form that has space or quality restrictions.

<p>Normally Senators take their seats on the 1 July following the election. Thus the Senators elected in October 2004 will take their seats on 1 July 2005. But Section 13 of the Constitution (as amended in 1907) provides that after a <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_dissolution.html" title="Double dissolution">double dissolution</a> they will take their seats immediately after the election, and will be <i>deemed</i> to have sat since the preceeding 1 July. Thus the Senators elected at the March 1983 double dissolution were deemed to have taken their seats on 1 July 1982, and their terms therefore expired on 30 June 1985, which was why there had to be an early election in December 1984. The list is therefore correct with the note I have added. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 07:40, 5 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thanks for your message regarding my vote and comment.</p>
<p>In my dealings with Guanaco, I have sometimes witnessed him use his administrator powers without understanding his reasons. At first I thought this was simply bizarre behaviour, but then I decided to ask him why he'd taken actions that left me puzzled (a few times via his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User+talk:Guanaco/archive&amp;action=history&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=0" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User+talk:Guanaco/archive&amp;action=history&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=0" rel="nofollow">talk page</a>). In all cases, I was satisfied with his response.</p>
<p>I recognise that Guanaco has a tendency to be terse and can seem intransigent, but the in the controversies I've seen that involve him, he has been able to justify his actions or admit his mistakes. While Guanaco's style may make one question his suitability as an administrator, the substance of his edits, which is the vital criterion, convinces me that he deserves to retain administrator privileges.</p>

<p>Ambi, if you have a moment, would you mind taking a look at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Lyndon_LaRouche_Proposed_decision_f54d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Lyndon LaRouche/Proposed decision">Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/Lyndon LaRouche/Proposed decision</a>? Herschelkrustofsky has initiated a query of the Arbitration Committee for clarification of their ruling about LaRouche activisim in Wikipedia. I agree that clarification is needed, because I feel the wording of the ruling was unclear and has left loopholes that the three or four LaRouche activists are exploiting (three of four user names, I should say: I'm not convinced they are separate editors). I have therefore written up a fairly long response to Herschelkrustofsky's query and have requested clarification from the Committee on specific points. The reason I'm writing to you is that I know you've expressed some concerns about the LaRouche supporters' edits, and so I wondered whether you'd be prepared to comment on the page. I've also let Adam know about this, though he may feel he doesn't want to open up the issue again. If you don't want to comment, don't worry about it, but I thought I'd let you know anyway. I feel this may be an opportunity to resolve some of the problems these people have been causing.

<p>Hi, Rebecca. In November, when I nominated <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autobiography_%28album%29.html" title="Autobiography (album)">Autobiography (album)</a> for FAC, you were fairly vocal in telling me where it was flawed. As I remember, you mainly complained about it having a POV slant and it needing concert info...isn't that right? Well, I've done a fair bit of NPOVing and expansion since then, including some concert info, and although I still have more work ahead of me, I'm considering nominating it again for FAC at some point not too far off. I was wondering if you'd look over it for me and tell me if you think the problems have all been properly remedied or not, or what else I can do to improve it. Also, do you have any idea what span of time I should wait before renominating it? Do you think people would be fine if I renominated it a month or so after the original nomination? <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 00:50, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

As for the critical summary, it seems to me that you ought to represent both positive and negative reviews of an album, unless there really aren't any of one or the other (or none that are significant), and that you ought to write the article so as to roughly present the critical opinion according to what it is. If it's mostly positive, with some dissenters, you have maybe 1 negative cite for every 3 or 4 positive cites; in this case, where it's roughly even, you represent it as mixed by having about as many positive as negative cites. I don't see what better way there could be to do it, and that's basically what I think I've done with the article in question. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:20, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as I can tell, it's not the style of the prose that you object to, it's the level of detail. I have every reason to want to discuss it with you if I can expect you to veto a FAC nomination. You know how important this is to me. You ought to either tell me what I can do to get you to drop your opposition, or just abstain from voting on it. I'm thinking of ways to expand the intro, so if I do that'll be one of the problems remedied. And I'm thinking of ways to incorporate more negative criticism without being unfair. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:44, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You think the data from outside North America is sorely lacking? I've gone to a lot of trouble to dig up info on chart positions from various other countries. Anyway, the paragraph that you say is terribly written <i>is</i> summarized. That's why I created the chart, so I could summarize that paragraph and present the data more clearly at the same time. However, the paragraph is necessary because it includes sales figures, which the chart doesn't do, and because it includes cites everything, which the chart can't do, and because it includes other little bits of info, like the fact that the <i>Now!</i> album displaced it or the fact that it increased 61% in sales last week. And there's really no way I can remove the quotes, because things need to be cited; nobody wants to hear <i>my</i> opinion on "Love Makes the World Go Round", but I assume people would like to know what the critics think about it. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:05, 16 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We've just finished a (lengthy) discussion and revision over at <a href="../../../r/e/f/Reformed_Egyptian_0854.html" title="Reformed Egyptian">Reformed Egyptian</a>, and those of use who were involved consider your opinion both valuable and likely-to-be-reasoned-and-equitable.
