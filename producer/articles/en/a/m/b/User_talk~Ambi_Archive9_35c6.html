<p>You will need to contact each of the state / terrirory parliaments and ask them for either a copy of the latest edition of their parliamentary handbook or a historical list of members with dates of election. some of this may now be online at the parliamentary websites so check first. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> 12:37, 19 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>G'day,</p>
<p>Wikinews has been experimenting with OR for a while now, and it seems like it's all going pretty well, and we've had a couple of really good articles from it. So what im planning with a couple of other aussies on wikinews, is to write an OR article in real time from the senate for a blow by blow account of what happens on July one, when the government gets its majority (i mean, we all knows what happens; unions get fucked over, but we dont know exactly how its gonna happen yet). Anyway, just wondering since you are also in our fine nation's capital, if you were interested in a foray into OR? Im gonna contact some of the other wikipedians who have said they are from Canberra to see if they are interested aswell, since its gonna take some logistical doing - at the very least we will need one laptop, a digital cammera (are you allowed to take photos, or are you only allowed to use the official TV fotage?), and some means of wireless conection to the internet. Im really not sure what the facilaties are in APH, so it will need a bit of research. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_bellman_55cf.html" title="User:The bellman">The bellman</a> 12:12, 2005 Apr 21 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You know what i just realised; July 1 is smack bang in the middle of the semester break, so i may well not be in canberra.&#160;:( Damn howard, not planning his assult on Australia around my calander. Re: privacy; for normal OR you dont (currently) need to give any personal details above and beyond normal (there would be a mention that wikinews reporter <i>The bellman</i> saw/heard/whatever foobar, and a link to a subpage of the article which had further details (ie. a transcript, emails etc), however there is a seperate mechanism for <i>Acreditation</i> which means you have to put your personal details on wikinews, but you dont need to be acredited to write OR. Anyway, looks like this idea might not work after all, still ill talk to some other canberra wikipedians and see if i can get it off the ground <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_bellman_55cf.html" title="User:The bellman">The bellman</a> 12:04, 2005 Apr 22 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thankyou, Ambi, for trying to justify yourself. I am quite happy to have dropped out of editing Wiki. I have multiple "personalities" under which I used to edit, but found my best and longest articles were the ones I wrote anonymously. These have stood the test of years. Dropping out has not only saved time, but also saved money: I found I was buying books to get the information for articles.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am perplexed by your moving <a href="../../../d/e/n/Deniliquin.html" title="Deniliquin">Deniliquin</a> to <a href="../../../d/e/n/Deniliquin%2C_New_South_Wales_d1f3.html" title="Deniliquin, New South Wales">Deniliquin, New South Wales</a>, and angered that you have done this again, without entering into discussion - I put a note on the discussion page asking you why you had done this. Is this a generally agreed-upon convention to add the names of states to Australian places? If so, it is a bloody stupid one, IMHO. Are we to redirect <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney.html" title="Sydney">Sydney</a> to <a href="../../../s/y/d/Sydney%2C_New_South_Wales_db78.html" title="Sydney, New South Wales">Sydney, New South Wales</a>?<a href="../../../m/g/e/User%7EMgekelly_7b5b.html" title="User:Mgekelly">XmarkX</a> 06:49, 23 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Something very strange has happened. I was looking over my watchlist and noticed some red links: Drouin, Nyah West and Moe. Someone has just gone and deleted these articles. Fortunately I have 2 of those articles on my Towns in Victoria, Australia article, but since Moe was removed because it was quite long, it's all gone. I don't know who did it, and I don't know if the information can be retrieved as in deleting the article the history goes as well. I couldn't find any of these listed under VfD. I'm asking you for help as you're an admin, but I don't know if anything can be done. Please help keep a watch on the other towns as they might go to.

<dd>Actually, I just looked in my history and I have all the information on Moe as well, so I can re-create the article, but it wouldn't have the history of all the people who worked on it, so I won't at this point.

<p>Lists of members elected to each parliament are strangely hard to come by. There are lists of members in alphabetical order floating around, e.g. <a href="http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/web/webpages.nsf/WebFiles/MLA+List+Complete/$FILE/SN+10+MLAs+by+number+ALPHA.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/web/webpages.nsf/WebFiles/MLA+List+Complete/$FILE/SN+10+MLAs+by+number+ALPHA.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but I guess it would be pretty time consuming to convert such a list into a list for each parliament. I could suggest some books that would almost certainly contain the information you want, but they would be pretty hard to get hold of outside WA, and I suspect you don't live over here in the west. <a href="../../../h/e/s/User_talk%7EHesperian_5634.html" title="User talk:Hesperian">Hesperian</a> 22:39, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The <b>Western Australian Parliamentary Handbook</b> gives election results only for the election previous to its publication. So my 17th edition provides details of the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1983.html" title="1983">1983</a> election only. If you can get access to multiple editions, then it would just be a case of photocopying a couple of pages from each one. The Handbook also contains lists of successive members for each electoral district. e.g entries of the form</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>ASHBURTON: Burt, Hon Septimus: From 1890–1900. Forrest, David: From 1900–1901. Consistuency abolished, 1901.</i></dd>
</dl>

<p>I have just reverted the second of your two edits to the main ArbCom page as it caused a page doubling. I don't think I've removed anything I shouldn't have, but you should take a look just in case.

<p>Ambi, you can see that I am asking where the rule is. Where is the rule? Are you just going to revert without explanation? Will you deign to say why the principle is a bad one or a good one? If it is one which is deserving of discussion will <i>you</i> put it in the list of "proposed principles" for consideration by the arbitrators? <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 04:46, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ambi replied on my talk page:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Only arbitrators are allowed to edit the proposed decision page. That's all there is to it. Please don't re-add the principle again, else I'll have to protect the page. Feel free to make suggestions on the talk page, however. Ambi 06:16, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Wikipedia never used to be like this. Things should not be allowed or disallowed seemingly on a whim. Explain where there is such a rule. The wording of the page does not say that non-arbitrators can not add proposed principles. It does say that only arbitrators can modify or vote on the proposed principles. This is not some police state: You are accountable, just like the rest of us. Say why! <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 06:25, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I note you have not replied to my other point: If the principle proposed by me is a good one, say so. If not, say that. Either way, as one of the only permitted editors, supposedly, of that page, please copy my proposed principle in and then vote for it. Or against it. Things are not "just so". Explain. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 06:25, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I didn't get your reference to an existing hard ban.

<p>In the finding of fact (Tkorrovi and Paul Beardsell case) <b>only 1 out of 10 personal attacks mentioned was by me</b> and even this was about how I named his Paul Beardsell's personal attack against me. And as a remedy, I was proposed to be indefinitely banned from editing the article. This is <b>severely</b> unjust, any punishment <b>must</b> be proportional to the misconduct. You give me an indefinite ban for a single comment, equal to indefinite ban to Paul Beardsell for numerous personal attacks against me during a year, which, as you see, I did not reply with personal attacks, except maybe only once (I'm human), in spite of everything which I might feel, I think this is civil behaviour.

<p>Ambi, maybe you do not reply because you are confused and know not to which I refer.

A reader of Tkorrovi's evidence might think that I had said such a thing. You, an arbitrator in this case who, by your comments in the proposed judgement, is claiming to know what went on, must surely have seen <i>evidence</i> of this somewhere. I don't remember writing this and I am unable to find a reference. Please supply one. I would like you to do so reasonably quickly as you are repeating what I think is a false assertion (one of many) by Tkorrovi and thereby giving it unreasonable credibility amongst followers of the case and, more importantly, your fellow ArbCom members. <a href="../../../p/s/b/User%7EPsb777_ac47.html" title="User:Psb777">Paul Beardsell</a> 21:00, 31 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry to butt in: I too take exception. Ambi has, without properly perusing the evidence, asserted I have said something I did not. That I am guilty of personal attacks on another. She has also falsely called me a bully. (See recent postings by me on this page.) SHE HAS DONE BOTH THESE THINGS ON A PAGE WHICH I (AND OTHER LESS SPECIAL USERS) AM FORBIDDEN TO EDIT. She, on Dan100's, page and elsewhere attacks him personally and now she calls him a hypocrite.

<dd>Accusations of bullying should always cite instances, I think. Because otherwise the making of such an accusation can so easily be construed itself as an instance of bullying. It is better to cite an instance of unacceptable behaviour and then let others decide whether that constitutes bullying than to claim that someone is a bully as though it were self-evident. It's certainly not evident to Paul that he's a bully so, to allow him dignity, you should indicate why you think that. Even if you can show that he's been high-handed with Tarvo, you should also indicate why Tarvo is a victim and what Paul has done that prevents Tarvo from defending himself. I'm actually at a loss to see how a medium like wikipedia could possibly provide an avenue for bullying. Nobody is forced to do anything. People like to win their arguments, as they do everywhere, but to equate that with bullying needs proper justification. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Stannard_9e17.html" title="User:Matthew Stannard">Matt Stan</a> 10:47, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In relation to the alleged "you're not human" accusation, I think I may have introduced this idea into the artificial consciousness discussion at some point, based on the speculation that Tarvo might be a chatbot, i.e himself an artificially conscious entity. Remember we were all the time (or at least I was) aiming to reach a consensus on what the criteria for articicial consciousness are. This speculation was just that, and was in the context of discussing tests for artificial consciousness along the lines of the Turing test for artificial intelligence. If it was wrongly taken by Tarvo, I think you'll find this was just another instance of Tarvo not really understanding what was being said. If you want to weigh up the levels of nastiness between Paul and Tarvo, then please consider how 'nice' it is to accuse someone of being a racist, shortly after discovering their country of origin. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Stannard_9e17.html" title="User:Matthew Stannard">Matt Stan</a> 06:42, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Considering someone an unconscious entity is a personal attack, no matter how you substantiate doing so. This was certainly not any serious scientific conversation, I did not want such senseless discussions, you forced them upon me, as I was supposed to "work together with you", but you used that not to have a constructive discussion, but to ridicule me. In any other circumstances I never talked to you, but here in Wikipedia you cannot choose the people you have to deal with. So I talked to you in a faint hope that maybe you start to work constructively, which even happened sometimes for a short while, but your general attitude didn't change, and personal attacks against me didn't stop. If it did change, then at best your speculations might be considered as a lame (un)friendly joke, but unfortunately how you treat me is very far from jokes. Now you offer to discuss a subterfuge for personal attacks, I would advise no one to go into that trap, as I said, personal attacks cannot be discussed, but only considered as personal attacks by the community.<a href="../../../t/k/o/User%7ETkorrovi_0c02.html" title="User:Tkorrovi">Tkorrovi</a> 14:53, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I called Paul's remarks against me racist, and not allowed, this had nothing to do with the country of origin of neither Paul or me. I consider racist a remarks like whether I'm conscious or not, that anthropologist would be necessary to find out who I am, that he knows smarter animals than me (see blasphemy archive), and that he compares me with monkey, also that I'm paranoid, a pest etc. Just only that. No need for these, maybe I was not patient enough in wanting them to stop, but instead of changing your attitude, you started to attack me even more. And of course, I always wanted you to stop any talk about nationality as well, most senseless and not appropriate, especially when done against one's will. Things like that, I don't see them as any interest concerning science or whatever, but as a way to find a possibility to attack me, and the history of our interaction proved that more than well. Not only nationality though, whatever you succeed to find, like the most senseless and absurd criticism of me by Chinasaur, he wrote to support you after your complaint or who knows what reason. I talked to him, and he don't support that any more, I forgave him, as he was a reasonable person who understood while having a reasonable conversation.<a href="../../../t/k/o/User%7ETkorrovi_0c02.html" title="User:Tkorrovi">Tkorrovi</a> 15:31, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I assume you view my comments as a personal attack. OK, even if that's not what I meant them to be, if that's how you feel, I am sorry. I will take care to present any frustrations I feel surrounding arbitration in a less ambigous manner in the future, if I feel the need to express such opinoins again.

<p>However, that does not excuse you calling me a 'jerk', nor your attempts to belittle my work and bully me. We should not make personal attacks, against anyone, under any circumstances.

<p>Ambi, I believe you have made a substantial error in judgment by concluding that you do not need to warn and notice people when you block them. If you do not have the time to leave a note on their talk page, then I would suggest that you are also too busy to be engaging in blocks at all. By failing to leave a note even in the case of an obvious vandal you substantially increase the risk of confusion and hurt feelings by other users who are also blocked due to the occasional shared IP. --<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 04:36, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
