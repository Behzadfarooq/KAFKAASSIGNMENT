<h2><span class="mw-headline">Indian current events</span></h2>
<p>Hello Joturner, Not sure why you have merged the Indian currents events with the Pakistan even after the consensus did not indicate an unanimous vote of support. Please explain on my talk page. - <font color="navy"><a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaneshk_9519.html" title="User:Ganeshk">Ganeshk</a> (<a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGaneshk_3d44.html" title="User talk:Ganeshk">talk</a>)</font> 03:57, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>One more thing, It was an archive page of the news displayed on the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Portal%7EIndia_13cb.html" title="Portal:India">Portal:India</a> news section. - <font color="navy"><a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaneshk_9519.html" title="User:Ganeshk">Ganeshk</a> (<a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGaneshk_3d44.html" title="User talk:Ganeshk">talk</a>)</font> 04:01, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, there was no <i>unanimous</i> support, but that unanimous support is not needed to achieve <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a>. However, it appeared as though there was a general okay to merge several of the regional current events articles on the merge's <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Current_events_13e9.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Current events">discussion page</a> (which, by the way, has been up for a few weeks now). Considering that the page for current events in Pakistan hasn't been updated since March, it only made sense to merge the two related articles into one section. The inclusiveness of all South Asian nations into one article will also allow for events from <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh.html" title="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/p/Nepal.html" title="Nepal">Nepal</a>, for example, to be included on one of the regional events pages. Could you please explain the problem you have with the merge? Of course, the <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_events_in_South_Asia_fea3.html" title="Current events in South Asia">Current events in South Asia</a> page needs to cleaned up to reflect the change, so overlook that for now. As the page will still contain past current events for India, is it really a significant problem for <a href="../../../i/n/d/Portal%7EIndia_13cb.html" title="Portal:India">Portal:India</a> and <a href="../../../p/a/k/Portal%7EPakistan_1278.html" title="Portal:Pakistan">Portal:Pakistan</a>. I don't think it's a big deal, but perhaps you disagree. <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturn</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">r</a> 04:15, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The merger has resulted in a lot of confusion. For example, the first news of the section now says "Prime minister urges medicos to end strike. Medical students along with students from other institutes are observing strike against the proposed hike in reservation for OBCs in higher educational institutes." Definitely, the news now clearly doesn't mention its scope very well. While if it were on Portal:India's archive of News, the context is clearly present. The Portal:India is very active and per Nichalp there is no need to merge the archives of it to that of South Asia. Even if there might be a need to merge events of South Asia, the archives of News from Portal:India MUST be maintained separately. Just as you wouldn't suggest merging another of South Asian countries portal with Portal:India if they are not "up to the mark", the current event section also should be kept separate. Portal:India is a Featured Portal and for a good reason there are archives of the news. Any kind of changes to the archive will hurt the quality of the portal. -<a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.Saxena_7172.html" title="User:Ambuj.Saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbuj.Saxena_ee93.html" title="User talk:Ambuj.Saxena">talk</a>) 11:40, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV again</span></h2>
<p>See, time and again, whenever you ahve to make "generalized" stamements, you got to use such words which you have called "unencylopedic". Check any featured article, they often use such words. Replacing them with "exact" words like you do would mean ignoring the exceptions one might have encountered. Also, the POV/NPOV does not have to be checked for each and every line and phrase and word; it has to be checked for the entire article as a whole. e.e, one might make a generalized statement, and then in the next sentence, enumerate the exceptions. According to your view, it would seem that both lines must be khatched!</p>

<p>Hey. As it is currently set up, any image type of any subject <i>can</i> be nominated as a FPC -- policy doesn't explicitly exclude anything. Personally, I think a good autostereogram, one which shows what autostereograms are all about, would satisfy the criteria. But, as you say, and as the India map promotion revealed, many voters do have problems promoting images that are not pictures. I think an autostereogram would have trouble. You won't know until you try, though, so if you have a good autostereogram in mind, I would encourage you to nominate it. -- <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcasterline_8fb5.html" title="User:Bcasterline">bcasterline</a> • <a href="../../../b/c/a/User_talk%7EBcasterline_273f.html" title="User talk:Bcasterline">talk</a> 22:45, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for the suggestions, but I'm thinking that a major article size change and summarization would best be discussed by the community before it's carried out, since many people seem to support the article the way it is. As to the pictures next to the largest cities table, they fit perfectly on my screen and they don't overlap. I'm not sure if the problem that you have is shared by others or pretain to the majority of readers. The mulitple pictures are used to show the uniqueness in the various cities, instead of just concentrating on New York City, but I understand your argument in having just one picture.--<a href="../../../r/y/z/User%7ERyz05_ef61.html" title="User:Ryz05">Ryz05</a> <sub><a href="../../../r/y/z/User_talk%7ERyz05_3d38.html" title="User talk:Ryz05"><font color="red">t</font></a></sub> 22:32, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Ambuj:</p>
<p>I'm sorry that it took a day to get back to you. I woke up yesterday morning with the unholy combination of a migraine and nasty laryngitis, and I sound like a tortured teapot at the minute! Anyhow, thank you for the barnstar and your kind comments; they were quite a suprise, and I am very gratified by the recognition!</p>
<p>I have always hated the sight of 'it's' in the place of 'its;' it's my bête-noire, I suppose. Even though it is less interesting than my creating articles, I like to do what I can to reduce the number of instances of this on Wikipedia by spending a few hours tracking the blighters down. It might be a little eccentric, but I think the encyclopædia's being grammatically sound is as important as the contents therein.</p>
<p>As for copyright, I made that copydown image out of antipathy towards the whole system, although I would be intrigued to see how you corrected it&#160;:). I've written things and made CDs, and my own opinion is that a free flow of ideas open to everyone would be far better than the current system, which only benefits a minority. I would rather that people were accessing my things than <i>paying</i> for them. Who knows, maybe we'd have less people just in it for the money if copyright were taken out of the agenda; or possibly, I'm just being a vacant idealist...</p>
<p>As for understanding copyright policies, you're right, I don't have much of a clue in that arena. Well, I did study law a few years back, but I avoided copyright statutes- and all forms of commercial law- like the plague, and stuck to mostly criminal law. Given the choice between studying individuals' acts of madness and hundreds of clauses in a patent act, my interest slightly leaned towards the former!</p>

<dd>Thanks Ambuj! I have to bother you again: Browsing though <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:License_tags" class="extiw" title="commons:Category:License_tags">commons:Category:License tags</a>, I found more such licences that could do with a translation if and when you have the time:</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the translations. Regarding the PD template, a lot of users still upload files using the deprecated template.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Invitation and Recommendations for writing articles on Hindi Wikipedia</span></h2>
<blockquote style="border: 1px solid blue; padding: 2em;">
<p><b>Hindi wikipedia invites and welcomes Wikipedians to contribute for the cause of spreading knowledge and the Hindi language.</b> This page contains guidelines for writing a wiki-article on any topic at the Hindi Wikipedia, with special recommendations for writing in Hindi (Note: The script/font-family for Hindi is <b>Devanāgari</b>; the script/font-system for English is <b>Roman</b> script, also, the Hindi spelling system is not completely standardized). This article is yet in English language (mostly), in order to encourage even non-native/foreign people who have learnt/are learning Hindi to contribute to the Hindi wikipedia, and native Hindi speakers who normally write in English. The examples given below are only for explanation. Recommendations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly for proper viewing, it is recommended to keep all links NOT-UNDERLINED. Otherwise the मात्रा below the Hindi alphabets might get partly hidden behind the underlines. For this, please go to My Preferences (मेरी पसंद) at the top of the page, then click Misc., and then choose "underline links -&gt; Never". Save your settings. Also, do not click yes for "justify paragraphs", otherwise on some browsers, the devanagari script will appear highly distorted.</li>
<li>All users are requested and encouraged to contribute articles here, especially, to create new articles on general topics. They are also encouraged to expand the existing articles, and improve upon them. A non-user can also do the same; it is recommended but not required to register yourself as a wikipedian user at the Hindi wikipedia. As far as possible, each article should be written with a Neutral Point of View (NPOV)—no nationalistic or partiality or hatred based articles are welcome. The articles should be based on <i>facts</i>—and appropriate references should be provided as and where needed. See the English wiki's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Help%7EContents_Editing_Wikipedia_f2e1.html" title="Help:Contents/Editing Wikipedia">help page for editing in general</a>. Almost all the general wiki-features are available for editing on Hindi wiki too. Guidelines for the content matter is mostly the same as given in English wiki.</li>
<li>Since the Hindi wiki is at its initial stages, users are welcome to take introduction and basic points from the English (or another) wikipedia's corresponding article and translate them for small articles. An in-page link to the English wiki's article will be deemed sufficient for references (a template might be created stating this). For longer articles, it is recommended to mention the references separately.</li>
<li>Since most computer users in India and elsewhere have the standard Western-type keyboard, it is best recommended (but not necessarily required) to use the virtual (software) keyboard like the one of <a href="http://malayalamkeyboard.com/hindimozhi.htm" class="external text" title="http://malayalamkeyboard.com/hindimozhi.htm" rel="nofollow">Hindimozhi</a> or <a href="http://bangla.name/isis/" class="external text" title="http://bangla.name/isis/" rel="nofollow">of ISIS (Tavultesoft Keyman)</a>—which are freewares. These are advantageous because the contemporary Hindi-speakers in India often write messages/chat using Hindi words but written in Roman (English) script, and the layout of these keyboards is quite the same that such people use. For example, using the "normal" keyboard with this software, typing <i>ga</i> would give ग and <i>ghaa</i> would give घा.</li>
<li>Create the article with its name written in Hindi (devanagari script). Always take care to include the nukta (dot below) for foreign / Urdu loanwords wherever it occurs in the standard spelling. For non-Indian names, use that spelling (for article name and other words) which is commonly encountered in Hindi newspapers, G.K.-books, Hindi-dubbed TV documentaries and Hollywood films and magazines. e.g., America-अमरीका (या अमेरिका), China-चीन, French-फ़्रांसिसी. For English acronyms/short-forms, use the initials in Roman script, and again create a full form in Hindi and redirect it to the short form. e.g. <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_96f8.html" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</a> (अन्तर्राष्ट्रीय ध्वनि वर्णाक्षर); <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Nations_Organization_e65b.html" title="United Nations Organization">UNO</a> (संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघ). Doing the opposite is also fine. But creating the article with the Hindi short form, as सं०रा०सं०, is not recommended. Also, the article proper must be written with the proper nukta, as फ़ारसी, and then, a non-nukta (mis-)spelt version फारसी should preferably be created to redirect to the correct spelling.</li>
<li>Hindi wikipedia strongly recommends the users to write articles in everyday common Hindi in the खड़ीबोली dialect (Hindustani or Hindi-Urdu, i.e., बोलचाल वाली हिन्दी, which may include many loanwords from Persian and Arabic). The use of शुद्ध संस्कृतनिष्ठ हिन्दी is in general neither required nor recommended. E.g., use: वजह instead of कारण, ख़ास instead of विशेष, वगैरह instead of इत्यादि, लेकिन instead of परन्तु etc. However, for <i>technical</i> and <i>specialized</i> vocabulary, the use of शुद्ध संस्कृतनिष्ठ हिन्दी is recommended and usually mandatory. Thus: <i>upper House of Parliament</i>—संसद का उच्च सदन, but not Urdu—मजिलिस का ऐवान-ए-बाला&#160;; <i>Foreign Minister</i>—विदेशमन्त्री, but not Urdu—वज़ीर-ए-ख़ारिजा&#160;; <i>knowledge/science</i>—ज्ञान/विज्ञान, but not इल्म. Use spoken Hindi's ये and वो instead of यह and वह / वे. Do not use the title of respect जी after names, it is unencyclopedic. Thus: कृष्ण / श्री कृष्ण but not कृष्ण जी. Use the आप form and its corresponding 3rd person verbal conjugation for writing about respectable persons. Thus: श्री वाजपेयी मध्य प्रदेश में जन्मे थे. But not: वाजपेयी मध्य प्रदेश में जन्मा था. But do not use the pronoun "आप" itself in-text in biographies.</li>
<li>English should be used sparingly, only when required; i.e., if the corresponding शुद्ध हिन्दी word is too "difficult and not generally encountered", or if it is a proper name of non-Indian person/place/terminology/title, or if the user is highly unsure of the proper translation. It is recommended (but not required) for English-to-Hindi translation while writing articles, the <a href="http://www.shabdkosh.com" class="external text" title="http://www.shabdkosh.com" rel="nofollow">Shabdkosh online dictionary</a> should be used. For each English word, that alternative should be used which is generally encountered in everyday spoken Hindi, and also fits well into the context. Use of intelligent guesses for newly encountered words is also allowed, and so are translations encountered in Hindi-dubbed TV documentaries, Hollywood films, Hindi-translated books, etc. e.g., दमपिशाच for <a href="../../../d/e/m/Dementor.html" title="Dementor">en:Dementor</a> (used in dubbed HP films).</li>
<li>If used, it is recommended to use the English words within the articles using the English (Roman) alphabets rather than devanagari (or better, the devanagari transliteration should be used in the sentence, followed by the English word in Roman alphabet in parentheses). Such words should be italicized and not put in quotation marks. Preferably, there should be an in-page interwiki link (like&#160;:en:) on the word to the English wikipedia. If the word comes as an integral part of a sentence, so as not to break the continuity, the <i>en:</i> prefix should be hidden by writing the word again after the pipe sign (piped link). Thus, recommended: <code>हैरी पॉटर ने ''[[:en:Pensieve|Pensieve]]'' के अन्दर ''[[:en:Little Hangleton|Little Hangleton]]'' गाँव में लॉर्ड वोल्डेमॉर्ट की माँ ''[[:en:Merope Gaunt|Merope Gaunt]]'' को देखा. ''[[:en:Resplendent Quetzal|Resplendent Quetzal]]'' पक्षी के ऊपर एक मेक्सिकन पादरी डा० ''[[:en:Pablo de la Llave|Pablo de la Llave]]'' ने काफ़ी शोध किया था.</code> Whence,
<ul>
<li>हैरी पॉटर ने <i><a href="../../../p/e/n/Pensieve.html" title="Pensieve">Pensieve</a></i> के अन्दर <i><a href="../../../l/i/t/Little_Hangleton_cdda.html" title="Little Hangleton">Little Hangleton</a></i> गाँव में लॉर्ड वोल्डेमॉर्ट की माँ <i><a href="../../../m/e/r/Merope_Gaunt_20de.html" title="Merope Gaunt">Merope Gaunt</a></i> को देखा</li>
<li><i><a href="../../../r/e/s/Resplendent_Quetzal_e682.html" title="Resplendent Quetzal">Resplendent Quetzal</a></i> पक्षी के ऊपर एक मेक्सिकन पादरी डा० <i><a href="../../../p/a/b/Pablo_de_la_Llave_0a79.html" title="Pablo de la Llave">Pablo de la Llave</a></i> ने काफ़ी शोध किया था</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Always start the first 1 or 2 lines of the article giving its definition (from any standard dictionary/other wiki) or suitable introduction. Thus, recommended: <b>ललिता सहस्रनामन</b> हिन्दू धर्मसुधारक <a href="../../../%E0%A4%86/%E0%A4%A6/%E0%A4%BF/%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%BF_%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF.html" title="आदि शंकराचार्य">आदि शंकराचार्य</a> द्वारा रचित देवी <a href="../../../../hi/%E0%A4%A6/%E0%A5%81/%E0%A4%B0/%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%BE.html" class="extiw" title="hi:दुर्गा">दुर्गा</a> को समर्पित एक पूजा-मन्त्र है, जिसे कई हिन्दू रोज़ श्रद्धा से जपते हैं । But not: <b>ललिता सहस्रनामन</b> मन्त्र जपने के लिये लड्डू-पेड़ा, ताम्बुल, सिन्दूर, लाल चुनरी के साथ नित्य इस मन्त्र का पाठ करें, तो जल्द ही गड़ा हुआ ख़जाना मिलेगा । Recommended: <b>वैमानिक अभियान्त्रिकी</b> (<a href="../../../a/e/r/Aeronautical_engineering.html" title="Aeronautical engineering">en:Aeronautical engineering</a>) <a href="../../../../hi/%E0%A4%B5/%E0%A4%BF/%E0%A4%AE/%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8.html" class="extiw" title="hi:विमान">विमानों</a> (<a href="../../../a/i/r/Aircraft.html" title="Aircraft">en:Aircrafts</a>) की अभिकल्पना, निर्माण और प्रचालन करने का विज्ञान, कला और कार्य है । (<i>translated from Eng. Webster's New World Dictionary</i>). But not: आजकल वैमानिक अभियान्त्रिकी के लिये देशभर में कई कॉलेज खुल गये हैं, जिनमें अग्रणी स्थान यूटोपिया स्थित लालू-यादव टेक्लिनक कॉलेज का है ।</li>
<li>For names of countries, cities, places, languages, people, books, films, technical vocabulary, mythology, etc, start the article like this:
<ul>
<li>1. <code>The name in bold ('''अपोलो''')</code></li>
<li>2. <code>starting parenthesis, then English name in Roman script, in-page interwiki-linked to English wiki ff. by semicolon ((अंग्रेज़ी : [[:en:Apollo]];)</code></li>
<li>3. <code>The native name(s) if applicable in the italicized native script, preferably followed either by its italicized approximate Hindi pronunciation or non-italicized</code> <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phonetic_transcription.html" title="Phonetic transcription">phonological transcription</a> <code>within / /, ff. by closed parenthesis (यूनानी : ''Aπollων अपोल्लोन''))</code></li>
<li>4. <code>the rest of the definition or introduction (प्राचीन [[यूनानी धर्म]] (ग्रीक धर्म) और प्राचीन [[रोमन धर्म]] के सर्वोच्च देवता थे ।)</code> For country names, only the standard short form of the name is needed in the first line. If there is a common name for a difficult word in Hindustani, also mention it. Whence: <b>अपोलो</b> (अंग्रेज़ी&#160;: <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apollo.html" title="Apollo">en:Apollo</a>; यूनानी&#160;: <i>Aπollων अपोल्लोन</i>) प्राचीन यूनानी धर्म (ग्रीक धर्म) और प्राचीन रोमन धर्म के सर्वोच्च देवता थे । If you don't give the interwiki English/another language link (which would be deemed to be the default reference), then you MUST provide an appropriate reference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Please leave no article without an appropriate category. See the list of created categories <a href="../../../../hi/c/a/t/%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B7%7ECategories_b9c2.html" class="extiw" title="hi:विशेष:Categories">here</a>; you can also make a new category (pref. in Hindi). Please leave no article without at least <b>ONE</b> off page (like en:) interwiki link. E.g., the user can check the article name (say Apollo) on the finally redirected English page and append to the Hindi article (<code>[[en:Appolo]])</code>). These interlanguage links will help a bot to update all interwiki links for that article in all wikipedias. The category and the aforementioned link should be typed at the end of the article. If the article is very small, mention it as a stub/substub.</li>
<li>Use of templates is welcome. See the list of templates <a href="../../../../hi/t/e/m/%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%A3%E0%A5%80%7ETemplates_cb0d.html" class="extiw" title="hi:श्रेणी:Templates">here</a>. If creating a template, name it pref. in Hindi.</li>
<li>Use पूर्णविराम ( । ) instead of a period (.) for ending statements. The पूर्णविराम, semicolon, colon and dash (but not comma) must come after one space after the word to prevent ambiguity. Use the international form of the Hindu-Arabic numerals (1,2,3 instead of १,२,३), as used by the Constitution and the Government of India (even for Hindi). There is no need to use the हलन्त at the end of Sanskrit words wherever it occurs. Hence, prefer: संसद over संसद्; अथर्वन over अथर्वन्. Use the proper quotation marks “” from the Insert toolbox, not "". Write dates as 2 मई 2006 (ईसवी or ईसापूर्व). Write time as 3:45 pm. Separate common suffix-words like शास्त्र, विज्ञान, ज्ञान with a hyphen. Thus: रसायन-शास्त्र. For most others, leave both the words of the noun-cluster free. Combine them into one word only if it is very common to do so. Thus: सामवेद.</li>
<li>The use of <b>ज़</b> for the <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiced_alveolar_fricative.html" title="Voiced alveolar fricative">en:voiced alveolar fricative</a> (/z/, as in <b>z</b>oo, ro<b>s</b>e) is fundamentally wrong. Its nearest counterpart is the <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiceless_alveolar_fricative.html" title="Voiceless alveolar fricative">en:voiceless alveolar fricative</a> /s/ (as in <b>s</b>ea), and not Hindi ज (<a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiced_palatal_plosive.html" title="Voiced palatal plosive">en:voiced palatal plosive</a>). Hence, it is suggested and recommended that for the sound /z/, whether it comes in English (etc.) spellings (z) for while pronunciation otherwise, should be transcribed as <b>स़</b> (स with a dot below, available in the Insert toolbox). Hence: Reason <b>रीस़न</b>, not रीज़न&#160;; Roses <b>रोस़ेस़</b>, not रोज़ेज़. But common Hindi words borrowed from Persian/Arabic (so-called Urdu words) are allowed to continue with ज़ spelling. Thus: ज़रा, नज़र, तर्ज़. The <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiced_postalveolar_fricative.html" title="Voiced postalveolar fricative">en:voiced postalveolar fricative</a> (/ʒ/ as in trea<b>s</b>ure), inexistent in Hindi, can similarly be transcribed with <b>श़</b>. Thus: treasure <b>ट्रॅश़र</b>. The nukta (dot) available in the Insert toolbox can be combined with various consonants to suggest a more exact phonetic devanagari rendering of foreign sounds. E.g., since phonetically, English Think and this are not equal to थिंक and दिस, a better transcription could be <b>थ़िंक</b> and <b>द़िस</b>. <b>Please take care of the dot below in so-called Urdu words, otherwise the Hindi spelling is deemed incorrect</b>.</li>
<li>For the following English vowels m<b>e</b>t, m<b>a</b>te, m<b>a</b>t, transcribe as मॅट (short vowel), मेट (not मेइट), मैट (not मॅट, as popular in Marathi). However in contemporary Hindi and here, it is acceptable to use ए instead of ऍ. Thus: अमेरिका is more popular than अमॅरिका. For c<b>o</b>t, c<b>oa</b>t, c<b>au</b>ght, transcribe as कॉट, कोट, कॉट (not कौट). Transcribe English /t/ and /d/ as ट and ड.</li>
<li>Use half-न before त, थ, द, ध, न, instead of anuswaar अं. Use half-म before प, फ, ब, भ, म. Use the anuswaar before all the rest of the consonants (not half-ङ, ञ, ण). If the मात्रा is not above the alphabet, use chandra-bindu, but only for <b>nasalization</b>. Thus: अन्दर, not अंदर&#160;; अन्त, not अंत&#160;; हिन्दी, not हिंदी&#160;; सम्भव, not संभव&#160;; पंचमी, not पञ्चमी&#160;; अंडा, not अण्डा&#160;; कंठ, not कण्ठ&#160;; लैंड, not लैण्ड&#160;; आँख, not आंख. However, both forms are acceptable in contemporary Hindi as well as here; the prec. are just recommendations.</li>
<li>When proceded by another vowel, use the pure vowels instead of य (unless the य is clearly articulated while pronouncing). Thus&#160;: जाएँ, not जायें (not जावें)&#160;; आएगा, not आयेगा . However, both forms are acceptable in contemporary Hindi as well as here.</li>
<li>Please pay careful attention to the masculine/feminine gender (and singular/plural) in adjectives and verbs, else the sentence becomes ungrammatical.</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My take on the IIT FAC</span></h2>
<p>Hi Ambuj,</p>
<p>Well, let's see. I don't think that I voted "support" on the IIT FAC because I felt too "broken" to raise more objections. I have no problem being the only person to object to an FAC nomination; in fact, it happens quite frequently. I will say, however, that I have a tendency to subconsciously "reward good behavior". That is, if I saw two FACs of identical quality but slightly below my standards, and one of them had been worked on extensively through the FAC process while the other had not, I would be more likely to vote support on the first than on the second. Just a tendency of mine—I don't enjoy being confrontational to people who are obviously working hard to make improvements. That tendency is perhaps stronger when I'm the lone opposition. So perhaps some of that influenced my decision, but I don't think it was a significant factor. When I voted support, I recognized that the prose was still not at 100%, but after reading the article thoroughly looking for errors, I recognized its overall quality and was willing to back off a little bit on the prose. That's something I'm willing to do—if an article goes above and beyond in some areas, I'm often willing to leave minor problems alone and support anyway.</p>
<p>Another factor in this case was the amount of time I put into the article. It's rare that I spend as many hours as I did attempting to fix an FAC, and the effort I put into it may have influenced me to vote support (since one always thinks more highly of one's own work). There may have also been a sense of futility--I was the only one picking out some of the grammar errors (even after Taxman copyedited it, I went through again and found another dozen problems). So it becomes easy to think to oneself, "oh, maybe I'm the only one who sees these problems; perhaps they aren't really that big of a deal".</p>
<p>It's complicated. I don't think I was "broken" into voting the way I did. However, if the article had first appeared in its current state on the FAC page, I might not have supported it right away. But I don't regret the vote—being human, I'm incapable of being a perfectly impartial judge. There's always the element of peer pressure, and while I think I do a good job of avoiding it (like I said, I have no problem being the lone opposition), it does influence me to some extent.</p>
<p>Tony and I are alike in that we both have very high standards for FACs. I probably initially object to 90%+ of the FACs I see, and so does he. The difference between my support and Tony's support is that Tony's make or break issue is the prose. If the prose isn't up to par, he objects. For me, the make or break issue is inline citations. If I notice sections without inline citations, I object, largely without considering anything else. That isn't to say that prose isn't important to me, and I know that citations are important to Tony too, but our #1 priorities are different.</p>
<p>I wouldn't worry too much about the whole Wikiproject mass voting issue (it's inevitable with Wikiprojects, and the good that these Wikiprojects do far outweighs any harm, if there actually is any). Just continue to show people that are you are willing to accept objections and work through them, and encourage editors within the wikiproject not to challenge other voters except in exceptional cases. Most of the time, the FAC regulars are quick to point out invalid votes, and too often, those with an interest in the article or its subject matter feel that they must defend their support vote by questioning someone else's objection. This is especially true of those with little FAC experience, because they've never seen my demands or Tony's demands before, even though we have consistently made them on scores of FACs over the past months.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.

<p>Hi again, I think I might have been a bit i don't know, curt, earlier and I don't respond well to criticism and I like to argue, sorry about that. I went through the article and removed points about "Webster's Eloquence" "and masterful uses" and the like. In addition to this I dealt with things you yourself pointed out to me; "widely respected throughout the community" has had an inline citation added to it, as has the claim of Ebenezer's regret at not being educated fueling his desire to educate Daniel. "Though poor and uneducated" remains but I justify the "dramatization" by using the uneducated clause to establish the aforementioned regret and the poor part to establish the ever present money woes in both websters' life. I hope these changes and the others I've made without specific prompting are satisfactory and that you would at least be willing to reconsider your position. If not, thank you for considering the article. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyJoe_b2ac.html" title="User:TonyJoe">TonyJoe</a> 03:30, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
