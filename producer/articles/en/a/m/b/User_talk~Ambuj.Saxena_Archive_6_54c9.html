<p>Dear sir<br />
Re. <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jolly_Roger_Restaurant_5629.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jolly Roger Restaurant">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jolly Roger Restaurant</a>, I am seeking consensus. Toward meeting your interests, the <b>topic <u>already exists</u></b> in improved and complete form, per Wikipedia standards, <b>in context</b>, at <a href="../../../l/a/k/Lake_City%2C_Seattle%2C_Washington_616f.html#Storied_past" title="Lake City, Seattle, Washington">Lake City, Seattle, Washington#Storied past</a>. The piece was chopped out by a newbie. The damage was soon repaired, and I've been trying to clean up this uprooted duplicate leftover. For Wikipedia quality, I would prefer disposing of this odd snippet, rather than leaving a scrap lying about. I am the original researcher and author of the topic in the article, post <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lake_City%2C_Seattle%2C_Washington&amp;oldid=53159721" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lake_City%2C_Seattle%2C_Washington&amp;oldid=53159721" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The Jolly Roger story is an integral part of the character of Lake City, but it is otherwise not particularly encyclopedic.</p>
<p>So toward consenus, would you change your vote? Thank you for your consideration. --<a href="../../../g/o/d/User%7EGoDot_aa14.html" title="User:GoDot">GoDot</a> 11:10, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Ambuj</p>
<p>Well, thanks for that. I've inserted that extra code into the six items in Exercise 1. Can you try it now and see whether it makes a difference? If so, I'll pass on this suggestion to AndyZ, from whose "suggestions" article I copied the original code. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 13:07, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, and the other problem is that unless the sentence in each question is short, it doubles back to a new line, which is mostly obliterated (you can see only the top half of that line). Any idea how to prevent this from happening? <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 13:09, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS Why on earth are you going for the mop? As a general rule, those without it are the ones who contribute the intellectual content. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 13:10, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That's just excellent, Ambuj. Do I understand that you've gone through the whole thing with respect to both issues (premature displays <i>and</i> semi-hidden overhangs)? I think you have, but let me know if I need to do it. I'll direct AndyZ to this discussion. Thanks TONS.</p>

One problem is with the legend of Ahmed Shah. The legend story is there in all the books of Ahmedabad and I have also cited one book for the legend. So does it qualify as a weasel word? I changed the sentence to read "A popular story about the creation of Ahmedabad..." instead of "Legend has it...". The second point that I have not addressed yet is the cite news tag. I am not very familiar with the use of that tag.

<p>Hi Ambuj. Will you do me a favour and have a look at the formatting for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tony1/How_to_satisfy_Criterion_2a:_exercises_in_textual_flow#Exercise_2:_sentence_length|" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tony1/How_to_satisfy_Criterion_2a:_exercises_in_textual_flow#Exercise_2:_sentence_length|" rel="nofollow">my new question/answer tutorial on sentence length</a>? Only the first one is done. The only problem that sticks out to <i>me</i> is the large gap between the heading "Solution" and the actual solution sentence. How to reduce?</p>
<p>Also, I've tried a light green background for the paragraph exercise at the top. I wonder whether you can point me to the codes for all of the available colours; I'd like something even lighter. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">Tony</a> 09:22, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Ambuj: Thank you, thank you. A few points.</p>
<ul>
<li>I've not gone for a "safe" background colour, because none of those displayed at the linked articles was light enough. I hope that it causes no problems on an 800 x 600 display.</li>
<li>There was problematic text-wrapping on my screen in the question box, so I've shorted the lines by using the line breaker—rather laboriously, by trial and error. And I've ramped up the vertical measure to 10em.</li>
<li>I'm unsure of the problem you talk of with 800 x 600. When I choose that (down from 1680 x 1050), it looks fine—just ... big. Let me know if it's a problem still.</li>
<li>Do you like the hint idea?</li>

I think talking to you was overdue, in fact, since I never really got the chance to express you how impressed and moved I was with the diffs I provided at your RfA. It shows that not only you're a hard working and talented editor, but a great person as well. I hope we get to talk more pretty soon!

<p>I've been looking through your RfA and would like to give my thoughts about it to you. Some voters have opposed or even changed to oppose in under 2 minutes from their last edit. So let me guess this straight,</p>
<ol>
<li>they browse to <a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfA_0b0c.html" title="WP:RfA">WP:RfA</a> from the last page they were on</li>
<li>scroll down to your name on the list</li>
<li>and they've read all the main oppose reasons</li>
<li>and look at all the difs included with them</li>
<li>make their decision whether to oppose</li>
<li>scrolled back up to the <i>Edit</i> button</li>
<li>and edited in their oppose vote</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>All in under 2 minutes?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm not giving out any names, but sometimes I just feel people oppose just for the sake of it instead of actually reviewing the oppose reasons. Fact is, your being opposed because</p>
<ul>
<li>Your standards of a featured article are higher than other users</li>
<li>Your approach disagreeing with SV's actions on the talk page weren't particularly great, you wanted opinions about the situation but went the wrong way about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I don't understand how that will make you a significantly bad admin. But hey, maybe it's just me?

<p>While I disagree with people's reasoning in opposing, I do not get to make the final decision myself. Don't take it too hard, everyone agrees you are a good contributor and what doesn't kill you typically makes you stronger. I'm sure you'll be even more well prepared next time, just take into account what things you can from the oppose votes in order to improve what you can and let go of the rest. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 17:18, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have to say, I was a bit p*ssed off at some of the reasons for people opposing (especially the comment about your English, but whatever...). And, there does seem to have been a bit of piggy-back voting (But I see that on many RfAs these days) by people who have evidentally friends of Slim Virgin and so felt obligied to back up that particular POV&#160;:) If you do go up for RfA again, I wish you the best of luck and will, obviously, support. <a href="../../../s/u/k/User%7ESukh_2aea.html" title="User:Sukh">Sukh</a> | <span style="color: green;" lang="pa" xml:lang="pa">ਸੁਖ</span> | <a href="../../../s/u/k/User_talk%7ESukh_f94b.html" title="User talk:Sukh">Talk</a> 17:53, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You got an overwhelming support and unfortunately due to a variety of reasons, some significant opposition as well. Don't let this worry you in any way and continue your good work.

<dd>Also notice that almost everyone that supported you in the beginning, did not change their opinion in the end. It was a whole lot of new opposes that showered in after the FAC thing.

<p>Hi Ambuj, belated birthday wishes! I'm not in India at the moment, and so my internet connection is a bit sporadic. I'm sorry your RFA didn't turn out too good, I came to know about it only at the last minute. RFA is a mess I know, and the issue was not very serious. All that was needed was to have a reputed editor break down SV's opposition and make it less vitriolic that what it seemed. Unfortunately nobody rose up to the occasion and we had the equivalent of a sock-voting "NO" without personally evaluating if there was a serious problem. PS I'll resume editing this weekend.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Accreditions</span></h2>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am unsure of the changes you made, which don't seem to make sense to me. You have added <a href="../../../a/i/c/AICTE_6a11.html" title="AICTE">AICTE</a> as a school accreditor, while I know it as an accredition council for technical education (college level). Even <a href="http://www.education.nic.in/higedu.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.education.nic.in/higedu.asp" rel="nofollow">the link you provide</a> speaks it as a part of high education system, which means college level. I believe this confusion was created because of differences in way things are referred to in India, as against the US (this part I am deducing from the discussion above). Also, I find the AICTE category too much misleading as the colleges are not a part of AICTE, the accredition being the only link. A better category would be Category:AICTE approved colleges and universities, though even that definition would cover nearly every technical college in India. There are only a handful of those that are not accredited by AICTE, so this separation looks like dividing the things in the world as bananas and non-bananas. I request you to undo the changes you made, as I find them misleading and inaccurate. — <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.Saxena_7172.html" title="User:Ambuj.Saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbuj.Saxena_ee93.html" title="User talk:Ambuj.Saxena">talk</a>) 13:40, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>1) Yes, <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_India_Council_for_Technical_Education_9f2c.html" title="All India Council for Technical Education">All India Council for Technical Education</a> is part of education department and it accredits, according to the department.<a href="http://www.education.nic.in/higedu.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.education.nic.in/higedu.asp" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) I don't understand your point. The schools are in the category because they are accredited by <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_India_Council_for_Technical_Education_9f2c.html" title="All India Council for Technical Education">All India Council for Technical Education</a>. If you click on the category it states "<b>The following are schools under the supervision of All India Council for Technical Education</b>." This is standard on wikipedia, for example, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_Association_of_Schools_and_Colleges_19fe.html" title="New England Association of Schools and Colleges">New England Association of Schools and Colleges</a> has the schools it accredits in its catgeory, which is a subcategory of school accreditation. I guess if you have a problem with the categories of that name you should propose renaming all the accreditation categories, and not just that one.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3) The categories are for accreditated schools, whether there by 20 or 2,000 (in the case of <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_Association_of_Schools_and_Colleges_19fe.html" title="New England Association of Schools and Colleges">New England Association of Schools and Colleges</a>) it doesn't matter. There are only a few New England schools not accredited by that assoc. It is show the relation and oversight, which recognizes the degrees (accredited vs non-accredited). In the case of <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Association_of_Colleges_and_Schools_eac1.html" title="Southern Association of Colleges and Schools">Southern Association of Colleges and Schools</a> it accredits over 13,000+ schools. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliEd_4d84.html" title="User:CaliEd">CaliEd</a> 19:27, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Ambuj. I was on a long vacation to India. Came back yesterday.

<dd>Thanks for your help! In fact, I just nominated <a href="../../../l/a/d/Ladakh.html" title="Ladakh">Ladakh</a> for FA. With your help, hopefully it would soon achieve that standard. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeeptrivia_80bd.html" title="User:Deeptrivia">deeptrivia</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/e/User_talk%7EDeeptrivia_3f41.html" title="User talk:Deeptrivia">talk</a>) 20:09, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi! Something peculiar happened just now! I tried editing in the talkpage of Ratnadeep joshi (<a href="../../../r/a/t/User_talk%7ERatnadeep_joshi_697b.html" title="User talk:Ratnadeep joshi">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__Ratnadeep_joshi_fa63.html" title="Special:Contributions/ Ratnadeep joshi">contribs</a>). Somehow I ended up adding something to your welcome subuser page! And then had to revert it. And then tried to edit again on that user's talk page, but could not!!! Did you happen to notice something similar?--<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayan</a> (<a href="../../../d/w/a/User_talk%7EDwaipayanc_1f27.html" title="User talk:Dwaipayanc">talk</a>) 18:58, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi! Thanks for the additions, but I guess it failed because there weren't any supports coming and I was too busy to actually work on the article during the week. I too was surprised by the delisting, it was there for less than a week.

<p>Regarding your comment, well what can I say!! It sure looks very interesting to me... I remember the previous one about the chicken too. That one had some problem regarding RD not being online etc. Ah well, you are far better at these things than I.. so I can hardly give any advice. Maybe nominate more mundane ones:) -- <a href="../../../l/o/s/User%7ELostintherush_780a.html" title="User:Lostintherush">Lost</a><a href="../../../l/o/s/User_talk%7ELostintherush_4204.html" title="User talk:Lostintherush"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 14:23, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was typing a reply when your message came. My internet connection has gone terribly slow for some reason. I've taken care of most of the stuff. Just a couple of points I'd like clarified:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do I verify the IPA? There is a concern (on the talk page) about the voice rendering too - I'll take care of that soon.</li>
<li><i>Since 2003 however, an economic rejuvenation has arrested the morbid decline, leading to a spurt in the city's growth.</i> - That was ripped off Kolkata, an FA.&#160;:P Do you think I should change it?</li>
<li>About the "low industrialisation" ref - I couldnt find any refs particularly for Kochi. The entire state was under an economic stagnation for a long time, so that includes Kochi too. If that comes up during FAC, I guess I'm left with no option but to clarify myself. Any other ideas?</li>
<li>Good that you pointed out the GDP flaw. That site gave the same GDP for all the Indian cities! Apparently, it was India's GDP. I've removed it now.</li>
<li>I have cut the number of newspapers, but have left the TV channels as it is, because all of them are very popular in Kerala.</li>
<li>44:1000&#160;??!! Hehe...., too bad for you.
