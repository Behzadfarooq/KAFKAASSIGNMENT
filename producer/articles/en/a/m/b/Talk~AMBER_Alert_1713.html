<p>Seems there should be a section for criticisms, statistics for success and failure rates, and also examples of the "scams."</p>
<p>Obviously from this Talk page, there is plenty of controversy, disagreement, lack of clear data, and scamming going on in the country regarding Amber Alert. Yet this doesn't seem to be mentioned in the article.</p>
<p>Evidently there isn't a consensus and there's a problem with whether some sources are legitimate. But shouldn't these things at least be mentioned in the article, with their specifics omitted? I for one have no idea what the controversies and scams are ABOUT. I don't need names and places -- I just need to know the concepts. What is the controversy? Could the scams be described? <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETragic_romance_34e6.html" title="User:Tragic romance">Tragic romance</a> 04:00, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, should an entire underlying concept be removed from an article just because its specifics are unsourced? Or should the specifics be removed, while leaving the concept intact? [For example, you wouldn't delete the entire "Hail Mary" section from the football article just because someone put in unsourced info about players and coaches who used it.]<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETragic_romance_34e6.html" title="User:Tragic romance">Tragic romance</a> 04:04, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I had put those questions in there to accompany the sectstub that was applicable to the History section. Someone squeezed in a new section above the stub and comments last month.

<p>I removed this link from the see also. The program is used to help find children of a variety of colors and both genders in my area and I am sorry if it is only used to find white females in the area of whoever added it but it is not related to this article. - <a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzain_cd43.html" title="User:Kuzain">Kuzain</a> 16:46, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Since Amber Alerts are predominantly concerned with white rich kids, particularly female, certainly the link about "Missing white woman syndrome" is relevant.</p>

<dd>Can you back up this claim with some facts? If that link is to be there, it needs to be accompanied with properly sourced justification.

<p>I concur with Kuzain. The Amber Alert system has nothing to do with the cultural phenomenon "Missing White Woman Syndrome." I could see an article on "Missing White Woman Syndrome" referencing the Amber Alert article, but not the other way around.<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETragic_romance_34e6.html" title="User:Tragic romance">Tragic romance</a> 03:29, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article as it was on 3-01-06 is emblematic of what is wrong with Wikipedia. It was an advertisement rather than an impartial encyclopedia-like article. Amber alerts, who issues them, how they are used, how much funding goes to them, and what happens to the funding, are controversial subjects. Promotional writings on Amber alerts deserve a skeptical eye.</p>
<p>There are so many people profiting from child protection scams, particularly the government sponsored ones, that nowadays in America, almost any program or agency claiming to help children should be suspect. Nobody should simply assume these programs or agencies are blossoming from the goodness of someone's heart. — Nehmo 15:06 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You raise some excellent points, but you also demonstrated some of the other shortcomings of Wikipedia. For one, your attempts to correct the situation consisted of turning the article into a very informally phrased message board post; your contributions belie your frustration, as they sound more like sour grapes than anything academic. Also, the article was actually far more neutral before someone started messing with it on February 19. You should always check the recent history on an article that attracts scam artists because they tend to sneak things in, and they make their last change be a minor edit that causes people checking watchlists to overlook the more drastic changes made on the same day. That's pretty much what happened here (I'm not calling anyone a scammer, I'm just saying there were some less-than-ideal edits that snuck in). For now, I have reverted it to the last 'good' version. This also includes reverting the 'Successful Examples' section that was added by <a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappa.jake_9f3e.html" title="User:Zappa.jake">Zappa.jake</a>; in hindsight, I think a discussion of examples should include a mention that unsuccessful examples are rarely publicized, and the likelihood that the 'success' of the system is hard to measure, since many cases are never proven to be abductions. So please review the current article and see what you think is needed, and let's discuss its shortcomings here (see below). — <a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMjb_eccd.html" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a> 19:44, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it's not necessary to elaborate on the criticisms of child protection scams in general, at least not in an article devoted to AMBER Alerts specifically, but I'd like to at least characterize the controversy (i.e., mention that it exists). Would you say that the system's high visibility is thought, by some, to feed into the public's paranoia and hysteria about child abductions? I think I would, but I can't cite a source for that.</p>
<p>What are some of the other criticisms?</p>
<p>Some of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AMBER_Alert&amp;diff=41746300&amp;oldid=41376169" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AMBER_Alert&amp;diff=41746300&amp;oldid=41376169" rel="nofollow">contributions by Nehmo (click)</a> that were removed when reverting the article to the relatively neutral version include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who prompts the issuing of alerts? It was speculated that sometimes it is local police departments, and sometimes it is child protection services divisions of state governments, while some erroneously think it is the Dept. of Homeland Security. Who's doing the issuing and at whose behest seems like it should be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a> info; would someone mind doing some Googling for that?</li>
<li>It was speculated that an AMBER Alert wouldn't have helped Amber Hagerman, and "Maybe it was just a feel-good the media wanted after the kid's murder". Wikipedia is not the place for such speculation, but there might be ways we can work these points into the article when discussing the intent and justification of the system when it was created.</li>
<li>Criteria for issuing an alert varies widely, and the state of Maine's criteria was given as an example, along with discussion of how other jurisdictions' criteria may differ. I think this is good stuff and can be restored, but it needs some phrasing cleanup. Did you (Nehmo) author it yourself or did you pull it from somewhere? It was formatted with hard line breaks which makes me think you copy-pasted it from somewhere.</li>
<li>More examples of successes and failures were given. I like the general idea but it could grow out of hand; we need to first write some prose about the variable measures of 'success' and the fact that failures are not publicized. Then, any examples <i>must</i> have sources cited.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nehmo, please adhere to Wikipedia conventions here. Don't split up someone's original comments. If you need to address them point-by-point, then make separate copies what you're responding to, and use indenting (everything at a particular indent level should be attributable to the same person, so they don't have to sign every paragraph).

<dd>I don't know. But it's a separate issue than anything I discussed. The main issue is that Amber alerts are claiming to be something they are not.

It unabashedly presented Amber alerts as benevolent, and it didn't even contain one critical item.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Moreover, you displayed your own bias this when you choose to include (subsequently removed by Lendu ) as the only example of an Amber alert the vague "successful" example added by Zappa.jake. There were so few details in the story, I couldn't conduct a decent search on it, but I tried <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Saint+Paul%2C+Minnesota+amber+alert+2004+boy&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Saint+Paul%2C+Minnesota+amber+alert+2004+boy&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Let me know when you find the story. Actually, Zappa.jake, the original submitter of the example, should provide a cite. If Wikipedia allows submitters to just fabricate examples, biased ones at that, then Wikipedia is less reliable than even the usenet. At least in that case the possibility of a challenge is more likely.</dd>

<dd>Pretty much everything you've said above is based on incorrect assumptions. When you started making changes to the article, it was, I agree, in a pretty sorry state. It got that way mainly due to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AMBER_Alert&amp;diff=40353511&amp;oldid=40258935" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AMBER_Alert&amp;diff=40353511&amp;oldid=40258935" rel="nofollow">series of edits</a> made on February 19 by an anonymous user at IP address 65.25.18.202 (this person was attempting to fill in some history details in order to justify removal of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Template_talk%7ESectstub_0858.html" title="Template talk:Sectstub">sectstub</a>, but they ended up just adding propaganda), and Zappa.jake's edit on February 21, which added the so-called 'succesful example'. (And all Lendu did was add a link to the Finnish version of the article.) Prior to 65.25.18.202's changes it was actually in pretty good shape, and did <i>not</i> have egregious bias problems. You are completely mistaken when you say that I reverted it to a version that said "She could possibly been rescued shortly after she was abducted. If only there had been a means of spreading her information, the nine-year-old girl could have lived." That text clearly came from 65.25.18.202's ill-advised changes made on February 19.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Neither did I knowingly "allow speculation to stand for so long" as you ask about below. It was actually not even two weeks. And what happened was this: when I checked my watchlist on the night of Feb. 19, I saw only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AMBER_Alert&amp;diff=40353511&amp;oldid=40353332" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AMBER_Alert&amp;diff=40353511&amp;oldid=40353332" rel="nofollow">the very last edit by 65.25.18.202</a>. It was very benign, and I didn't think to check to see if any more drastic edits had been made prior to that. Watchlists only show the most recent change, you know, so when someone follows up a major change with a minor one, it has the effect of "nothing to see here, move along". This is a trick some people use when they make controversial edits. Sometimes it is just an accident. Anyway, that's how it slipped by me and probably everyone else who is watching this article. Then, when I checked my watchlist on the 21st, I saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AMBER_Alert&amp;diff=40585438&amp;oldid=40353511" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AMBER_Alert&amp;diff=40585438&amp;oldid=40353511" rel="nofollow">Zappa.jake's edit</a>. I could see that his edit was rather useless and unverifiable as an example, but it wasn't demanding immediate attention, and I figured it would be dealt with by someone with a greater interest in the article anyway. The next edit was TSP's on Feb. 26, which got buried in my watchlist (which is rather long) and I never saw it. It didn't reflect any bias, though. Then you came along with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AMBER_Alert&amp;diff=41746300&amp;oldid=41376169" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AMBER_Alert&amp;diff=41746300&amp;oldid=41376169" rel="nofollow">a ton of changes</a> that, in conjunction with what came before, left the article looking not just "unpolished" but also resembling an informal message board post editorializing in rebuttal to some unseen propaganda. It needed more than copyedits and would have had to be completely rewritten to bring it up to encyclopedic standards. So I reverted it to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AMBER_Alert&amp;oldid=40258935" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AMBER_Alert&amp;oldid=40258935" rel="nofollow">the pre-chaos version</a>, and then posted here in order to explain the action and start some productive discussion on what <i>this</i> version of the article actually needs in order to be improved.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Who prompts the issuing of alerts? It was speculated that sometimes it is local police departments and sometimes it is child protection services divisions of state governments, while some erroneously think it is the Dept. of Homeland Security.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I addressed this already, and I could expand on the topic too.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What I meant, and I provided two explanatory links, was that some people confuse Homeland Security advisories with Amber alerts. They see the words "Amber alert" and they think it's a risk level, which are colored for distinction, and two of the colors are amberish. I don't know of any instance of someone believing Homeland Security issued a missing-kid Amber alert. -- Nehmo</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK, I see what you are saying (The "AMBER" in AMBER Alert is sometimes mistakenly thought to indicate a risk level in a color-coded system like those used for air quality and national security alerts, whereas it is actually just the name of the type of bulletin issued by agencies participating in this system). If we are careful how we phrase it, we could say this in the article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>It was speculated that an AMBER Alert wouldn't have helped Amber Hagerman, and "Maybe it was just a feel-good the media wanted after the kid's murder". Wikipedia is not the place for such speculation, but there might be ways we can work these points into the article when discussing the intent and justification of the system when it was created.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>The previous article _speculated_ that such an Amber alert back then in Arlington would have helped Amber: <i>"She could possibly been rescued shortly after she was abducted. If only there had been a means of spreading her information, the nine-year-old girl could have lived."</i> Why did you allow that speculation to stand for so long if speculation is inappropriate? -- Nehmo</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Criteria for issuing an alert varies widely, and the state of Maine's criteria was given as an example, along with discussion of how other jurisdictions' criteria may differ. I think this is good stuff and can be restored, but it needs some phrasing cleanup. Did you (Nehmo) author it yourself or did you pull it from somewhere? It was formatted with hard line breaks which makes me think you copy-pasted it from somewhere.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I wrote it myself. I agree, it wasn't in polished form, but the previous version of that section was worse. Even though the section used the qualifiers "most" and "guidelines" It implied those criteria are indeed used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article I changed states "… most alerts follow the following guidelines".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1. Since written guidelines or criteria vary widely, how can anyone say they are followed? Just what is being followed?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2. Nobody follows the criteria. None of the examples I posted conformed to any criteria. And if you look at the local alerts in your community, you'll see how loosely the criteria in your area are followed. Many cases are girls who left with their boyfriends, foster kids trying to escape, or parents "taking" their own children. These aren't Amber-alert-monsters abducting little kids. -- Nehmo</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK, well, regarding point #1, the qualifiers made it pretty clear that the four criteria listed were in the ballpark, but were not supposed to be exhaustive. I don't think people reading it would come away with the wrong impression of what the criteria actually are, because it disclaimed away any pretense of the list being anything more than representative. On the second point, though, you are correct, there was no citation provided to verify that most jurisdictions follow the guidelines, and it's plausible, if not verifiable, that they don't. I think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AMBER_Alert&amp;diff=42490592&amp;oldid=42479112" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AMBER_Alert&amp;diff=42490592&amp;oldid=42479112" rel="nofollow">TSP's edit today</a> tightens up the language of that section pretty well, and makes good use of <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scare_quotes.html" title="Scare quotes">scare quotes</a> and a reference to a source. — <a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMjb_eccd.html" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a> 11:40, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>More examples of successes and failures were given. I like the general idea but it could grow out of hand; we need to first write some prose about the variable measures of 'success' and the fact that failures are not publicized. Then, any examples</i> must <i>have sources cited.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>I never characterized anything as a success of failure, and it would be simplistic to divide cases into those categories. If, via an Amber alert, a mother gets caught for trying to keep her baby from what she believes are kidnappers, the state government, is her capture a success? In a way it is. It's a successful kidnapping. —Nehmo 16:56 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps, but the article isn't a place for such "food for thought". Any examples must be illustrating an explicitly stated point. I think if you/we can come up with a way to phrase that point as matter-of-fact rather than implying it or editorializing, then those examples might be useful. —<a href="../../../m/j/b/User%7EMjb_eccd.html" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a> 11:40, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Amber alerts are issued at the discretion of the city or county emergency manager. Traditional ways of issuing alerts are to send faxes to all media outlets (namely television and radio stations). The Emergency Alert System is the key dissemination instrument. EAS is a FCC-mandated network of radio and television stations, and has by far been the most effective way of distributing AMBER Alerts (called Child Abduction Emergencies [CAEs]). While the EAS system is mandated by the FCC, broadcasting of AMBER Alerts are not- a station is free to choose to not disseminate an alert. While most stations will broadcast an alert for public safety issues and (frankly) good press, there are stations who refuse to interrupt programming for a child abduction alert. Billboards that have marquees dedicated to local emergencies have also been extremely effective ways of distributing alerts. Difficulty arises when the child "abducted" has been taken by a divorced parent- the emergency manager must be selective in issuing AMBER Alerts because he/she does not want to desensitize the local population to serious alerts such as AMBERs. There is no universal protocol for determining when or when not to issue a CAE. —24.11.214.174 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's my opinion that the pastor is mistaken, and is trying to generate book sales with his claim that he initially suggested the Amber Alert. In his story, he mentions that the Arlington Police Chief was Dee Anderson and I know for a fact that is absolutely incorrect.

<p>I think that the section on England's "Child Rescue Alert" system probably merits being split off into its own article, since the program is so separate from the AMBER Alert system in the U.S. and Canada. A new section for "Child alert systems in other countries" with a link to the new article would probably be sufficient. Does anyone object to this? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevyn_a8f7.html" title="User:Kevyn">Kevyn</a> 08:14, 4 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That sounds correct to me. This article is not about "Child alert systems." This is specifically about the "Amber Alert" system. I also agree that the two proposed articles be linked. <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETragic_romance_34e6.html" title="User:Tragic romance">Tragic romance</a> 03:51, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just announced today. <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070123/ap_on_hi_te/myspace_amber_alerts" class="external free" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070123/ap_on_hi_te/myspace_amber_alerts" rel="nofollow">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070123/ap_on_hi_te/myspace_amber_alerts</a></p>
<p>Probably should go in the article somewhere.</p>
