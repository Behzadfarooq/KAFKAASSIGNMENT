<p>-Why, may I ask, did you revert my edits?</p>
<p>Or is the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> page simply off-limits for fear of it actually containing <i>relevant</i> information?</p>
<p><br />
-So a sentence on the background of the current climate driving the Australian economy (and has been for the past few years) is not worthy of publication?</p>
<p>Nice thinking - suppose you opposed VSU aswell, eh?</p>
<p><br />
-So domestically occuring factors which fuel the economy are the only thing worth knowing about?</p>
<p>You should really delete any entry referring to trade then.</p>
<p><br />
-Since when is general consensus an opinion - or did I miss a recent edit in the wiktionary?</p>

<p>Heheh, good to see you keeping tabs of things. As for the above, all I can say is yeehah! ride em cowboy!

<p>Yeah well Lou Rae is doing his PhD at Utas, Phil Whitham's got his book, the tickets book from yonks ago has it all summed up very well, when I was much younger I read all cc singleton's arts in the arhs mag, I lived in queenie running the west coast miner and working for mt lyell many moons ago, went there with wife and kids almost 3 years ago and brought every book in sight,so it's a start, but...we'll see! <a href="../../../v/c/x/User%7EVcxlor_b6bb.html" title="User:Vcxlor">vcxlor</a> 16:06, 17 December 2005 (UTC) oh the photos for uploading - it looks like february (hmph i'm only 7 months behind)</p>

<p>Hi, I notice you have moved <a href="../../../w/o/d/Woden_Valley_%28district%29_5915.html" title="Woden Valley (district)">Woden Valley (district)</a> to <a href="../../../w/o/d/Woden_Valley_ba87.html" title="Woden Valley">Woden Valley</a>. I was just wondering your reasoning behind this, as it probably also applies to Weston Creek, North Canberra, South Canberra and Tuggeranong. All of which are used only as names of distrcts (as far as I am aware). I have also never been able to figure out why Citys, Town and Suburbs are Name, State while districts somehow avoid this naming scheme. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></small> 22:23, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Then shouldn't all the district articles also be at district name, state? Unfortunatley this isn't possible for several of Canberra's districts as they have a corresponding suburbs already at that location. Up until the move of Woden all of the districts of Canberra where at [[name (district)]]. If we are going to break this consistancy then we should at least have some kind of guideline behind it. I would support moving all non-conflicting districts to their proper (non-disambiguated) name. In cases like belconnen, <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belconnen.html" title="Belconnen">Belconnen</a> would redirect to [Belconnen, Australian Capital Territory]] (the suburb) which would have "Belconnen redirects here if you are after the Canberra district of Belconnen see <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belconnen_%28district%29.html" title="Belconnen (district)">Belconnen (district)</a>". Alternatively the redirects could go to the districts with the disambiguation located there. What do you think? --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartyman_a0b9.html" title="User:Martyman">Martyman</a>-<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMartyman_49e7.html" title="User talk:Martyman">(talk)</a></small> 00:04, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I've been meaning to tackle the issue we discussed some time ago about Parliament Categories. I think I'm ready to tackle it but thought I should check with you first. What I propose t odo is to move all teh lists to Category:Members of the Parliament of South Australia etc, This would mean moving all the lists under Category:Australian Parliaments to Category:Lists of Members of the Parliament of Australia. It would then free that category up a bit, and allow Category:Australian Parliaments to hang neatly off the various legislature and parliaments categories. Do you mind if I go ahead and do it? I won't be doing it today as I'm about to log off, but sometime over the break. -- <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> 08:11, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I see you reverted my redirect from District Attorney to Prosecutor. I reinstated it. Please note that I redirected multiple redundant phrases for Prosecutor to that article, including County Attorney and Commonwealth Attorney. They are all prosecutors, and are listed as such on that page. It's not helpful for each iteration to have its own page, if anyone is looking for any of those titles, they're looking for info on prosecutors. Thanks! <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufflaw_0eb1.html" title="User:Tufflaw">Tufflaw</a> 18:23, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>District Attorney and prosecutor are synonymous terms, they mean the same thing. It's confusing and redundant to have two different pages for them. If there's additional info at the District Attorney page that is not duplicated at the Prosecutor page, I'll make sure it's included, but there shouldn't be two separate pages. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufflaw_0eb1.html" title="User:Tufflaw">Tufflaw</a> 23:17, 18 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fair enough, however, District Attorney is not the only variant of prosecutor. In the U.S., every state has prosecutors, however in some states they are called District Attornies, in some states they are called Commonwealth's Attorneys, in some states they are called State's Attorneys, in some states they are called State Prosecutors. Do we need a separate article for each one? They all do exactly the same thing, they are all prosecutors. The functions of a District Attorney in New York are exactly the same as a Commonwealth Attorney in Massachusetts, they're just called different things. They are both Prosecutors. <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETufflaw_0eb1.html" title="User:Tufflaw">Tufflaw</a> 23:29, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Alas, with a history stretching back a mere 15 years, you could say that the standards for notable alumni at NHSPA were pretty lax. In any case, we agreed in a previous discussion to set the bar at 'has received coverage in a major news outlet', as the ones there have. Except Matthew Taylor, who is a TV personality, albeit on cable.

As I have made clear on the NHSPA talk page, the standard of "what would survive a VfD" is not appropriate in the case of 'notable alumni'. As I have made clear, I am not seeking an article on the subject of me, nor have I moved to create one. As you are aware, I am already mentioned in Wikipedia and I have "moved on" to the extent that I create and edit other articles. I would ask that you stop attacking me and my motives and, if this is an area that genuinely interests you, contribute to the discussion on the subject of criteria. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoestella_3257.html" title="User:Joestella">Joestella</a> 13:56, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Ambi(valenthysteria),</p>
<p>We really are missing your input at the OEP though I suspect you have put your energies into Wiki. Its great really. Would really appreciate you wandering through occasionally 'cause I suspect its going to go belly up. I was thinking the OEP could be really useful as a regional source of information rather than trying to cover what Wiki and the new one is going to do. Maybe I will come along and add some other Australian stuff (or maybe steal yours for OEP!!! NEVER!)</p>
<p>Nice to chat to you and wish you all the very best for 2006!</p>

<p>Ambi, please take this seriously. You do not have the right to revert half-an-hour of work which includes the web link/documentation you demanded because it includes data which challenges your strongly-held beliefs. You do not own Wikipedia. You do not own all GLBT topics. You are not any more capable or intelligent than I am, and your status as an admin does not make you somehow a better editor than I am. I will seek to have your adminship cancelled if you continue to fail to work to agreement and pursue (you would say, "stalk") my efforts on the encyclopedia. I have had no problem with some of your adjustments to my editing thus far, but here on this article you are being very arrogant. Also, refrain from use of profanity; refrain from turning encyclopedia editing into a personal matter (I'm talking about your comment on an unrelated entry, "over my dead body" which encourages a fighting-type mentality).-<a href="../../../n/a/i/User%7ENaif_1ab2.html" title="User:Naif">Naif</a> 10:05, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think I have been using the gazzetal date, which I guess is not really the same thing. The trouble is, if you use anything else, how do you define establishment? As many areas of Canberra have a history predating the modern suburbs. The gazettal date is when the suburb officially exists from, I think in early canberra this was often some time after the suburbs had been settled, and these days it can be several years before construction starts.</p>

It would be great if you can state your intent clearly, so that the community can have some basis to consider if we'll have to retitle the lists, and to restructure the categories. Thanks. (P.S.

And despite my attempt to discuss this with you, you went ahead and reverted my edit as well (this time without the rollback button, thank you). Is this your way of dealing with content disputes? I'm not going to get into an edit war with you, or with anyone else. If you feel you've won this battle by keeping Manji out of a category, more power to you.</dd>

<p>Would you kindly clarify your request for the first half of the following paragraph to be explained (it is "thoroughly confusing," you say).</p>
<ul>
<li>The Constitution is "autochthonous" (a constitutional term of art also used in Malaysia and meaning, literally, "aboriginal," indicating that legal continuity with the former metropolitan power was severed and the Constitution enacted by the parliament of the newly independent state rather than by an imperial parliament as in the case of the Constitutions of Canada and Australia). It is "entrenched," meaning that its provisions overbear any ordinary statutory enactments which the courts find to be inconsistent with it, in accordance with the constitutional authority of Marbury v. Madison. It declares the "underlying law" -- that is, the separate common law of Papua New Guinea -- to consist of the Constitution, "customary law" derived from the "custom" of the various peoples of Papua New Guinea, and the common law of England as it stood at the date of Papua New Guinea's independence on 16 September 1975.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Constitutions of Australia and Canada are enactments of the Imperial Parliament at Westminster. The Constitution of PNG was enacted by the PNG House of Assembly acting as a constitutional convention without involvement by the metropolitan power in Canberra. In practical terms there is little significance but both Malaysia and Papua New Guinea make a great deal of this aspect of their acquisition of sovereignty.</p>
<p>An entrenched constitution overbears any conflicting ordinary statute. Thus the constitutions of the USA, Canada and Australia are the subject of a great deal of judicial deliberation with respect to the question of whether a particular act of parliament (or a regional legislature) is consistent with them. There is no magic in this principle; until the US Supreme Court ruled in Marbury v Madison that the effect of statutory conflict with a constitutional provision was to render the conflicting provision of of the statute null, and thus Marbury v Madison is part of the constitutional jurisprudence of those common law jurisdictions which have entrenched constitutions. I note that you are a law student; I too attended law school in Australia and this was lesson 1 of the constitutional law course. I hope this is clearer now; I can't really see how it could be more accurately stated in the article itself though.<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasalai_b16e.html" title="User:Masalai">Masalai</a> 12:23, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I filed an appeal for my AC case just now. In so doing I cited you, as you can note. I hope that's okay; I certainly don't want to drag you or anyone else "down with me" (and have tried to avoid doing so). But I by no means implied that you endorse all my actions here or anything like that, so I hope I'm not out of line. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeryVerily_bb8a.html" title="User:VeryVerily">VeryVerily</a> 21:57, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Further to your response on my user talk page, I don't take you for a fool. Regarding the loss of Bass and Braddon, here is a poll that predicted this prior to Latham's forest policy announcement <a href="http://www.examiner.com.au/story.asp?id=250918" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.examiner.com.au/story.asp?id=250918" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, so I don't think your claim that all polls showed Labor winning Bass &amp; Braddon prior to their forest policy launch is accurate. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Campbell_f443.html" title="User:Peter Campbell">Peter Campbell</a> 10:57, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi. I have been in email contact with three of these people. Basically they are all friends who attended <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_College_London_3428.html" title="University College London">UCL</a>. In late October a <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">User:Antidote</a> started to try and force the deletion of Jewish lists by voting up to six times on one afd, see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Antidote_e661.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote">Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Antidote</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Antidote_Contribution_table_cb45.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote/Contribution table">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote/Contribution table</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Antidote_User_comments_d0fe.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote/User comments">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote/User comments</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Antidote_Voting_fad8.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote/Voting">Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Antidote/Voting</a>. The multiple voting was first spotted by <a href="../../../r/a/c/User%7ERachelBrown_1109.html" title="User:RachelBrown">User:RachelBrown</a> on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Jewish_Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society_44db.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Jewish Fellows of the Royal Society">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Jewish Fellows of the Royal Society</a>. In mid November the user again nominated that list as well as other lists, with many users suspecting that many votes were being cast by one user. I and RachelBrown did ask other users to vote on these vfds (I have seen many users asking others to vote on vfds, including admins). The vfding of the lists brought them to the attention of some users, mainly Lulu of the Lotus eaters who became involved at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Jewish_jurists_20dd.html" title="Talk:List of Jewish jurists">Talk:List_of_Jewish_jurists</a> where he repeatedly criticised the use of the Jewish Year Book as a source which was later confirmed to be a perfectly respectable source by User:Jayjg. Rachel became pretty upset as to what she felt was an attack, her friend Poetlister then offered to help to try and solve the dispute. Lulu then began following some of the edits of Rachel, adding cleanup or unverified tags, and more Jewish lists were again nominated with clear sock puppet voting of the one user above which contributed to the stress Rachel had began suffering which caused her to almost have a breakdown. Her cousin LondonEye, Poetlister and another friend Newport offered to work on articles Rachel had drafted and add them to Wikipedia. I am absolutely certain these users are not deserving of a ban and really this has all come about due to confusion and unfortunate circumstances. I would be really grateful if you could help sort this mess out. Thanks Arniep 00:54, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Apart from the question of the status of Transnitria the other key issue is the removal of the Russian forces from Transnistria. The agreement to withdraw all Russian forces was initially signed in 1994, and while there are less than 2,500 troops remaining, there is an immense stockpile of ammunition and equipment. While Russia has destroyed several tons of ammunition and has fundamentally changed since 1995. These forces are a tangible sign of Moldova's conditional sovereignity. Moldova's dependency on Russian energy as well as the Russian market has limited the country's ability to press for a conclusive agreement to resolve the status of these forces. A significant development came at the <a href="../../../o/s/c/OSCE_64d2.html" title="OSCE">OSCE</a> Istanbul summit in November 1999 when Russia agreed to a declaration to remove all forces from Moldova by the end of 2002, without any conditions and without any linkage to resolving Transnitria's status. With the coming to power of Putin in January 2000, however, the Russian Foreign Ministry backtracked from this commitment and made public the military withdrawal would have to coincide with a political agreement on the status of Transnitria by 2002. The Moldovan Foreign Ministry was quick to point out that the Istanbul declaration made no mention of synchronization. Moreover, the Moldovan Foreign Ministry noted that the Istanbul declaration was a binding commintment within the OSCE framework.</p>

<dd>Ambi, please I am absolutely begging you to reread what I wrote above and to look at the rfc on Antidote which is how this all started, it is just incredible that that user himself has not been banned (at least his sock puppets). I know for certain these people are different, they are close friends who all attended the same university in London who had entirely different interests for months until the problem with the Jewish lists in November. The user who was nominating the Jewish lists voted up to 6 times in one afd, which led me and Rachel to ask her friends and others (I also asked Lulu of the Lotus eaters and Vulturell from memory) to vote on these afds. I don't think that this is against the rules as they didn't just sign up to vote, I see plenty of people asking each other to vote all the time. Arniep 02:28, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just noticed You posted in My future RFA page, and I think You're right about Me going overboard about being fascinated with sysop promotions. I was starting to become unsure as to whether on not You're even supposed to <i>express</i> Your wish to become one. I'll tell You what: I'll try My best to shift My attention to other things for now. Before I attempt a nomination, I plan to ask whether or not I'm ready. I did put a to-do list on My own user page, and I do have other things to do in 2006. I just don't want people to think I want to be promoted "for the sake of it".<br />

<p>I notice there are different users adding and deleting parody websites to different articles. Why are they OK on some articles and not others. Confused. Even more so after Longhair's intervention on the Paula Rizzuto article, as you seem to be in frequent correspondence with him could you please resolve the matter and get back to me. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephenBengHo_1ec8.html" title="User:StephenBengHo">StephenBengHo</a> 12:06, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the support. I appreciate it more than I can say. Regarding a featured article, it's interesting you'd mention that! I put <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disneyland_Railroad_2d75.html" title="Disneyland Railroad">Disneyland Railroad</a> up for peer review after busting my hump on expanding the text. Only concern was a lack of recent photos. I uploaded a few that I took back in October to the Commons. I was going to add more, but I've mislaid the camera! A few have been added by other users and I'll add the ones from Commons and try again. Sneak a peek when you have a moment.&#160;:) - Lucky 6.9 17:58, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not much to add about the individual stations since all were there pretty much from the get-go. The biggest changes over the years have been the conversion of Frontierland Station to New Orleans Square Station in 1967 and Fantasyland Station to Toontown Depot in about 1993. New Orleans Square got a slight realignment when The Haunted Mansion came in 1969 and the siding in front of Main Street Station has been disconnected since about 1958. Fun facts for a 5/8-scale railroad that runs in a trapezoidal circle around a theme park. &#160;:) Seriously, the trains aren't too fast, but they sure are fun. The stretch along the Rivers of America is truly and genuinely one of Southern California's must-see sights. I'll see what I can dig up. BTW, your article looks flat wonderful at first glance!

<p>Why did you revert my edits to this article without explanation? I explained why I wrote what I wrote in my edit summary and on the talk page. You just put "Revert per 172" in the edit summary and offered no explanation on the article's (or my) talk page.</p>

<p>Hi DrKinsey, there is a straw poll going on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:User_prerogatives#Straw_Poll_to_Archive_the_page_Wikipedia_talk:User_Bill_of_Rights_with_the_rejected_and_inactive_tag" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:User_prerogatives#Straw_Poll_to_Archive_the_page_Wikipedia_talk:User_Bill_of_Rights_with_the_rejected_and_inactive_tag" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Please express your concerns there. For now, though, considering the opposition already expressed, the chances of establishing consensus for "the bill of rights" seem quite slim. I suggest that you try to change things as you see fit by speaking out in the straw poll rather than just reverting the redirect of the "bill of rights" page to the less controversial name "user prerogatives."

<dd>There is no need to tapdance around the question, as no one has accused you of doing anything wrong. Kelly blocked a user for saying that you banned SPUI from an IRC channel, so people want to know if the statement was true or not. I assume from your tortured legal posturing that the statement was essentially true. I certainly don't blame you for banning him. I do however take issue with Kelly blocking a user for stating that you did, as it smacks of intimidation (and an abuse of adminstrative powers). <a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKaldari_58ca.html" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> 00:14, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think you would do well to assume good faith on my part. Yes, I think Kelly Martin has provided a clear example of someone who should not have access to power. Yes, I feel substantive criticisms of her should be aired. But I do not want to harm anyone, in any way.

<dd>I know you have strong opinions here, but criticism has been aired - repeatedly. At last count, there was more than fifty pages of criticism and counter-criticism, and I really feel that there's nothing more to be gained from continuing that except further bad blood, leading inevitably to repercussions for both sides. If the issue continues to be approached from the stance of "apologise for your sins or we will smite you", it'll just lead to further hostility, but if we can actually sit down and try to work out an amicable solution, as Philwelch and I tried to do last night, then something useful (or at least some peace) might just come out of this. There has been enough bomb-throwing; now is the time for actually trying to resolve this mess in a manner that is amicable to as many people as possible. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 08:49, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I understand where you are coming from. I don't agree that you and Philwelch alone can work out a solution and impose it on others without their agreement, any more than he can delete my discussion regarding it and claim to be part of an honest dialogue. I do however think that you discussing things politely w someone who disagrees w you is a positive step. My impression of your position is that you feel this incident is not a big deal, and should blow over. My position is that it should be made widely known, so that Kelly will be resoundingly removed from office in the upcoming elections. As different as these 2 positions are, there is room for compromise. If Kelly makes it clear that she regrets her actions and will strive not to repeat them, I would also support the RfC being ended. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam Spade</a> 09:09, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your response - I think taking it here was a good idea. Above all, I hope you understand that Philwelch and I weren't trying to dictate a solution onto everyone else yesterday. Rather, I think it's fairly clear that nothing much could come out of the old RfC, except more anger and bitterness from both sides, and it was a good-faith effort to try and redirect that energy into a form where something good might come out of it.</p>
<p>I think you summarised my position fairly accurately. I don't think there was any inherent harm done in deleting those userboxes. I think it was reasonable to be bold <i>in the first place</i> - just as it was reasonable that, when people disagreed, the boxes were re-created. With this in mind, I'm struggling to see any lasting damage done here, though I could have missed something.</p>
<p>While I understand that you're not fond of Kelly and want her voted off the arbitration committee, I don't think this is the way to go about it. For starters, I think the backlash against Kelly is doing far more harm to the community than her actions ever did, and I think the longer it goes on, the more bad feeling that is created, and the greater the likelihood of there being acrimony and retaliation down the track against not only Kelly, but a myriad of others involved, including you. You've made your point, and I think now would be a good time to start working towards some resolution that's amicable to all parties involved, rather than furthering this in the name of personal revenge. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 09:29, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Let me be clear: I don't care about userboxes (at all), and I have no desire for revenge on Kelly Martin (for what I don't know, she hasn't done anything to me that I am aware of). I also have nothing against her as a human being (non-wikipedian).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What I do have are concerns, comments, and possibly a great deal of evidence (if I can be arsed to spend an hour or 2 hunting up links) regarding her suitability for positions of power on the wikipedia. The concerns which relate directly to the RfC are: out of process deletions, an unwaranted block, and numerous violations of civility / conduct unbecoming her position. I frankly feel she has handled herself very badly indeed, and that a great deal of fuss regarding that is in order.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am, however, nothing if not <a href="../../../r/i/g/Rigour.html" title="Rigour">rigourous</a>, and will personaly favor the closing of her RfC if she makes suitable comments of contrition. Outside of that, I see no imminent danger to the wikipedia, or indeed anyone (myself included) from people complaining about her conduct. On the contrary, I see the groundswell against her as the most hopeful sign I have seen on the wiki in ages, immediately correlated in my mind with the size of the donation meter. People care about what is going on here, and are putting their $0.02 (or $20, and the case may be), in. All hail populism!
