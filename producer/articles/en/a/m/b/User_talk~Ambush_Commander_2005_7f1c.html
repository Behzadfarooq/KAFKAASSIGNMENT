<p>Howdy. I'm glad you reverted that change on the main VFD page, but I think you blamed the wrong user for it.

<p>Hi, first I want to thank you for your comments on my talk page. About deleting or moving the proposal — right now the proposal is formatted to appear at the Wikipedia think-tank. I think this is where it belongs. Some proposals there date to 2003, so there is no time limit. If you think there is a better way to publicise the announcement I have no objection. But I think the proposal and the accompanying discussions should still be together and linked to the Think Tank.</p>
<p>As to why I mentioned so many names. My main reason was that I wanted to make clear that I was not creating hypothetical straw-men arguments just to criticize them; that I was responding to real arguments actually made by Wikipedians.</p>
<p>As to the passage you call attention to — well, I was responding to real objections. You raise a different objection which I also address in another section (on popularity as an argument for NPOV). Of course, you may still disagree with my argument.</p>
<p>I understand why you think it might have been better to have mentioned no names. If the explanation I gave above (to show that my arguments against a position are against positions that people have actually taken) does not satisfy you, let me explain that when the topic first came up on the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Talk%7EJesus_56ae.html" title="Talk:Jesus">Talk: Jesus</a> Page (I didn't start it; JimWay changed dates to BCE/CE, someone reverted, I reverted back to Jim's changes and gave an explanation; all this is now archived) it quickly turned into a very viturpritive argument. If you think that the acrimoneous arguments and personal attacks against me are a result of how I wrote the proposal, I assure you that you are wrong; the people who have written long and at times nasty comments are people who first expressed their hostility to the <i>idea</i> of BCE/CE and me personally on the Jesus talk page. I have no doubt that no matter how I wrote the proposal, they would have responded in exactly the same way.</p>
<p>I know you are making a second point, that perhaps how I wrote turned off otherwise neutral people. If that is so all I can do is regret it. I honestly think nothing I could do now would make a difference as some people have already decided I am a stupid troll.</p>
<p><b>However</b>, if you pesonally believe this is a discussion we ought to be having, well, I urge you to come up with your own proposal, you own wording, and your own arguments. I think that if there is to be an honest discussion about NPOV and dating, someone else has to try at this point, and will hopefully be more effective. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 14:42, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hiya, Ambush Commander, I noticed you use the godmode-light script. As you use an emulation of the rollback feature I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on a proposal I have which would grant the rollback feature to those who request it, similar to <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_385d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship">Wikipedia:Requests for adminship</a>, except with a lower threshold. The proposal is at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_rollback_e66f.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for rollback">Wikipedia:Requests for rollback</a>; your comments are welcomed at <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_rollback_f07e.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for rollback">Wikipedia talk:Requests for rollback</a>.

<p>Thanks for the edits. The article is slowly improving, but still needs a lot of work before it reaches that standard necessary for such a big topic. It was in a pretty bad state because of a lot of partisan bickering based on the Conservative/Liberal divide in the US. Hopefully when i've got time i'll try and work the global prespective a little.

<p>Dear AC,</p>
<p>Though I respect your desire to improve the Time Cube article, I feel like you are stirring up trouble by asking for the discussion to continue. I realize that the previous discussions are scattered, and it is hard to read them all, but I must assure you that all of these points have been discussed before. The discussion broke down when the anonymous user we refer to as Time Cube Guy refused to make any logical arguments without refering to Time Cube. If we restart the discussion, I can promise you that it will continue down the same chaotic path it has been going for almost two years.</p>
<p>In answer to the questions you posed on Time Cube's talk page, I first want to cite the following passage from the <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it doesn't belong in Wikipedia (except perhaps in some ancillary article) regardless of whether it's true or not; and regardless of whether you can prove it or not (see Wikipedia:Flat earth problem).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Time Cube isn't well known because it's a theory. Time Cube is well known because people like to make fun of Gene Ray. I refer you to the lecture Gene gave at MIT, where he was ridiculed by students for more than an hour. So are we really supposed to believe that <i>anyone</i> else actually believes the gibberish on his site? Of course not; the people who are trying to interpret it on Wikipedia are trolls, trying to make us look stupid. The more we debate this, the more enjoyment they get from watching us trying argue about a bogus theory. The fact of the matter is this: all evidence points to the fact that only <i>one</i> person in the world actually understands what Gene Ray is talking about, and that is Gene himself. That means that his theory deserves no place on this site, and NPOV does not apply. Further, Time Cube Guy's edits have mostly been to change the wording slightly in the article with a ridiculous interpretation of NPOV. For example, he keeps trying to change "most people think it's a crock of bull" to "there are those who disagree with it."</p>
<p>Restart the discussion if it makes you feel better, but I warn you that a year and a half of futile bickering, a RfC, and a RfAr, probably imply that the discussion won't go anywhere. —<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Kelly_ce0f.html" title="User:Sean Kelly">Sean κ.</a> <span style="cursor:help;"><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Kelly_1d9a.html" title="User talk:Sean Kelly">+</a></span> 17:53, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aloha.

<dd>I agree with your assessment. The only consensus on a common name that I could find is <i>Hawaiian caterpillar</i>. Otherwise it's referred to as <i>Meat-eating caterpillar</i>, <i>Snail-eating caterpillar</i>, and <i>Snail-capturing caterpillar</i>. I'm leaning towards <i>Hawaiian caterpillar</i> and listing the species on that page.

<p>Hello. Round four of Wikipedia Mind Benders will open on Thursday, <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_1.html" title="December 1">December 1</a>. This round will be drastically different from round three; part one will consist of a creative project, and part two will be developed from there. The full details will be released when the round opens. Time and speed should not be major factors in this round; thus, there is no exact opening time for the round as speed will not factor into the scoring.

<dd>It seems to me that something along the lines of "some page loads may fail" would be useful.

<li>Ambush Commander, let me know if I can answer any questions for you. I can say that I haven't deleted any legitimate votes. The vote that was deleted in the link above appeared to be the second vote from the same anonymous user, which I deleted when restoring my links to that user's vandalism of my user and talk pages. Again, let me know if I can help. | Klaw <small>¡digame!</small> 22:21, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>thanks so much for your objectivity. i fully appreciate your constructive commentary on the GH AfD. you seem to be the only voice of reason in a hotly contested debate. the interesting points that the GH article has brought up alone should be criteria enough to warrant it being listed on here... hahaha! all of the other AfDs i peeked at in the past seemed to die without a whimper, with the exception of the infamous chase one. and now this!</p>
<p>however, i am rather puzzled by the derogatory labeling as a "meat/socketpuppet", which i assure you i am not. i have been using wikipedia since its inception and this was the 1st time that i found something of interest on here that i felt impassioned enough about to break my vow of privacy and comment on. i am not a colleague of GH. i am my own seperate entity and would like to be respected as such. why is it that all the new users are being designated as puppets? not everyone has the hang of how to navigate on here. it's easy enough to search for data but not so easy to figure out how to edit properly. must a novice editor be slandered as being a puppet for being wiki-inept? i am confused about this. any comments you have will be greatly appreciated. again, thank you for your objectivity and for your time. <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInspectorpanther_cc78.html" title="User:Inspectorpanther">Inspectorpanther</a> 21:27, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regarding your comment, " That reason is notability. Back up your claims that GH is a "creatively influential design organization" with fact."</p>
<p>GH is currently in the process of creating artwork that will be displayed wrapping around the entire facade of the MTV building in Times Sq, which spans the whole city block. This will remain up for an entire year. How can these types of influential projects be added to the article without sounding like advertisement?</p>
<p>Your comments and suggestions towards this debate have been very helpful.

<p>That was great feedback - I really appreciate the time you put into it. It's been interesting - I must have started 20-30 AfDs by now, maybe 50, but this was the first where my pages were vandalized or where I ran into meatpuppets.<br />
<br />
If I called someone a sockpuppet, that was my error. They were clearly meatpuppets, and I think the distinction is critical. A meatpuppet might stick around to contribute more. A sockpuppet, well, won't.<br />
<br />
Also, my deletion of the vfd text was actually a rookie mistake on my part. I didn't recognize it as a template because it was copied as text rather than inserted as a template. When Lerner correctly re-inserted it as {{<a href="../../../v/f/d/Template%7EVfd_41cd.html" title="Template:Vfd">vfd</a>}}, I knew I'd screwed up. But he did the right thing in putting it back in.<br />
<br />
Again, I appreciate the time &amp; thought. I've said all along that I don't care if the result is delete or keep. I felt my responsibility was to make sure the process wasn't subverted and that the closing admin has all the information required to make a good decision. Yes, I do still think that Inspectorpanther and Lerner are either the same person or are working in concert, but that is strictly my opinion, and because I can't prove it, I have to ignore it. It's a learning process and the more experienced users like you who have stopped by have been a big help. | Klaw <small>¡digame!</small> 04:47, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Relating to the prior discussion - I've stored some comments in my wikispace that I posted to Lerner's and Inspectorpanther's talk pages, which both users deleted. (Another similarity between them.) You can see them here: <a href="../../../k/e/i/User_talk%7EKeithlaw_Inspectorpanther_da77.html" title="User talk:Keithlaw/Inspectorpanther">User_talk:Keithlaw/Inspectorpanther</a>.

<p>hello there! if you don't mind, i just wanted to ask you for some advice again. i recently added a quote from an art magazine that i found from the net onto the GH page and i was wondering if i did it correctly and also if it is acceptable. i would really appreciate it if you would give me some feedback about it when you have the time.</p>
<p>also, i found a "paper magazine" (may 2002) cover that has GH as a cover story. am i allowed to put image up that as a proof of notability? i believe that paper magazine is a highly reputable and widely recognized publication. what do you think?</p>
<p>i must say that i have to laugh a bit at klaw's contstant accusations that lerner and i are the same person. it's utterly and highly delusional. i think that when i accidentally deleted his page as i was trying to leave him a message at the commencement of the AfD, it caused him to go a little bit crazy. he already had me suspended and i've paid my penance but it doesn't seem to be enough for him. it's almost as if he's out to destroy whatever i do on here. i think he's stalking me on here and following my every move. every time i try to make a contribution to a different article, he immediately deletes it. i tried to give him 2 polite warnings but he won't stop. please help. what should i do? it's starting to get downright creepy. the funniest part is that he keeps on referring to me as a guy and i am actually a girl! hahaha! how silly is that? <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInspectorpanther_cc78.html" title="User:Inspectorpanther">Inspectorpanther</a> 19:36, 18 December 2005 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInspectorpanther_cc78.html" title="User:Inspectorpanther">Inspectorpanther</a> (<a href="../../../i/n/s/User_talk%7EInspectorpanther_9df0.html" title="User talk:Inspectorpanther">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Inspectorpanther_75f6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Inspectorpanther">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>The problem with Oregon State is that it is a minor third-tier university. Even the few first-tier universities listed, like the University of Washington and the University of Tulsa, are not major centers for art (that is, they are listed as first-tier universities by U.S. News magazine for the quality of their other programs).</p>
<p>What I find interesting is that GHava has not been picked up or endorsed by any of the top first-tier universities with renowned avant-garde art departments and museums, like Columbia, Yale, Berkeley, or Harvard, as well as independent schools like the New School or Juilliard. I also note that none of the major newspapers or magazines appears to have paid any attention to this group at all. --<a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcaesar_34f0.html" title="User:Coolcaesar">Coolcaesar</a> 19:47, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
