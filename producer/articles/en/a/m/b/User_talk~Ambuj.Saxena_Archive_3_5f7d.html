<h2><span class="mw-headline">SAC</span></h2>
<p>Ambuj, this india SAC list needs attention. I mean articles should be moved to SA. However, due to less voting, its difficult to decide if we ourselves should do the work. For example, Chola Dynasty would be FA very soon. It's bad if we do not promote it to India SA soon.</p>
<p>Some articles like <a href="../../../k/2E/_/K._M._Nanavati_vs._State_of_Maharashtra_5dab.html" title="K. M. Nanavati vs. State of Maharashtra">K. M. Nanavati vs. State of Maharashtra</a>, <a href="../../../k/2E/_/K._R._Narayanan_6d23.html" title="K. R. Narayanan">K. R. Narayanan</a> - no one should object in case those are promoted to SA list. What do you think? I think we can contact an Indian admin. May be Saravask, the newest one!

<dd>I hope Chola Dynasty will get a long list of Support...It looks great. Like the Kolkata FAC. In fact, hereafter we should work in such a way that all India FACs find only supports! May be difficult though!! What's plans in IIT? Is your exams over?

<dd>Well, yes you are right. More Indian s should be there in FAC procedures. I think aboute 15 people are already almost regular. If that count goes to 30, it will be nice. After you are done with IIT, have a look of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darjeeling.html" title="Darjeeling">Darjeeling</a> also. I am becoming busy with studies. Will be free after June 10. Will push the article then. Patel should be up for FAC as well soon. So is Ahmedabad (may be a few days later). So its going to be a hot summer.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">coin</span></h2>
<p>Yeah, though it says that the script is Devnagari, the script on <a href="../../../u/t/t/Image%7EUttama_coin.png_6f26.html" title="Image:Uttama coin.png">the coin</a> has uncanny similarity with Bengali script. May be because it was from Sri lanka. There is some dispute, but often it is sain "Sinhala" came from "Vijaysingha", an Indian prince who arrived at the present Sri Lanka. I have read in "History of Bengali literature" (in our school texts) that this Vijaysingha was from Bengal-Orisa region. In fact, there is a famous line of a poem (I forgot the writer) <i>Banglar chele bijaysingho helay Lanka korilo joy</i>, meaning, Vijaysingha, son of Bengal, won Lanka easily.</p>
<p>This line is not used to portray the history though. It is rather used in an ironical sense. The usual sayings of the Bengalis - that we were famous in past, that we did so and so - this line is satirically used to refer to this attitude. However, even this idiom is gradually disappearing from usage.</p>
<p>Anyway, the coin is really intersting. Its eerie. LoL. Regards.--<a href="../../../d/w/a/User%7EDwaipayanc_db12.html" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayan</a> (<a href="../../../d/w/a/User_talk%7EDwaipayanc_1f27.html" title="User talk:Dwaipayanc">talk</a>) 06:00, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes its ok to link cats. The italicized links are to festivals and programs at IITs, plus the book. These are better distinguished this way. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">Rama's Arrow</a> 06:40, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Btw - I believe there is a problem with many of the forks you or someone else has created. Except for the book "The IITians," the articles of history and reservation policy should contain the full name "Indian Institutes of Technology," because there is the page for <a href="../../../i/i/t/IIT_1ce3.html" title="IIT">IIT</a> is a disambig, and "History of IITs" could correctly apply for any of the disambig links. Please correct this, although I doubt the FAC will be affected. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">Rama's Arrow</a> 06:45, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't believe there's a need to remove schools of management, becoz they are a part of those family IITs, not independent institutions. Please create the Culture central article prior to FAC.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">IITs</span></h2>
<p>I won't be having the time to review this weekend unfortunately. It's close, but not up to FA standards as yet. I still have a lot of issues with the article including page size, lack of printed references prose etc. Basic question that needs to be addressed: Why is the government reluctant to increase the number of IITs? Dates like these: "1 October" needs to be wikified. I would like to see the following before I review:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pie graph (colourful) of the breakup of reservations</li>
<li>Pic of a classroom if possible?</li>
<li>Graph on rankings?</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dd>1. About the dates: Bobblewik unwikified the year, not the date. Wikifying a date (Month-Date) is necessary as it displays the dates according to a user's preference: "1 October" or "October 1". You can change this setting in your preferences section. 2. The debate over the increase of IITs would make an interesting read. 3. Pie chart would be the visual representation of data: For example see <a href="../../../f/e/a/Image%7EFeatured_article_star.png_1e70.html" class="image" title="Featured article"><img src="../../../upload/thumb/8/8c/Featured_article_star.png/16px-Featured_article_star.png" alt="Featured article" width="16" height="17" longdesc="../../../f/e/a/Image%7EFeatured_article_star.png_1e70.html" /></a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brihanmumbai_Electric_Supply_and_Transport_b905.html" title="Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport">Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport</a>. 4. I'll think about graph and let u know. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENichalp_b881.html" title="User:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">=Nichalp</font></a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENichalp_e311.html" title="User talk:Nichalp"><font color="#0082B8">«Talk»=</font></a> 10:45, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The pie chart on reservations is not correct; there is 22.5% reservations and actually about 10-12% is filled. the remaining is not filled by general candidates but is left vacant. so, your 'actual' pie chart should show sc, st and vacant (to make up to 22.5%). <a href="../../../i/i/t/User%7EIitmsriram_b14f.html" title="User:Iitmsriram">Iitmsriram</a> 07:50, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Ambuj - thanks for the thumbs-up. I appreciate it.</p>
<p>I think there's one issue in the formatting of the notes - see <a href="../../../k/o/l/Kolkata.html" title="Kolkata">Kolkata</a>, where the authors for the respective articles cited are noted before the weblink. I think this should be done here. Also, if you don't mind, I'm gonna move the reservation policy section into the admissions sections - subject is connected - and the student life section above the criticisms. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">Rama's Arrow</a> 18:42, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I hope the re-formatting meets with your approval.

<dd>I moved the map out becoz that section was over-crowded and poorly formatted owing to the pics. Yeah the IIT culture fork is a good one and important. You are feeling a little off prolly becoz this is your first FA - this type of work is difficult to do when you have an active, main-priority life and if there are wikibreaks, etc. After the inevitabilities of the first FAC, the next experience is better owing to planning, organization and having a sense of what is necessary.</dd>

<p>Hi Ambujbhai - I'm very sorry to have disappointed your expectation in me, but it had become impossible for me to compromise my principles. I don't covet adminship at all, so it wasn't a difficult decision. However, I cannot tell you how greatly joyous I feel at the enthusiastic, wonderful support you expressed for me. I don't know how hard it will be to understand that your supports means extremely a lot to me. I thank you from my heart, and please let me know if I can ever be assistance or help in anything.</p>
<p>Yes the IIT references are perfect. I hope the "Alumni" section is circumspect as per the info you possess. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">Rama's Arrow</a> 19:50, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Ambujbhai - Your doubts are legitimate, but I give the example of articles like <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabindranath_Tagore_9e00.html" title="Rabindranath Tagore">Rabindranath Tagore</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahatma_Gandhi_e9af.html" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugo_Chavez_1fdf.html" title="Hugo Chavez">Hugo Chavez</a>. These articles are inherently above 60kb. If the article is comprehensive, that is more important than size. So I don't think that you should worry about size. If you can reduce by slashing long-winded sentences and "unnecessary information," do it. But it doesn't doom an FAC if the article's size is above 50kb. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">Rama's Arrow</a> 04:33, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><a name="Fair_use" id="Fair_use"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fair use</span></h2>
<p>Fair use is a <i>very</i> complicated issue on WP. Most of it is caused my people who do not understand what is fair use. I have very tough time explaining users what it is and what is required. I myself took about half a year to realize some of the complexities of fair use. For a fact, I still don't know much about it. Also, fair use images are very convenient; the temptation to use them is extremely high. Most of the time no free alternative could be obtained. Also, WP does not have a short &amp; sweet &amp; easy to read tutorial/intoroduction about fair use and other copyright issues.</p>
<p>I remember reading somewhere a post that fair use should not have "download a high resolution version." And I agree. If I spot something like this, I would donwload it, use some picture program, scale it down and re-upload under the same name.</p>
<p>The magnitude is humongously giantnormous&#160;:) I spent a couple of days looking through some pics on WP... and I almost want to cry. Fair use logos are spammed everyhere, fair use screenshots are claimed public domain, magazine covers illustrate magazine models, etc etc etc. I haven't seen this week a fair use pic with a rationale. A gazillion of pictures don't have sources, descriptions, or have wrong copyright info. I would not be too surprised if after a very careful cleaning up, WP would be left with 15-20% of all the pics it has now.</p>
<p>What do I suggest? I was asking myself this question... The magnitude is simply... overwhelming. I think the biggest problem is education of users. They are very quick to shout "Copyright paranoia!" You could be spending years on removing fair use pics and they will still add them back (either because they don't believe WP should be so strict on fair use or because of simple ignorance). So I have a ton of half-baked ideas... For example, sweet &amp; short tutorial/intorduction or exam/test/quiz.</p>
<p>But I don't think that is really what you are asking (<small>I feel I need to vent a little, sorry&#160;:)</small>). <a href="../../../r/e/n/User%7ERenata3_94d8.html" title="User:Renata3">Renata</a> 10:21, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The black box is a ghostly box. I can't figure out how it appeared here. Strange, the file should be easily editable. Have you tried CTRL+CLICK?

<dd>Thanks for the fixes. Some tips:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>If creating any new text make sure that you select the text and click on Text&gt;Unflow in the file menu. If the unflow is not done, the text won't be rendered by mediawiki.</li>
<li>Always use generic fonts such as Sans, Serif, Fantasy and Cursive. Sans is ideal for diagrams.</li>
<li>If tracing a document from a bitmap, ensure that the bitmap is stored on a new layer and locked. After completion, delete the layer which contains the bitmap.</li>
<li>Add metadata to the document in File&gt;Document Preferences</li>
</ul>

<dd>Ambuj, if you're not getting any particular points to fix up, you might as well go for FAC - any poignant criticism will only come from there now. Also, you should ask for help from non-Indian editors (since Indian experts seem to be mostly on break) like Taxman, Ragib, etc. I say you should go for FAC, and fix the problems cited.

<dd>An important thought: I wonder if there should be a section on what/how things are taught at IIT - like what technology (computers, etc.) is used, what progressive teaching philosophy/methods are employed, what about internship, research projects. What is the balance between theory and practicals? How much coaching, mentorship is available. What subjects apart from science/math/engineering are emphasized as careers? Does IIT provide students with laptops? Sorta like the education culture which actually makes IITs great places.

We need your input on how to rectify this problem. <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow">Rama's Arrow</a> 18:36, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks. The article looks much better now than the last time I saw it (a few months back?) - looks like you have put in a lot of effort. Cheers. -<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECribananda_a8b4.html" title="User:Cribananda">Cribananda</a> 18:51, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Indian english</span></h2>
<p>Indian English is modelled on British English. Just to brief you on what is considered correct for IE spellings:</p>
<ul>
<li>-our vs -or (colour/color)&#160;: Use -our</li>
<li>-lled vs -led (labelled/labeled)&#160;: use -lled</li>
<li>(-ise vs -ize) (italicise/italicize)&#160;: both are acceptable. The -ise is commonly used in BE, --ize is used in academic publications, and by AmE almost exclusively. --Nichalp 08:38, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Glad to help out. As for Tony, I was actually talking about <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony1_9951.html" title="User:Tony1">User:Tony1</a>—he's a professional writer, and a really good editor. It's extremely rare for him to support an FAC nomination right away, because he always finds lots of minor problems (heh, and you thought I was bad =). However, he's usually pretty busy, so he might not get a chance to take a look at this one. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpangineer_57d1.html" title="User:Spangineer">Spangineer</a><sup><a href="../../../../es/s/p/a/Usuario%7ESpangineer_0822.html" class="extiw" title="es:Usuario:Spangineer">[es]</a></sup>&#160;<small><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html" title="User talk:Spangineer"><font color="brown">(háblame)</font></a></small> 12:38, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yup! Tony is the best.
