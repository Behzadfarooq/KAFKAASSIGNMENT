<p>thanks for supporting my nomination of the Kylie article, which has been contested, and well that's the end of that. But that's ok.

<p>Hi. You just listed two pages on VfD although both (imho) were candidates for 'speedy' deletion. Where there is no edit history and an article is clearly inappropriate (such as in this case where basically advertising) then they aren't likely to need much - if any - discussion, and cen be deleted by any admin who agrees with you. Instead of adding {{subst:Vfd}} you just add {{delete}} instead. --<a href="../../../v/a/m/User%7EVampWillow_af3c.html" title="User:VampWillow">VampWillow</a> 10:55, 7 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Ambivalenthysteria</p>
<p>thanks for supporting my nomination of the Kylie article, which has been contested, and well that's the end of that. But that's ok.

<p>Hi. You just listed two pages on VfD although both (imho) were candidates for 'speedy' deletion. Where there is no edit history and an article is clearly inappropriate (such as in this case where basically advertising) then they aren't likely to need much - if any - discussion, and cen be deleted by any admin who agrees with you. Instead of adding {{subst:Vfd}} you just add {{delete}} instead. --<a href="../../../v/a/m/User%7EVampWillow_af3c.html" title="User:VampWillow">VampWillow</a> 10:55, 7 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, I’ve reverted because of the links, they keep putting "The Pavelic Papers" and jasenovac.org, both of whom are Serb run projects that are posturing of being “objective”, under "Outside views", while at the same time putting Croatia - Myth and Reality By C. Michael McAdams, a respected American professor, under "Croat view" just because the text doesn’t suite them. Any attempt at reasoning with them has so far been futile, and most of the time they just ignore any common sense.--<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneralPatton_882e.html" title="User:GeneralPatton">GeneralPatton</a> 00:20, 16 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>They even admitted adding the links they know are grossly inaccurate. I did not take them out, I just put most of them under Serb view, for fairness and for providing multiple views. if I played like they do, I’d probably would have removed them. Avala is the biggest problem maker of the bunch, although he’s not the most extreme in his views.--<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeneralPatton_882e.html" title="User:GeneralPatton">GeneralPatton</a> 00:26, 16 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, Ambivalent, me again. When protecting a page against vandalism, isn't it appropriate to protect a non-vandalized version of the page?

<li>I believe that the arbitrators have succeeded in creating a process that each of them finds unpleasant. Therefore, they don't follow arb matters closely because it isn't much fun.</li>
<li>Some members are not particularly active Wikipedians. It is rare for Wikipedians to remain active editors for more than about six months at a time, because the life circumstances that lead one to edit wikipedia for hours a day tend to be transient in nature. Since the arbcom members were drawn from longtime contributors, there are some whose life circumstances and interests are such that they are not active at Wikipedia on a daily basis.</li>
<li>The legalistic nature of the process makes it inherently slow. They deliberate, then decide whether to accept, then deliberate, then gather evidence and ask questions, then deliberate, then decide whether there's a problem, then deliberate on remedies before preparing and voting on a decree. Each step takes up to a week because some members don't check in daily.</li>
<li>I would characterize a majority of the arbcom members as been basically opposed to bans, and of the group, AFAIK only Fred Bauder and MyRedDice have much online collaboration experience outside of Wikipedia. Those members who are basically opposed to bans don't want to issue them unless there's been a clear, bright-line policy violation. So, they don't ban people who are making asses of themselves as long as they do it in such a way that they don't violate rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, elections would help, because the arbitrators could state their views on how things should work and people could vote accordingly. A stronger mandate would help, some more bright-line community-driven rules on acceptable behavior would help.</p>
<p>As for mediation, well, I don't believe the formal mediation mechanism can claim any successes, and we should probably just take it out of the dispute resolution process because it doesn't work.</p>
<p>Until then, the arbiters are probably right to insist that people try that first, since them 's the rules.</p>
<p>My grammar is terrible today. All these sentence fragments. Oh well.</p>

<p>Happy to. My first big problem is that I think the definition is weak and overly rigid. Although I see Sam's concerns with an adaptive definition, I think a definition that will need continual ammendment is even worse. My other big problem is that I think the effect of this is to make troll bans quickpolls open only to sysops. Obviously lone ranger blocks aren't going to work, but I don't think this is good either, regardless of the threshold. If we're going to use an essentially democratic process to block users, it needs to be open to non-sysops. My current preference, though I'm very open to debating it, is for tempblocks to be imposable by sysops with the support of two other users with a minimum of 200 edits each. If someone feels that they were blocked in error, they may appeal to the arbcom, and, in the absence of a temporary injunction from the arbcom, will recieve amnesty from blocks regarding trolling. (The arbcom, of course, may also refer to mediation, etc) Yes, this dumps a lot on the arbcom, but let's face it - persistant trolls are going to fight their way to the arbcom no matter what policy we have in place. But, yeah, those are my objections - too rigid a definition, and a solution that too resembles quickpolls. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 11:59, Jul 23, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>The suggestion was made that the VVAW should kill <a href="http://oregonmag.com/KerryVVAWPlot.htm" class="external text" title="http://oregonmag.com/KerryVVAWPlot.htm" rel="nofollow">(via assassination)</a> various United States politicians (including US Senators).</p>
<p>According to some, that statement was immediately shouted down by a large majority. Though the suggestion to kill US politicians was voted down, the VVAW members did vote to meet with <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Vietnam_5079.html" title="North Vietnam">North Vietnamese</a> leaders.</p>

<p>What follows, for your edification, is the perfectly factual, evenly presented information about the 1971 meeting which YOU keep removing. And to answer the rehetorical(?) question on the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kerry_b44b.html" title="John Kerry">John Kerry</a> history pages, posed by Gzornenplatz "what has Kerry to do with it if another member of the VVAW makes some dubious proposal?", the 1971 meeting MATTERS, because RELIABLE REPORTS by CREDIBLE WITESSES place Kerry at the meeting and AT THAT MEETING, where violence was proposed. Further, since VIOLENCE WAS PROPOSED, and since there is a bona-fide dispute about the accuracy of Kerry's denails of attendence, the history and facts surroundign that meeting MUST be presented to the public! If you keep deleting this, you ae in effect a pro-kerry censor.</p>
<p>Pleas READ the links in the section I am posting, so you can make an EDUCATED assement of the facts, rather than simply LEAPING to the conclusion that this is not germane!</p>
<p>Here now, is the information which the pro-Kerry censors keep deleting:</p>

<p>I have been trying without much success to stay out of editing and the disputes on Kerry. Rex has been overly "In Your Face" but he is new and being given very little real guidance. He is frustrated at trying to add what he sees as balance and is simply being cold-cocked (pardon my French). I find edits on Bush and Kerry to be extremely POV, and now I see VeryVerily (on Bush) and Rex (on Kerry) being brought up on RfC. This seems to me to begin to move toward censorship of views that don't fit those of editors who feel they own the articles. As a matter of principle I don't believe in RfC against editors though frankly Neutrality is straining my patience. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 08:23, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks for the note. I've been here a lot longer than Rex, I seem to have a cooler head, and I'm a bit more mellow about Neutrality's off-handed stubbornness. I'm bothered by Neutrality's attitude. He's been here a while and should know better. When he was up for admin, a number of editors brought up relevant complaints, and he promised to clean up his act. I gave his nomination an extra day to try to reach clear consensus, and was criticized because this was deemed a bad idea considering the critiques; but Neutrality seems to be getting worse, not better, and I don't have a clue why. -- <a href="../../../c/e/c/User%7ECecropia_bce2.html" title="User:Cecropia">Cecropia</a> | <a href="../../../c/e/c/User_talk%7ECecropia_0e8d.html" title="User talk:Cecropia">Talk</a> 08:50, 27 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, remember the anon about whom you wrote "I think I was too lenient with that anon that time. If he comes back (and continues this behaviour, I'm going to ban him." on my talk page a little while ago? Well, I beat you to it and now he is complaining on the WikiEN-l mailing list (as "Harry Smith").

<dd>Ok, but I don't see any link to have started entering data on a page for that. This is how they beat me to it and made me the issue on a user Rfc, rather than the page being the issue as I had requested. Also, my edit links on my personal discussion page do not seem to work right. Try editing the last section and the 2nd to last opnes instead. The only way to get to the bottom of my page is via the master edit tab at the top of the page.
