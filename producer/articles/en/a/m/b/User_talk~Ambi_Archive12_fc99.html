<p>You removed it as being 'biased'. There are many other anti-VSU articles in that page already; why not allow some balance?</p>

<p>Hi Ambi! Just a quick note to let you know how pleased I am to see you're back safe and sound. Just a little suggestion: just ignore those who can't find anything better to do with their time than to engage in stupid and petty battles. They're not worth spending time on. I don't often edit your articles, but I have read quite a bit of your work, and I've missed you over the last few weeks. I really hope you're back to stay for good, Ambi. I know I'm not the only one who feels that way. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 13:13, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Ambi, you mentioned Glebe Park in the <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_Centre%2C_Australian_Capital_Territory_b077.html" title="City Centre, Australian Capital Territory">City Centre, Australian Capital Territory</a> article. I thought you might be interested to know that I created a <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glebe_Park%2C_Canberra_26ea.html" title="Glebe Park, Canberra">Glebe Park, Canberra</a> page and uploaded a pic. The article needs a LOT of work.

<p>Why did you revert my edit? the quote is verry relevant to Joyce's denial. It establishes that he may not be of the opinion that is stated above that. Also, saying that Barendse's election is under a cloud is verry POV. The actual sittuation is described in the paragraph below it and a reader can decide if it is "under a cloud" or not themselves. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 12:57, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have it on good advice that Barendse did get Joyce's assurance and he believes Joyce dudded him. Mind you, your acusations against me seem fairly hypocritical to me given the fact that you are just reverting everything i do just for the sake of it. <a href="../../../x/t/r/User%7EXtra_5b60.html" title="User:Xtra">Xtra</a> 14:08, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wherever wikipedia editors have bothered to look at the schema-root.org page in question, they have decided to keep the schema-root.org link. You can read for yourself discussions which have already occurred concerning this very point. Schema-root.org is currently serving about 20,000 pages a day. Where else but schema-root.org are you going to find cross-referenced newsfeeds, a newsfeed archive, and a number of reference sites relevant to very specific topics? Good form would be for you to edit based upon merit and the resulting effect on Wikipedia page quality, in my opinion. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntinker_5af1.html" title="User:Johntinker">John Tinker</a> 16:47, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I see comments from all of one editor, whom I disagree with. To the best of my knowledge, there's a bunch of sites that offer the same services, but I have no problem with schema-root links being added by people other than the site owner. Out of curiosity, has anyone other than you ever added schema-root links to Wikipedia? Ambi 16:56, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have never checked. It would be a simple matter to arrange for others to add links. It would seem a little silly. I think there are about 30 references to schema-root.org in Wikipedia subject pages. Your complaint is only the second one, as far as I know. Schema-root.org has about 7,000 topics total, each with current and archived newsfeeds. So 30 out of a possible 7,000 is hardly spamming, I would say. And you have not yet made any comment about the quality of my site. Or responded to my contention that such should be the determining factor.</p>

<p>Ambi, I'm not trying to annoy you, but could you find a reference for me somewhere that would support your "bad form" comment to me. I've been reading through the Wikipedia etiquette, and can't find any references to users not putting links to their own pages, if they provide useful content, are relevant and of good quality. If indeed this is to be a Wikipedia policy, perhaps it should be spelled out somewhere (if it is not currently).

<p>We have been discussing the rules editing on this page without your interferrance. It is inappropriate for you to simply jump in and revert work that has been compromised on. I have asked you to participate in the discussion of Bob Jones Universities rules before you revert the page. You have not done so. My earlier reverts on the topic were to my versions. My newest reverts are reverts to a compromised version of the page. I ask you to consider the facts before blindly inserting these rules again. They do not belong here any more than they belong in another school article. They are the "most interesting thing" to you, but that is your POV, not the POV of everyone. To remain neutral, I ask that you consider working within the boundaries of the compromise already reached.

<p>Hi Ambi.

If you can, could you please move Template:Kiportal:Australia/Did you know and Template:Portal:Australia/Did you know back to Template:Wikiportal:Australia/Did you know. I - rather stupidly, it could be said - mass-moved all the Portals templates without really thinking. It didn't occur to me until after I had finished that I couldn't templatise a namespace.

<dd>Thanks. Okay, I see how I'm being a bit unclear. What happened was that I accidentally moved Template:Wikiportal:Australia/Did you know to Template:Kiportal:Australia/Did you know when I was trying to move it to Template:Portal:Australia/Did you know. Because I want the page history retained, I'd like for Template:Kiportal:Australia/Did you know to be moved back to Template:Wikiportal:Australia/Did you know. After that, both Template:Portal:Australia/Did you know and Template:Kiportal:Australia/Did you know can be deleted. Don't worry about any redirects - I'll try and fix them myself.

<dd>The Jamison Centre is in the Australian Capital Territory. Why would I not include that in the link to distinguish it from potential conflicts?

<p>First thank you for commenting on my respond.<br />
Second, maybe I've made a mistake changing the Goings-on page, but I want to clarify you the reasons&#160;: I've noticed that the Village Pump was getting very unpopular and a posts in it would get no attention, that's why I was thinking of a page where every user could announce and advertise whatever project or news in the community, much like an announcement board (check the interlanguage links in this page for examples in other language wikipedias). I first thought that the Announcement page could be the best, but it semmed that a lot of users wanted to reserve it for news about Wikipedia as a site. One of the reasons I tried the Goings-on page is because it description stated that it was a page for news in the Wikipedia community, but since it didn't get any news, I thought I would advertise it by changing it. What are your comments?</p>
<p>And about the Album namespace proposal, my main motivation is that a lot of images are temporarily removed from an article, and they get lost in the Image namespace. You're right we can move them to the Commons, but not fair use images which represents a big part. The "Album namespace" is just like an "Image category namespace". Putting these images into the old Category namespace like articles is also a solution, but I'm not really a fan of it and some people want to visit categories for articles without waiting for images upload. Please discuss this idea.</p>

<p>Thankyou for being the first person to actually delete names from those lists, instead of disambiguating them instead! The reasons the ACT list is missing was a combination of getting late the light I was doing the lists, and a complete failing to understand the sort order at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_postcodes_in_the_Australian_Capital_Territory_bd27.html" title="List of postcodes in the Australian Capital Territory">List of postcodes in the Australian Capital Territory</a> - what makes a "Main Postcode"? My primary objective on the day was to make all the postcode pages use links with the state names, and then I made plain lists as well, so I could detect misnamed and uncategorised articles. Do you know the history or preferred future for that page? I could start it again from the data at <a href="http://www1.auspost.com.au/postcodes/index.asp?sub=2" class="external free" title="http://www1.auspost.com.au/postcodes/index.asp?sub=2" rel="nofollow">http://www1.auspost.com.au/postcodes/index.asp?sub=2</a> - the others I just started from what was already in the article.

Turns out these are two different places in Sydney, one of which is called Tennyson, and one of which is called Tennyson Point (and is confusingly sometimes also called Tennyson). To untangle the mess (which is mostly my fault), I think we need an admin to do 3 things, namely an redirect/article swap, and deletion, and a move, like so:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennyson_Point%2C_New_South_Wales_870f.html" title="Tennyson Point, New South Wales">Tennyson Point, New South Wales</a> article needs to be swapped with the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennyson%2C_New_South_Wales_a6dd.html" title="Tennyson, New South Wales">Tennyson, New South Wales</a> redirect.</li>
<li>Then the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennyson_Point%2C_New_South_Wales_870f.html" title="Tennyson Point, New South Wales">Tennyson Point, New South Wales</a> redirect needs to be deleted.</li>
<li>Then the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennyson_Point_078c.html" title="Tennyson Point">Tennyson Point</a> article needs to be moved to <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennyson_Point%2C_New_South_Wales_870f.html" title="Tennyson Point, New South Wales">Tennyson Point, New South Wales</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you think you might be able to help out? I'll then update both articles to reduce the confusion (including adding a "see also" line so that both articles refer to each other, in case people end up at the wrong one). To the best of my knowledge, there is nothing controversial about this.

<p>Ambi, I didn't mean to at all suggest that suburb articles weren't valuable. (You might have noticed that I've created Dickson, Ainslie, and Aranda, contributed to others, created some stubs in Gungahlin, and fixed up several of the hastily created stubs which were written in a whirlwind just recently and left in a poor state. I intend to get back to these and fix the rest up in time and also intend to get back to Kingston shortly). I was just making the point that I think we can get more 'bang for buck' with districts and that we shouldn't neglect them. I think that there need to be articles on both suburbs and districts and will continue working on both. I just wanted to clarify that in case there was any misunderstanding. <a href="../../../a/d/z/User%7EAdz_7b0c.html" title="User:Adz">Adz</a> 04:29, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

However, in this case, the article was redirected without consensus. I had suggested delete, and Friday not only thought redirect, he had redirected before anyone else had commented. That, I think, is inappropriate - it is unilateral and defeats the purpose of the process. A review of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sean_Federline_55ad.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sean Federline">discussion</a> a day later shows a general consensus to redirect and thus, I am un-opposed to that happening. But to do so without discussion (ie, at least more than two people), was wrong.--<a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberjunkie_2262.html" title="User:Cyberjunkie">Cyberjunkie</a> | <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberjunkie_1e27.html" title="User talk:Cyberjunkie">Talk</a> 06:10, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for your good faith attempts to resolve our differences. I regret not earlier taking the step of asking for the opinion of a neutral party whom I think we can both respect. I feel that Rossami has laid the issues out in a way that allows me to see that it's largely a matter of communication and that, in that regard, you have valid concerns that I should not neglect, and that the fault in this matter has been largely my own. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:29, 16 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi. Maybe I'm being overly pedantic, but don't think it would be worth waiting until the returning officer has declared the results before stating that someone was elected, and possibly even until they are sworn in to list them as an MLA? <a href="../../../j/p/d/User%7EJPD_191b.html" title="User:JPD">JPD</a> 15:15, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that the results are fairly clear - there is probably more chance of one of the victors being invovled in a an accident before taking their seat, than someone else being elected - so it isn't a big deal, even if I am a bi uncomfortable with it.

<dd>I'm sorry, but I just can't resist biting any longer. Have you ever considered, even for a moment, that maybe your interpretation of policy might be wrong? Consensus is king on Wikipedia. That's how the place works. That's the basis for requests for adminship, too. If there is a consensus that people generally trust you, you'll be granted the privilege - it is <i>not</i> a feit accompli. I've generally been a campaigner for reasonably low adminship standards, and I've not run into you before, but after seeing your behaviour in response to that RfA, I would find it difficult to support you <i>ever</i>. I suspect you'll ignore me as you appear to have ignored all others, but <i>please</i> take a step back and have a look at yourself. Even your allies on Wikipedia have tried and failed to point out to you that you're wrong on this one. By being self-righteous and demanding privileges, you only poison the well with the rest of the community and further demonstrate you don't understand the most fundamental principle of working on Wikipedia - consensus. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 06:26, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>"you ever considered, even for a moment, that maybe your interpretation of policy might be wrong?"</b> Yes, but that is unlikely, since even you admit that the RfA standards should be low; The "policy" as written is plain enough for a kid to understand, so no, whether or not the policy is a good idea, no I'm not misinterpreting it. <b>"but after seeing your behaviour in response to that RfA,"</b> Hold on a sec. "response?" Response to what? Maybe I had a <i>reason</i> to respond. So, maybe first you should look at that was said or done to provoke me. I'm not saying I responded perfectly in every situation, but how would <i>you</i> have responded? You yourself admit you campaign for lower, more reasonable standards, so I'm sure you would have been upset at the actions there too. <b>"I suspect you'll ignore me as you appear to have ignored all others"</b> I ignore no one; I read every single post here and elsewhere, if I can (and usually do) -you mean I "disagree" -I do not even always disagree with others when I may be wrong. Seeing my RfA, I apologized to one fellow to whom I said something slightly rude, so no, I don't even disagree 100% of the time. <b>"don't understand the most fundamental principle of working on Wikipedia - consensus."</b> That's why I asked for others to help identify the current concensus both in <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia_talk%7EFeatured_article_candidates_f596.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Featured article candidates">Wikipedia_talk:Featured_article_candidates</a> and in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia_talk%7ERequests_for_adminship_ee2f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship">Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship</a>, but I am damned when I do ask (see the replies I've gotten), and I'm damned when I don't seek concensus (your reply). So, which is it? Should I seek to identify and comply with concensus or not? If I am going about it in the wrong way, don't say I'm wrong unless you have a better alternative, and then "show me" if you're right. I am generally willing to hear (and enact) new ideas.

<p><i>From my page, you posted this (and I replied)</i> The point is that the consensus is already apparent to everyone else - which is why no one is bothering to respond to your polls. To become an administrator, there must be a consensus among the respondents that this should be the case. Someone else who had lost an adminship vote not long ago gave you some good advice above - take your loss on the chin, take heed of people's concerns, stop demanding adminship as a right, and maybe reapply in two or three months. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 09:27, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have drafted a compromise and I'd like to run it by you and Redwolf, before I post it on the reform page, that allows for a leader to give direction, but with little opportunity to acrue power. The Administrator General, Admin Gen, will be the only goverment functionary, elected to a four month non-consecutive term; self-nominations for the position are not permitted. Redwolf would be acknwoledged as the current Admin Gen and he will set the date for an election to be held within the month. Only Esperanzian members as of the date before an election begins may vote in that election. The issue of government expanison will be taken up when/if Esperanza passes 150 members. I have amende my postion in the hope that Esperanza can do some good even if it is not what I intended. I hope you can moderate your postion as well.-<a href="../../../j/c/a/User%7EJCarriker_76c6.html" title="User:JCarriker">JCarriker</a> 18:30, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Rebecca</p>
<p>Please don't link simple years, decades and centuries unless there's a good reason to do so. They are of no use to the reader, and make the text slightly harder to read. See <a href="../../../m/a/k/Wikipedia%7EMake_only_links_relevant_to_the_context_57f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Make only links relevant to the context">Wikipedia:Make_only_links_relevant_to_the_context</a>.</p>
<p>Tony</p>
<p>PS I meant 'meaningless', of course, in the last edit summary. 'Wikify' means to use Wiki mark-up, including internal links. I don't think it necessarily implies that articles should be peppered with blue (and for most users, underlined) links to sites of no particular relevance. Picking a previously linked year at random, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1916.html" title="1916">1916</a> starts by telling me about blood transfusions. It contains nothing about Patrick White.</p>
<p>I want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep the reader focused on Patrick White;</li>
<li>limit Wikipedia's valuable linking function to useful links, thus increasing the likelihood that readers <i>will</i> follow those up; and</li>
<li>make the text slightly easier to read and more attractive on the page.</li>
</ul>
<p>The practice of linking all chronological items appears to arisen from the need to link dates to enable the auto-formatting function (which is justifiable because it performs a use). Mass linking of all years, decades and centuries is now a problem, in my view. See the article on <a href="../../../k/a/m/Kammerlader.html" title="Kammerlader">Kammerlader</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a> and, I think, the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> for already highly linked text that does not blue out all the years.</p>
<p>Somehow, we have to get some photos. The one that the elusive Simon has chosen looks good, but yes, you're right about the copyright thing. I think the ABC's Patrick White site might have to be approached eventually for permission to use their stuff. What do you think?</p>
