The Central is now <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Depp_9e6a.html" title="Johnny Depp">Johnny Depp</a>'s former business venture, the infamous <a href="../../../v/i/p/Viper_Room_2ce8.html" title="Viper Room">Viper Room</a> on the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunset_Strip_8596.html" title="Sunset Strip">Sunset Strip</a>, where actor River Phoenix overdosed on Halloween Night, 1993.</p>
<p>Amber Rose began to show talent at a very young age and starting acting professionally at the tender age of 4 years old, after a family friend suggested she try out for an NBC TV Movie of the Week called, "Face Of Love".</p>
<p>Amber Rose was handpicked by director Mel Damski, for the role and played <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheryl_Ladd_47bd.html" title="Cheryl Ladd">Cheryl Ladd</a> (<a href="../../../v/e/g/Vegas.html" title="Vegas">Vegas</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie%27s_Angels_b1fe.html" title="Charlie's Angels">Charlie's Angels</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poison_Ivy_5e77.html" title="Poison Ivy">Poison Ivy</a>) and Anthony John Dennison's (<a href="../../../w/i/s/Wiseguy.html" title="Wiseguy">Wiseguy</a>) daughter, Amanda Huntoon.

The film's title was later changed to "Victim of Innocence" and runs regularly on <a href="../../../l/i/f/Lifetime_Television_b63e.html" title="Lifetime Television">Lifetime Television</a> for Women.</p>
<p>Amber Rose started writing poetry as she got older, which was a natural progression to her music. She got her first guitar around 12 years of age, which was a full year after she had already written her first song. Largely self-taught, Amber Rose had already written 7 original songs before she even learned a cover tune.</p>
<p>Amber Rose started performing in the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> area at age 15 as a solo acoustic artist while still attending North Hills Prep School in the <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Fernando_Valley_0bd3.html" title="San Fernando Valley">San Fernando Valley</a>. She is a BMI affiliated songwriter whose original songs are a blend of raw/sultry vocals and <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_music.html" title="Alternative music">alternative</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steel-string_guitar.html" title="Steel-string guitar">acoustic</a> <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_music.html" title="Folk music">folk</a>/<a href="../../../p/o/p/Pop_music.html" title="Pop music">pop</a>/<a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock_music.html" title="Rock music">rock</a> <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar.html" title="Guitar">guitar</a>. Her song, "Don't Let Me Go" hit #1 after only 1 week on the Internet Charts in July 2004. Amber Rose is a <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broadcast_Music_Incorporated_f75d.html" title="Broadcast Music Incorporated">BMI</a> affiliate, and has a large catalog of songs.</p>
<p>Amber Rose Kelly is also an avid fine art <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photographer.html" title="Photographer">photographer</a>. She had her first solo <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photography.html" title="Photography">photography</a> show, called, "Two Faced -Portraitures From The Shadows, at age 15, at the UnUrban Gallery in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Monica_aa1e.html" title="Santa Monica">Santa Monica</a>, CA. She has shown her work at various galleries around Los Angeles, such as Melrose Lightspace, The UnUrban Gallery, and The Soapbox Gallery.</p>
<p>2006 was a busy year for Los Angeles resident, Amber Rose and her new band! After a brief sabbatical from music at age 18, singer/songwriter, Amber Rose Kelly began playing out again, as a solo artist, in April 2006, when Ian contacted her through her MySpace Music page to play at The Cat Club on the Sunset Strip.</p>
<p>It would be her first return to the Sunset Strip after debuting at The Rainbow Room at age 16. She followed this up by playing at The Rockstars Show After-Party at the swanky private club, Otis in San Francisco in May, at the Start Mobile Launch to promote her 4 song ringtones chosen for the new service, which included Sorrows and Tears, Don't Let Me Go, Now I Know, and Pushing Me Away.</p>
<p>On June 12th, she qualified for Boot Camp, after being voted as one of LA's Top Bands to compete for a $1,000,000 Recording Contract in the Bodog Battle of the Bands. The only problem was, she was a solo artist, and had to produce a band out of nowhere to play her show.</p>
<p>The next two months were spent scanning Craig’s List, Music Connection, and any other sources to find a group of musicians that were not hired pros, as this would eliminate her from the competition. Finally, after much trial and error, the Amber Rose Band was born. The current line up is Amber Rose on guitar/vocals, Buster Nicolas on electric guitar, Marcus Neilhaus on bass, and Eddie Chavez on drums.</p>
<p>Her new band debuted at The Roxy on August 30th to a packed house. And everyone was surprised at her new sound! A far cry from her solos acoustic days, she rocked the house that night, and the crowd loved it! Though eliminated in the WildCard Voting phase, Bodog invited her band back for the Semi-Finals at The Key Club on November 22, 2006 when another band dropped out.</p>
<p>She was the only female fronted band left in L.A., and held her own against 19 of Los Angeles's Best MALE fronted Bands! She may not have won Bodog, but she won the respect of her competitors, and she is sure to win yours, too!</p>
<p>Throughout 2006, Amber Rose has been featured on Tunes Baby.com (www.tunesbaby.com) as a Featured Artist, Top Ten, and Female Guitarists. Amber Rose’s song, “Powerless” won 4 Garage Band awards in October of 2006, and as a result of her past involvement with the charity organization, Sound Aid (www.soundaid.org), her song, “Don’t Let Me Go”, will be included in the upcoming Sound Aid Compilation CD to be released in 2007.</p>
<p>The CD, which will feature music by other Sound Aid artists, will sell at coffee house venues, with 100% of the proceeds going to Sound Aid (www.soundaid.org) which directly benefits Heifer International (<a href="http://www.heifer.org" class="external free" title="http://www.heifer.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.heifer.org</a>). There is also discussion about an upcoming Sound Aid Concert, which may be coming to a city near you!</p>
<p>Other shows in 2006, have included, The Masquer's Cabaret in July, The Cat Club in October, a benefit for the Junkiri School in Nepal, Katmandu in December and then earlier this moon January 19th at Tangier for Bohemian Shindig!</p>
