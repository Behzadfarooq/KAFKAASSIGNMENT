<p>Seventeen-year-old Amber arrived in <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> in 1997. Before that, Amber worked with <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheila_Carter_0168.html" title="Sheila Carter">Sheila Carter</a> (<a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimberlin_Brown_2746.html" title="Kimberlin Brown">Kimberlin Brown</a>) in a restaurant in <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Valley_6e6e.html" title="Death Valley">Death Valley</a>. At Sheila's urging, Amber eventually got a job babysitting Sheila and James' (<a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Buchanan_681f.html" title="Ian Buchanan">Ian Buchanan</a>) baby, Mary Margaret; Sheila believed Amber would allow her to see her baby, who was being raised by Maggie Forrester (<a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Crampton_663c.html" title="Barbara Crampton">Barbara Crampton</a>). After initially sympathizing with Sheila's plight, Amber quickly sided with James and Maggie and made it publicly known that she did not believe Sheila was either mentally stable, or a fit mother.</p>
<p>By this time, she had begun working for <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brooke_Logan_bcd1.html" title="Brooke Logan">Brooke Logan</a> (<a href="../../../k/a/t/Katherine_Kelly_Lang_efd8.html" title="Katherine Kelly Lang">Katherine Kelly Lang</a>) as <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Forrester_69a6.html" title="Rick Forrester">Rick</a> (then played by <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob_Young_88a5.html" title="Jacob Young">Jacob Young</a>) and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridget_Forrester_9ba8.html" title="Bridget Forrester">Bridget's</a> (then played by <a href="../../../a/g/n/Agnes_Bruckner_cb1d.html" title="Agnes Bruckner">Agnes Bruckner</a>) <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babysitter.html" title="Babysitter">babysitter</a>. Amber was initially amused by Rick's school boy crush on her, but soon began to develop feelings for the sixteen-year-old. Eric and Brooke were not thrilled with Amber when the infatuation first came to light, but Amber had won over <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephanie_Forrester_%28B%26B%29_3d24.html" title="Stephanie Forrester (B&amp;B)">Stephanie</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_Flannery_021b.html" title="Susan Flannery">Susan Flannery</a>) after Sheila attacked Stephanie and left her for dead. Grateful for finding her and having her taken to the hospital, Stephanie announced that Amber had saved her life.</p>
<p>When Rick ended up in <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hospital.html" title="Hospital">hospital</a> after an accident in a <a href="../../../d/r/a/Drag_race.html" title="Drag race">drag race</a> with <a href="../../../c/2E/j/C.J._Garrison_bff2.html" title="C.J. Garrison">C.J. Garrison</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Cain_7df7.html" title="Mick Cain">Mick Cain</a>), which was Amber's idea, a guilt-ridden Amber donated one of her own <a href="../../../k/i/d/Kidneys.html" title="Kidneys">kidneys</a> to save Rick's life. The two became closer, but one night, Amber went out with a high-school boyfriend, Raymond (originally played by <a href="../../../u/s/h/Usher_%28entertainer%29.html" title="Usher (entertainer)">Usher</a>). She woke up the next morning knowing only that she had passed out drunk the night before. It was weeks before she would learn from Raymond (now played by Karim Prince) that they had sex after she had passed out. Since she had slept with Rick just once around the same time, when she learned she was pregnant, she believed it was Rick's child at first.</p>
<p>Amber left L.A. and went to see her mother, Tawny (<a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrea_Evans_474b.html" title="Andrea Evans">Andrea Evans</a>), in <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Valley_6e6e.html" title="Death Valley">Death Valley</a>, wanting to give birth away from L.A., because in the event that the child was Raymond's, it would be rather obvious as Raymond was <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">black</a>. Unfortunately, as the child was <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stillborn.html" title="Stillborn">stillborn</a>, there was never an opportunity to test the baby's paternity, though it has always been assumed to be Rick's. Amber was devastated by the death of her child, and when Tawny learned that Amber's cousin Becky (Marissa Tait) had given birth that same night to a child that she did not want, she convinced Amber to take that baby back to L.A. as her own. It wasn't long before Amber fell in love with the infant. Brooke eventually learned about the night that Raymond and Amber were together, and lied that Amber's involvement was consensual. Rick (then played by <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Torkildsen_bda2.html" title="Justin Torkildsen">Justin Torkildsen</a>) agreed to stay with Amber regardless.</p>
<p>Becky visited Amber in L.A. and voiced regret over giving up her baby. Amber was uncomfortable with Becky's attachment toward Little Eric and helped organize a job for Becky at Forrester International in <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>. Becky soon found the baby she had put up for adoption and Amber convinced her to keep quiet, while Rick continue to battle unresolved feelings for Kimberly Fairchild (Ashley Lyn Cafagna). At an effort to undermine Amber, Kimberly uncovered the truth about Little Eric's true identity. Rick and the rest of the Forresters were horrified at the revelation that the real Eric Forrester III was dead and buried in the middle of the desert.</p>
<p>C.J. and Becky then began dating. Amber discovered that Becky was dying and kept her illness a secret from her. Everyone knew that Becky was dying and kept it from her until her wedding day. Becky died peacefully, bringing together the Forrester and Spectra families. C.J. gained temporary custody of Little Eric and moved in with Amber. Bringing home Ash, who tried to pick her up while working at Café Russe, Sam, a jealous groupie, set Amber and CJ up for drug possession. The Forresters feared for Little Eric's well-being. C.J. and Amber soon developed feelings for one another and planned to marry. Rick stopped their wedding by tracking down <a href="../../../d/e/a/Deacon_Sharpe_ccef.html" title="Deacon Sharpe">Deacon Sharpe</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Kanan_a9ea.html" title="Sean Kanan">Sean Kanan</a>), Eric's biological father. Rick implored Amber to leave C.J. so that he could give her the life she had always dreamed of. Not completely over Rick, Amber left C.J.</p>
<p>The Spectras and Forresters began a bidding war for Little Eric. Using Little Eric as leverage, Deacon took the child to live with himself and his lover Carmen Arena (Gladys Jimenez) at his apartment, which was situated above his club, The Lair. Deacon's attraction to Amber soon developed into much deeper feelings of affection. Carmen became suspicious of Deacon's motives of not accepting the offer of one million dollars and Amber's constant visits. Carmen's jealousy intensified one night when she took baby Eric to the rooftop of Deacon's building. Amber confronted psychotic Carmen, who hesitantly returned Eric to Deacon. The confrontation ensues in a struggle, which resulted in Carmen accidentally falling to her death.</p>
<p>Amber asked Deacon to sign papers releasing her from the four month agreement but instead allowing visitation to Little Eric. Amber and Rick's wedding day arrived, and as the ceremony began and the two were about to exchange vows, Eric stood up and asked the minister to stop as he approached Deacon and demanded he leave immediately. Eric and Brooke were mortified when Bridget (then played by <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Finnigan_2709.html" title="Jennifer Finnigan">Jennifer Finnigan</a>) announced that Deacon was her date! The guests are asked to leave. Deacon and Amber went to the den to talk, while the rest of the Forresters tried to make Bridget see Deacon's true intentions. When Rick, Eric and Brooke entered the den, Deacon forced them to choose between Amber and Bridget, stating that he WOULD be leaving with one of them. Rick and Amber then married.</p>
<p>Deacon begged Amber not to marry Rick, but she refused. To get revenge on the Forresters, Deacon began dating Bridget and eventually married her in a shotgun <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas_bf20.html" title="Las Vegas">Las Vegas</a> ceremony! Deacon tried to make a deal with the Forresters that he would divorce Bridget if Amber and Little Eric were given back to him. The Forresters refused the deal and Bridget and Deacon stayed married. Deacon continued to flirt with Amber, until Bridget found out the real reason Deacon married her and was involved in a car crash. Deacon vowed to stand by his wife and Amber stayed with Rick. Soon after, Amber became pregnant with her and Rick's second child. Amber then began designing for Forrester Creations and became a fashion success, but she passed out in pain at her first fashion show. Amber was rushed to the hospital, but lost the baby due to complications.</p>
<p>Amber could not stand the pain of losing another child and turned to pills to ease the pain. She became addicted to them and after her doctor refused to prescribe anymore of them to her, she went to a drug dealer named Ziggy (<a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Borlenghi_afbc.html" title="Matt Borlenghi">Matt Borlenghi</a>) to get them. When Amber realized how low she had sunk, she went to her sister in law, <a href="../../../t/a/y/Taylor_Hayes_Forrester_767e.html" title="Taylor Hayes Forrester">Taylor Hayes</a> (<a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunter_Tylo_50ac.html" title="Hunter Tylo">Hunter Tylo</a>), for help. Taylor got Amber into a rehab center and Rick supported her through the ordeal. After Amber returned home, the Forresters threw a <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beach.html" title="Beach">beach</a> party. At the beach party, a man named Lance drugged Amber and took her back to his place (Lance was paid by Sheila to do so). The next morning, Lance told Amber that she had gotten drunk, but they had not slept together (this was only half true). Amber went home and told Rick that she woke up in bed with a strange man and could not remember anything else. Rick was furious to hear what Amber had done and Amber then moved in with Taylor and <a href="../../../r/i/d/Ridge_Forrester_bd0e.html" title="Ridge Forrester">Ridge</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronn_Moss_4fa1.html" title="Ronn Moss">Ronn Moss</a>). Amber and Taylor believed that she had been drugged by Lance but could not figure out why. Amber questioned Lance many times, but Sheila murdered him before he could tell her what really happened that night.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before Amber realized what was going on, and Sheila kidnapped her, determined to install her own sixteen-year-old daughter, <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erica_Lovejoy_7bb1.html" title="Erica Lovejoy">Erica</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/u/Courtnee_Draper_02e9.html" title="Courtnee Draper">Courtnee Draper</a>) as Rick's love interest and Little Eric's mother. In a final battle, Taylor was shot by Sheila and presumed dead, and Amber and everyone else grieved for her. Rick and Amber were able to get past what had happened and reunite.</p>
<p>However, Deacon's presence continued to cause problems in their life, especially when it was proven that Rick and Amber had no legal right to Little Eric. Deacon, who had recently married <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macy_Alexander_Sharpe_673a.html" title="Macy Alexander Sharpe">Macy Alexander</a> (<a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobbie_Eakes_51fc.html" title="Bobbie Eakes">Bobbie Eakes</a>), eventually won custody of Little Eric. Amber kidnapped Little Eric and went on the run, which was the final straw for Rick, who walked out on her. After Macy died at <a href="../../../o/s/c/Oscar_Marone_fd5a.html" title="Oscar Marone">Oscar Marone</a>'s (<a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Gaskill_c826.html" title="Brian Gaskill">Brian Gaskill</a>) club, Amber offered to look after Little Eric for Deacon, and knowing how much his son loved her, he agreed.</p>
<p>Once Deacon was able to look after his son again, Amber was again out of their lives, and with Rick having turned his back on her, she began flirting with Oscar to get a job with him, but nothing came of it. When Amber nearly died in a housefire, she temporarily moved in with firefighter <a href="../../../h/e/c/Hector_Ramirez_b4ba.html" title="Hector Ramirez">Hector Ramirez</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorenzo_Lamas_c11d.html" title="Lorenzo Lamas">Lorenzo Lamas</a>), his daughter <a href="../../../c/a/i/Caitlin_Ramirez_142a.html" title="Caitlin Ramirez">Caitlin</a> (<a href="../../../k/a/y/Kayla_Ewell_a311.html" title="Kayla Ewell">Kayla Ewell</a>), and adopted son Jimmy (<a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Warren_Jr._1fba.html" title="Chris Warren Jr.">Chris Warren Jr.</a>), but it wasn't long before Amber was back on her feet again and living in Taylor's old <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beach_house.html" title="Beach house">beach house</a>. She tried once again to patch things up with Rick, but he had fallen in love with Caitlin. When Ridge's son <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Forrester_d053.html" title="Thomas Forrester">Thomas</a> (<a href="../../../d/r/e/Drew_Tyler_Bell_b54d.html" title="Drew Tyler Bell">Drew Tyler Bell</a>) found Caitlin, whom he had been seeing, kissing Rick, he ended up at the beach house, where Amber comforted him. Amber tried to fight her attraction to Thomas, but when the Forresters turned their backs on her and she was rendered homeless, she stopped fighting and she and Thomas began lovers. She reluctantly left town after Ridge filed a <a href="../../../r/e/s/Restraining_order.html" title="Restraining order">restraining order</a> against her, returning after <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thorne_Forrester_6c37.html" title="Thorne Forrester">Thorne</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/n/Winsor_Harmon_3f7a.html" title="Winsor Harmon">Winsor Harmon</a>) offered her a job at Spectra Couture. She then moved into the Forrester guesthouse and tried to have a genuine relationship with Thomas, but when that failed, she blamed Ridge.</p>
<p>Desperate to prove that Ridge wasn't such a great guy in an attempt to get Thomas back, Amber set Ridge and Bridget (now played by <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashley_Jones_c285.html" title="Ashley Jones">Ashley Jones</a>) up to end up in an abandoned mine together on a skiing trip to <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Bear_Lake_581c.html" title="Big Bear Lake">Big Bear</a>, convinced that they would give into their feelings for one another. Her plan backfired when Ridge and Bridget almost died, and Thomas wanted nothing more to do with her. She left Los Angeles for <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> to try to put her life back together, and caught Ridge in what she believed was a delicate position with another woman, but in fact, an <a href="../../../a/m/n/Amnesiac.html" title="Amnesiac">amnesiac</a> Ridge had been kidnapped by a mentally unstable Morgan DeWitt (<a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Buxton_%28actress%29_2db5.html" title="Sarah Buxton (actress)">Sarah Buxton</a>). She helped get him home, but it didn't improve her standing with the Forrester family. After swearing to Stephanie that she would make herself a better person, Amber left town for parts unknown.</p>
<p>A year and a half later, in November 2006, Amber moved to <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genoa_City%2C_Wisconsin_df4f.html" title="Genoa City, Wisconsin">Genoa City, Wisconsin</a> -- the hometown of former acquaintance <a href="../../../l/a/u/Lauren_Fenmore_Baldwin_61f7.html" title="Lauren Fenmore Baldwin">Lauren Fenmore Baldwin</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/a/Tracey_E._Bregman_35fd.html" title="Tracey E. Bregman">Tracey E. Bregman</a>). Reuniting with Lauren and her new husband <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Baldwin_7471.html" title="Michael Baldwin">Michael Baldwin</a> (<a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_LeBlanc_6d57.html" title="Christian LeBlanc">Christian LeBlanc</a>), Amber performed at Indigo, the <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> club owned by <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Winters_2fae.html" title="Neil Winters">Neil Winters</a> (<a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristoff_St._John_9556.html" title="Kristoff St. John">Kristoff St. John</a>), when the regularly scheduled band cancelled without notice. She also began a flirtation with <a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrian_Korbel_d991.html" title="Adrian Korbel">Adrian Korbel</a> (<a href="../../../e/y/a/Eyal_Podell_52dc.html" title="Eyal Podell">Eyal Podell</a>), who was also interested in <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colleen_Carlton_0a30.html" title="Colleen Carlton">Colleen Carlton</a> (<a href="../../../a/d/r/Adrianne_Leon_4666.html" title="Adrianne Leon">Adrianne Leon</a>). Since he broke it off with her, she has been attracted to a mysterious bartender named Cane, who she is going to marry so that he doesn't have to move back to Australia. Amber met <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cane_Ashby_77c4.html" title="Cane Ashby">Cane Ashby</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Goddard_9119.html" title="Daniel Goddard">Daniel Goddard</a>) on a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chat_room.html" title="Chat room">chat room</a> for adoptees looking for their birthparents. Amber had previously been looking for a woman called Violet after being accidentally present at <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katherine_Chancellor_1345.html" title="Katherine Chancellor">Katherine Chancellor</a>'s (<a href="../../../j/e/a/Jeanne_Cooper_9f6a.html" title="Jeanne Cooper">Jeanne Cooper</a>) house when Kay remembered having stolen <a href="../../../j/i/l/Jill_Foster_Abbott_1298.html" title="Jill Foster Abbott">Jill Abbott</a>'s (<a href="../../../j/e/s/Jess_Walton_d1eb.html" title="Jess Walton">Jess Walton</a>) son Phillip and replacing him with another child. Kay then remembered giving him to someone named Violet. Following up on this lead, Amber trolled the Internet with some help from Adrian. Amber knows that Cane is the child they are seeking, but instead of telling them, she decided to marry Cane, whom she has been spending time with for the past several weeks. After leaving for <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas%2C_Nevada_aec8.html" title="Las Vegas, Nevada">Las Vegas</a>, Amber drugged Cane and, with help from <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alison_Stewart_%28ATWT%29_6584.html" title="Alison Stewart (ATWT)">Alison Stewart</a> (Marnie Schulenburg), orchestrated a faux wedding. Cane does not remember marrying Amber, but is willing to give their marriage a go.</p>
