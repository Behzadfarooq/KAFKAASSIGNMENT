<p>I tidied up the listings for things like Routes, Commuter services, Freight, etc, and combined them under "Amtrak routes and services". I also took the infrastructure-related items and consolidated them under "Trains and Tracks". I see <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlambo_7b8d.html" title="User:Slambo">Slambo</a>, a fellow UNIX/Railroad geek is cleaning up the route table as well. Good.

<dd>The table was a little crunched by the route schematic, so a quick br fixed that. Adding the background color on the column headers makes them easier to distinguish too. I used the same background color as we're using on the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Portal%7ETrains_b02e.html" title="Portal:Trains">Trains Wikiportal</a> and in the infobox at the top of the page. I think it could look a little better if it had a 1px border on the cells, especially for rows where the text wraps (which will happen on smaller monitor resolutions). <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlambo_7b8d.html" title="User:Slambo">slambo</a> 15:37, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">UK</a>, <b>Amtrak</b> is the name of a parcel delivery company.</i></p>
<p>Possible the two companies are related?</p>
<p>No, but U.S. Amtrak does accept parcels for station-to-station shipment. Mine disappeared without a trace. Or as they say, Do all Amtrak trains go to Chicago? No, but all the baggage does.</p>
<p>It seems like Amtrak is doing better, i.e. less crashes (or maybe I'm just not up on the news). All I ever used to hear about Amtrak was yet another crash. The article doesn't seem to address their safety record. Does anyone have information on this?</p>
<p><br />
hmm...not really... i ride it between home and college every few weeks. The trains are often late and not very popular. However, I still glad that it's an transportation option for me. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacrowiz_a6da.html" title="User:Macrowiz">Macrowiz</a> 20:55, 24 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Amtrak is dependent on freight traffic and track that Amtrak doesn't own or operate to function. In dense areas, Amtrak does well because states can organize better trackage for particular routes (like the Amtrak Cascades route). With higher-ridership routes, the trains can operate with a profit if they provide a level of service capable of getting people off the roads, but since US citizens don't see the price of their roads when making transportation decisions, they tend to use cars.</p>
<hr />
<dl>
<dd>Amtrak employs over 22,000 employees and receives a great deal of federal government funding, leading to recurring debates over its elimination. However, since the terrorist atttacks of <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001.html" title="September 11, 2001">September 11, 2001</a>, government funding of Amtrak has been greatly increased.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">NPOV?</span></h2>
<p><i>Often, Amtrak's top management would be more interested in their own political ambitions than in actually making the operation successful, and would often lie to Congress about Amtrak being close to self-sufficiency. This changed when President George W. Bush appointed David Gunn as President of Amtrak. He immediately began a program of trimming fat from the operation, and of giving Congress unvarnished truth, rather than toadying to curry favor, a change that earned him respect from both Congress and the Public.</i></p>
<p>This does not seem very neutral to me. I'm certain that no one in Washington has ever muttered the "unvarnished truth," and how can one prove the supposed respect he has with Congress and the public? Just say what he did in an "unvarnished" way. What are the facts? This seems to me a bit too enthusiastic to be considered neutral.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree, not very neutral. My personal opinion would be to just delete the whole paragraph. Any other opinions? <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> 03:32, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>NPOV does NOT mean removing any points of view that are not neutral, it means including all points of view to make the article neutral.

<p>There is truth in the statement, but it is incomplete and poorly expressed. I do not think we can fairly use the word <i>lie</i> when those in Washington are all playing something of a game of the Emporer's New Clothes. The fact is that they truth was twisted to be politically correct. I think the comments present an important problem Amtrak has had (and will have for the foreseeable future). <a href="../../../v/a/o/User%7EVaoverland_3ef2.html" title="User:Vaoverland">Vaoverland</a></p>
<p>Try this working as an alternative:</p>
<p><i>Amtrak was established to relieve railroads of their federally-mandated responsibilities to transport passengers as a priority over freight. This was causing increasingly large large financial losses for the railroads as the networks of federally-funded highways and airports expanded.</i></p>
<p><i>At the outset, Amtrak was expected to pursue conflicting goals. Amtrak was supposed to provide a national rail passenger service while simultaneously operating as a commercial enterprise. Without a without a dedicated source of capital equipment and operating funding (except for competitive passenger fares and even less express income, Amtrak's continued operation has been dependent upon both the Executive and Legislative branches of the U.S. government. Both congressional funding, and appointments of Amtrak's leaders are subject to political considerations, which have varied widely during its existence through seven U.S. presidencies and major shifts of power in the U.S. Congress.</i></p>
<p><i>Amtrak has benefited from both highly skilled and politically-oriented leaders. For example, former U.S. <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_the_Navy_6a8c.html" title="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_Railway_%28US%29_c64f.html" title="Southern Railway (US)">Southern Railway</a> head <a href="../../../w/2E/_/W._Graham_Claytor_Jr._b193.html" title="W. Graham Claytor Jr.">W. Graham Claytor Jr.</a> brought his naval and railroad experience to the job. Claytor to come out of retirement to lead Amtrak after the disastrous results of the Alan Boyd presidency during the Carter administration (1979-1983). He was recruited and strongly supported by <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_H._Riley_2517.html" title="John H. Riley">John H. Riley</a>, an attorney who was the highly-skilled head of the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Railroad_Administration_a283.html" title="Federal Railroad Administration">Federal Railroad Administration</a> (FRA) from 1983-1989. <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secretary_of_Transportation_1413.html" title="Secretary of Transportation">Secretary of Transportation</a> <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Dole_5e1b.html" title="Elizabeth Dole">Elizabeth Dole</a> also tacitly supported Amtrak. Claytor seemed to enjoy a good relationship with the Congress for his 11 years on the job. Since then, leadership changed several times. Two of the leaders who followed Claytor lacked freight railroad or private-sector experience. They also inherited the Amtrak self-sufficiency myth which began under <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Stockman_5b90.html" title="David Stockman">David Stockman</a> and his successors at the <a href="../../../o/f/f/Office_of_Management_and_Budget_a30d.html" title="Office of Management and Budget">Office of Management and Budget</a> (OMB) under Claytor's presidency (in 1986).</i></p>
<p><i>Amtrak President Thomas Downs had been City Administrator of <a href="../../../w/a/s/Washington_DC_0dbd.html" title="Washington DC">Washington DC</a>, and oversaw the Union Station project, which had experienced massive delays and cost overruns. Under Downs, in 1995 Amtrak began to claim that it could achieve operating self-sufficiency, and its leaders seemed to be increasingly misleading as to the prospects of achieving that goal when pressed by Congress and the media.</i></p>
<p><i>After Downs left Amtrak, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Warrington_557c.html" title="George Warrington">George Warrington</a> was appointed as Amtrak's president. He had extensive experience in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> area, where citizens have long demonstrated a commitment to the mass transit services. When he took the helm in January, 1998, self-sufficiency was still officially a goal, although it was becoming elusive in the eyes of Congress. Under Warrington's administration, Amtrak was mandated by the Administration and Congress to become totally self-sufficient within a five-year period, and all its management efforts were directed to that goal. Finally, at the end of that period, it became clear that self-sufficiency was an idealistic goal which was simply unachievable, no matter how many much additional express revenue was gained or how many cuts were made in Amtrak services.</i></p>
<p><i>In fairness, while both Downs or Warrington had extensive experience in government, neither had the non-governmental cost accounting or practical experience in railroading of that Claytor also had. Claytor also enjoyed the benefit of serving during the Reagan Administration when increases in federal spending on military items was drawing a lot of the political attention in Congress.</i></p>
<p><i>When <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Gunn_ce5c.html" title="David Gunn">David Gunn</a> was selected as Amtrak president, the myth of Amtrak self-sufficiency had been exposed. He came with a reputation as a strong, straight-foward and experienced operating manager. In his selection, President <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> knew he was not hiring someone who would tell Congress whatever was politically correct. Years earlier, Gunn's refusal to "do politics" put him at odds with the WMATA (Metro) board, which includes representatives from the District of Columbia and suburban jurisdictions in <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a> during his tenure from 1991-1994. His work as president of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_Transit_Authority_cc39.html" title="New York City Transit Authority">New York City Transit Authority</a> from 1984 to 1990 and as Chief General Manager of the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Transit_Commission_aca4.html" title="Toronto Transit Commission">Toronto Transit Commission</a> in Canada from 1995-1999 earned him a great deal of operating credibility, despite his rough handling of politics and labor unions. The two agencies were each the largest transit operations of their respective countries. Prior to 1974, Gunn also gained private-sector railroad experience with <a href="../../../i/l/l/Illinois_Central_Gulf_Railroad_50ae.html" title="Illinois Central Gulf Railroad">Illinois Central Gulf Railroad</a>, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Central_1d72.html" title="New York Central">New York Central Railroad System</a> (before the Penn Central debacle) and for the <a href="../../../a/t/c/Atchison%2C_Topeka_and_Santa_Fe_Railway_d672.html" title="Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway">Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway</a>. Before that, he had experince with the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Navy_1b88.html" title="U.S. Navy">U.S. Navy</a> in the Naval Reserve. Gunn's credentials are the strongest at the head of Amtrak since W. Graham Claytor came out of retirement by request in 1982.</i></p>
<p><i>So far, Gunn has been polite, but very direct in response to congressional criticism, and is seen as more credible by the Congress, the media, and many Amtrak supporters and employees. Perhaps more than any past president of Amtrak, Gunn seems willing to publicly oppose the positions of the President of the United States who appointed him, and whose pleasure he serves.</i></p>
<p><i>A more realistic view of Amtrak under the Gunn administration is that no form of mass passenger transportation in the United States is self-sufficient as the economy is currently structured. Highways, airports, and air traffic control all require large expenditures to build and maintain. Gunn answered a demand by leading Amtrak critic Arizona Senator <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_McCain_2b79.html" title="John McCain">John McCain</a> to eliminate all operating subsidies by asking the Senator if he would also demand the same of the commuter airlines, upon whom the citizens of Arizona are much more dependent.</i></p>
<p><i>If Amtrak is to operate, it must do so safely and it will require extensive ongoing financial capital and operating support. Gunn and President Bush are probably in agreement that more state and local funding support would be desirable for Amtrak. Both probably also realize that the more practical and frugal management under Gunn will draw less fire from Amtrak's opponents in Congress, where the question of federal financing will ultimately be decided, perhaps an a year-to-year basis for the foreseeable future.</i></p>
<p>Is this too much detail? My career has been in transportation, mostly in competition with Amtrak to a point. However, I am not anti-Amtrak, mostly I am NPOV, personally. I am comfortable with the facts as I have written them above. How is that for a more balanced statement of Amtrak, leadership, and the funding dilemma?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Weasel words</span></h2>
<p>Hey gang. I think the section on Amtrak politics -- particularly the "self-sufficiency" and portions on Gunn -- need work. I agree with the thrust of the commentary, but it contains way too many <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weasel_words.html" title="Weasel words">weasel words</a> that ought to be tidied up. For instance... <i>Some of Gunn's actions have been seen by many as politically wise</i>. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup> 21:11, September 8, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I deleted the reference to the <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metrolink_%28Southern_California%29_b064.html" title="Metrolink (Southern California)">Metrolink (Southern California)</a> contract that Amtrak <i>used</i> to have ... And then <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">User:SPUI</a> put it back (see the history for the main article). My reason for deleting the reference is that if we include Metrolink, then we have to include <i>all</i> Amtrak's previous contracts to provide commuter service, i.e. <a href="../../../m/b/t/MBTA_Commuter_Rail_f5ee.html" title="MBTA Commuter Rail">MBTA Commuter Rail</a>. I think that's a waste of space in the main article, just as I thought it was a waste of space to include a list of every route or train that ever was (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Amtrak_routes_b75f.html" title="List of Amtrak routes">List of Amtrak routes</a>).</p>
<p>So how do we handle it? Move it to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Amtrak_routes_b75f.html" title="List of Amtrak routes">List of Amtrak routes</a>? Delete it and not worry?

<dd>How about a line or two - Amtrak used to have contracts for Metrolink, MBTA, etc... and put the details in the linked articles? --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a>) 17:08, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>To what end? To me, it's like the list of defunct routes that used to be included - who cares? Well, actually, I do and am interested enough that I <i>have</i> perused the list. But include it as part of a general-audience encyclopedia article? Why? What does it add? --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlaws_d66e.html" title="User:Plaws">N5UWY/9 - plaws</a> 17:46, 17 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia is a general-interest encyclopedia and many specialist encyclopedias all in one. A list of all commuter services once operated by Amtrak would be useful - it could alternately be another section on the Amtrak routes article, but should be linked from this article. --<a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESPUI_637c.html" title="User:SPUI">SPUI</a> (<a href="../../../s/p/u/User_talk%7ESPUI_234e.html" title="User talk:SPUI">talk</a>) 19:20, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Old Amtrak logo nickname and sliding toward bias</span></h2>
<p>Another editor removed the nickname of Amtrak's old logo. The logo has been called "the pointless arrow" in many industry publications. I've seen it recently in Trains magazine. I think the nickname needs to be mentioned to present both positive and negative points of view about the subject. I'm concerned that other editors are removing text that is critical of the company while leaving text that praises it, thus biasing the article in favor of Amtrak. Reporting both sides of a story isn't POV, it's balanced reporting. <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlambo_7b8d.html" title="User:Slambo">slambo</a> 11:01, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Speaking as an Amtrak supporter myself, I think there's something to this argument. However, I also think that it belongs in a separate section on "criticism of Amtrak" rather than scattered through the main section. At most, the logo caption could read, "nicknamed <i>by some</i> 'the Pointless Arrow'." <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobGreenwade_7c9e.html" title="User:BobGreenwade">BobGreenwade</a> 16:59, 25 October 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It really shouldn't matter whether one is an "Amtrak supporter" or not. The term "pointless arrow" has been used by the industry for many years. I'll agree that "nicknamed by some" would be acceptable.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>That's a much more useful and informative caption on the old logo now. I especially like the way it ties in the introduction of the current logo. Kudos! <a href="../../../s/l/a/User%7ESlambo_7b8d.html" title="User:Slambo">slambo</a> 18:09, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I was the editor that originally removed the <i>pointless arrow</i> reference. I was afraid that it was a neologism or a slang term used by a few. Obviously I was wrong and I hope the alteration I later made to the caption is better. <a href="../../../e/d/w/User%7EEdwinHJ_27bb.html" title="User:EdwinHJ">EdwinHJ</a> | <a href="../../../e/d/w/User_talk%7EEdwinHJ_d1f4.html" title="User talk:EdwinHJ">Talk</a> 23:27, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm the anon, it wasn't vandalism. I just didn't get around to posting on the talk page. I sense an anti-Bush-administration vibe running through the article, beginning with "Secretary of Transportation, Norman Mineta, also sits on the board although he has never attended a board meeting." and extending through the firing of Gunn. Likewise, there are instance of "Amtrak is incompetent" sentiment peppered throughout.
<dl>
<dd>Please sign your talk posts using ~~~~ so others can correlate your words here with your edits to the article.</dd>
<dd>The statement on transportation secretary Mineta is IMHO a neutral statement of fact, and as such does not trip my POV alarm. Please elaborate on what you see as non-neutral or non-factual. — <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonRoma_fb06.html" title="User:JonRoma">JonRoma</a> 06:21, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
