<p>When I looked at this page, I was surprised thatI could not see the image "Amtrak schematic.png" embedded in the article. At first I thought this was because someone vandalized the article, but after some examination, I found that for some reason my browser only shows a thick blue line where the image should be. If I click on the line, I am taken to the large version of the png file, which I can view without problems. I tried to tweak the code, but it makes no difference in my browser.</p>

<p>I've just reverted some edits from the anonymous user at 24.22.127.149. The assertions made by this person are unproven statements that would be appropriate if they can be verified and documented.</p>
<p>In particular, I take some exception to the statements</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In addition to the national impact from its employees and passengers, there is a large impact from Amtrak on the national economy due to Amtrak presence in its major hub cities of Chicago, Washington, D.C, New York, and Los Angeles. Amtrak owns or operates inside the large Union Stations in these cities, and their usage by Amtrak has a very large impact on those cities economies.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>I sincerely doubt that Amtrak is a significant factor in the economies of these cities in terms of the numbers of employed, and the effects to a city's economy of the loss of Amtrak service would be less significant than a loss of commuter rail. A statement that makes these assertions <i>accompanied by factual statistics</i> would be more meaningful than an unproven claim of "very large impact on those cities' economies".</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The fact that Amtrak does not own tracks outside the NEC, and is subject to dispatching from the host freight railroads, presents a dilemma for Amtrak and delays for its passengers. Amtrak trains are often subject to extreme delays imposed by the freight railroads. Amtrak trains are often forced onto sidings for hours at a time while waiting for freight trains to pass. Although capable of speeds over 100 MPH, Amtrak trains are frequently limited to speeds of less than 40 MPH by freight railroad imposed speed restrictions. The delays most often show up on the freight railroads which have an inauspicious relationship with Amtrak and/or have poorly maintained track.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This is false. Amtrak trains are capable of speeds of 100 mph only on sections of track that have cab signals; federal regulations prohibit running above 79 mph in the absence of such systems.</p>
<p>Though Amtrak's relationship with its freight-carrying hosts has often been shaky, the situation is much improved from the past. It is a fair statement to discuss the challenges of running a scheduled passenger service on lines dispatched by a railroad that has its own operational priorities, but the other assertions (regarding "forced onto sidings for hours at a time" and "limited to speeds of less than 40 mph" are not supported by any facts in the edits I reverted. — <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonRoma_fb06.html" title="User:JonRoma">JonRoma</a> 21:16, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just made significant copyedits (some grammar, wording), and reordered some sections.</p>
<ul>
<li>Put "Amtrak routes and services" before subsections "Gaps in service" followed by "Commuter services" and "Intermodal connections".</li>
<li>"Freight services" is now it's own section.</li>
<li>Cut the paragraph about <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Gunn_ce5c.html" title="David Gunn">David Gunn</a> from the intro. This is already discussed in the history section.</li>
<li>Moved the "National impact" paragraph to the intro, as this provides some basics about what Amtrak is that belong in the intro.</li>
<li>Removed the schematic image, as it's showing up for me (and others). If problems with it are fixed, I don't see why it can't be re-added later.</li>
<li>Moved the national system map to the "Amtrak routes and services" section.</li>
<li>Rearranged some of the other photos, e.g. AutoTrain to where the article mentions AutoTrain.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think these changes improve how the article reads in a more logical way, but as always feel free to discuss the changes here (or revert). -<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AudeVivere_35a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/AudeVivere">contribs</a>)</small> 02:18, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In a brochure from 1972, Amtrak say, the name is <i>American track &amp; travel</i>, now, Amtrak say in his hompage <i>american and track</i>! In a german book over world's railways is standing also <i>american track and travel</i>. Wat is now right?--212.99.205.172 18:38, 11 February 2006 (UTC) Mäfä from Germnay wikipedia</p>
<p>According to the late Dr. Adrian Herzog, the name <i>Amtrak</i> came from an employee contest; and his was the winning entry. Dr. Herzog told me his entry came from the words "America, track, and travel." -- wlindley@wlindley.com 2006-03-01</p>
<p>According to Amtrak's own websites, Amtrak is short for "American Track": <a href="http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Copy/Title_Image_Copy_Page&amp;c=am2Copy&amp;cid=1081442674300&amp;ssid=174" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Copy/Title_Image_Copy_Page&amp;c=am2Copy&amp;cid=1081442674300&amp;ssid=174" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.capitolcorridor.org/aboard_the_train/train_trivia/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.capitolcorridor.org/aboard_the_train/train_trivia/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> But there are also sources that say it means "American Travel by Track", including page 38 of the June 1991 issue of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trains_%28magazine%29.html" title="Trains (magazine)">Trains</a>, part of an article written by Kevin McKinney, who was involved in the behind-the-scenes work of Amtrak's startup. Is this a case of revisionist history, or simply an error by one of the sides? --<a href="../../../n/e/2/User%7ENE2_ab1c.html" title="User:NE2">NE2</a> 09:31, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The whole discussion is kind of pointless, because anybody with half a brain can tell that Amtrak is an invented word that blends American and track, but it never existed as a full form "American Track" or anything like that. It also doesn't belong at the beginning of an encylcopedia article. It should be more like a footnote, at best.--JBH23 15:27, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why doesn't an explanation of where it came from belong near the beginning? Someone coming here wondering why it's called Amtrak should be able to get an answer easily. --<a href="../../../n/e/2/User%7ENE2_ab1c.html" title="User:NE2">NE2</a> 16:00, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That kind of argument can be used to put anything near the beginning. How many people do you think are wondering that and can't figure it out for themselves? Besides, evidence offered doesn't seem conclusive.--JBH23 15:08, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am commenting on the following:</p>
<p>"Historically, on routes where a single railroad has had an undisputed monopoly, passenger service was as spartan and as expensive as the market and Interstate Commerce Commission regulation would bear, since such railroads had no need to advertise their freight services. But on routes where two or three railroads were in direct competition with each other for freight business, such railroads would spare no expense to make their passenger trains as fast, luxurious, and affordable as possible, because it was considered to be the most effective way of advertising their profitable freight services."</p>
<p>This is, I think, insightful and largely correct. But it isn't the whole story. I can't comment on the pre-World-War II situation, but after the war it was not clear to anyone that intercity passenger service would turn out to be a terrible investment. After making a major commitment to diesel-powered, streamlined equipment, the AT&amp;SF found that its passenger revenues increased as much as 227% annually; Santa Fe remained a believer far longer than competing lines, and until its 1971 demise the Super Chief was still one of the finest trains in the history of railroading. There was a commitment there that, it seems to me, goes beyond advertising for the company's freight operations. To be sure, I'm not disputing the overall picture, but the above generalization isn't quite accurate. How should we fix this? <a href="../../../p/f/a/User%7EPfaff9_358a.html" title="User:Pfaff9">Bryan</a> 23:36, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The facts were not inconvenient they just werent relevant to the section, however your statistics from an organizations whos goal is to destroy that thing makes those statistic not neutral and while consistence does matter something that is not neutral does not become neutral just because something else is not neutral. Also it is pretty clear that you are anti-amtrak, which isnt a problem, however your goal of inserting negative comments about the company just to be negative does seem to be a problem.--Kev62nesl 23:29, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It is not neutral to compare safety statistics which treat an automobile as the equivalent of an entire train.

<p>I got a response from a source at the DOT who gave me an updated number of 2902 BTU / passenger-mile.</p>
<p>Unforunately, BTS (the source in the article) has some other issues with its data. Transit buses are 15% more energy intensive than their numbers, as they did not include any fuel besides diesel when doing their analysis. The Transportation Energy Databook appears to be correct for this one. The remaining difference between the two sources is for light-duty trucks, and BTS appears to be correct as it uses more current data than the Transportation Energy Databook does.</p>
<p>In the end, I don't know which should be linked to, since both are somewhat lacking.</p>

<li>Well, I was able to dump it into an excel spreadsheet and it divided into two columns just fine--thanks for compiling this. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackensen_13da.html" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMackensen_e910.html" title="User talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 21:03, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
