<p>In November 2004 I had noticed that some of the information on the Australia article was incorrect. At the time your article claimed that the Head of State of Australia was an Indian Sikh and that the Prime Minister of Australia was really the Indian Prime Minister. I was only stating that there were errors and that it was not my place to correct them. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraig_goch20_fd9a.html" title="User:Draig goch20">Draig goch20</a> 17:11, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>In Early January 2005 I had noticed that someone had gone into the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> article and put "There is only one god, thats allah". That as many would know was incorrect as the Christians beleive in both Jehovah and Jesus.

<p>After being part of the editing community on here since 2003, I plan to finish editing on en.wikipedia.org in January 2006. My plan is to concentrate more on other wiki projects.

<dd>Is this why you want your user ID disabled? If you really want that, I'll see what I can do. It would be nice to have you full-time on the Welsh wikipedia, but there may be times you want to edit on the English, eg. if you create a new article and want to add the "cy" link. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a> 11:58, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not great practice to use an IP address for editing -- people who do that are often regarded with suspicion (and sadly, this is justified in many cases). I can understand your feelings -- it's true that the Welsh wikipedia is a much more pleasant environment to work in (although we do <i>occasionally</i> get "fandaliaeth"). Would it be any good if we just protected your user page and user talk page and left you as an inactive user, but with the option of returning? (I'm not sure if I'd be allowed to do that, but I'm also not sure if it'll be acceptable to delete your ID.) <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDeb_5525.html" title="User:Deb">Deb</a> 17:25, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Typical that people would prefer to make events like yesterdays a non War on Terrorism event because it happened in the UK. I think it is rediculous and that this is very well part of the WOT and the UK is very much involved in fighting terrorism. It's a different war, not a war of nations, it's a war of Nations vs Criminals, people who don't just rob their local bank or their corner shop, they kill millions of innocent people. I support this war on terrorism and hope that one day, we will defeat them. Yesterday is an example of that, and a victory for the police and security services of the UK, we deserve acknowledgment in our contribution to ending what could had been the largest terror attack since 9/11.</p>

<dd><i>they kill millions of innocent people.</i> WTF? when the yanks invaded afganistan and iraq they killed tens of thousands of <b>innocent civilians</b>. the yanks call this collateral damage, but this is bull shit, its called murdering tens of thousands of people. <b>al qaeda was created by CIA</b>. trained, funded, they even activly provided intellegence. so i think the yanks should just go and hug their <b>forner friends</b>. and since all you yanks are so christian why dont you turn the other cheek.

<p>Yes, your page can be protected, but for some reason this practice is frowned on. That's why <i>my</i> user page is such a mess - I stopped using it because other people decided I shouldn't protect it. If you <i>have</i> had incidents of your page being vandalized, then you can justify protecting it - but if you haven't, then someone will probably take it upon themselves to unprotect it in the future.

I have written to them before re: weather or no Wales is a principality and they were quick in their response.

<dd>Thanks for your message. Lenincymru2007 is a new contributor and potentially has much to contribute to Wikipedia. I need to try and find a way to work productively with him and to convey that, where something has been well sourced (e.g from reliable academic sources as you suggest), there needs to be a proper reason (i.e beyond his general feeling that he doesn't like it) for it to be removed or edited. His input into the Plaid Cymru article has obliged me to do more reading, research into the party's history and improve the article; now that I have I find it more than a little frustrating to find him dumping my meticulously sourced references because he misguidedly thinks they show the party in a bad light (as if that was ever the criteria). To that end, I would value enormously someone who could give a view on whether some or all of the disputed edits should stand. Can you help? <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENormalmouth_757b.html" title="User:Normalmouth">Normalmouth</a> 22:12, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
