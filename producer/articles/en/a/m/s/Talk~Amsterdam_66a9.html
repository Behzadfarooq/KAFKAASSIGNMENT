<p>is it allowed to smoke weed in amsterdam? i dont seem to find any info on dat&#160;:\ --84.47.112.56 21:40, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>you should read wikitravel on that. It is allowed but remember it is concerned to be very rude to cause inconvenience to others.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's actually not legally allowed to smoke weed in Holland (Amsterdam). Cannabis is still a forbidden substance under Dutch law. However the official policy (so not in a legal but a political sense) on softdrugs is to allow it (gedoogbeleid). This policy is that you can smoke weed in 'coffeeshops' (SO NOT ON THE STREET!!). The policy for coffeshops is also called the no- AHOY policy: no Advertising, no Harddrugs, no Overlast (crime) and no Youth.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I love in Amsterdam and I can't imagine the police bothering about someone smoking in the street. Indoors is a different matter. Of course coffeeshops (of this kind, so not 'coffeehouses') are ok, but in a cinema you can assume you'll be asked to leave if you're 'caught'. In bars, well, use your judgement. Or simply ask. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 05:46, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands (although the actual seat of government is in The Hague)</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>This is what the Dutch always say, but usually "capital" just means the seat of government. Capitals are sometimes boring places full of politicians, bureaucrats and lawyers, e.g., Sydney is not the capital of Australia. --195.149...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would disagree. "Capital" does not mean major city, that is true. But Amsterdam is declared as the capital in the Dutch constitution, while The Hague is "only" Seat of Government -- in contrast to Australia. By the way, after German re-unification in 1991, Berlin was declared capital, but became seat of government only after the administration finished moving there a few years ago. --<a href="../../../u/s/a/User%7EUsagiYojimbo_ec0b.html" title="User:UsagiYojimbo">UsagiYojimbo</a> 11:47 6 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not think there is anything wrong with these links. If you do not find them useful, simply do not click on them. They do not do any harm. If someone argues that he/she does not find it worth the effort to put these links I respect that (as long as they are not deleted). The term beach is relevant for Amsterdam, otherwise it would not have been mentioned. Now that it is mentioned somebody may decide that he/she wants to read about those in general. The link shows that there is an article on beaches and makes it also convenient to go there. --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick_7b47.html" title="User:Patrick">Patrick</a> 09:55 4 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I deleted 'The three Xs -St Andrew's crosses- represent the three virtues of the city: Valor, Resolution, and Mercy. '</p>
<p>I assume whoever wrote this is referring to the motto carried in the Amsterdam coat of arms. (Helhaftig, Barmhartig, Vastberaden) This motto was granted to Amsterdam by Queen Wilhelmina in 1947 in recognition of Amsterdam resistance efforts during WWII. Since the flag dates back far earlier, it is very unlikely that the crosses would refer to this motto. -- viezeric 13:01 21 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I've read, but can't remember where, that the three crosses represent the three things that have been the greatest threats to Amsterdam throughout the ages: Fire, Water and The Plague.</p>

<p>I'm done editing. I've left most of the content as I found it (and added only a few lines here and there to make things more clear) but the page is now very long. Maybe we could open separate entries for Amsterdam (history) and Amsterdam (tourist information)? And I think most information about the administrative changes in the 80s and 90s could be deleted. (or put in a seperate entry Amsterdam (administrative changes) )We should aim for something like the nl.wikipedia entry for amsterdam. Add categorys like geography, administration, economy, demograpics etc etc These could all be relatively short. When I've time (maybe during the holidays I'll have a look at it.) PS we should remove all links to tourist information. It is hard to explain why some links are allowed and others not.

<p>I am a bit confused by this statement located under "Nightlife".

<p>Hello! Finally found out why I couldn't insert a link to my site Amsterdam Hotspots. I'm not really sure how to add a comment here, but I'll try my best. It seems you feel Amsterdam Hotspots is a commercial site, and furthermore it seems that 'commercial sites' do not deserve to be mentioned. Amsterdam Hotspots is an online guide to Amsterdam which covers pretty much the same topics as any printed guidebook, the difference of course being that the information is always up to date, and that it is possible to interact with other visitors to the site. If you think the site is about hotel bookings only, please take some time to browse the site, you will find that it gives a comprehensive overview of things to do in Amsterdam, for visitors and residents alike. As such I think it would deserve to be mentioned on the Wikipedia page about Amsterdam. It's not possible to determine beforehand what kind of info visitors to this page are looking for, is it? If the site was about hotel bookings only I could understand you banning the site, but in reality the hotel bookings facility is a really minor portion of the content. I'd like to hear your thoughts about this... [62.195.252.195 5 April 2005 11:41]</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry for the long delay in answering your questions.. I just saw your comments today. The reason why I delete the link is just as you say: Amsterdam Hotspots is a webpage with touristguide information.

<dd>I thought I saw something about the setting up of a tourist-guide book wiki about a month or so ago, but now I cannot find any reference to it. Either I was mistaken, or it was a dead project idea that has floated off somewhere.

<p>Amsterdam has a lot of homeless psychiatric patients (zwerfgekken). I say this is a result of government policy. A quote to support this view:</p>
<p>"Je kunt de toename van het aantal zwervende psychiatrische patiënten in stad en land voor een groot deel verklaren uit het beleid. Dat is erop gericht de rol van de psychiatrische klinieken te verkleinen. Maar beleid- makers en financiers lijken zich over de toename van de 'zwerfgekken' te verbazen en zoeken de oorzaak bij een veranderende samenleving. De oplossing die ze kiezen is de rol van de klinische psychiatrie nog verder te verkleinen, wat natuurlijk averechts werkt. De vraag is wie er voor de echte gekken zorgt. Er moeten meer plaatsen in klinieken komen voor die laatste groep." -G.R. Van den Berg, directeur behandelzaken van het Psychiatrisch Ziekenhuis Amsterdam. --<a href="../../../p/r/a/User%7EPrater_a281.html" title="User:Prater">Prater</a> 10:41, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>"Well, as a family member of a former psychiatric patient I know how hard it is to get someone commited against their own will. A large share of the 'zwergekken' are people who could be helped, but don't want to get help. I'm not fond of the current government policy, but to just blame it on them isn't completely fair. Maybe the text should be changed to include both explanations? --<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmyShelter_d4c0.html" title="User:JimmyShelter">JimmyShelter</a> 10:51, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes it's not government policy or a lack of funding that is to blame but new treatment (well not really new. It started in the 70s) methods for psychiatric patients. If I remember correctly the present situation is that the mayor has to sign an order to lock someone up against his/her will. Last year a new center was opened where people could be held and treated for a short period of time. It had to close again soon after it opened because of fire regulaions? or something like that (I don't remeber the exact details).</dd>

<dd>I think it's better if you write a seperate article Amsterdam (tourist attractions) and not post links (even to the official vvv site) to sites that are trying to make you spend money in Amsterdam. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and not a tourist guide. More, this site is not intended as a free advertisment spot for hotels and bars in Amsterdam. If they want costumors they can find other ways of getting them. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardon_4cd9.html" title="User:Chardon">chardon</a></dd>

<p>I'm not sure what gave you the misconception that I want to turn this into some kind of advertisement for Amsterdam, or for hotels and bars trying to reach "costumors". I was just using the Tourist Attractions section as an example as to how to make the article better. Also, I don't see any problem with having the VVV site there. It's not like the people who made www.amsterdam.nl don't want you to spend money in Amsterdam. So why don't you delete that too? Also, you can list tourist attractions without it being an advertisement for some company or other. As for making a separate page for Tourist Attractions, I like having all the information in one place, rather than spreading it out in to different pages. But that's just me. If you would like to create a page like that, go ahead. -<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBig_Brother_is_Watching_4781.html" title="User:Big Brother is Watching">Big Brother is Watching</a></p>

<p>There seems to be some disagreement about the number of tram and metro/light rail lines in Amsterdam. I always thought there was one (the line to Amstelveen). However the website of the gvb doesn't mention light rail at all (<a href="http://www.gvb.nl/overgvb/feitenencijfers/vervoerscijfers.html" class="external free" title="http://www.gvb.nl/overgvb/feitenencijfers/vervoerscijfers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gvb.nl/overgvb/feitenencijfers/vervoerscijfers.html</a>). Perhaps we should reflect this in the PT section and give Amsterdam 4 metro lines.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The carriages may look different, but they run on the same tracks (except for the Amstelveen extension, which only gets trams I believe). The question is what a line is. Is it defined by the carriages, the routes, the tracks or the usage? There are four routes, one of which is a 'lightrail', but it runs over metro tracks for more than half the way (I don't know if a metro could run on a <i>light</i>rail track; the name suggests otherwise). From the track point of view one could say there is an almost complete circle with two branches (of which one forks once more). And from the usage point of view there is no distinction between metro and lightrail. I'm not sure, but I suppose the routes define a line. So then there there would be 3 metro lines and 1 lightrail line, although the <a href="http://www.gvb.nl/reizigers/plattegronden/metrokaart.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gvb.nl/reizigers/plattegronden/metrokaart.html" rel="nofollow">gvb map</a> doesn't make that distinction. But the article states there are 2 lightrails. I have no idea what might be meant by that. <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 07:08, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some of my comment seems to have disappeared. I meant to say that I always thought there are 3 metrolines and 1 lightrail line. Like you I have no idea what the second lightrail line could be (perhaps the new tram to IJburg?). Anyway I suggest we follow the GVB and give Amsterdam 4 metrolines and no light rail lines. It was mostly a political decision anyway to call the line to Amstelveen light rail as a consequence of the problems during the building of the first 2 metro lines.</dd>

<dd>The tram (which is a tram...) to IJburg is mentioned separately, but that can be caused by different editors. I'd say the '2 lightrails' can go. And if the metro could run on the Amstelveen line I'd agree with you about the 4 metro lines. But it doesn't (I believe) and if it can't that means the lightrail is really different. Then again that's a rather technical distinction. What about '4 metro lines, one of which is a lightrail'? <a href="../../../d/i/r/User%7EDirkvdM_f079.html" title="User:DirkvdM">DirkvdM</a> 07:40, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The old metro carriages used on line 53 and 54 can't use the track to Amstelveen. They are to wide. The 'new' carriages for line 50 can use the track to Amstelveen. I think they only called this line a sneltram for political reasons and not for any technical differences (except platform width and third rail/overhead power) from the original metro.

<p>To quote "wikipedia is not a travel guide so link to weather is unnecessary". I disagree. I know it's not a travel guide but it is just convenient to have it linked.

<dd>I have just looked fhrough the list of featured articles on cities, and my impression is that most of them do not have weather links. In fact, of the two that you point out, Seattle did not contain a weather link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Seattle%2C_Washington&amp;oldid=11221801" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Seattle%2C_Washington&amp;oldid=11221801" rel="nofollow">at the time that it gained featured status</a>. Anyway, regardless of whether other articles include such links or not, I would argue that such a link is outside of the types of external links suggested at <a href="../../../e/l/_/WP%7EEL_7814.html" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a>. <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremyA_6669.html" title="User:JeremyA">JeremyA</a> 06:18, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Perhaps you saw pedals - not - moving, or moving a bit backwards.

<p>The Van Halen Bros are Dutch allright, but not from Amsterdam. Van Gogh stayed in Amsterdam for a short period, but calling him a famous Amsterdammer seems out of proportion.

<dd>The dead criterium was to keep footballers and pop singers from the list. Johand Cruyff should be on the list though.

<dd>I don't think we necessarily need to define specific criteria.

<dd>The decision to add or delete someone to the list of famous amsterdammers is always based on criteria. Better to have clear guidelines for adding or deleting a name or we will have the same discussion over and over again. There are more then 10 famous amsterdammers but should there be more then 10 on this page? I agree with you that if the list gets to big it wuld be better to create a seperate page for the subject. How many is to many is open for discussion. I picked 10 because it's a nice number, not for any particular reason. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChardon_4cd9.html" title="User:Chardon">Chardon</a> 19:40, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Unfortunately, one place it really can't go is in one of those nice Wikiquote ref boxes, because there's no WQ page on Amsterdam, and current WQ style is to try to keep themes on author pages.

<p>I'm wondering - is there any story as to why Amsterdam is the officially designated capital of the Netherlands, in spite of the fact that it has never been the seat of government, and was never intended to be? Ever since the Dutch Republic was established in the 16th century, the seat of government has been at the Hague. Why so much hating on the Hague? It's bad enough to be the seat of government and not the major city. It must seriously suck when you're not even <i>called</i> the capital, in spite of having been the seat of government for more than 400 years. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 00:48, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To put one thing straight first: Amsterdam <b>has</b> been the seat of government once, between 1808 and 1810 King Lodewijk Napoleon made Amsterdam his seat of government and capitol. An important reason for the role as capitol of Amsterdam is that this is the city where the king gets crowned. There are several other reasons for Amsterdam as capitol, but I can assure you none of them is hatred agains The Hague. The whole thing is not an issue in The Netherlands. <a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomedae_bf2b.html" title="User:Lomedae"><font color="#0000CC">L</font><font color="#0033CC">o</font><font color="#0066CC">m</font><font color="#0066FF">e</font><font color="#0099CC">d</font><font color="#00CCCC">a</font><font color="#00CCFF">e</font></a>&#160;<a href="../../../l/o/m/User_talk%7ELomedae_0349.html" title="User talk:Lomedae"><font color="#3399FF"><sup>talk</sup></font></a> 00:54, August 3, 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It was never the seat of government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Nor of the state which existed between 1581 and 1795, the United Provinces, nor of the state which succeeded it, the Batavian Republic. It was very briefly the capital of the very short-lived Kingdom of Holland. It seems to me that my version was more true than false. I will change it, though. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john k</a> 01:14, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Photo-caption: <i>Leaning buildings are common in Amsterdam due to settling of the soft ground and fill underneath.</i></p>
<p>Rather stange the buildings would always lean forward. The reason i know is that while most 'grachtenpand' (canal-buiding) were storage-houses for trade, they all had a 'hijsbalk' (crane) on top. To operate the crane it would be very difficult if the building were reclining or straight. So they build them leaning forward. regards <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAleichem_ac9c.html" title="User:Aleichem">Aleichem</a> 10:50, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I note that someone (I didn't catch the name) removed an entry from the list of famous Amsterdammers. I wish to point out what it is that is being done with this list, and all the others I am working on.</p>
<p>What I am doing is basically adding the name of every person, whether or not they already have a page, from a biographical dictionary I have before me to the list of residents of his area of birth. <b>By definition</b>, every person from this book qualifies as importance enough for their own article. In this case, however, that article has yet to be created. That, however, does not mean that they are not "important" enough to have their own article, simply that it has not yet been created. I will also be adding the names of every other resident from this book and its successor volumes, whether they have an article already or not, to the lists here and elsewhere. If, as I think likely, it means that some of these lists will probably become so long that they require their own page, it's probably better having it as a separate page including a section of minimal stub data on those who do not yet have their own pages than having a huge number of separate stubs with only a sentence or two of content. Also, by having them on the resident page or section, it makes anyone who sees the entry, most of whom will probably be interested in the town to some degree and have access to info about the town and its people, see that a page does not yet exist for this person and possibily stimulate them to create a separate page, probably with more data than I have available to me from my source. Also, I call to mind that, in accord with wikipedia guidelines, those entries actually had specific individual references.</p>
<p>Clearly, the individuals who have been removed <b>do</b> qualify as important enough for their own articles; they just haven't <b>gotten</b> them yet. And, if the only real data available on them is the minimal data I presented, we might be better off if that data were included in a short list, rather than having an ever expanding proliferation of mini-stubs. I sincerely hope that the person who saw fit to remove the individuals from the list reconsiders that action. If s/he does, I believe that they will reach the same conclusion I did, that they do qualify at least for reference in the list. I shall continue to add details and reference for the names on this list for a while; however, I may reconsider that in the near future at any time if this kind of summary judgement continues. I sincerely await a response. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 16:16, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So basically we would end up with a list of notable people born in Amsterdam? Wouldn't a category be better for that? Personally I don't find it necessary to have such a list. Even in this article I don't find it really necessary, but at least the list is small and is (should) only be for really notable people born in Amsterdam. Rembrand for instance. Not for every person born in Amsterdam who has (or should have) a wikipedia article. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarion96_c83d.html" title="User:Garion96">Garion96</a> <a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarion96_d01f.html" title="User talk:Garion96">(talk)</a> 19:37, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

Their reasoning was explained in this small statement in the introduction:</p>
<p>The evolution of the European Union (EU) from a regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to today's supranational organization of 25 countries across the European continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the annals of history... ... for such a large number of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching entity is truly unique... ... the EU ... has many of the attributes associated with independent nations: its own flag, anthem, founding date, and currency, as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy in its dealings with other nations. In the future, many of these nation-like characteristics are likely to be expanded. Thus, inclusion of basic intelligence on the EU has been deemed appropriate as a new, separate entity in The World Factbook. However, because of the EU's special status, this description is placed after the regular country entries.</p>
<p>I might add that EU citizens have EU- numberplates, -passports, drivinglicense, the EU institutions, and regular election.

I'll try to bike around a bit and find the exact location, but if anyone else knows, that'd be great. --<a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrator_bbf9.html" title="User:Krator">User:Krator</a> (<a href="../../../k/r/a/User_talk%7EKrator_7c0e.html" title="User talk:Krator">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Krator_5c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Krator">c</a>) 09:47, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The church is De Duif at the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prinsengracht.html" title="Prinsengracht">Prinsengracht</a> number 756, near <a href="../../../r/e/m/Rembrandtplein.html" title="Rembrandtplein">Rembrandtplein</a>, which is clearly not the <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordaan.html" title="Jordaan">Jordaan</a>. Apart from this, I'm not sure whether this image is representative of the <i>skyline</i> of Amsterdam, because almost all you can see are trees. If I can find one, I would like to replace it with another good quality image of the skyline of Amsterdam. – <a href="../../../i/l/s/User%7EIlse%40_2e80.html" title="User:Ilse@">Ilse</a><a href="../../../i/l/s/User_talk%7EIlse%40_913e.html" title="User talk:Ilse@">@</a> 17:05, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
