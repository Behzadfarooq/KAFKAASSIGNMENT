<p>Amstrad Action, known in the CPC community as <b>AA</b>, had the longest lifetime of any <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amstrad.html" title="Amstrad">Amstrad</a> magazine, running from October 1985 until June 1995 and producing 117 issues in total (although Issue 117 features a "Next Month" box which suggests that the decision to end the magazine was a last-minute decision). The magazine was still being published long after the CPC had ceased production and games were no longer available in the shops. This is believed to have been due mainly to the fondness with which the title was regarded by its publisher.</p>

<p><i><b>"So here it is at last - the real <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amstrad.html" title="Amstrad">Amstrad</a> magazine. The one you’ve been waiting for all this time. The one they never had in the newsagent’s. Until now."</b></i> - <i>Peter Connor, Editor (AA1, October 1985)</i>.</p>
<p>Published by <a href="../../../f/u/t/Future_Publishing_7150.html" title="Future Publishing">Future Publishing</a>, a company set up by <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Anderson_%28TED%29_6c83.html" title="Chris Anderson (TED)">Chris Anderson</a> (ex-Personal Computer Games and <a href="../../../z/z/a/Zzap_64.html" title="Zzap 64">Zzap 64</a> editor). Launch Editor, Peter Connor, also an ex-PCG staff member, shared the writing duties with the only other staff writer, Bob Wade. Bob, another ex-PCG/Zzap! 64, was given the title ‘<a href="../../../s/o/f/Software.html" title="Software">Software</a> Editor’ and would review the vast majority of the games featured, with Peter given a second opinion. Trevor Gilham, Art Editor, would complete the four man team.</p>
<p>Issue 1 dated <a href="../../../o/c/t/October.html" title="October">October</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> was released in <a href="../../../s/e/p/September.html" title="September">September</a> <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> with the cover price of £1; 1 pence for every one of the 100 pages. Some of the long lasting familiar features were present even back then; Amscene, Cheat mode, Action Test and even The Pilgrim was there with his Adventure pages. Apart from games there was the other side to AA, sometimes tagged as ‘serious’; <a href="../../../p/r/o/Programming.html" title="Programming">programming</a>, business <a href="../../../s/o/f/Software.html" title="Software">software</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_hardware.html" title="Computer hardware">computer hardware</a> features.</p>
<p>The review approach included a main write up, a second opinion box, a good news / bad news comparison list and the percentages. Percentages were given to Graphics, Sonics, Grab Factor, Staying Power and an overall AA Rating. High rated games of 80% and above were given an ‘AA Rave’ accolade, while the highest rated game of the month received the ‘Mastergame’ award. The first game to receive a ‘Mastergame’ award was <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_House_fa1c.html" title="Melbourne House">Melbourne House</a>’s ‘The Way Of The Exploding Fist’, gaining an impressive 94% AA Rating.</p>
<p>Although it took the new publication a few issues to find it's audience, the circulation figures grew rapidly and the most popular publisher was born.</p>
<p>A bumper 116 page Christmas 1985 issue 4, priced £1.50, included a cover mounted tape with two games; a first for any computing magazine. The games featured included two unreleased <a href="../../../o/c/e/Ocean_Software_67cc.html" title="Ocean Software">Ocean</a> titles Kung Fu and Number 1.</p>
<p>Although not credited as such, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Anderson_%28TED%29_6c83.html" title="Chris Anderson (TED)">Chris Anderson</a> took charge of issue 9’s editorial duties in-between the editor changeover.</p>

<p><i><b>"I’ve watched it grow from a pretty amateurish first issue into a very professional, entertaining mag. It also started the whole of <a href="../../../f/u/t/Future_Publishing_7150.html" title="Future Publishing">Future Publishing</a> going, which now boasts six impressive titles - all the envy of many rival publishers."</b></i> - <i>Bob Wade, Editor, July 1988.</i></p>
<p>February 1987 and a slight shuffle in personnel as Bob Wade moves up to Editor.</p>
<p>March '87's issue has a fresh, much tidier and more professional look. The reviews underwent a minor change, the biggest change being the modification of the Ratings box to include comments on each rating, good or bad.</p>
<p><i>‘Welcome <a href="../../../a/m/t/Amtix%21.html" title="Amtix!">Amtix!</a> readers’</i> states Bob Wade in his May '87 editorial, which relates to the demise of an <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amstrad.html" title="Amstrad">Amstrad</a> publication. <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsfield.html" title="Newsfield">Newsfield</a>’s <a href="../../../a/m/t/Amtix%21.html" title="Amtix!">Amtix!</a>, which, like it’s <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crash.html" title="Crash">Crash</a> And <a href="../../../z/z/a/Zzap_64.html" title="Zzap 64">Zzap 64</a> publications, concentrated on gaming only, ceased after 18 issues.</p>
<p>July 1988 is the last time Bob Wade appears on the AA pages. He’s off to work for sister magazine <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advanced_Computer_Entertainment_561d.html" title="Advanced Computer Entertainment">Advanced Computer Entertainment</a> (ACE).</p>

<p><i><b>"Let’s come clean about Last Ninja 2: we looked at it, and decided it was the biggest load of old rubbish since Psycho Pigs UXB..."</b></i> - <i>Steve Carey, Editor, AA49, October 1989.</i></p>
<p>Steve Carey arrives as the new editor for the August '88 issue. <a href="../../../t/a/r/Target_Renegade_8938.html" title="Target Renegade">Target Renegade</a>, from <a href="../../../i/m/a/Imagine_Software_1103.html" title="Imagine Software">Imagine Software</a> becomes the lowest rated Mastergame; receiving a 86% overall rating. Quite why it is awarded a Mastergame was not explained and remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Issue 35 again? A printing error has AA36 numbered as 35 on the front cover.</p>
<p>AA38 is the first issue not to award any game the Mastergame accolade. Apparently there were no games worthy of the award that month.</p>
<p>AA40 - Christmas issue and another cover tape. <i>"Goodbye CPCC"</i> states Steve’s editorial. The CPC Computing circulation figures had fallen for the last time as it merges into <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amstrad_Computer_User_f31c.html" title="Amstrad Computer User">Amstrad Computer User</a>, the official publication. This latest fall of a rival magazine title made AA the only independent magazine on the newsstand at the time.</p>
<p>Steve Carey introduces new games reviewer (credited as Staff Writer) Trenton Webb in June 89's issue 45, which includes the big football special issue; football games reviewed (<a href="../../../e/m/l/Emlyn_Hughes_International_Soccer_be37.html" title="Emlyn Hughes International Soccer">Emlyn Hughes International Soccer</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Lineker_6cdc.html" title="Gary Lineker">Gary Lineker</a>’s Hot Shot!, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microprose.html" title="Microprose">Microprose</a> Soccer and Streetgang Football). The football feature aslo includes league tables with past football games. <a href="../../../a/u/d/Audiogenic.html" title="Audiogenic">Audiogenic</a> wins the AA Mastergame award with their <a href="../../../e/m/l/Emlyn_Hughes_8880.html" title="Emlyn Hughes">Emlyn Hughes</a> game and a 93% overall rating.</p>
<p>October 1989 and AA’s fourth birthday with another cover tape giveaway. A playable demo of the excellent arcade game <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shinobi_%28arcade_game%29.html" title="Shinobi (arcade game)">Shinobi</a> from <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Interactive_cb76.html" title="Virgin Interactive">Virgin Interactive</a>, plus the usual extra tools and utilities. The infamous independent attitude of AA displayed itself in the reply to a letter about the lack of Last Ninja 2 / Robocop reviews; <i>"let’s come clean about Last Ninja 2: we looked at it, and decided it was the biggest load of old rubbish since Psycho Pigs UXB, and that we’d much rather review some better games. As for Robocop, which incidentally we liked very much, we had such problems getting a review copy out of Ocean at the time that we thought, ‘Stuff ‘em, we’ll review something else.’"</i> <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laser_Squad_345c.html" title="Laser Squad">Laser Squad</a> by Blade Software, which has been mentioned many times as being an AA staff favourite, is awarded the Mastergame accolade with a 91% rating.</p>
<p>November '89 introduces the new Technical Editor, Adam Waring; and Steve Carey announces that this issue (AA50) will be the last that he will edit. He is moving on to edit <a href="../../../s/t/_/ST_Format_ade1.html" title="ST Format">ST Format</a>.</p>

<p>December 1989 and Rod Lawton arrives as the new editor for AA51.</p>
<p>March 1990 and the mysterious lost Mastergame that would be <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chase_HQ_fc4d.html" title="Chase HQ">Chase HQ</a>. The <a href="../../../o/c/e/Ocean_Software_67cc.html" title="Ocean Software">Ocean</a> <a href="../../../a/r/c/Arcade_game.html" title="Arcade game">arcade game</a> conversion received a score of 90%, coupled with being the highest rated game this issue. This would normally justify the Mastergame accolade, however the game only got an AA Rave accolade and no explanation or corrections were made since.</p>
<p>June 1990's AA57 is the first issue to award the Mastergame accolade to more than one game; <a href="../../../e/-/m/E-Motion_4d23.html" title="E-Motion">E-Motion</a> by <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Gold_0979.html" title="US Gold">US Gold</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turrican.html" title="Turrican">Turrican</a> by <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rainbow_Arts_8599.html" title="Rainbow Arts">Rainbow Arts</a> received ratings of 92% and 90% respectively.</p>
<p>AA60 and the new <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amstrad.html" title="Amstrad">Amstrad</a> range have arrived. AA has an in depth look at the new machines; the <a href="../../../a/m/s/Amstrad_GX4000_880e.html" title="Amstrad GX4000">Amstrad GX4000</a> console, the 464 Plus and the 6128 Plus. Trenton Webb disappears; to write for another <a href="../../../f/u/t/Future_Publishing_7150.html" title="Future Publishing">Future</a> publication; while James Leach takes the vacant Staff Writer position.</p>
<p>November 1990 and <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Dangerous_2_402a.html" title="Rick Dangerous 2">Rick Dangerous 2</a> receives the highest rating so far. The MicroStyle game gains a MasterGame award and an AA Rating of 97%.</p>
<p>All change for February 1990's issue 65; Art Editor Ollie Olderton and Staff Writer James Leach leave and Paul Morgan and Frank O’Connor take their vacant positions respectively.</p>
<p>AA finally gives in to reader’s pleas to have a permanent cover tape. An announcement is made, in AA66, that the following issue will, not only contain a cover tape, but contain more colour and be printed on different paper. Review pages are also slightly re-designed.</p>
<p>As announced in the previous issue, AA67, dated April 1990, comes with the first of the permanent cover tapes called Action Pack #1, along with a new cover price of £2.20. A playable demo of <a href="../../../o/c/e/Ocean_Software_67cc.html" title="Ocean Software">Ocean Software</a>'s Total Recall and complete games Hydrofool and <a href="../../../c/o/d/Codemasters.html" title="Codemasters">Codemasters</a>' <a href="../../../d/i/z/Dizzy.html" title="Dizzy">Dizzy</a> are included on the tape.</p>
<p>September 1991's AA72 and another change in personnel; Frank O’Connor leaves to go to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_and_Video_Games_%28magazine%29_e5ff.html" title="Computer and Video Games (magazine)">CVG</a> while Adam Peters comes in as the new staff writer.</p>

<p>April 1992 and the ABC (<a href="../../../a/u/d/Audit_Bureau_of_Circulation_b660.html" title="Audit Bureau of Circulation">Audit Bureau of Circulation</a>) figures show, yet another, increase - 37,120.

Following issues would dispense with AA Rave and Mastergame accolades. <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemmings_%28video_game%29.html" title="Lemmings (video game)">Lemmings</a> joins <a href="../../../r/i/c/Rick_Dangerous_2_402a.html" title="Rick Dangerous 2">Rick Dangerous 2</a> as gaining the highest AA rating given during it's publication.</p>
<p>AA83 and Staff Writer Adam Waring is leaving, which leaves the AA official editorial staff at two; Rod Lawton and Adam Peters.</p>
<p>Januray 1993 and another revamp of the reviews section. <a href="../../../y/o/u/Your_Sinclair_0ae1.html" title="Your Sinclair">Your Sinclair</a>’s editorial staff are shown in the Power Up intro section. Linda Barker, again, Rich Pelley and Jon Pillar share the games review credits. The first time that the official AA editorial staff had not written any of the games reviews.</p>
<p>After 39 issues of editing AA, a record that was never beaten, it is announced that issue 89, February 1993, will be Rod Lawton’s last. Replacing him as editor will be Linda Barker. Staff Writer Adam Peters also has left. Introduced this issue is new staff writer Simon Forrester, a self taught programmer and an AA reader since issue 10. Jonathan Nash (previously known as Jon Pillar) continues to contribute to the games reviews section.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/s/Amstrad_Action_419f.html" title="Edit section: 100 AA’s - March 1993 to April 1994">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">100 AA’s - March 1993 to April 1994</span></h3>
<p>March 1993's issue 90 features the first highest rated game not to receive an AA accolade. <a href="../../../n/i/g/Nigel_Mansell_56a3.html" title="Nigel Mansell">Nigel Mansell</a>’s World Championship gets an overall rating of 93%, but no accolade of either Rave or Mastergame. The long standing AA signature accolade has been discarded. Following the departure of longest serving editor, Rod Lawton, the shortest serving editor, Linda Barker (one issue as editor), has left, leaving the way for the brand new Acting Editor, Tim Norris. <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_II_60e4.html" title="Street Fighter II">Street Fighter II</a> is mentioned in the Next Month column.</p>
<p>May 1993, AA92, publishes the ABC figures for <a href="../../../j/u/l/July.html" title="July">July</a> 92 - <a href="../../../j/a/n/January.html" title="January">January</a> 93, a fall from previous figures, 27,090, surely shows that AA’s future looks doubtful. <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_II_60e4.html" title="Street Fighter II">Street Fighter II</a> is, again, mentioned in the Next Month column.</p>
<p>AA93 and Tim Norris is still credited as Acting Editor (eventually earning the Editor title in AA94) and <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_II_60e4.html" title="Street Fighter II">Street Fighter II</a> is, yet again, mentioned in the Next Month column. <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_II_60e4.html" title="Street Fighter II">Street Fighter II</a> even features on the front of AA95 and included inside is a ‘story so far’ write up.</p>
<p>September 1993's AA96 issue acquires it's ninth editor, Dave Golder. It was always on the cards, AA96 is the first issue not to include a review for any new games release. All reviews featured are re-released budget games.</p>
<p>December 1993 AA99’s Serious Action cover tape includes the complete game, albeit a censored version, of <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormlord.html" title="Stormlord">Stormlord</a>. With the self-censoring of the Hewson, now known as <a href="../../../h/e/w/Hewson_Consultants_8407.html" title="Hewson Consultants">Hewson</a>, game, it seems that AA is trying to avoid similar controversy that followed the inclusion of How To Be A Complete Bastard way back in AA68’s Action Pack #2. <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_II_60e4.html" title="Street Fighter II">Street Fighter II</a> is promised to be completed and ready for review in AA100.</p>
<p>AA is 100 and one of the very few dedicated games mags to reach such a feat. Voted the best game on the CPC, <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firebird.html" title="Firebird">Firebird</a>'s <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elite_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Elite (computer game)">Elite</a> is the complete game given away in the Serious Action cover tape. News announced is that the long awaited <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_II_60e4.html" title="Street Fighter II">Street Fighter II</a> has been abandoned. According to <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Gold_0979.html" title="US Gold">US Gold</a> there were no plans to release a CPC version and that any previous release date given was a clerical error. AA looks at the top 100 products for the CPC and also a trip down memory lane, including past editors and staff.</p>

<p>As circulation figures wind down further still there is a drastic drop in page numbers from 60 to 36 in July 1994's AA106. More compact issues mean no superfluous columns or features.</p>
<p>AA107 becomes the first issue with only one member of official staff. Simon Forrester and others are credited as occasional contributors.</p>
<p>November 1994's AA110 and Tim Norris is back to cover as Editor as Dave Golder has left to edit Ultimate Future Games.</p>
<p>AA111 and no Credits list, although we can deduct that the new editor is Karen Levell, who answers the Reaction letters and confirms her appointment as editor.</p>
<p>June 1995 and although everything appears as normal in AA117 and, though AA118 is advertised in the next month box, this is the last AA ever. 24 pages of Features, news, Reaction come to an end. Costing £3.25 on it’s way out, AA will always be remembered as the first title published by Future and as a trend setter.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/s/Amstrad_Action_419f.html" title="Edit section: Cover Tapes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Cover Tapes</span></h2>
<p>AA was the first magazine in the world to <a href="../../../c/o/v/Covermount.html" title="Covermount">covermount</a> software cassettes, beating <i><a href="../../../y/o/u/Your_Sinclair_0ae1.html" title="Your Sinclair">Your Sinclair</a></i> to the honour by a matter of months. The first cover-mounted cassette appeared on issue 4, but were not a regular feature until later in the magazine's life. The cover-cassettes featured <a href="../../../g/a/m/Game_demo.html" title="Game demo">game demos</a>, miscellaneous free software and, in some instances, complete games. Due to the low quality of the cassettes used many Amstrad owners found them to be unreliable, something which was commonly reflected in the letters pages. One solution to fixing the unreliable tapes as posted to the letters section was to unwind the tape and put a warm iron on it!</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/s/Amstrad_Action_419f.html" title="Edit section: Editorial staff">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Editorial staff</span></h2>
<p>Memorable staff included Bob Wade, Richard Monteiro, Steve Carey, Rod "The Beard" Lawton, Trenton Webb, James Leach, Frank O'Connor and Adam Waring. Adam had written several games himself, for which, if one came up for review upon re-release, he would gracefully be allowed to write a second opinion. Later editorial staff included Simon Forrester, whose magazine nickname/handle was "The Hairy One", "The Hairy Happening" or often just "Hairy". Simon had written various programs himself for the platform and was known to jump down the throats of people who didn't agree with his fondness for the computer game <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chuckie_Egg_5fc2.html" title="Chuckie Egg">Chuckie Egg</a>.</p>

<p>Long-running features included <i>Forum</i>, for technically-minded CPC users; <i>Action Test</i>, for games reviews; and <i>Cheat Mode</i>, containing game <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walkthrough.html" title="Walkthrough">walkthroughs</a>, maps, hints and cheats. The readers letters were answered in the <i>Reaction</i> section, where numerous arguments and, usually good natured, humour was found. <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interactive_fiction.html" title="Interactive fiction">Interactive fiction</a> was covered by "The Pilgrim" and later "<a href="../../../b/a/l/Balrog.html" title="Balrog">Balrog</a>" and "The Examiner".</p>
<p>One popular feature of <i><b>AA</b></i> was the <a href="../../../t/y/p/Type-in_program.html" title="Type-in program">Type-In</a> section. This itself split the readership over whether the programs should be put on the covertape instead. Over a six month period this is what happened, until this practice (and ultimately the Type-Ins section) was abandoned due to space restrictions.</p>
<p>As activity in the Amstrad world declined, the editorial staff, and editorial content, was constantly being reduced and the magazine adopted an increasingly eccentric style, with one edition in particular featuring an eight-page script for a Christmas pantomime. Later on, a double spread review for the 2nd <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teenage_Mutant_Hero_Turtles_fba2.html" title="Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles">Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles</a> game was split between the review itself and bizarre transcribed interview between Rod Lawton and Adam Peters (pretending to be one of the turtles). Peters would usually try and promote his band in some way (he featured on the cover of 'music orientated' issue and had one of his techno-MIDI band's songs on the covertape). The magazine is also notable for pioneering the kind of responses - sometimes dry, sometimes surreal, usually humorous and mildly rude - to readers' letters of a form now seen throughout UK gaming magazine culture. These characteristics, for many readers, added to AA's charm.</p>

<p>Initially only the best rated game of the month earned an <i>AA Mastergame</i> accolade, but from issue 57 this was changed to all games that received a 90% or higher rating. Games receiving 80-90% were awarded an <i>AA Rave</i>. Publishers of CPC games such as <a href="../../../a/c/t/Activision.html" title="Activision">Activision</a>, <a href="../../../o/c/e/Ocean_Software_67cc.html" title="Ocean Software">Ocean</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infogrames.html" title="Infogrames">Infogrames</a> proudly mounted these awards on their packaging to promote their games to potential customers.</p>

<p>At the height of its popularity, <i><a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_Fighter_II_60e4.html" title="Street Fighter II">Street Fighter II</a></i> was released on the <a href="../../../1/6/-/16-bit.html" title="16-bit">16-bit</a> computers by <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_Gold_0979.html" title="US Gold">US Gold</a>. However, in early press releases, the firm had stated that it would also be releasing <a href="../../../8/-/b/8-bit.html" title="8-bit">8-bit</a> versions of the game on all platforms. Eventually, however, only the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_64.html" title="Commodore 64">Commodore 64</a> and <a href="../../../z/x/_/ZX_Spectrum_4c8a.html" title="ZX Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> versions of the game were released.</p>
<p><i><b>AA</b></i> covered the saga for many months, as references to the CPC game were dropped from press releases and ultimately it was claimed to be a marketing error on the part of the copyright owners of the game. <i><b>AA</b></i> even made a special feature about the game in Issue 95. Once the game was confirmed as being cancelled, <i><b>AA</b></i> organised a mail-in petition to show that demand for the game existed. However, this had no effect.</p>
