<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/h/Talk%7EAmherst_College_e43f.html" title="Edit section: Pronunciation">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Pronunciation</span></h2>
<p>I've just removed the following paragraph from the entry:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Those in and around "Amherst" pronounce it without the "h" â€” Am'erst. However, "Amherst" is commonly pronounced as it is written, while Williams students and alumni often <i>emphasize</i> the "h" - "Am-<b>H</b>ERST".</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you poke through the history, you'll see that there's been a sentence resembling the first one in the entry for a few months. The current revision smells a lot like vandalism, particularly given the questionable NPOV of the author. (And, to be fair, my own.)</p>
<p>I'd like to hear opinions about including information on the pronunciation of the College's name. Given people's accents are parsed and used as a means for social inclusion/exclusion (see [shibboleth]) there's an argument to be made for including the accepted pronunciation as a service to outsiders (so they won't recieve a frosty correction - but the frosty correction itself is open to derision like that above.) <a href="../../../p/j/m/User%7EPjmorse_8d4d.html" title="User:Pjmorse">Pjmorse</a> 21:23, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I go to Amherst, so let me weigh in my opinion. Most people from Western Mass. call the town, and therefore the college, "Am'erst", and I've never heard an exception from a town local. Amherst College students all call Amherst College "Am'erst" (in fact, it's a very common campus joke) but most call UMass "UMass AmHerst", and some also call the town "AmHerst", but fewer than do so UMass. Most UMass students who are from the general area call the town "Am'erst", but most are from wider regions -- inside Mass, it can go either way. Anyone from anyway southwest of Mass invariably calls it "AmHerst" (in all three cases) unless they've been corrected by a local (not particularly likely) or a student/alum (more likely). No, I can't source this, but if you ask the vast majority of AC students, they'll all tell you the same thing. - <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_65d1.html" title="User:CheNuevara"><font color="darkblue">Che Nuevara:</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../c/h/e/User_talk%7ECheNuevara_5bc9.html" title="User talk:CheNuevara"><font color="red">Join</font></a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="darkgreen">the</font></a> <a href="../../../c/h/e/User%7ECheNuevara_navbar_e72b.html" title="User:CheNuevara/navbar"><font color="orange">Revolution</font></a></sup> 21:23, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's wording in the town article (<a href="../../../a/m/h/Amherst%2C_Massachusetts_d9bb.html" title="Amherst, Massachusetts">Amherst</a>) suggesting that this is a local pronunciation (i.e. the College gets it from the town) so I've added wording to that effect to the article. - <a href="../../../p/j/m/User%7EPjmorse_8d4d.html" title="User:Pjmorse">Pjmorse</a> 14:38, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Regarding the wording in the town article, it's not very authotitative. It has a <a href="http://www.amerst.com/about.php" class="external text" title="http://www.amerst.com/about.php" rel="nofollow">reference link</a> that doesn't really settle the issue. I've lived all my life in the town, so I'm fairly certain that the H is not pronounced, but it would be great if someone made some authoritative reference for it. Anyone in the college have any ideas? -<a href="../../../g/l/a/User%7EGlamdringCookies_beee.html" title="User:GlamdringCookies">GlamdringCookies</a> 03:48, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As one of those responsible for the referenced website, I'm amused.&#160;:) We're just two alums who weren't aware there was any question about the pronunciation.

<dd>The RC Orientation show used to have a running "The H is for the peasants" joke. The original (British) pronunciation is no doubt "Am'erst" ...

<p>I wonder if "notables" should include the children of famous people? Did these folks do anything to merit a mention, or is their presence more an indication of Amherst's cache? If the latter, I'd delete.</p>

<hr />
<p>I'm in favor of removing the "children of famous people" listings. Until they do something notable themselves, they don't necessarily reflect anything about the College the way its accomplished alumni do. They should also be allowed to make their own lives outside their parents' shadows. Here's who I've removed:</p>

<dd>Point taken, but that doesn't mean they add anything to one's understanding of the College, which I suppose is my point.

<dd>When you come right down to it, forking the Amherst alumnus listing might be a good idea, because it would allow more focus on the College itself. I only hesitated to do it in the past because the list still seemed fairly selective. But now with Keats and Baker, Cariani, etc., none of whom seem notable, much less famous (alongside Coolidge, Stone, Meredith, Turow), it might be time for a fork.</dd>

<p>Honestly, I'm going to keep reverting additions of "YoHo" in the water polo team name unless someone can explain to me why they, in fact, know the correct name.

<p>The name of the Water Polo team is the "Yo-Ho Penguins," not the "Penguins." I can give you no other reason for why this is the case than that I am a current member of the water polo team and, as such, I know what the team's name is.

<p>Emily Dickinson was not an alum of Amherst College, so it's odd to mention her in the first paragraph of the entry. There are many more illustrious alumni to mention off the bat, including Calvin Collidge, Daniel Webster, Francisco Flores, Harlan Fiske Stone, the Merrill and Smith that founded Merrill Lynch, etc.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Emily did attend Amherst Academy, but not the College (not coed at the time, obviously.) She spent a year (or less? A semester?) over the Notch at Mt. Holyoke, but then came home to be a recluse. So, you're right. Emily's grandfather was one of the College's founders, though.

<p>How about books in the basement of the AC library which say "Property of Williams College" in them? I've heard a lot of AC students mention them.

<dd>Those books are part of the myth. Anyway, any book that's been in the library since 1821 is most likely in Special Collections, not in the stacks of C-level. (Though that assertion might be easier to disprove than my assertion that the Williams books are a myth.) If one could be found, that might be accepted as "contemporaneous evidence," but I'm betting that the Williams president who denied the story probably did this kind of research.</dd>

<p>I'm actually pretty sure that's not true. Can someone source it? UMass Amherst's fokloristics specialist told me he doesn't think there are any sources.

<dl>
<dd><i>The hostility between the British and Native Americans ("Indians") after the French and Indian War led to the first documented attempt at biological warfare in North American history. In response to the 1763 uprising known as Pontiac's Rebellion, Amherst suggested using smallpox as a weapon for ending the rebellion. In a series of letters to his subordinate Colonel Henry Bouquet, the two men discussed the possibility of infecting the attacking Indians with smallpox through gifts of blankets that had been exposed to the disease. Apparently unbeknownst to both Amherst and Bouquet, the commander at Fort Pitt had already attempted this very tactic. Although Amherst's name is usually connected with this germ warfare because he was the overall commander and because of his correspondence with Bouquet, evidence appears to indicate that the attempt was made without Amherst's prior knowledge. (See Pontiac's Rebellion for more details.)</i></dd>

<p>I reworded a recent addition which asserted that men's and women's swimming and diving had won more individual national titles than any other sport at Amherst. Checking <a href="http://www.hickoksports.com/history/ncaamd3swim.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.hickoksports.com/history/ncaamd3swim.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.hickoksports.com/history/ncaawd3swim.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.hickoksports.com/history/ncaawd3swim.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a> suggests that the swimming and diving teams have indeed won quite a few titles, but it's unclear about "most." <a href="http://www.amherst.edu/~xcountry/allamerican.html" class="external text" title="http://www.amherst.edu/~xcountry/allamerican.html" rel="nofollow">This page</a> asserts that five athletes from the track teams have won thirteen national titles between them, but that spans two seasons - is that "four" teams? The swimming record shows several relay wins: are they counted as four or as one? (Or even not as individual titles at all?) How many wins to how many athletes? And in which other sports are individual titles available? (Golf, tennis, squash, skiing, wrestling, what else? Yes, Amherst once had a wrestling team.)</p>

<dd>I seem to remember that baseball games then were played under, shall we say, slightly different rules, and running up the score was one of the results. A score like that is not uncommon in cricket - actually, I think it would be a low score for cricket - that being the game baseball is usually compared to.</dd>

<p>I've seen some minor changes in the intro graph in the last few months which seem to be aimed at finding a balance between NPOV and communicating the College's "elite" status (e.g. removing "elite," then having it later replaced with "highly selective.")</p>
<p>Personally, I come down on the side of NPOV-caution here. The article already mentions selectivity (first sentence of the "Academics" section) so putting it in the intro does come off, in my mind, a bit too close to bragging. But I don't feel strongly enough about it to make an edit, and I'd like to see other opinions. --<a href="../../../p/j/m/User%7EPjmorse_8d4d.html" title="User:Pjmorse">Pjmorse</a> 15:04, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Personally, I don't think that "elite" is POV. Amherst is widely considered to be one an elite college (now, if it made the claim that it was the best then that would be a problem). However, I wasn't quite prepared to revert the removal of the word elite. I added "highly selective" in an attempt to mirror the Williams intro (which doesn't seem to be causing problems). <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordjeff06_d69d.html" title="User:Lordjeff06">Lordjeff06</a> 15:10, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, I added "elite" back in and added references to both the <a href="../../../p/b/s/PBS_66e9.html" title="PBS">PBS</a> documentary "Best and the Brightest" which describes Amherst as elite and to a <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsweek.html" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a> article which lists Amherst amongst the generally recognized premier colleges. It may still be POV, but it's a pretty universal POV. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELordjeff06_d69d.html" title="User:Lordjeff06">Lordjeff06</a> 16:53, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was just looking through, and noticed this - "but the two groups tend to socialize separately at the Club since the Williams alumni are demonstrably more attractive and successful." Does this seem POV to anyone else?</p>
<dl>
<dd>You're right. I axed the whole paragraph, since the sharing of the alumni club (while accurate so far as I know) doesn't seem important enough to keep relative to the vandalism-bait it represents. --<a href="../../../p/j/m/User%7EPjmorse_8d4d.html" title="User:Pjmorse">Pjmorse</a> 12:59, 19 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
