<p>To everyone who has helped put together this Wiki article. I've been trying to suss out some Amharic grammer rules for years. This discussion is helping me a LOT.</p>

<p>Don't those Abugida symbols have Unicode equivalents? I don not think we can ask every Wikipedia user to install the extra font to be able to read the fidels. On a sidenote, I have been adding the Noun and Adjective sections today (more is to come), using Latin transcription. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse"></a>— <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 17:58, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>The table does use the Unicode encoding. Perhaps I can additionally generate a graphics version. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 19:10, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It does indeed use the Unicode encoding, I asked the wrong question. What I mean is that people still have to download the GF Zemen font to be able to view the fidels, which I think is bad. If these symbols are not included in Arial Unicode or Lucida Unicode, the fonts most people have, then it would probably be a good idea to generate a graphics version. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse"></a>— <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 22:43, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not sure I'm interpreting the discussion correctly, but I do hope that the Unicode fidel table will remain in place, even if an alternative image-based version is added. I think it's a disservice to the language to propagate non-textual representations exclusively.</p>

<dd>I concur.

<p>Recently, a whole paragraph on a supposedly significant translation company was added to the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd><s>Ethiotrans is the first Ethiopian company who is offering the localization and translation services in various African/Ethiopian languages. You can see the list of languages what Ethiotrans is offering by going its web site ethiotrans.com . Also Ethiotrans is the first company to sale an Amharic keyboard which allows the user to learn the Amharic letter while learning how to write. You can see the Amharic keyboard at this location ethiotrans.com/ethiopickeyboard/order.htm</s></dd>
</dl>
<p>To me, it sounds too much like advertising paired with an attempt to Googlebomb ethiotrans.com (see also Ethiotrans).

<p>Update - Amharic wiki had the fastest article growth rate of all 217 wikipedias for the month of August, jumping from 5 articles on Aug 1, to 35 on Sep 1. (See multilingual statistics).</p>
<p>September kind of slowed down considerably, looks like our count for Oct 1 is going to be 45.</p>
<p>If you write Amharic, come and contribute some articles, and if you know anyone else who does, get them to spread the word! <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">Codex Sinaiticus</a> 23:26, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Update - Good news for all Amharic speakers! Someone has finally found the programs that solved the problem of how to type and edit ፊደል directly into the wiki edit box, instead of having to cut-and-paste it from another program like we've been doing! See the <a href="../../../../am/c/o/n/Help%7EContents_22de.html" class="extiw" title="am:Help:Contents">am:Help:Contents</a> page for details (I am using Anykey with Firefox method)...

<p>I don't understand why the <i>fidäl</i> chart is brought not under the traditional order. The grouping of similar consonant is already made (though, not ideally, IMO) in the consonants chart. <a href="../../../y/h/e/User%7EYhever_87d1.html" title="User:Yhever">Yhever</a> 18:19, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why doesn't anybody respond? I think that writing "not in tradition order" above the chart is still no explanation to the reasons of doing so. There is no point in grouping the letters "by manner of articulation", if that has already been done in the phonemic chart.</dd>
<dd>Should I change it myself? <a href="../../../y/h/e/User%7EYhever_87d1.html" title="User:Yhever">Yhever</a> 23:06, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that traditional (ha-pe) order would be infinitely more appropriate. I have been meaning to get around to changing it too, but haven't yet, so I just put "not in traditional order" for the time being! <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">Codex Sinaiticus</a> 23:26, 30 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>Well, I did as I promised and changed the chart to be "in traditional order".</p>
<p>Next thing I think should be changed is the transcription to be phonemic and according to common usage among <i>éthiopisants</i>; that is: <i>č</i> instead of <i>c</i>, <i>ǧ</i> instead of <i>ɟ</i>, <i>y</i> instead of <i>j</i>, <i>š</i> instead of <i>ʃ</i>, <i>ž</i> instead of <i>ʒ</i> and <i>ň</i> instead of <i>ɲ</i>. Nevertheless, the usage of an apostrophe instead of a subscript dot may be more convenient typographically. I think that <i>ts'</i> is neither clear for marking a single phoneme nor correct phonetically. This can be replaced by <i>ṣ</i> or <i>s'</i> . I am aware that the symbols I have suggested are not according to IPA, but they are more convenient and standard (as in the transcriptions of both Wolf Leslau and Thomas L.

<dd>I suggest dropping (x) from the transcription for letter ኸ because in modern Amharic it is pronounced identical to, and indeed in spelling is interchangeable with, the sounds represented by ሀ, ሐ, and ኀ. These four letters may have been distinguished once in the distant past, cf. Arabic and Hebrew; but in modern Amharic, all four have quite the same consonantal sound, and may all be interchanged in spelling.</dd>
<dd>On another note, I have trouble seeing some "phonetic" letters on my computer, they look like little squares; this includes these letters in the above paragraph (copying and pasting, they all look like squares to me): ǧ ɟ ʃ ʒ ɲ ṣ ... I have this pronblem with a lot of articles that use phonetic transcriptions... Whereas these ones show up just fine: č š ž ň Anyone know a remedy?

<dd>Back to Codex Siniaticus' point about 'x', you're right about the fact that the 'h' letters are interchangeable with ኸ (as for the pronunciation, I'm not sure). On the other hand, I think that there <i>is</i> a phonemic difference between <i>x</i> and <i>h</i>.</dd>
<dd><i>h</i> is not compatible with the first order vowel (<i>ä</i>) which is pronounced the same as the fourth order vowel (<i>a</i>) after it (e.g. <i>halafi</i> "responsible" and not <i>hälafi</i>). This 'h' is sometimes in variation with nothing, as in: <i>həlm</i>/<i>əlm</i> "dream", <i>hamsa</i>/<i>amsa</i> "fifty", etc.</dd>
<dd>'x', on the contrary, <i>is</i> compatible with the first order vowel: e.g. <i>ayyäxäw</i> (which might be pronounced [<i>ayyähäw</i>]) "you saw him", and is related to the phoneme <i>k</i> as in: <i>honä</i> "he was, became" vs. <i>akkwahwan</i> "manner of being, condition". The syllable <i>xä</i>/<i>hä</i> can only be written with ኸ, since the first order of the other 'h' letters has the vowel <i>a</i>. <a href="../../../y/h/e/User%7EYhever_87d1.html" title="User:Yhever">Yhever</a> 17:47, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You're right in that when the following vowel is ä, only ኸ can be used, as in አየኸው "you saw him", because the first form in all the other h's happens to share the vowel of the fourth form. But I would disagree that this indicates any different consonant "x" as opposed to "h". If you take off the "him" part, you have "'ayyeh" (Did you see?) which is normally written አየህ, but could conceivably even appear as አየሕ or አየኅ alongside አየኽ, and still be correct. No matter what letter is used, the "h" can always be pronounced more roughly aspirated, or not - I presume that's what the "x" is supposed to indicate. But the only thing different about ኸ is the fact that it is the only H letter that can be used to write with the -ä vowel. The consonantal value is identical to ሀ, ሐ, and ኀ, all of which can range anywhere from normal h, to a more aspirate x. If anything, it is ሐ that tends to be read more aspirate than the others, not ኸ, but it's really a matter of personal affectation how much to aspirate or not aspirate the h sound, and has little to do with which letter is used in spelling. And you're right, often enough initial h- can coexist alongside another spelling with initial ' , as in hagär / 'agär.

<dl>
<dd>Well, I didn't intend to make such a big deal out of it, though it is probably my fault. You're absolutely right about orthographical conventions in Amharic, but I was referring not to the way things are written (or pronounced, for that matter), but to the phonological analysis of the phonemes represented by the four different 'h' letters. The 2nd person suffix of the verb is made of such a phoneme that when followed by the vowel 'ä' appears as ኸ, whereas the first syllable of the word <i>halafi</i> which is in the same pattern as <i>säbari</i> apears as ሃ/ሀ/ሐ/ሓ/ኀ/ኃ (and probably not with ኻ) i.e. 'ha'. My point was that the different behaviour of these 'h'-s (out of which only the second varies with nothing as in: ሀገር/አገር ሀምሳ/አምሳ, etc.) points to two different elements; The first I mark with 'x' (as it is historically related to 'k', and also interchanges with 'k' in the current language, as in the example I gave of: <i>hedä</i>&#160;: <i>askedä</i>; <i>käbbädä</i>&#160;: <i>yä-häbbädä</i> in some dialects, etc.) and the second one I mark with 'h'. Only the first one <i>has</i> to be written with ኸ when followed by the vowel 'ä'.</dd>
<dd>Nevertheless, it may be convenient to leave out this whole issue from the presentation of the letters... <a href="../../../y/h/e/User%7EYhever_87d1.html" title="User:Yhever">Yhever</a> 00:48, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a matter of fact, you certainly <i>can</i> write <i>halafi</i> as ኻላፊ alongside the other six variants, because it <i>is</i> precisely the same sound. The only way ኸ is "historically related" to k, is in the fact that it is indeed really just the letter for k (ከ) with a bar added to the top. Aside from that, as you seem to agree that it makes no difference in either pronunciation or spelling fronm the other h's, I don't think it's particularly enlightening to present that letter as representing "x" (which most people apart from linguists would misunderstand anyway) on the basis of "phonology" (whatever that is - I mean if it's not relevant to spelling or pronunciation, what exactly is it anyway?) I know we are belabouring a very petty point here, but I look forward to the day when the learning of Amharic will not purposefully be made to appear so much more intimidating than it really is, with just this kind of thing...

<dd>You are persistently avoiding the evidence. I never said that <i>halafi</i> cannot be written with ኻ, I only mentioned that it is not the normal way of writing it (which is what I meant by: "probably not"). If you wish you can look at the examples I gave you and see that there are two kinds of 'h'-s even though they are pronounced the same and written mostly the same. The difference comes from the behaviour of surrounding vowels, and the interchangeability with nothing for one 'h' and with 'k' for the other one.</dd>
<dd>I agree that this whole issue may be too complicated, and not in place in the chart of letters, so let's delete this 'x'.</dd>
<dd>And back to my original question: The transcription right now is not consistent throughout the article. Now, what do you think about my suggestion to change it to be the same as in Wolf Leslau's dictionary and in Thomas L. Kane's dictionary? <a href="../../../y/h/e/User%7EYhever_87d1.html" title="User:Yhever">Yhever</a> 17:51, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I just added the correspondences between IPA and the transcription conventions. I think the IPA symbols should remain in the phoneme charts, whatever system of transcription is used elsewhere in the article. By the way, the transcription is still not consistent (there are two different palatal nasal consonants used, for example). Personally, I'd be in favor of switching completely from Leslau's system (adopted unfortunately by Kane), with its cumbersome use of non-standard characters for the two most common vowels (not to mention confusing use of schwa) to one more like the standard adopted by the mapping authorities in Ethiopia. And not all éthiopisants use this system either. Just my preference. But I'm new here... <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeGasser_459a.html" title="User:MikeGasser">Mike</a> 03:59, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not familiar with how things are handled by the mapping authorities in Ethiopia, so could you elaborate? Among linguists, Leslau's system is the most common and that is why it is used here at present. But I think it's a good idea to give other systems some consideration. — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 10:05, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's true that Leslau's system is the most common among linguists (as much as I dislike it, I used it myself once in a paper, bowing to convention), but it's not familiar at all to native-speaking non-linguists, and the question is what will be the most useful for Wikipedia users, many of whom will not be linguists (let alone Ethiopianists). I'm not sure when this actually happened, but at some point the mapping authorities in Ethiopia adopted a system by which the vowels (in traditional order) were represented by /e/, /u/, /ī/, /a/, /ē/, /i/, /o/. This has the advantage that diacritics are not needed for the most common vowels. In any case, I think the important thing is to agree on a single convention for this page which can be used for other Ethio-Semitic languages. I'd like to start working on the Tigrinya page, for example (it's just a stub now). Oh, by the way, the IPA symbols for the "palatal plosives" are not right. Like the corresponding English consonants, these are really post-alveolar or alveo-palatal affricates, and the symbols should be /ʧ/, /ʤ/, and something like /ʧˈ/ for the ejective. Note that I'm not arguing these symbols (or the other IPA symbols) be used throughout the article, just fixed in the table. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeGasser_459a.html" title="User:MikeGasser">Mike Gasser</a> 15:22, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(Soddo phonetics/phonology is very close to Amharic.) So I give up. I'll use this for the Tigrinya page as well. But should we use ň or ñ (as currently in amarəñña at the top of the page) for the palatal n? Even though it's not strictly part of Leslau's system, the latter has the advantage that it's more likely to be familiar to people from Spanish. — <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeGasser_459a.html" title="User:MikeGasser">Mike Gasser</a> 19:00, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The most extensive one, coming in at a good 2300 pages in two volumes, is Thomas L. Kane's (1990) <i>Amharic-English Dictionary</i>. A lot of it, however, consists of a compilation of various older dictionaries (including Guidi's 1901 <i>Amarico-Italiano</i>, a French one, and Armbruster's 1908 E-A and A-E vocabularies). It may be the most complete, but it includes many archaisms and neologisms. The best one, to me at least, is still Wolf Leslau's (1976) <i>Concise Amharic Dictionary</i>. Both A-E and E-A in 538 pages, in the same transcription as his Reference Grammar. The lemmas are concise, but reliable. As for the pocket version, you may have been looking at Amsalu &amp; Mosback (1973), only English-Amharic. The back cover says that they have been teaching Amharic for about twenty years, yet they didn't consider it necessary to include sample sentences, which makes it virtually unusable unless you already know Amharic in which case you wouldn't need it anyway.

<dd>There are two types of "ch"s in Amharic, a non-plosive ቸ, and a plosive (explosive) version, ጨ. I'm not sure if that's the correct terminology to refer to the second word, but it's definitely similar to the other plosives. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom">Yom</a> 23:34, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see it from the table that there are two <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">ʧ</span>-s, one normal and one ejective, but the IPA-symbols suggest that only the airstream mechanism is different, and they are both affricates. The <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voiceless_palatal_plosive.html" title="Voiceless palatal plosive">voiceless palatal plosive</a> has a different IPA-symbol ([c]). <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Voiceless_palatal_plosive.ogg" class="external text" title="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Voiceless_palatal_plosive.ogg" rel="nofollow">Sound sample (voiceless palatal plosive)</a></dd>

<p>The second paragraph says the writing system is _called_ fidel or abugida. It's called Amharic, Ethiopic, or <a href="../../../g/e/27/Ge%27ez_alphabet.html" title="Ge'ez alphabet">Ge'ez</a>.

<dd>Isn't A-Bu-Gi-Da... just a system to sort the characters? The other one would be Ha-Le-Ha... The writing system is called "fidel" in Amharic.

<dd>This is a typical problem caused by modern linguists stealing an Ethiopian word meaning "ABC" (Abugida). and applying it to a whole class of writing systems including Brahmic, then they seem to forget where they stole the word from, and question whether Ge'ez (the original to be called "Abugida") has any real right to be called this, according to their new definition, which has by now become confused. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 12:45, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ge'ez was the official language basically until the 19th century. The language of the court was basically Amharic for most of the Solomonic dynasty, but it was always Ge'ez that was written. In the 18th century the court language became Oromo with <a href="../../../i/y/o/Iyoas_I_of_Ethiopia_812c.html" title="Iyoas I of Ethiopia">Iyoas I</a>, and remained <a href="../../../o/r/o/Oromo_language.html" title="Oromo language">Oromo</a> during the hegemony of the Yejju (1779-1855; not sure if it was <a href="../../../t/i/g/Tigrinya_language.html" title="Tigrinya language">Tigrinya</a> during <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikael_Sehul_bcd7.html" title="Mikael Sehul">Mikael Sehul</a>'s regency of the 18th c.). Ge'ez probably ceased to be spoken in the 6th-9th century, though. Amharic is putatively a descendent of Ge'ez, but more likely split around the 4th century from Ge'ez by way of a sister language or some dialect(s) of Ge'ez. Of course, the date at which you define the language as Amharic and no longer Ge'ez is also arbitrary, so the dates can vary. — <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom"><font color="green">ዮም</font></a> | <b><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Yom_45a6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Yom"><font color="#FFD700">(Yom)</font></a></b> | <a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYom_16ed.html" title="User talk:Yom"><font color="red">Talk</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yom_414b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yom">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../e/t/h/WP%7EETH_da5e.html" title="WP:ETH">Ethiopia</a></small> 17:26, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You just contradicted yourself. It is correct that the slide from Ge'ez into Amharic is imperceptible and gradual, and very well documented much like Anglo-Saxon into English. The "sister language" thing is a theory of some modern day revisionists for which there is no shred of documentation or evidence, and I'm rather surprised to see you giving it any mention. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_4880.html" title="User:Codex Sinaiticus">ፈቃደ</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/d/User_talk%7ECodex_Sinaiticus_daab.html" title="User talk:Codex Sinaiticus">ውይይት</a>) 17:31, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Where's the contradiction? The change from one language to another is almost always gradual (excepting pidginization/creolization), but the usual date for considering the dialect/cluster of dialects being a separate language from Ge'ez is generally in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Late_antiquity.html" title="Late antiquity">Late antiquity</a> or the early medieval period. This time period is not at all well-documented, actually. We have very few inscriptions and texts, limited to those of <a href="../../../k/a/l/Kaleb_of_Axum_bf80.html" title="Kaleb of Axum">Kaleb</a> of the 6th c., <i>Hatsani</i> Dani'el of the 7-9th century (probably 9th c. but uncertain), and a few biblical texts from <i>Abba</i> Gerima (Garima) dating to the early medieval or late Aksumite period (with a mention in the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colophon_%28publishing%29.html" title="Colophon (publishing)">colophons</a> of Armaho - probably <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armah.html" title="Armah">Armah</a>) and a few small short inscriptions. All of these texts are unequivocally Ge'ez and do not show the evolution into Amharic that you claim. In fact, we don't find any clearly Amharic words until the 14th century, with the Soldiers' Songs of <a href="../../../a/m/d/Amda_Seyon_I_of_Ethiopia_722a.html" title="Amda Seyon I of Ethiopia">Amda Seyon I</a>, which are in fully developed Old Amharic. We don't, however, have any evidence of the evolution of Amharic between it and earlier Ge'ez texts. Old Amharic words and names continue to appear throughout the years, especially in soldiers' songses (fully in Old Amharic), colophons, and magic scrolls. If it is this gradual increased usage of Amharic that you are referring to when you say that the "slide from Ge'ez into Amharic is [...] very well documented," then you are mistaken, as the Soldiers' Songs of Amda Seyon are clearly those of a full-developed (Old) Amharic language. As for the sister language theory vs. dialects, vs. multiple dialects, what is called a language is arbitrary. I was simply noting it as a possibility since linguists have considered it. — <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom"><font color="green">ዮም</font></a> | <b><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Yom_45a6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Yom"><font color="#FFD700">(Yom)</font></a></b> | <a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYom_16ed.html" title="User talk:Yom"><font color="red">Talk</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yom_414b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yom">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../e/t/h/WP%7EETH_da5e.html" title="WP:ETH">Ethiopia</a></small> 01:11, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you can get a chance, please look at the info in the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica article "Semitic languages", it describes a gradual transition of texts in the yearly chronicles and other government and court records over the centuries, being written in a mixture of Geez and increasingly Amharic words.

<dd>I'm aware of the increased usage of Amharic words over the years in Ge'ez chronicles, but it's <i>not</i> the evolution of Ge'ez into Amharic right before our eyes. I'd guess it was a result of an increasingly smaller population that fully spoke and understood Ge'ez, but whatever the reason, Old Amharic was a fully developed language separate from Ge'ez by the 14th century and almost certainly earlier. The Amharic used in the 4 Solders' Songs from Amda Seyon's time were not mixes of Amharic and Ge'ez but pure Old Amharic. — <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYom_9375.html" title="User:Yom"><font color="green">ዮም</font></a> | <b><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Yom_45a6.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Yom"><font color="#FFD700">(Yom)</font></a></b> | <a href="../../../y/o/m/User_talk%7EYom_16ed.html" title="User talk:Yom"><font color="red">Talk</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yom_414b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yom">contribs</a> • <a href="../../../e/t/h/WP%7EETH_da5e.html" title="WP:ETH">Ethiopia</a></small> 02:06, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The reason why you find so many Amharic words in Ge'ez texts of the Middle Ages is the fact that a) Ge'ez wasn't any more a spoken language at that time but the language of scholarship (it had a role may be comparable to that of Latin in Europe); b) the authors of those texts were in most cases Amharic mother tounge speakers and especially in the chronicles they had to use Amharic words for items, offices etc. which originate in the language of the court, which was Amharic (lesane negus) (cf.
