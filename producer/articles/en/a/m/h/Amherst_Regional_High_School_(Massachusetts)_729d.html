<p>The school's sports teams are all known as "The Hurricanes". ARHS is one of many high schools in Massachusetts with a nationally-ranked <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_%28sport%29.html" title="Ultimate (sport)">Ultimate</a> program. The boys' and girls' Ultimate teams have both won the national championship several times, including the girl's program winning the national championship 5 consecutive times. The girls' cross-country team has won 11 consecutive Western Massachusetts titles. The boys’ cross-country team has also been dominant in the region for several years, winning six of the last seven Western Mass Championships. The Girls ultimate team has won 5 consecutive national championships.</p>
<p>The 1992–1993 “Lady Hurricanes” girls' basketball team, which won the state championships, inspired the book <i>In These Girls, Hope is a Muscle</i> by <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madeleine_Blais_e7e9.html" title="Madeleine Blais">Madeleine Blais</a>.

<p>While not technically an extracurricular activity, since the class is taken for credit, ARHS is one of the few schools in the nation to offer a <a href="http://www.arps.org/hs/Academics/Science/SurvivalLiving/" class="external text" title="http://www.arps.org/hs/Academics/Science/SurvivalLiving/" rel="nofollow">Wilderness Survival</a> program. The class meets through the spring semester, and covers subjects such as orienteering, wilderness first aid, emergency shelters, wild edibles, and emergency fire-building (typically, students are warned that anytime there is rain during class, the scheduled class will be replaced with a fire-building class).</p>
<p>Former teacher Charlie Camp started the program. Exercises include an overnight hike with the whole class, a two-day orienteering campout in pairs, and a three-day <a href="../../../p/r/a/Practicum.html" title="Practicum">practicum</a> where students simulate being lost in the wilderness alone. Many former students return to help teach the class or aid with the major exercises, and often describe the class as a highly formative event in their lives.</p>

<p>The town of Amherst, situated in an area surrounded by five colleges, prides itself on being particularly socially conscientious. Because of this, issues ranging from First Amendment rights to race relations have a habit of repeatedly cropping up in Amherst Regional High School. Recently it has experienced a wave of controversies over several different issues, many of which have helped put it in the national spotlight.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1990.html" title="1990">1990</a>, Principal Ilene Levitt instituted a <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_harassment.html" title="Sexual harassment">sexual harassment</a> policy, among the first of its kind for a high school in the nation. The policy banned "staring or leering with sexual overtones", among other acts; it received significant media attention. <a href="http://www.teenink.com/Past/1990/1060.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.teenink.com/Past/1990/1060.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/h/Amherst_Regional_High_School_%28Massachusetts%29_729d.html" title="Edit section: Principal Myers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Principal Myers</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, Principal Stephen Myers resigned after allegations that he had a student show him his <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nipple.html" title="Nipple">nipples</a>, and invited the student over to his house. Though Myers claimed the incident was harmless and he only looked at the boy's nipples due to the student's concerns of being teased about his breast size, the controversy was enormous, with many parents demanding he be removed from his position. Of much speculation was that Myers was unmarried and had an <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adoption.html" title="Adoption">adopted</a> son.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>As allegations grew, previously overlooked allegations of Myers' <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_misconduct.html" title="Sexual misconduct">sexual misconduct</a> surfaced from his time as a Principal at a school in <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Cruz%2C_California_ad36.html" title="Santa Cruz, California">Santa Cruz</a>. A Santa Cruz police report tells of two incidents of alleged sexual misconduct between Myers and students.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The first incident occurred in 1994, when a <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_Protective_Services_dd08.html" title="Child Protective Services">Child Protective Services</a> worker reported that a parent had discovered pictures of students in their <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underwear.html" title="Underwear">underwear</a> or <a href="../../../b/a/t/Bathing_suit.html" title="Bathing suit">bathing suits</a>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The police determined that the pictures were taken as part of a school activity and no crime had taken place. The second incident came in late December <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, when a former alleged molestation victim of Myers contacted the police due to Myers' attempts to adopt a 4-year-old Romanian boy.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> During the subsequent investigation, Myers admitted to the 1980 incident.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> He also admitted that he had committed a sexual act with a teenage boy during a School trip to <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>. However, neither of these cases could be prosecuted, as the 1980s case exceeded the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statute_of_limitations.html" title="Statute of limitations">statute of limitations</a>, and the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a> incident occurred outside of U.S. <a href="../../../j/u/r/Jurisdiction.html" title="Jurisdiction">jurisdiction</a>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Legal rules prevented the police from making these incidents public, however, the fact that Myers was hired without a more extensive <a href="../../../b/a/c/Background_check.html" title="Background check">background check</a> created a public backlash over the Amherst school board's failure.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Also according to the police report, Myers had previously admitted he was <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">sexually attracted to teenage boys</a>, and had been in <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychotherapy.html" title="Psychotherapy">psychotherapy</a> to control his impulses.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> He also let police know of an incident where he had shared a bed with a 14-year-old student during a school trip to <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_983d.html" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, though he said there had been no sexual contact.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The boy confirmed that the incident had been non-sexual in nature.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Then, in the summer of <a href="../../../1/9/9/1996.html" title="1996">1996</a>, police began looking at new allegations that Myers had molested the 4-year-old boy he had tried to <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adoption.html" title="Adoption">adopt</a>. The adoption, being conducted by a <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania.html" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>-based agency, had been scrapped after the investigation six months earlier.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> But when police learned of troubling comments the boy had made to his foster mother about Myers, they tried to reopen the investigation. That attempt was dropped at the request of the 4-year-old’s foster parents, however, who were worried about the emotional well-being of the child.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Though Myers maintained his innocence throughout the ordeal in Amherst, and he was never actually charged with a crime, he still resigned from his position due to the public humiliation and backlash from the incident.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> Amherst Regional High School received international press coverage for their decision to allow students to perform <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Vagina_Monologues_c052.html" title="The Vagina Monologues">The Vagina Monologues</a></i>. Although many adults within and outside of the community felt that <i>The Vagina Monologues</i> dealt with inappropriate material for teenagers, some ARHS students felt that the performance had relevance to their lives. Appearing on <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_News_3dc5.html" title="NBC News">NBC News</a>, 17-year-old Kristin Tyler, who helped organize the event, stated that "one in five girls in high school are either <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_abuse.html" title="Sexual abuse">sexually</a> or <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physical_abuse.html" title="Physical abuse">physically</a> abused on a date."</p>
<p><br />
In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a> <i>The Vagina Monologues</i> were performed by Amherst Regional High School students again. Women's Rights Club, founded in fall <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> by Sophie Rabinovitz, '07, sponsored the show. After seeking permission from principal Mark Jackson to perform the monologues in their high school auditorium, their request was denied. Jackson cited reasons such as the town's looming budget cuts, previous controversy and negative publicity associated with the show, as well as lack of interest by teachers and staff to help organize the performance. The members of the club persisted and succeeded in securing the Northampton Center for the Arts for their show. <i>The Vagina Monologues</i> took place on February 15th, 17th and 18th. The Saturday and Sunday night shows both sold out, and the club succeeded in raising several thousand dollars to donate to local women's charities. Amherst students plan to put on another production of the show in February of 2008. Mycal Carter a Freshman hopes that the principal Will appeal his decision next year. "<i>We pride ourselves for having something few high schools has, and just look at how women are portrayed today?</i>."</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> the word "<a href="../../../f/r/e/Freshman.html" title="Freshman">freshman</a>" was deemed by then assistant principal Marta Guevarra to no longer be acceptable for use in the school. The term was deemed sexist because it contains the word "man" and therefore implies that all students in the 9th grade are men. Opponents of the decision assert that it is unreasonable because the word "freshman" has morphed outside of the bounds of possibly meaning "fresh man". Although the administration persists on using the term "9th graders", the change had little effect on the student body. In response to the "freshman" controversy, a satirical letter was written to the administration by a student claiming that the school should also change the name "High School" as it oppresses short people, and suggests that the students are always intoxicated.</p>

<p>Ronald Garney, a teacher of 9th grade science, was arrested <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_28.html" title="November 28">November 28</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> after Amherst Police raided his apartment, on the grounds of possession of <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_pornography.html" title="Child pornography">child pornography</a>. According to the police, three CDs, respectively labeled 'boys', 'girls', and 'boys and girls', were found in Garney's apartment, featuring children ages 2-12. It was reported that one of these discs contained 56 videos of child pornography. Garney admitted that he had been watching <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_pornography.html" title="Child pornography">child pornography</a> for 20 years, but police have not yet found any evidence that children from the local school have been involved. Garney has been banned from the school property and forbidden to have contact with anyone under the age of 18 (minors). Since the arrest, numerous ARHS alumni have offered detailed accounts of Garney's inappropriate behavior in the classroom, including a habit of rubbing his genitals against a desk while lecturing and making female students uncomfortable with his proximity and by frequently appearing to look down their shirts. <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>
