<p>I've taken down the 'Controversy' section, as the linked article makes no claims regarding any *amount* of funding from the Ford Foundation. Meanwhile it makes outlandish claims about her salary, ownership of the DN! program, and is largely uncredible. The removed text:</p>
<dl>

<p>The earlier edits which claimed Goodman receives one million dollars per years are also baseless w/r/t the linked article. If you read the source for that article's, the editor ends the article with <b>"[Editor's note: This compensation may cover the cost of producing DN!]"</b> In other words, it is just as likely that she, and the dozen or so producers and assistants working on the Democracy Now! television program, are all being paid from the $1MM per annum. -<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlausible_deniability_fe0f.html" title="User:Plausible deniability">plaus</a> 22:00, 07 Aug 2006 (GMT)</p>

<dd>I just read the Democracy Now! Productions Inc. IRS Form 990 for 2004. According to the Form 990, Amy Goodman's salary is $58,000 a year. The "hr/wk" section is filled in, "As required". Other salaries and wages are $600,000. Democracy Now!'s gross receipts are $3 million; $2 million comes from "Direct Public Suport", $26,250 comes from government grants, the other $1 million comes from program service revenues, which is mostly $675,000 documentary and broadcast fees, $292,000 distribution and tape sales income. <a href="../../../n/b/a/User%7ENbauman_bc94.html" title="User:Nbauman">Nbauman</a> 10:54, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>How does this article not identify Goodman as a left wing ideologue? Imagine if one were to refer to Michael Savage as an "alternative journalist". This is ridiculous!</p>

<dd>Quote: "..., and other countries. Goodman and Democracy Now! are known for their left wing views. Criticism of the corporate media, and regular coverage of topics related to the antiwar and anti-globalization movements are hallmarks of Goodman and Democracy Now!". There you go. Oh, and Savage isn't a journalist. He applied to be a dean of journalism and got rejected flat out. Thats his extent of journalism experience.

<p>I just don't see how it makes any sense for the Clinton administration to be deliberately selling weapons to the Indonesian Army to crush the independence movement when the U.S. had already voted Yes on a U.N. resolution that expressed concern over Suharto's human rights record.

<p>ok, it's a fact that Clinton backed a U.S. Yes vote in the U.N. based on concerns over Suharto's human rights record. furthermore, American military aid was cut off to Indonesia by 1993, the year Clinton took office. given these _facts_, Goodman's claim of U.S. support in the mid-90s should be treated as just that, a claim, not an undisputed fact. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrey_Stone_e7d3.html" title="User:Trey Stone">J.

<p>Reverting back and forth from one version to another does not help to build a consensus. In a recent exchange we had things like "Quotes" versus "Quotations" reverted. Surely we can agree on many items like this. Let's only change the things we don't agree with and leave those that are NPOV, rather than wholesale reverting. If we can narrow the focus of the dispute then we'll have a better chance of developing a stable version.

<p>Whoever wrote/said this needs to get there definitions straight. She may be anti-zionist but that doesn't neccesarily mean she is anti-semitic. --154.20.62.186 05:04, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>"self-hating Jew" is the bigoted canard used to deflect criticism Jews make of Israeli policy, whether or not that policy carried out by people who are Jewish. If the critic is not Jewish, the bigoted canard used is "anti-semite." Then there is the conventional definition of "anti-semite" as someone fundamentally bigoted against Jews, but such people have nothing to do with reflective criticism of Israeli policies. People who employ such bigotries exploit Jewishness for their own political purposes, and so, in fact, are deeply anti-semitic, but that view can't currently be tolerated in widespread media.<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmyTheSaint_8d0d.html" title="User:JimmyTheSaint">JimmyTheSaint</a> 15:50, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I remember hearing this interview when it was first broadcast, and it stunned me: Clinton was brilliantly articulate, smart as a whip, and forthcoming. My respect for him went way up; he was already known to be a smart guy (Rhodes scholar and all), but this was never a possibility for his (or any recent president's) public persona. There was one brief moment where he became flustered and lost his temper a bit at Goodman's "interrogation," but I thought how great it was to have politicians giving real answers to real questions instead of hearing nothing but boilerplate. Clinton only classified it as hostile or disrespectful because he was so unused to an inquisitive public interview as president regarding political policy. It was pathetic how, even at that late moment of the 2000 campaign, the best the Democrats could offer was an attack on progressive politics and anyone to the left of themselves, which is everyone on the left, in the middle, and a little to the right, and showed himself as "Republican lite." But if all our national figures laid themselves out like that, the better informed electorate would pull them back to the interests of the many instead of the few. I've even heard GWB, in debates with Ann Richards, articulate himself smartly and sharply, but that's always been suppressed on the national stage, and even his "left" critics consistently play into the trap by calling him dumb.<a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimmyTheSaint_8d0d.html" title="User:JimmyTheSaint">JimmyTheSaint</a> 15:50, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I added a section on the Clinton interview, since it was one of the most memorable interviews I've ever heard. (I've linked to it on journalism lists as an model of how an interview should be done.) I basically paraphrased Goodman's own description from the DN web site. I didn't realize it had already been added and removed with some controversy until I reviewed the history. What was the problem?

<dd>I think it's inappropriate too. The "left gatekeeper" idea (if I understand it correctly) is that Goodman is actually a right-winger, funded by right-wing corporations to pretend to be a left-winger and co-opt the left movement, keeping "real" left thought suppressed. They have not made their case for that.

<li>Knock off the personal attacks.

Otherwise, the sentence simply asserts that the Jewish press (whatever that is) is making the allegation.

<dd>JP, sorry, but I just don't understand your point - the Jewish Press is a legitimate on line weekly magazine that represents the viewpoint of the orthodox Jewish community - and yes, it was an editorial position, but any statement of that nature almost by definition has to be an editorial position - and there is no such policy that only neutral matters may be posted in articles, if YOU read the wikipedia rules sourced material if expressing a pov may be posted - that approach appears in MANY articles - now, would you mind reversing your reversion?

For example, you didn't comprehend in the least that your presentation of the "Jewish Press" quote wasn't removed because of its content, but because it wasn't presented as a verifiable reliable source. I had to do a lot of digging around to determine that you were actually quoting a source rather than just expressing your own opinion (as you've done previously by simply inserting "XXX is an anti-semite" into multiple articles). The everyday reader, the target audience for Wikipedia, would not have been able to do that. If, on the other hand, you'd presented the quote correctly, it might have been moved in the article, as the desired prominence of the opinion would have been argued, but it would have more likely been accepted. Don't expect others to do your work for you; if you want to include pejorative assertions, you'll need to back them up. Same thing would have applied if you'd said "Amy Goodman is a space alien" or "Amy Goodman is a ailurovore"; it has nothing to do with prejudice, bias, or anti-Jewishness. You should note that an approximately equal number of critics think Wikipedia is a Zionist propaganda mill as think that Wikipedia is a hotbed of anti-Semitic fervor.

<p>A question on POV, from a Wikipedia newbie, if I may? First, some A wikipedia entry is a place to gather information about its subject. Information that, by consensus of the editors, is relevant, and factual, and of NPOV. In the case where an editor adds a quote to an article about a person that says "According to the opinion page of journal Z, X is anti-Martian." That Z's opinion page had said that about X is fact - they did say that, only it's Z's opinion, right? Whether X is anti-Martian is not established fact, in this context, based on that quote - yes?</p>
<p>So, what is established, is that journal Z has an opinion about X, but that info is a fact about Z, not about X. Therefore, does it make sense to include this fact about Z in an article of facts about X? Shouldn't that fact belong in an article about Z? To the point, does it seem that Incorrect's desire to include the fact of the Jewish Press's opinion about Goodman - can this be taken as an attempt to assert non-factual POV about Goodman? Is that a reasonable take on this type of edit? It seems to be a common situation on Wikipedia, and I'd like to learn how to deal with it. Regards, --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlausible_deniability_fe0f.html" title="User:Plausible deniability">plaus</a> 23:33 / 21 May 06 GMT</p>
<ul>
<li>Good question, and I'm not sure I can give anywhere near a complete answer. I agree with you completely that the info is about Z, not X. So what needs to be looked at is how important is it to an understanding of of X? I think <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV#Undue weight</a> might bear on this. We have to make judgement calls; part of editing Wikipedia involves determining whether or not writer Y's opinion (or writer Y himself) is important enough to warrant mention in an article. --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 02:52, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Both Ms Goodman and her style of journalism, are not dedicated to lighthearted spoofs. She (to my knowledge) has never been employed by MTV:News infact I would go so far as to say that the very nature of her work is designed to be inflamitory and arguementative. It should be the job of any author contributing to her article, to present facts about her and her work. Not pass judgement upon it. Wikipedia, for it's own sake, can not take sides in this. If something seems too volitile to include in an article then by all means we should exclude it untill such time as we can enter it objectively. This should not be used as a soapbox to promote personal ideas and moral values. --Dashhammer 14:50, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article indicates that that the DN! broadcast was pulled by Pacifica on Sept 11 2001. Are we *sure* it was actually pulled - the firehouse is not far from thm the WTC, and power failures or other problems may have caused the blackout.

<dd>I second your concern. The source that is cited doesn't say relate DN!'s hiatus to Sept 11. Doubleplusjeff 04:11, 20 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Such a thing is not so simple to prove with web references, but personal observations may not be enough. Remember that more important events were being recorded that day. As a former DN! worker, I was working in the firehouse on 9/11, and we were definitely pre-empted. The show ordinarily goes on at 9:00AM EST, and the planes started hitting the WTC shortly before then. We had power that day (and throughout the post-9/11 time period, too - different part of the power grid than the WTC, on the other side of Manhattan.)</dd>
<dd>I personally believe that WBAI made the choice to go with live coverage from WBAI reporters on the street, as the buildings were coming down. The catastrophic events of the day brought on the decision, IMO, but you never know. Mind you, at the time, DN! and AG were on the opposing side of a very public struggle to control Pacifica's board, and as a result were quite unpopular with WBAI management (Utrice Lied, who took control of WBAI in the wee hours of the morning, during the so-called Christmas Coup, was no friend of AG.) WBAI lost power on the uplink to the Empire State Bldg transmitter later in the day. For what it's worth, WBAI pulled DN! altogether for a period during 2001, and Pacifica stopped all funding too (we were unpaid on 9/11, and for a number of months prior.) <a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlausible_deniability_fe0f.html" title="User:Plausible deniability">plaus</a> 03:59, 29 Nov 06 GMT.</dd>

She did not delve the harsh details of the Palestinian?occupation during her recent Popejoy appearance. She did, however, identify herself as Jewish and share her?horror of having seen the sacred Star of David hanging from Israeli tanks?and from bulldozers used to destroy homes and olive groves.? On Jan. 18 Goodman was focused on preventing a war against Iraq. She?reminds us that innocent Iraqi civilians, not Saddam Hussein, are?suffering the consequences of U.S. sanctions and the Gulf War. To her they?are not “collateral damage.” She knows all too well what price the people?have already paid, that hospitals are filled with children dying of cancer?or born with horrible birth deformities, that there is not enough medicine,?drinking water, food or electricity, that the civilian population of Iraq?will not survive another U.S. onslaught. “Democracy Now” has brought us?inside Baghdad and allowed us to hear their voices and eyewitness?accounts from doctors, journalists and international witnesses.? Some people read the Torah and bow before a paternalistic God who judges?and declares “An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.” Others understand?that “Never Again” means never again remain silent in the face of?witnessing a holocaust of any people.?

Simply claiming that its The Truth or that "everyone thinks so" isn't good enough. I've provided a compromise here that does not violate wikipedia NPOV policy, by adding a line noting that a headline in a notable newspaper once referred to Goodman as "left wing", with a link to that article. I don't believe it is necessary to do so, as any reader should be able to make up their own minds from the article as to Goodman's political leanings, but I've done this simply to appease those who insist that "left wing" be inserted somewhere into the lead.

<dd>I think that your contention here is valid. Here's my two cents: avoid the 'left-wing, right-wing' thing altogether, and just call her what she certainly is, which is <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressivism.html" title="Progressivism">progressive</a>. Some of Goodman's views may clash with both mainstream 'left-wing' and 'right-wing' perspectives, depending on the issue, and by calling her 'progressive' we adopt a more flexible term that is less frequently used inappropriately to pidgeonhole or dismiss somebody's views. I will give this a shot and see if it sticks.

<dd><a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a>, why are you engaging in an edit war over a valid description of Goodman and DemNow!? Multiple sources have called Goodman and DemNow! 'progressive', and a little research will tell you that the causes that she sympathizes with and discusses on the show are widely considered to be 'progressive'. The edits you made between mine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amy_Goodman&amp;diff=83312557&amp;oldid=83296606" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amy_Goodman&amp;diff=83312557&amp;oldid=83296606" rel="nofollow">here</a> all seem to be purely dedicated to removing the term 'progressive' from the article. This seems to me to be an odd reason for engaging in an edit war.--<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackbirdsong_8abb.html" title="User:Jackbirdsong">Jackbirdsong</a> 23:58, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Funny criticism, given that I actually left the "progressive" descriptor in tact--I simply condensed both of the quotes into a descriptor, and not a direct quote, for the sake of accuracy and concision, because if we leave the entire quotes in place, the sentence then has to be structured so that attribution is given to the quote, which becomes to cluttered. Care to try another criticism? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a> 00:00, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The adjective "progressive" is subjective and relative to a particular point of view or frame of reference.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestrade_9460.html" title="User:Lestrade">Lestrade</a> 00:07, 24 October 2006 (UTC)Lestrade</dd>

<p>(unindent)You removed direct quotes for the sake of accuracy? Thats intriguing...the concision aspect makes more sense, but in such a diminutive article brevity seems less important, IMHO, than accuracy. I have no desire to fight about this really, it just seemed silly to me to avoid describing her in terms that multiple credible refs have, thats all. And of course the term is subjective: any political descriptor is surrounded by some degree of relativity, i.e. 'liberal', 'conservative', etc. This does not mean it cannot or should not be used to describe somebody's political ideology in general terms. Nontheless, I am going to stop editing this article for now, as this seems futile.--<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackbirdsong_8abb.html" title="User:Jackbirdsong">Jackbirdsong</a> 00:33, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"Liberal" and "conservative" are not subjective adjectives. They have conventional meanings that are objectively applied to political groups. "Progressive" may mean one thing to one group and another thing to another group, depending on the group's goal and purpose. Whatever advances toward that particular goal is progressive.<a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestrade_9460.html" title="User:Lestrade">Lestrade</a> 01:50, 24 October 2006 (UTC)Lestrade</dd>

<dd>Just to respond to this last comment, <i>""Liberal" and "conservative" are not subjective adjectives"</i>? So there aren't multiple schools of liberalism and conservatism that may conflict at times? "Liberal" means the same thing to different parties? To paint these terms as objective is absolutely incorrect, for if they were there would not be multiple branches of these ideologies. Also, you are mixing the Dictionary definition of 'progressive' with the political ideology, which is more specific. Progressivism is a movement that began in late 19th century America (see: <a href="../../../p/r/o/Progressivism.html" title="Progressivism">progressivism</a>) with specific ideologies and tenets such as 1)environmentalism 2)social justice 3)corporate regulation 4)efficiency of the democratic process. Teddy Roosevelt started the 'Progressive Party' with these specific goals in mind, and progressive has been a term applied to this set of mostly left-wing ideologies ever since.--<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackbirdsong_8abb.html" title="User:Jackbirdsong">Jackbirdsong</a> 03:08, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I replaced the Braxton quote with the Publishers Weekly quote because using the Braxton quote in the intro draws attention away from Goodman to the allegedly "disenfranchised left." Since the article is about Goodman, I felt the Publishers Weekly quote is more appropriate quote to use in the intro. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStanley011_1b51.html" title="User:Stanley011">Stanley011</a> 03:40, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not to quibble over something so minor, but after some consideration its my opinion that because the publishers weekly quote is not as specific as the original LA Times quote, and mention of the "disenfranchised left" does not really distract from the subject of the article in any significant way, there is no real reason not to use the Times ref'd statement. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackbirdsong_8abb.html" title="User:Jackbirdsong">Jackbirdsong</a> 04:18, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>88.36.237.121, I don't understand what "Capitalist and anti-capitalist" means in this context. You can find the term "capitalist" on DemocracyNow.org with a Google search, but here it sounds funny. "Anti-capitalist" has different meanings to different people, most of them POV, and some of them ironic. Finally, the source that I gave is an example of balanced coverage of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, but it's not an example of balanced coverage of the capitalist/anti-capitalist conflict. Can you find a citation? Maybe you could say "corporate and anti-corporate," or "establishment and progressive" (which I would prefer). <a href="../../../n/b/a/User%7ENbauman_bc94.html" title="User:Nbauman">Nbauman</a> 08:13, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>88.36.237.121, why did you take out this line?</p>
<p><i>"She is an unapologetic advocacy journalist, and supported Ralph Nader's presidential campaigns."</i></p>
<p>I think everyone would agree that she's an advocacy journalist.</p>
<p>I heard her speak at a pro-Nader rally at the Ethical Culture Society during the 2000 election. I heard her say that the Democratic and Republican parties were both moving further to the right, and the Democratic party was telling us that we have to vote for them or else the Republicans would appoint anti-abortionists to the Supreme Court. She said that if we accept that argument, we're going to continue to move to the right with both parties, and the only way to avoid that move to the right was to vote for Nader. (I probably have notes somewhere.)</p>
<p>I think that's significant because many reporters in the major media are advocacy journalists themselves, but don't admit it.</p>
<p>I also think that's significant because it demonstrates that an advocacy journalist can produce better, more objective news than a New York Times or Washington Post reporter.</p>
<p>Can anybody give me a reason not to put it back in? <a href="../../../n/b/a/User%7ENbauman_bc94.html" title="User:Nbauman">Nbauman</a> 08:40, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, Nbauman - First, check the edit history again, and you will see that that was removed by Jersey Devil -- hopefully, he will explain his reasons for that deletion. What I deleted was a completely different paragraph, which was (as I said) "unsourced opinion" -- iow, it was the anon. user's <i>personal opinion</i>, not appropriate for Wikipedia. In general, it <i><b>is</b></i> a bit tricky to describe certain aspects of Amy Goodman's approach to journalism -- things which are readily apparent to regular listeners. The only way to stay clear of <i>personal opinion</i> or <i><a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a></i> is by judicious use of cited sources.

<dd>One of the most important standards of traditional balanced journalism, which she must have learned at Columbia journalism school, is to get both sides of the story, not just the one you agree with.

<dd>For that matter, the Wall Street Journal isn't neutral, nor are most American newspapers, nor do they always claim to be. They support the U.S. in the war in Iraq. When a WSJ reporter in Afghanistan found an al-Qaeda laptop, he shared it with American intelligence. Yet, when the WSJ writes about the war in Iraq, they follow the standards of traditional balanced journalism, which many of their reporters learned at Columbia journalism school, along with Goodman.</dd>

<dd>I hope my just-added line in the intro section about Goodman refraining from interjecting her personal views on-air meets with approval -- I worded it as carefully as I could in hopes of keeping it NPOV.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the article should discuss Goodman's approach to journalism, and I also agree that she frequently invites people with opposing or contrasting viewpoints (though not always, to be sure). But as I suggested above, it's a complex issue that needs to be laid out carefully, with any conclusory judgements coming from cited sources, rather than reflecting our personal opinions on the matter. This is all the more true when it comes to the issue of "advocacy journalism", a term which is very much open to interpretation -- especially for the average reader with little or no background in journalism.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It can be NPOV to describe someone as an <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advocacy_journalism.html" title="Advocacy journalism">advocacy journalist</a>. You agree with that, don't you?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think it's both NPOV and important to describe Goodman as both (1) an <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advocacy_journalism.html" title="Advocacy journalism">advocacy journalist</a> who (2) follows the standards of balanced journalism (that they teach in Columbia journalism school and preach in the New York Times style book). This is a big debate in journalism (the NYT Public Editor wrote several columns about it recently), and she's on one side of it — which is as important as her particular politics.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it's correct to say that she refrains from interjecting her personal views. When she asks a government official, "Why are you continuing to give military aid to East Timor in view of their human rights violations?" that's interjecting her personal views. If you listen to the Bill Clinton interview, it's clear what her personal views on each issue is.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The advocacy journalists say that you should be upfront about your personal views — it's dishonest not to be. If you say she refrains from interjecting her personal views, that's actually accusing her of being dishonest.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The 2 things that distinguish Democracy Now! from similar news media are her politics and her style. Her style is advocacy journalism that beats the major media at their own game of traditional balanced journalism. I think that's important because it demonstrates to advocacy journalists that you can follow the journalism rules and still be effective.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>I think we should call her an advocacy journalist and give a Wiki link to <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advocacy_journalism.html" title="Advocacy journalism">advocacy journalism</a>.

<p>Ha! <i>I told you</i> this was going to be tricky! LOL</p>
<p>I knew <i>somebody</i> was probably going to take issue with my choice of words. But for reasons I can't explain rationally, I went through with it anyway (just to see what would happen, I suppose).</p>
<p>Well, it crossed my mind that I could discuss the (indisputable) fact that listeners can -- for the most part -- easily <b>infer her views</b>, and what she cares about, from the content of her questions and her priorities in terms of issues and guests. But that is <i>not the same thing</i> as directly <b>interjecting her views</b> in the way that the typical radio personality does. And, <b>no,</b> I do not agree that that amounts to accusing her of dishonesty. Don't be ridiculous. What Goodman does is, she makes a point of <b>interjecting a lot of <i>facts</i></b> in her questions, in contrast with the softball, "fact-lite" approach favored by so many mainstream journalists. Unquestionably, the facts that she chooses to marshall are determined by her views &amp; concerns -- <i>just as they are for any other journalist.</i></p>
<p>At the same time, I am continually struck by the low key, generally restrained approach she maintains during the course of the program each day. This is even more apparent when you watch her utter lack of facial expression -- don't forget, the program is broadcast on television, too. (She would need to be subjected to some radical form of retraining &amp; reprogramming before she could ever get hired by a mainstream tv network!)</p>
<p>Now, there have been exceptions -- most notably, I think, the Clinton interview, where she adopted something of a "take no prisoners" approach. But that was atypical -- probably because she had to wing it with no advance preparation, since it happened <i>after</i> she had just finished that day's <i>Democracy Now!</i> broadcast.</p>
<p>Both of these basic aspects of her on-air style &amp; approach to journalism stand in stark contrast to her public speaking style. When she's giving an address to a room full of people, she doesn't observe the same constraints that she does when she's on-air. She holds forth freely &amp; passionately on all the obvious issues, and most amazingly, she even shows signs of having a sense of humor!</p>
<p>Okay, so having said all of this, the problem is that hardly any of it could go into the article because <i>it's mostly "<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original Research</a>"</i> -- unless it's been written up and published in a reputable publication that can be cited.</p>
<p>I haven't even touched on the issue of advocacy journalism or the question of journalistic balance -- both of which are far more complex than has been alluded to so far here. Nbauman, I'm a little concerned about your <i>eagerness</i> to insert both of those assertions into the article. I happen to agree, <i>in general terms,</i> that Goodman can fairly be described as an "advocacy journalist", and that in many (though not all) cases she makes a serious effort to adhere to the standard, "balanced" model of journalism -- but that's not good enough.</p>
<p>The fact that you can make the case <i>to your own personal satisfaction</i> here on the talk page simply doesn't meet the requirements of Wikipedia. Any discussion of those issues in the article needs to be <b>extensively sourced</b>, and each requires a good deal of elaboration in order to convey the nuances &amp; complexities. Otherwise, readers will simply substitute their own notions of what's meant by "balance" or "advocacy journalism".</p>
<p>I'm not by any means suggesting that these subjects should not be addressed in the article. I am simply saying that it needs to be done right. The first step is to find the sources and identify the specific passages that directly support every assertion. Otherwise, every statement is going to be torn to shreds. And bear in mind that, in discussing those issues, the article will need to reflect the views of critics as well as supporters. (I believe that's known as "balanced journalism".&#160;:)</p>

<dd>As a journalist myself I've learned a lot from listening to Amy Goodman, and I've recommended her techniques on journalists' email lists. I think everyone who wants to write about politics on the Internet should understand what she's doing. And I think her Wikipedia entry is a good place to explain it. And it can be done -- it can <i>only</i> be done -- in a NPOV way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It would be a waste of time to fill an encyclopedia with a million and a half entries, each of which is a string of unconnected facts. One of the criteria for Wikipedia is importance. The entry has to convey some important ideas.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What's the important information about Goodman that makes this entry worth reading?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think the most important information is the facts that illustrate why her work is good journalism.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The Internet has made everyone a journalist and a publisher. But now that they have that power, most people don't know how to use it effectively.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>People write for Indymedia, for example, and are eyewitnesses to demonstrations on the ground, and see police brutality and crime that the New York Times doesn't print. But instead of writing about their own eyewitness experience that would captivate their readers, they write bullshit manifestos about corporate power that Chomsky already does better. Instead of interviewing people who understand what corporations are doing better than they do, they write their own term-paper ideas about corporations.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Goodman knows how to do good journalism. She learned it at Columbia journalism school. When I, as a journalist, listen to her interview people (and I've interviewed thousands of people, from friendly to hostile), I can see how she uses her training and experience to get important ideas across to her listeners. The most important journalism-school rule she follows, for example, is to get both sides of the story, and to confront the people on the other side with the ideas of the left (which Indymedia almost never does).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For example, the radio program This American Life once had a piece about some activist who was living in Europe, talked his way into a press conference, and had a chance to ask George H.W. Bush a question. The guy just stumbled something out about nuclear power and the environment, and Bush (who has been confronted with questions like that a hundred times) of course answered, "Yes, we are concerned about the environment, and that's why we're creating this agreement...." and completely disarmed the question. Most activists don't know how to ask questions like that, Goodman does, and journalists can learn a lot from listening to how she does it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Instead of giving her own ideas (which she can do well enough) she lets other people speak for her. The most important thing I've learned from her recently is that I've noticed her pauses. She'll ask somebody a question and just wait. She waits a lot longer than I do. That's very effective.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another thing she does is get two people from different sides together in a room and let them talk it out. She'll let the Israeli ambassador give his position. But she'll have Norman Finkelstein there to check the ambassador's facts point by point. She'll say, "Well, ambassador, what do you say to that?" And just wait.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another thing she does is acknowledge the flaws of her "own" side. She was interviewing an animal activist who was going to jail. She asked him about the charges that the organization he was involved in was engaged in violence (which they were).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We can get everything we need to write the entry from Goodman's own works and from secondary sources on the Internet. Including her critics <i>improves</i> the story, and makes her case stronger, I think.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>An encyclopedia is a kind of history, and history has a purpose. The most important purpose, I think, is to compile <i>useful</i> information. The useful information about Goodman is her politics and the techniques she uses to advance her politics. That's information Internet journalists can use. The school she went to, or the places she visited, or the effusive adjectives heaped on her by commentators, aren't useful unless they support that purpose.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If the entry doesn't get across a few clear, useful ideas, there's no point in writing it. I think that her politics, and the way she uses Columbia journalism school techniques of news reporting to advance her politics, are the clear, useful ideas that give a purpose to this entry. If you want to write this entry, go to the [<a href="http://www.Democracynow.org" class="external text" title="http://www.Democracynow.org" rel="nofollow">Democracynow.org</a>] web site and ask yourself what's important about Amy Goodman. Then start writing. <a href="../../../n/b/a/User%7ENbauman_bc94.html" title="User:Nbauman">Nbauman</a> 18:54, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Nbauman, you've said a lot of things that I agree with. (Especially your comments about folks at Indymedia.) But there's one real problem, which basically comes down to a <b>mismatch</b> between what you are attempting to accomplish and the constraints imposed by Wikipedia's groundrules. Here it is in a nutshell:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"We can get everything we need to write the entry from Goodman's own works and from secondary sources on the Internet."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>That would amount to <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original Research <i>par excellence</i></a>. Very frustrating, to be sure -- but there's no getting around it. So unless we can locate <b>published material</b> that happens to describe &amp; document the sorts of things that we want to put in this article, we're pretty much out of luck, as I see it. <a href="../../../c/g/i/User%7ECgingold_abdb.html" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> 00:03, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
