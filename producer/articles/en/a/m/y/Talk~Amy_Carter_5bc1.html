But this does not support retention of a separate article bcz it raises more questions than it answers. <i>What</i> has she done that justifies an article?</p>
<dl>
<dd>'Graph 1: She's a relative of celebrities (just like the other Carter children). Not notable.</dd>
<dd>'Graph 2: She protested at least twice, got arrested once, got sprung. That could be part of something notable, but no evidence of that has been offered, and the fact that it's pretty thoroughly forgotten creates a presumption of non-notability that Mike has done nothing to overcome.</dd>
<dd>'Graph 3: MS, Married with kid, going on 38. Non-notable. (What was her field? I never knew, and no evidence anyone else remembers; no evidence she uses that presumably high quality education.) Creates a further presumption of non-notability that Mike has done nothing to overcome.</dd>
</dl>
<p>_ _ The article has existed for over 5 months without <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amy_Carter&amp;diff=19752526&amp;oldid=13748742" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amy_Carter&amp;diff=19752526&amp;oldid=13748742" rel="nofollow">anything of substance being added</a> (lets not count the anon vandalism that Mike properly axed) after its first 4 minutes. At least 6 non-vandals have touched it since the original author, and there's a consensus that it's still a stub.<br />
_ _ Leave the merge tag alone; removing it after 17 days, when nothing but stub-refinement, Cats, vandalism, and the Merge proposal has happened in 5.5 months just puts your good faith in question.<br />
_ _ I dunno about anyone else, but i'm in no rush about this; i wouldn't mind giving it another 5.5 months to see whether evidence of her notability accumulates. Don't worry, be happy. We didn't need the article for 4 years, so even if a merge proposal is some kind of scarlet letter, a few months of that for this decisively non-urgent article should be no big deal.<br />
_ _ Take your time, and find us some evidence of notability.<br />

<li>She is notable because she was quite visible during her father's presidency (as was her uncle, but not her brothers). We can add the reference President Carter made about asking her advice about Nuclear Weapons during a speech or debate; this was a somewhat notable event of his presidency/reelection campaign. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_ac1a.html" title="User:NoSeptember"><font color="green">NoSeptember</font></a> 15:36, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>As presidential offspring go, she is certanly among the more notable, and it in fact could be argued that many LESS notable presidential children have separate pages. (George W. Bush's daughters, for instance, have their own page, and aside from their underage drinking incident, neither has done much of anything noteworthy, thus far.) If nothing else, Amy Carter's activism and her association with Abbie Hoffman distinguish her from many of her "White House kids" contemporaries. It is doesn't seem unreasonable that she should have her own page. --Markt3 01:04, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I added that she illustrated a children's book with her father, and I believe this ties in with her major (I believe she majored in art history, but don't hold me to that).

<dd>_ _ Oh, gosh, she <i>is</i> notable; i forgot all the fuss that was made over that book -- no, wait a minit, i guess i'm thinking of Harry Potter. &lt;/snark&gt;<br /></dd>
<dd>_ _ Which is to say that (with whatever admirable or embarrassing motivation) she's competant to hold onto his coattails. She may even be supporting hubby in the style he's accustomed to with her illustrations for brochures and her unique velvet-painting style, but i'd still see nothing notable. Who reviewed the kids' book? How long was it in stores nationwide?<br /></dd>
<dd>_ _ We already mention <i>that</i> they spoke abt policy, but it would be more notable if they <i>never</i> had. If you can come up with <i>how</i>, that might be notable if it's verifiable: it would be cited as an insight into how he lost his way at the helm of a superpower! Which is to say, don't hold your breath until you find out.<br /></dd>

<dd>This is ridiculous. The article already exists, so it's not as if we're debating on whether to create it or not. Amy Carter is a widely known daughter of a president. She's just as "notable" as Chelsea Clinton is/was. At least for the next 30 or 40 years I think she's notable. Beyond that she may fade into the anals of forgotten presidential daughters. Is there some precious resource this article is taking up that needs to be "recycled", so we need to take a hard line on "notability"? Paper encyclopedias, and even DVD encyclopedias need to be edited for size constraints. With the cheapness of hard drive space I fail to see why this article should be removed or merged into the Jimmy Carter page. If it were it would only be <b>more</b> distracting from the Jimmy Carter page. Hell, this discussion (or really what just amounts to the whining of one person who sounds like they have some grudge) takes up FAR more resources than the single Amy Carter page. Oh, and looking through all the guidelines, nowhere do I see "notability" as a requirement for an article in Wikipedia, so this entire discussion is rather moot. Maybe you're referring to vanity pages, which obviously don't belong in an encyclopedia. This is obviously not a vanity article, so I see no issue here. So, as you see the impetus is not for anyone to justify the Amy Carter page, but for anyone thinking it should be merged to justify it. This hasn't been done. If you can do that, please do, otherwise remove the "merge" link. Vellmont
<dl>
<dd>Just on general principles, I agree with this. Sometimes it seems that there's a "merge mania" here on WP. While I can understand merging two articles that basically discuss the same thing, it seems too often to be used as a way of eliminating articles that some people feel "aren't important" enough. Really -- the reason that I come to Wikipedia, and the reason I find it so interesting, isn't because it's a replacement for Encyclopedia Britannica; if it was, I'd just read E.B. and be done with it. No, I read it because it has vast articles on all sorts of niche (some might say, bizarre) topics. This is a GOOD THING. Amy Carter isn't Jimmy Carter; she's been famous enough to have a few articles written about her in the mainstream press...she gets her own WP page. Any time two pages that aren't closely related to the point of duplication are merged together, content is very often lost -- or at least the possibility of adding more content is lost. I think we should take a very light approach to merging, and when there is any doubt that something deserves a separate article, give it one. There's no limit to the number that WP can have, so why throw out information? --<a href="../../../k/a/d/User%7EKadin2048_74a5.html" title="User:Kadin2048">Kadin2048</a> 06:19, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It would be a shame to let this discussion close without mention of what justifies doing so -- since not a word on this talk page does. (The level of Wiki-insight in the arguement of Vellmont (<a href="../../../v/e/l/User_talk%7EVellmont_4d16.html" title="User talk:Vellmont">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vellmont_c53e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vellmont">contribs</a>) is quite understandable, but their personal attacks on me will preclude my helping orient them. BTW &amp; in contrast, Mike, a few months more experienced here, has shown himself more reasonable to me elsewhere than how, on this page, he lets himself continue to appear.)

Corrected her surname at the top of the page and put in a short sentence about it. Looked back at the archives (Sept. 29, 2005), whoever changed it didn't provide an explanation, let alone a link. However, the Christian Science Monitor article that's already linked at the bottom clearly says that she still has her own name. Ariadne55 17:27, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
