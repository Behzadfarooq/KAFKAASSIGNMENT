<p>I apologize for appearing to use Wikipedia incorrectly, I was simply trying to add this information to the Encyclopedia. Can someone point me in the right direction for doing so? I looked at other additions for hints, but am striking out...</p>
<p>Although I do have verifiable sources for everything posted, I simply took down any information that may be construed as a fact without appropriate backing.</p>
<p>If you look at other company articles on Wikipedia, they basically do the same thing I was trying to do with our sites - just trying to inform people about this organization. What is keeping these other companies up on Wikipedia?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Both articles that you seem to be the only persn working on are proposed to be deleted. I would assume that that both entries are <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_page.html" title="Vanity page">vanity articles</a> and your only purpose here is to spam Wikipedia by adding links that appear to promote products by pointing to obscure or not particularly relevant commercial sites. Vanity articles that make no plausible claim of notability are usually deleted shortly after creation. It might be a good idea to familiarize yourself with Wikipedia policies before you continue. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYankees76_f29c.html" title="User:Yankees76">Yankees76</a> 13:40, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>[I am trying to contribute information regarding companies I am involved with and am having trouble doing so because of certain restrictions. I have read Wikipedia’s usage guidelines, however, cannot figure out why my pages are under negative scrutiny. I am happy to comply with any rules that I am so far apparently not following if someone could point me in the right direction. While going through all the rules, I came across the below specifics that I feel apply the most. I am not trying to publish a “vanity” article, but because I am a newbie, I am having trouble with this. Please let me know how I can fix this as I would like to have these pages remain on Wikipedia! Thank you.</p>
<p>“While an article about a little-known company, say, should not automatically be taken as a vanity article, it is preferable for the initial author not to be an owner, employee of, or investor in the company”</p>
<p>“An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous.”</p>
<p>“The key rule is to not write about yourself, nor about the things you've done or created. If they are encyclopedic, somebody else will notice them and write an article about them.”</p>
<p>“If there is nothing particularly offensive about the page, please be kind to the newbie. Suggestion: before beginning any deletion procedures on a vanity article, it is sometimes found that by simply politely informing the creator of the article that this appears to be a vanity article, and by pointing him or her to this page first, that the author him or her self will sometimes easily agree to the deletion him or herself, thus saving much waste of time and energy on the parts of all concerned parties.”]</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is neutral point of view. Your first line says it all "<i>companies I am involved with</i>". I can see clearly now why both articles are AfD. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYankees76_f29c.html" title="User:Yankees76">Yankees76</a> 21:38, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Amykocot, I'm sorry your first month on Wikipedia hasn't been such a great success. Unfortunately it looks like nobody presented you with a wecome message that contains lots of the stuff you need to survive editing (it can be very stressful on here...); I know this is well overdue but I also hope that it isn't too late&#160;:-)</p>
<p><br />
<b>Welcome!</b></p>
<p>Hello, Amykocot, and <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcome%2C_newcomers_06aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers">welcome</a> to Wikipedia! Thank you for your contributions. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Here are some pages that you might find helpful:</p>

Again, welcome!&#160;</p>
<p>One of the things you need to be aware of is <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">the "spamming" policy</a>. The two company articles you produced weren't an evil act, but they were quite small and don't really belong in an encyclopedia. The phrase that gets used to describe that is "non-notable". There's more information on what gets considered a notable company at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. What really annoyed people <i>a lot</i> was when you started putting external links to those companies at a whole bunch of other articles. That's seen as blatant advertising and people got quite fed up with it. That's why, quite early on, people gave you a warning message linked to <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>. There's also a policy called <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> - it means presenting information from a "neutral point of view". Things that look like ads go against NPOV, that's why it can be really hard to write about businesses here.</p>
<p>However, and this probably can't be said loudly enough, <b><big>please come back, despite all the scary messages, we actually really want you!</big></b></p>
<p>You sound, according to your message, like you really want to add information to the Wikipedia. That's great! We really need that! But until you get a feel for how things work here, try to avoid writing about small companies and people you are closely involved with. If you do want to write about Geary and Speak Inc, the best place to do it is at the <a href="http://www.yellowikis.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://www.yellowikis.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">business directory wiki</a>, rather than here. But there are some things where we need your help! You sound like you come from California - we have a really good and very busy California department you can join, and there's lots of work you can help with!</p>
<ul>
