<p>Amy first appeared in the show being dragged along to her sister <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Barnes_5699.html" title="Sarah Barnes">Sarah's</a> swimming training. She was bored and jealous of the attention Sarah was getting from her mum for the swimming. At home Amy was embarrassed when her dad <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Barnes_89b2.html" title="Mike Barnes">Mike</a> started doing silly things in front of her best friend <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michaela_McQueen_cede.html" title="Michaela McQueen">Michaela McQueen</a>, who found Amy's dad quite funny as she didn't have a dad of her own. Amy was also furious that her dad had quit his high paying job and she couldn't go on a holiday with Michaela's family.</p>
<p>At school Amy helped Michaela and Sarah get their own back on <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Ashworth_109f.html" title="Josh Ashworth">Josh Ashworth</a> and his cousin <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie__Fletch__Fletcher_5ac8.html" title="Jamie &quot;Fletch&quot; Fletcher">Jamie "Fletch" Fletcher</a> after they stole the Year 12 "Fit List" and put themselves on it. Michaela told the boys that needed to strip off in front of the Year 12 girls in a parade but they ended up stripping off for Amy and Michaela's P.E. class.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Barnes_4f2c.html" title="Edit section: Relationship with Ste Hay">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Relationship with Ste Hay</span></h3>
<p>Michaela introduced Amy to her boyfriend <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Tunnicliffe_a6a6.html" title="Wayne Tunnicliffe">Wayne Tunnicliffe</a>'s best friend <a href="../../../s/t/e/Ste_Hay_08e0.html" title="Ste Hay">Ste Hay</a>. Amy fancied Ste but didn't know how to ask him out. The two eventually started dating and Michaela pressured Amy into having sex with Ste. Amy was reluctant to sleep with him but ended up losing her <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginity.html" title="Virginity">virginity</a> in the back of Ste's older brother's car. Amy was put off after having such a bad first time but Michaela told her it would get better the more times she did it.</p>
<p>Amy refused to be pressured to have sex with Ste again, so she dumped him. Michaela told Amy that Wayne had to stopped talking to her, because she dumped Ste. Michaela then turned against her best friend leaving Amy devastated.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Barnes_4f2c.html" title="Edit section: First fight with Michaela">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">First fight with Michaela</span></h3>
<p>Michaela launched a hate campaign against Amy and wrote bad things on the female toilet walls about Amy being a slapper. <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie__Fletch__Fletcher_5ac8.html" title="Jamie &quot;Fletch&quot; Fletcher">Fletch</a> saw how upset Amy had become and tried to cheer her up by insulting Ste by calling him a neanderthal but Ste and Michaela were both behind him and Ste pushed him against a wall. <a href="../../../j/o/s/Josh_Ashworth_109f.html" title="Josh Ashworth">Josh</a> tried to hold Ste off but it was Amy who threatened to get a teacher if he didn't get off Fletch.</p>
<p>The following day Sarah noticed that something was wrong with Amy and she told her about Ste and Michaela. Sarah tried to help her sister, but later that day Amy and Michaela got into a physical fight. The two were given a <a href="../../../d/e/t/Detention_%28academia%29.html" title="Detention (academia)">detention</a> and her parents were called in.</p>
<p>The following week Michaela made up with Amy when she realised that Wayne was also using her.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Barnes_4f2c.html" title="Edit section: Writing contest">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Writing contest</span></h3>
<p>During a writing competition for the reward of £100, Amy found it difficult to come up with anything, so her father <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Barnes_89b2.html" title="Mike Barnes">Mike</a> tried to show her how to write a story, only to get caught up and ended up writing a full story on his own. Amy kept Mike's story and entered it into the competition. The story ended up winning and she had to read out the story in a school assembly where her parents could be invited. Michaela also had to read her story out as it came runner up (she wrote about breaking up with Wayne). Amy felt very guilty after winning the competition but Michaela told her to lie to her parents and tell them the assembly was for students only. This plan backfired when her parents rang the school up to ask if they could come and Mike eventually found out about his story being used. Amy then found out she had actually won £100 worth of book tokens and Mike told her that he wasn't mad at her for stealing his story and that it had inspired him to become a writer.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Barnes_4f2c.html" title="Edit section: Family fallout">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Family fallout</span></h3>
<p>Amy and Michaela were invited to a party but Amy couldn't get hold of any money because of her dad quitting work. Amy was then encouraged by Michaela to go shoplifting for a dress for the party, but the shoplifting didn't stop at a dress and the two started stealing from the local shop, <b>Drive 'n' Buy</b>. On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_8.html" title="June 8">8 June</a>, Amy was eventually caught by <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Cunningham_9898.html" title="Max Cunningham">Max Cunningham</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Cunningham_ed01.html" title="Tom Cunningham">Tom Cunningham</a>. Michaela got away, but Amy's mum <a href="../../../k/a/t/Kathy_Barnes_a131.html" title="Kathy Barnes">Kathy</a> and sister Sarah were disgusted by Amy when they found out. She seemed to cause her mother nothing but trouble with her friendship with Michaela and her mom looked down on the whole McQueen family.</p>
<p>She overheard her parents arguing, and her Mum calling her "trailer trash", which upset her. Mike managed to persuade Kathy to put on a birthday party for Amy, despite her being grounded for the shoplifting. But Amy snuck out of her house and met Michaela in the local park where they illegally drank alcohol. The pair were eventually joined by some local lads and she "got chatting" with a boy called Billy. They then had unprotected sex in the bushes. Later that night, when she returned home drunk, Mike lost his temper and ordered her out of his sight.</p>

<p>She later found out that she was <a href="../../../p/r/e/Pregnancy.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnant</a> - from the sex she had with Billy - after an unusually supportive Michaela advised her to take a pregnancy test after she had been sick, only for it to confirm Amy's fears. Michaela told her new friend <a href="../../../s/a/s/Sasha_Valentine_30a5.html" title="Sasha Valentine">Sasha Valentine</a> about Amy's pregnancy, despite Amy not wanting anyone else to know. Michaela then made Amy tell Billy about her pregnancy.</p>
<p>Amy, Sasha and Michaela met with Billy and two of his friends outside school and Michaela angry told him about Amy being pregnant. Billy didn't want to believe her and called Amy a slag and walked off. Micheala then told Amy that she could prove Billy was the father of her baby, but Amy had her mind on how she was going to break the news to her parents.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Barnes_4f2c.html" title="Edit section: Almost a confession">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Almost a confession</span></h3>
<p>On Kathy's 40th birthday, Amy was just about to tell Kathy she was pregnant when <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilly_Roach_d85b.html" title="Gilly Roach">Gilly Roach</a> let slip that <a href="../../../r/h/y/Rhys_Ashworth_9212.html" title="Rhys Ashworth">Rhys Ashworth</a> - Sarah's ex-boyfriend - had slept with Kathy when he was still seeing Sarah. Kathy was then thrown out of the family home by Mike, leaving Amy devastated and yet to tell her family the news of her pregnancy.</p>
<p>Amy (with the help of Michaela) made an appointment for an <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abortion.html" title="Abortion">abortion</a> but changed her mind when Michaela failed to show up with her, because her brother <a href="../../../j/o/h/John-Paul_McQueen_fc5e.html" title="John-Paul McQueen">John-Paul</a> had borrowed her phone. Mike and Sarah moved into the Owens' old apartment when Kathy returned with no alternative place to live. Amy joined Mike and Sarah after arguing with her mum, saying she doesn't care and she doesn't listen. When Kathy came to say goodbye to her family, Mike invited her to stay so that they could give their relationship a second chance, "for the girls' sake".</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Barnes_4f2c.html" title="Edit section: Joyriding">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Joyriding</span></h3>
<p>Trying to forget her unwanted pregnancy, she decided to play the part of a bad girl. She got back with <a href="../../../s/t/e/Ste_Hay_08e0.html" title="Ste Hay">Ste Hay</a>, even though Michaela tried to tell her that Ste would run a mile if he knew about her pregnancy. During her realtionship with Ste she started noticing bruses on him, Ste then revealed to her that he was being abused by his new step Dad.</p>
<p>She went round to Josh Ashworth's house after he copied a DVD for Ste. Ste saw Josh's dad's keys on the table and he, Amy, Josh and Fletch took <a href="../../../n/e/v/Neville_Ashworth_07be.html" title="Neville Ashworth">Neville Ashworth</a>'s car for a spin.</p>
<p>Amy loved rush of joyriding, so when she, Michaela, Josh and Fletch were walking home from school and Ste approached the group in a stolen <a href="../../../b/m/w/BMW_bcb4.html" title="BMW">BMW</a>, Amy was the first one to jump in the car. She then encouraged the other to get in with her. Ste drove the car over town and was almost caught by the police but Ste lost them and told the others to get out of the car while he ditched it. Amy wanted to stay with him but eventually got out.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Barnes_4f2c.html" title="Edit section: The crash">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The crash</span></h3>
<p>Michaela then started to compete with Amy for Ste's attention, telling her that Ste wouldn't want her with her child so he was up for grabs. The two started to think of ways to impress Ste Amy suggested they skive school to steal a car and going <a href="../../../j/o/y/Joyride_%28crime%29.html" title="Joyride (crime)">joyriding</a> again. Josh and Fletch over heard Amy's suggestion and Amy wound the pair up by telling Ste that the pair thought he wasn't a good driver. Ste invited the cousins to come with them but they refused.</p>
<p>The girls and Ste stole a car and drove around for a bit before going back to school, where they saw Josh and Fletch walking home. Ste threatened them with a beating if they didn't do as he told them. Ste wanted to scare the two lads and ditch them in the countryside to walk home.</p>
<p>Whilst Ste was driving Amy egged on Ste to keep driving faster, and he lost of control of the car when he turned round to ask the cousins if they liked his driving. The car crashed when it sped off the motorway and down a slope. Ste, Michaela, Josh and Fletch were all fine, but Amy hadn't been wearing her seat belt and was left motionless. Ste threatened Josh, Fletch and Michaela if they told the police he was driving and he fled the scene. Michaela and Fletch pulled Amy out of the wrecked car, whilst Josh thought about running away like Ste. Fletch told him to stay and the police arrived. Fletch told the police about Ste and he and Josh were arrested whilst Michaela went with Amy to hospital.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Barnes_4f2c.html" title="Edit section: Verge of death">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Verge of death</span></h3>
<p>Amy was taken to hospital, where she was still <a href="../../../u/n/c/Unconsciousness.html" title="Unconsciousness">unconscious</a>. Amy's family was called to the hospital and Michaela was then arrested for joyriding but was let out the next day. Kathy blamed Michaela for Amy's condition but Michaela was just about to tell Mike and Kathy about Amy's pregnancy, when she suddenly woke up from her unconscious state. Amy was left wondering weather her baby had survived the accident and whether Michaela had told her parents about her pregnancy.</p>
<p>Josh's mum <a href="../../../s/u/z/Suzanne_Ashworth_8a7c.html" title="Suzanne Ashworth">Suzanne Ashworth</a>, who was working as a nurse at the hospital, found out about Amy's secret and tried to persuade her to tell her parents, but Amy still refused. Together they listened for the baby's heartbeat, and they confirmed that the baby was still alive. Amy soon recovered and went to a court hearing where she, Michaela, Josh and Fletch were sentenced to community service.</p>
<p>After which, Michaela became sick of everyone trying to blame her for the accident so she stormed out on Amy in the time that she needed her most and refused to speak to her at all. Michaela ended their friendship by telling Amy that she meant nothing to her anymore.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Barnes_4f2c.html" title="Edit section: Relationship with Josh Ashworth">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Relationship with Josh Ashworth</span></h3>
<p>After finishing her community service, Amy decided to learn her lesson and stopped with her bad girl attitude. At school she was assigned to do a project with Josh. Josh started to like Amy, so he bought her a present and took the risk of asking her out. To his joy she said yes and they kissed. Amy only said yes to Josh because of her fallout with Michaela and she didn't want to be alone during her pregnancy.</p>
<p>After asking her for help with his <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algebra.html" title="Algebra">algebra</a>, Josh surprised her with a family dinner. Amy felt the pressure as Suzanne hinted for her to reveal her secret. Amy left the table to go to the toilet, and Suzanne confronted her in the hall, warning her to stay away from Josh, and pointed out that if Amy wasn't pregnant she wouldn't be going out with Josh.</p>
<p>Amy then broke up with Josh, so he started moping around the house until his brother Rhys and Rhys's best mate Gilly suggested he write down his heartbreak into a song. This gave Josh the idea to write a song for Amy called "I'm in Love". Josh persuaded his cousin Fletch to record the music and together they sung the song at Josh's sister, <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hannah_Ashworth_9d16.html" title="Hannah Ashworth">Hannah Ashworth</a>'s 18th birthday party.</p>
<p>Amy ran out, embarrassed because Suzanne was standing next to her. Josh followed her outside and told Fletch to carry on singing by himself. Amy told Josh that she ran out because she didn't want the school to know she had been dating Josh, but admitted that it was sweet of him to create a song for her and the two got back together.</p>
<p>She tried to tell Josh that she was pregnant when he invited her over to dinner, but was interrupted as baby Charlie was snatched by <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Burton_4578.html" title="Justin Burton">Justin Burton</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonny_Valentine_f4f7.html" title="Sonny Valentine">Sonny Valentine</a> in a car.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Barnes_4f2c.html" title="Edit section: Giving birth">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Giving birth</span></h3>
<p>Amy started feeling stomach pains at school. When Josh saw her in pain, she told him it was <a href="../../../p/r/e/Premenstrual_syndrome.html" title="Premenstrual syndrome">PMS</a>. Later, when Josh saw her holding her stomach, he told her that his mum had an Aroma Therapy cushion for her stomach pains. Amy was reluctant to go round until she found out that Suzanne was at work.</p>
<p>At Josh's house, he asked her if she would like some music on, and when he left to get a CD from Hannah's room, Amy's water broke. She quickly left the Ashworths' to go to her own house - meanwhile, Josh found the water on his bed and assumed she had wet herself.</p>
<p>Amy managed to get home but found no one there, and Josh rang Amy's mobile but she dropped it whilst in pain. Josh left a message saying the bed didn't matter and that he hoped she was okay. Back at the Barnes' house Sarah and Mike arrived and heard Amy screaming in agony. Mike and Sarah didn't know what was wrong until Amy came clean. Sarah asked Amy how far apart the pain was and Amy told her a few minutes. They phoned an ambulance but it was delayed. Mike and Sarah delivered Amy's daughter on the kitchen floor. Kathy then came in and could hardly believe her eyes. Finally the ambulance arrived and took Amy and the baby to the hospital.</p>

<p>Whilst taking the baby out for the first time, the Barnes family were approached by <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frankie_Osborne_f772.html" title="Frankie Osborne">Frankie Osborne</a>, and when questioned about the baby's parentage Kathy claimed to be the baby's mother.</p>
<p>Sarah told Amy she shouldn't give her to Kathy and she should try to bond with her and give her a name. Amy picked up her baby and whispered "little Leah" in her ear and then decided to give it to her mother. She is having a lot of trouble bonding with Leah, being unable to hold her and even look at her.</p>

<p>When she returned back to school she told her classmates she had a new baby sister, despite both Michaela and Sarah trying to convince her to claim Leah as her own. When Sasha found out about Kathy having a baby she realised that Amy hadn't gone through with the abortion as she had originally thought. Michaela kept going on at Amy to tell the truth but Amy told Michaela that if she did social services would take Leah away and put her up for adoption. Later Michaela stood up to Amy and told her that she shouldn't blackmail her and that social services really would take Leah away if she didn't tell people the truth about who her mum was.</p>

<p>One time her mum told her to look after Leah while she went for a meeting about maternity leave. Kathy told Amy if Leah started crying than she probably just wanted a hug. As soon as she left Leah started crying but Amy ignored her and went to her room and started listening to music. Kathy was furious when she came home to Leah screaming her head off.</p>
<p>When in the village with Michaela, Kathy asked Amy go to the shops to get nappies, and just then Suzanne came out and saw Kathy with baby Leah and realised Amy had had her baby. She almost revealed that she knew of Amy's pregnancy, but when she heard Kathy say she was Leah's mother she kept quite and returned to work. <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darren_Osborne_a757.html" title="Darren Osborne">Darren Osborne</a> then approached Leah and made a joke about <a href="../../../r/h/y/Rhys_Ashworth_9212.html" title="Rhys Ashworth">Rhys Ashworth</a> being the father of Kathy's supposed baby.</p>

<p>Amy found out from Michaela that Josh had the <a href="../../../f/l/u/Flu.html" title="Flu">flu</a> but had managed to organise a party with Fletch. Amy wanted to know why Josh hadn't invited her and she tried to text him, but he didn't receive her messages. She snuck out of her house and went to the party where she started drinking heavily. Josh went over to see if she was alright and told her he didn't receive any of her texts. She then asked him to go upstairs to his room where she tried to seduce him, but Josh didn't want to take advantage of her when she was drunk. Michaela then burst in and assumed Josh was about to take advantage of her best mate. Michaela dragged Amy home leaving a confused Josh behind. When they got home Sarah was waiting for her and Michaela left.</p>

<p>Amy later made herself some toast and when Leah started crying, she reluctantly picked her up and rocked her. It appeared that she was beginning to bond with her daughter but Kathy came in and angrily ordered Amy give Leah over to her. Amy hesitated but eventually handed Leah over. Kathy then told her to go to her room and that she'd deal with her later. After a visit from the health inspector Amy realised she wanted Leah for herself but can't seem to tell her mother.</p>

<p>After reading Amy's diary Mike took it upon himself to drag her out of school and march her off the doctors to put her on "<a href="../../../c/o/m/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill.html" title="Combined oral contraceptive pill">the Pill</a>". Amy had tried to tell Mike that she was not sleeping with Josh but he refused to listen. The doctor spoke to Amy privately and listened to what she had to say. The doctor gave Amy some leaflets and sent her home with a very displeased Mike. When at home, Amy tried once more to tell Mike that she wasn't sleeping with Josh, he again didn't listen. He admitted in the heat of the moment that he had read Amy's diary, which infuriated her. To make matters worse, Amy then walked in on Sarah saying that she (Sarah) "would never be so stupid as to get pregnant at 15". Amy then said that she was going to see Josh, but Mike blocked the doorway. She ran into her room, screaming at her dad that she hated him. Lying on her bed, crying, she phoned Josh and told him that her dad had said they couldn't see each other anymore.</p>

<p>After their parents saying they couldn't see each other anymore, Amy and Josh met up secretly in Hollyoaks alley way. Josh said they were like <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romeo_and_Juliet_141f.html" title="Romeo and Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a>. They made plans for him to climb through Amy's bedroom window so that they could spend time together in secret. This succeeded and they lay on Amy's bed talking, when Josh commented that it was stupid to get pregnant at 15. Then Amy said that if Josh didn't like the sound of a baby crying he should leave, and he told Amy he didn't mean it. They were nearly caught by Mike but Josh hid in the cupboard. While he was in the cupboard, Mike made a comment that suggested Amy was Leah's real mum, but Josh didn't seem to pick up on this. When Mike was gone, Josh said his goodbyes to Amy and escaped back out of the window.</p>
