<p>Despite her frequent use in Sega games (especially since the Dreamcast era), Amy was not actually created by <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Team_81bb.html" title="Sonic Team">Sonic Team</a>; her first incarnation appeared in the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28manga%29_aefb.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (manga)"><i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> manga</a> published in 1992, and there she was literally "the girlfriend of Nikki (Sonic)", as the description translates. After that appearance, <a href="../../../s/e/g/Sega.html" title="Sega">Sega</a> took the character, and Kazayuki Hoshino redesigned her for <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_CD_7acc.html" title="Sonic CD">Sonic CD</a></i> in 1993. In her original look, she had a blonde ponytail with a green ribbon, and she wore a peach-colored dress with a bow in the back. It's quite likely that she was based on the Nintendo character, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Peach_8c84.html" title="Princess Peach">Princess Peach</a> from the Mario franchise. It is said that she is always wearing running shoes so she can catch up to her beloved Sonic.</p>

Sonic and Amy Rose (as her early character design from <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_CD_7acc.html" title="Sonic CD">Sonic CD</a></i>.)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In her first game appearance, <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_CD_7acc.html" title="Sonic CD">Sonic CD</a></i> (1993), Amy was introduced and kidnapped by <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Sonic_2d90.html" title="Metal Sonic">Metal Sonic</a>. <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_Robotnik_6676.html" title="Doctor Robotnik">Doctor Robotnik</a> then used the time stones to set time back on the Little Planet. Next, Robotnik forced Sonic to challenge Metal Sonic to a race to save Amy and won. Amy was rescued and Metal Sonic was destroyed for the time being. She had the nickname "Rosy the Rascal" at this point, and was named "<a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Sally_6275.html" title="Princess Sally">Princess Sally</a>" in the Western manuals to tie in with the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28TV_series%29_fa83.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)">cartoon</a>, though all later games called her Amy. Being a Genesis-era game (though technically a Sega CD game), Sonic CD's plot was minimal. Amy's only personality trait was that she was a big fan of Sonic, and no real reason was given for her kidnapping besides as bait for Sonic. Though Sonic CD was released after <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_2_31dd.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog 2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a></i>, it was in production at the same time, meaning that Amy has more or less been around as long as <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miles__Tails__Prower_8fae.html" title="Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower">Tails</a>.</p>
<p>Amy appeared again in <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Drift_b52d.html" title="Sonic Drift">Sonic Drift</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Drift_2_6ea2.html" title="Sonic Drift 2">Sonic Drift 2</a></i> to race in a Grand Prix. She was a playable character in the 1996 arcade game <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Fighters_9837.html" title="Sonic the Fighters">Sonic the Fighters</a></i>, In 1997's <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_R_7190.html" title="Sonic R">Sonic R</a></i>, Amy was the only character to drive a car - everyone else ran on foot (or in Robotnik's case, drove an Eggmobile).</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Fighters_9837.html" title="Sonic the Fighters">Sonic the Fighters</a></i> introduced her Piko Piko Hammer. She had excellent dodging capabilities, very good attacks, a numerous amount of attacks that can break her opponents' sheilds, and arguably, the most comical attacks. This game used her "Rosy the Rascal" nickname as well, though it has not been seen since.</p>
<p>In 1999, <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Adventure_238d.html" title="Sonic Adventure">Sonic Adventure</a></i> thrust Amy in the spotlight. Her spines were redesigned into short hair being slacked down, and she now wore a red dress and red boots with a white stripe from the top to the tip to take advantage of her (relatively) more mature 12-year-old form. She was given green eyes, the same eye color as Sonic had. In the game she is a playable character and uses her weapon of choice, the Piko Piko Hammer to defend herself during her quest to find the family of her Flicky. The only stages she can play are <i>Twinkle Park</i>, <i>Hot Shelter</i>, and <i>Final Egg</i>. At the end of <i>Sonic Adventure</i>, Amy decided that she needed to become stronger and more capable, and thus begins to train herself.</p>
<p>When <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Shuffle_902f.html" title="Sonic Shuffle">Sonic Shuffle</a></i> was released for the Dreamcast, Amy, as well as Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles collected rings and other items while walking around on a board game surface. Amy's abilities did not really differ from the other characters. All the characters had the same speed and jumping capabilities. The only difference was her hammer which allowed her to access different parts of the stage that the others could not. Another noticeable change in the game is her feelings toward Sonic. She doesn't start any romantic conversations with Sonic or mention anything about her crush towards him.</p>
<p>She was merely a supporting character in <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Adventure_2_5c38.html" title="Sonic Adventure 2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></i>, but was playable in 2-player mode. When Sonic was locked up, it was she who saved the trapped hedgehog. This happened to be one of the suprisingly many times Amy has saved Sonic rather than the usual opposite. She also suggested Sonic marry her in exchange for telling him where Shadow was, although it didn't really work. She also helped Shadow uncover the real promise Maria gave him: "To give the people a chance to be happy".</p>
<p>Amy was playable in <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Advance_ccf0.html" title="Sonic Advance">Sonic Advance</a></i>, but was the most difficult to play with as she could not spin and all her attacks had to be triggered. She had an unlockable playable appearance in <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Advance_2_2528.html" title="Sonic Advance 2">Sonic Advance 2</a></i> (the player had to collect all seven <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos_Emeralds_d08a.html" title="Chaos Emeralds">Chaos Emeralds</a> with all the other characters), as well as <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Advance_3_ab89.html" title="Sonic Advance 3">Sonic Advance 3</a></i>, in which she again teams up with Sonic, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miles_Prower_d9bd.html" title="Miles Prower">Tails</a>, <a href="../../../k/n/u/Knuckles_the_Echidna_5c32.html" title="Knuckles the Echidna">Knuckles</a>, and <a href="../../../c/r/e/Cream_the_Rabbit_7a9b.html" title="Cream the Rabbit">Cream</a>. At this point, it seems that her skills are improving, as she is no longer as slow as she was in the original <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Adventure_238d.html" title="Sonic Adventure">Sonic Adventure</a></i>. She can become <i>Super Amy Rose</i> when she collects all seven Chaos Emeralds on her own.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Heroes_142a.html" title="Sonic Heroes">Sonic Heroes</a></i>, Amy leads Team Rose. She represents the team's speed formation which really shows off her speedy talents and stronger self after training for a while. She's accompanied by Cream the Rabbit and <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_the_Cat_9a8e.html" title="Big the Cat">Big the Cat</a> on a mission to impress Sonic, while Big wants to find his friend Froggy (again), and Cream and <a href="../../../c/r/e/Cream_the_Rabbit_7a9b.html#Cheese_the_Chao" title="Cream the Rabbit">Cheese</a> want to find Cheese's sibling, Chocola. At this point, Amy's skills have improved a lot in this game. She goes at an incredible speed in this game. She plows forward with even more confidence this time, no longer having nervous reactions to her speed or attack abilities as she does in <i>Sonic Adventure 2</i>, and she inspires the whole team, cheering her friends on, and she doesn't let them give up.</p>
<p>Amy appears in <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Battle_0761.html" title="Sonic Battle">Sonic Battle</a></i> as a playable character. Surprisingly, she is one of the stongest and most reliable characters in the game. All of her attacks contain large amounts of speed and power, her healing ability can quickly raise her HP, and she's the third fastest character. She takes the role of a mother figure for <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emerl.html" title="Emerl">Emerl</a> and teaches him boxercise and how it is important to protect those you care for. In-game dialogue shows that her crush on Sonic has reached new heights - now she assumes that he wants to raise children with her (although her delusion this time really came from one of Tails comments). In the game, she is incredibly defensive about Emerl, crushing several <a href="../../../e/-/s/E-Series_4a17.html" title="E-Series">E-121 Phi</a> robots who try to destroy him, and often clashes with <a href="../../../r/o/u/Rouge_the_Bat_0118.html" title="Rouge the Bat">Rouge the Bat</a>, who wants to use Emerl for herself. It is revealed that she got stronger as quick as she did by wearing weights whenever she trained, which eventually exhausted her.</p>

Sonic and Amy from Episode 52 of <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_X_c94d.html" title="Sonic X">Sonic X</a></i>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In Sonic X, Amy is Sonic's self proclaimed girlfriend. Her long-term goal is to get him to notice her. She gets mad at Sonic's impatience and aloof attitude, which occasionally are so bad that she is driven to violence. However, she really does care about him. Amy grows to understand Sonic more as time goes by, even learning the reason he loves to run when she uses a race-car to travel at sonic speed. She also tries to help him with things, including making a "lucky" bracelet of shells so he won't drown. Episode 76 highlighted that Amy is willing to die to save Sonic's life when she tries to save him from Dark Oak's planet, knowing that she would later be without a means to escape from the planet herself.</p>
<p>Despite his annoyance at her antics, Sonic's feelings are still unclear about her. In Episode 52, Sonic gave her a rose after a particularly long absence, and afterwards (in the Japanese version) he says something to Amy but it is muted. In the American version he says he would never leave Amy, and in the French version he says he loves Amy. In Sonic X the comic issue 16, it shows that Sonic actually took Amy on a date since it was Valentines Day. Amy had once dressed up so beautifully that it left him speechless. Sonic has also put himself at risk by diving into the water to rescue an unconscious Amy in Episode 9, even though he knows <i>very</i> well that he cannot swim.</p>

Amy's official comic profile picture.</div>

</div>
<p>In the <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28comics%29_3648.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></i> comic, Amy is the youngest member of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_Fighters_%28Sonic_the_Hedgehog%29_f5d0.html" title="Freedom Fighters (Sonic the Hedgehog)">Freedom Fighters</a>, and has a crush on Sonic that he tends to ignore.</p>
<p>Amy is the cousin of <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_characters_in_Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28Archie%29_4565.html#Rob_O.27_the_Hedge" title="Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie)">Rob O' the Hedge</a> (a thinly veiled homage to Robin Hood), who sends her to live in <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knothole.html" title="Knothole">Knothole</a> as things get tough in their homeland of Mercia. Echoing her introduction in <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_CD_7acc.html" title="Sonic CD">Sonic CD</a></i>, she was captured by <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Sonic_2d90.html" title="Metal Sonic">Metal Sonic</a> but saved by <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28Archie_character%29_9044.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie character)">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>.</p>
<p>She fell head over heels for Sonic, but remained distant out of respect for <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Sally_Acorn_91a4.html" title="Princess Sally Acorn">Sally Acorn</a>. Initially, Amy was the same age as depicted in the original games. However during the Sonic Adventure Adaptation she makes a wish on the <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ring_of_Acorns_d4c0.html" title="Ring of Acorns">Ring of Acorns</a>, which caused her to grow physically older, reaching the age of 12, while leaving her 8-year-old mind unchanged.</p>
<p>Amy's skill with her hammer earned her a spot among the Most Wanted enemies of Dr. Robotnik. She was one of the many participants in the battle against the <a href="../../../x/o/r/Xorda.html" title="Xorda">Xorda</a> attack, and her efforts eventually earned her a slot among the Freedom Fighters. During <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scourge_the_Hedgehog_b66e.html" title="Scourge the Hedgehog">Evil Sonic</a>'s impersonation of Sonic, Amy was one of several girls who was targeted by his attraction, along with <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bunnie_Rabbot_ca09.html" title="Bunnie Rabbot">Bunnie Rabbot</a>. She also aided the other Freedom Fighters in battle against <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mammoth_Mogul_47af.html" title="Mammoth Mogul">Mammoth Mogul</a>, <a href="../../../i/x/i/Ixis_Naugus_2285.html" title="Ixis Naugus">Ixis Naugus</a>, and their <a href="../../../d/e/s/Destructix.html" title="Destructix">Destructix</a> minions.</p>
<p><a href="../../../j/u/l/Julie-Su_2231.html" title="Julie-Su">Julie-Su</a> later took Amy under her wing, training her to teach skills that would help her performance as a combatant. Amy, along with Tails, helped reveal that <a href="../../../f/i/o/Fiona_Fox_d4e7.html" title="Fiona Fox">Fiona Fox</a> was in fact cheating on Sonic with his evil counterpart, becoming angered to the point where she attacked Fiona.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Rose_667e.html" title="Edit section: Sonic the Comic">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>Sonic the Comic</i></span></h3>
<p>In the UK publication <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Comic_12e0.html" title="Sonic the Comic">Sonic the Comic</a></i>, Amy first appeared in the 2-part story "Girl Trouble", where she was 'arrested' by Dr. Robotnik's Trooper <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badniks.html" title="Badniks">Badniks</a> for the criminal offence of association with Sonic (she had been saying she was his girlfriend). While annoyed at the fact she had been lying about them being an "item", Sonic still had a duty to rescue her and did so, but not before Robotnik transformed himself into a new, more despicable form (that is to say, the writers of the comic decided to alter Robotnik's appearance so it matched up with the cartoon series <i><a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventures_of_Sonic_the_Hedgehog_fde3.html" title="Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog">Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog</a></i>).</p>
<p>In the first 5-part Sonic story in STC's history, "The Sonic Terminator", which was based on <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_CD_7acc.html" title="Sonic CD">Sonic CD</a></i>, Robotnik had <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Sonic_2d90.html" title="Metal Sonic">Metallix the Metal Sonic</a> kidnap Amy as bait for Sonic, so that Metallix could then destroy both of them on the Miracle Planet. Sonic eventually defeated Metallix but was stuck on the Miracle Planet for the rest of the month with Amy. During a later mission to the Miracle Planet, Amy commented that Sonic had gotten lost an awful lot during that month. Sonic replied that that was just what he <b>wanted</b> her to think; he'd actually been hiding from her!</p>
<p>For a long time, a running joke was that various characters - either friends, foes or extras - would make a comment to Sonic about how he and Amy were a couple, which would result in Sonic immediately going on the defensive, enraged that anyone could even dare to think he had feelings for her. Amy occasionally used this to her advantage to get a rise out of Sonic, when she recognised a pattern emerging in his behaviour. Amy's character swiftly matured as the comic went on - even her second appearance (which also debuted <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Plunder_54ba.html" title="Captain Plunder">Captain Plunder</a>) had her showing enough intelligence to, even while caged, broker a deal between the Freedom Fighters and a gang of Sky Pirates. Relatively quickly, she became unrecognizable in terms of character compared to her game counterpart. She became one of the most valuable members of the Freedom Fighters, especially due to her expert marksmanship with her <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossbow.html" title="Crossbow">crossbow</a> (which she created herself). The notion of a love interest in Sonic was, for the most part, underplayed and writer Nigel Kitching revealed he saw it partly as Amy just trying to annoy Sonic. It was even hinted that <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_Fighters_%28Sonic_the_Comic%29_030e.html#Johnny_Lightfoot" title="Freedom Fighters (Sonic the Comic)">Johnny Lightfoot</a>, one of the team's best fighters, had a crush on her (something Kitching later admitted was completely intentional), though this was never properly developed. When Sonic was trapped in the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Zone_8b6a.html" title="Special Zone">Special Zone</a>, Amy assumed command of the Freedom Fighters and fought in the mass uprising of the Metropolis Zone citizens just before Robotnik was deposed.</p>
<p>Her appearance was also changed, likely to further distance her from her ditzy Mega Drive version - she was often seen wearing combat trousers and a white T-shirt that had various slogans or pictures on it, ranging from "<b>Girl Power</b>!" to a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> cross. When the <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Adventure_238d.html" title="Sonic Adventure">Sonic Adventure</a></i> adaptation was released, her hairstyle was altered to reflect the games and she began wearing a bomber jacket.</p>
<p>At a later part of the comic's life, Amy spent most of her adventures teaming up with her best friend <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_Fighters_%28Sonic_the_Comic%29_030e.html#Tekno_the_Canary" title="Freedom Fighters (Sonic the Comic)">Tekno</a> as they both traveled through time and space to save a vast selection of an infinite number of dimensions, even visiting <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> (where she met the mad <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_in_Sonic_the_Comic_d8d4.html#Colonel_Granite" title="List of characters in Sonic the Comic">Colonel Granite</a>) and the beginning of life on Mobius. These strips were, like all but the main Sonic ones, dropped to make room for reprinted strips in later issues. Interestingly, though, Lew Stringer, who became sole writer on the comic for a while, gave Sonic a similar set of adventures in the main strip, at the request of the editor, with Amy working alongside Sonic. When Nigel Kitching was brought back as sole writer for the comic's final non-reprint story, a new editor was in place and the character of Tekno was not used despite Amy's longstanding friendship with her, as Kitching preferred not to use Stringer's own created characters.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned final story, which was based on <i>Sonic Adventure</i>, Amy seemingly got "lost in the shuffle", so to speak. There were a vast number of characters and plot points that needed to be used and only 10 issues to do it in. The most important thing Amy did during this story arc was save <a href="../../../k/n/u/Knuckles_the_Echidna_5c32.html" title="Knuckles the Echidna">Knuckles the Echidna</a>'s life when he briefly lost all hope after he had to jettison the Chaos Emeralds and Master Emerald to keep them from being absorbed by the Chaos beast, resulting in the Floating Island falling from the sky. When Knuckles insisted on going down with the island, Amy knocked him out with a crowbar, and later said "If a friend can't hit you over the head with an iron bar, who can?"</p>
<p>No new stories were written after issue 184, so Amy's STC persona was not further developed until after the comic was cancelled following issue 223. However, she has made several appearances in <a href="http://www.stconline.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.stconline.co.uk" rel="nofollow">STC Online</a>, the online continuation of the comic which, while written by fans of the original, has received acclaim from the original writers, so it can be logically explained that STC Online's Amy is the "unofficially official" continuation of her character development.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Rose_667e.html" title="Edit section: Personality">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personality</span></h2>
<p>Amy was once presented as being kind and sweet (and slightly naive), and a good victim for holding hostage by her enemies. She was also seen as the cute girl of the Sonic series. Her kind and caring nature seems to have given her the ability to talk almost anybody out of destruction, from Eggman's supposedly single-minded and emotionless robots like <a href="../../../e/-/1/E-102_Gamma_e44a.html" title="E-102 Gamma">E-102 Gamma</a> (who then released her and turned on Eggman) to bitter, revenge-seeking villains such as <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadow_the_Hedgehog_96c3.html" title="Shadow the Hedgehog">Shadow the Hedgehog</a> (who after talking to her, helped Sonic save the world in Sonic Adventure 2).</p>
<p>In more recent games she has become far more violent and aggressive, but has increased in strength and speed to impress her love, Sonic. Her former image, that of being what could be described as the series <a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingenue_%28stock_character%29.html" title="Ingenue (stock character)">Ingenue</a> (the "sweet and innocent girl"), appear to have been taken over to the new character of Cream the Rabbit, who quickly became Amy's best friend. (Some fans believe that this personality change is because of young Cream having triggered some defensive maternal instinct in Amy, although this theory is just speculation). A good example of this is in <i>Sonic Battle</i> when Cream, not Amy, convinces Chaos Gamma to be good (it was Amy who talked to the original Gamma). Sources of anger to her include insulting the love of her life, or worse, daring to suggest that Sonic doesn't return her feelings. However, she is extremely protective of her friends, and if a villain tries to harm them, she will use all her might to defeat the enemy. Despite her violent tendencies, Amy has a very good heart, and tries to keep everyone happy, and she is the most cheery and optimistic character in the series. She never gives up, and her friends value this personality trait. She loves spending her time with her friends, hanging out and shopping.</p>

Amy Rose using her Piko Piko Hammer. (From <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_X_c94d.html" title="Sonic X">Sonic X</a></i>.)</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Also known as the Love Hammer in <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Battle_0761.html" title="Sonic Battle">Sonic Battle</a></i> in-game, Amy's Piko-Piko Hammer is based on a popular Japanese toy of the same name. They are common in Japanese comedy, where a person is often hit with the toy hammer, producing a loud "piko" sound. This toy is no longer very common in the United States, where it is known as a "squeaky hammer" or simply "toy hammer". In the <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_series_07bb.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog series">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> series, the Piko-Piko Hammer is Amy's weapon of choice. She uses it to defend herself or to threaten her friends if they annoy or anger her.</p>
<p>It is a reference to a <a href="../../../r/u/n/Running_gag.html" title="Running gag">running gag</a> in Japanese anime, in which a girl pulls out a huge hammer from <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammerspace.html" title="Hammerspace">hammerspace</a> and hits the unfortunate (and often male) person who is angering her.</p>
<p>The Piko-Piko Hammer has several powerful abilities, including the power to create small tornadoes. Amy is also able to conjure multiple hammers, allowing her to continue attacking even if she's lost or thrown one. The hammer first appeared in <i>Sonic the Fighters</i>, where it appeared to be a toy squeaky mallet, which squeaked comically when it struck an enemy. By the time the hammer next appeared, it appears to be very hard indeed and instead of squeaking, it makes a distinct, less squeaky <i>piko-piko</i> sound. The games are also inconsistent with the size of the hammer - mostly it is the size of Amy herself, but it is sometimes depicted as ridiculously huge. This is most noticeable in the <i>Sonic X</i> anime. Sometimes the hammer visibly changes in size.</p>
<p>In <i>Sonic Adventure</i>, Amy can upgrade it to the Long Hammer, which is green, has a longer range and makes a banging sound. The hammer has also looked slightly different in <i>Sonic Adventure 2</i>s 2-player mode, <i>Sonic Heroes</i>, <i>Sonic Advance 3</i> (when Amy is paired with various characters), <i>Sonic Rush</i>, and <i>Sonic Riders</i>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Amy can use <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarot_cards.html" title="Tarot cards">tarot cards</a>, although this isn't often mentioned. In <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Battle_0761.html" title="Sonic Battle">Sonic Battle</a></i>, Amy claims that her cards alert her to Sonic's presence.</li>
<li>As a speed type, Amy is extremely fast, nearly able to keep up with the other hedgehogs (excluding Silver who she can easily outrun). In the earlier games, she was portrayed as a quite slow character. As her appearances progressed, her speed improved up to the point where she can trail behind Sonic (usually with her Piko Piko Hammer clutched in her hands).</li>
<li>Amy is also said to have great strength in her arms, (as seen in Sonic X episode 55, where she ripped the giant fishing pole Sonic was tied to and carried the pole and Sonic down the stairs and standing while on the X-Tornado) but not as much as Knuckles, making her Piko Piko Hammer have great force when swung. In a scene in <i>Sonic Battle</i>, Amy is revealed to have been fighting with extremely heavy weights on her arms and legs.</li>
<li>It is theorized that Amy has access to <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hammerspace.html" title="Hammerspace">hammerspace</a>, from which she pulls her Piko Piko Hammer. The <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_%28comic%29_e20b.html" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (comic)">Archie Comics</a> adaptation to <i>Sonic Adventure</i> uses this explanation, although it is not official.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_X_c94d.html" title="Sonic X">Sonic X</a></i>, Amy apparently has excellent culinary abilities.</li>
<li>In a few episodes of the third season of <i>Sonic X</i>, Amy is seen flying a <a href="../../../f/i/g/Fighter_aircraft.html" title="Fighter aircraft">fighter aircraft</a> which is equipped with a mechanized version of her Piko Piko Hammer, as well as twin laser turrets that closely resemble her ears.</li>
<li>It is also revealed in <i>Sonic Battle</i> that Amy is also a mistress of <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxercise.html" title="Boxercise">boxercise</a>, which she does to stay fit.</li>
<li>Amy has excellent acrobatic skills, capable of impressively elaborate jumps and flips, especially with the aid of her hammer.</li>
<li>According to the <i>Bradygames Sonic Adventure Official Strategy Guide</i>, one of Amy's hobbies that was stated in her profile is searching for gold. <i>Sonic Battle</i> also contains an unlockable game named "Amy's Treasure Island" where she, Cream, Knuckles and Rouge search for treasure. This is further confirmed by the "Sonic Channel" website which states <a href="../../../d/o/w/Dowsing.html" title="Dowsing">dowsing</a> is one of her special skills. It was also seen in episode 55 of <i>Sonic X</i>, where she, Cream, and Cosmo search for a Chaos Emerald on a desert planet.</li>
<li>Amy has a few martial art skills.</li>
<li>Altough it isn't a typical 'ability', Amy is capable of cheering her friends on, in the sad or tight situations, especially when they are starting to give up, due to her optimismic personality. Because of this, Amy is an excellent leader, as seen in <i>Heroes</i>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Although it isn't a "typical" ability either, Amy appears to be very good at talking people into doing good things. The first example of this is <a href="../../../e/-/1/E-102_Gamma_e44a.html" title="E-102 Gamma">E-102 Gamma</a> in <i>Sonic Adventure</i>- who she manages to talk out of serving Eggman and convinces him to break his programing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best example though is probably <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadow_the_Hedgehog_96c3.html" title="Shadow the Hedgehog">Shadow the Hedgehog</a>, in <i>Sonic Adventure 2</i> she convinces him to help the people of Earth, her caring personality almost exactly mimics Maria's true last words to Shadow-reminding him of his promise, which he then does, supposedly (and possibly intentionally) killing himself-until he is found again in Sonic Heroes. However this "ability" doesn't work as effectively on <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silver_the_Hedgehog_66b9.html" title="Silver the Hedgehog">Silver the Hedgehog</a> in <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> - while still attempting to kill Sonic for a time afterwards, her words had instilled a considerable amount of doubt in his mission.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Rose_667e.html" title="Edit section: Interaction with other characters">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Interaction with other characters</span></h2>
<p>Amy's best friend is <a href="../../../c/r/e/Cream_the_Rabbit_7a9b.html" title="Cream the Rabbit">Cream the Rabbit</a>. Since Sonic Heroes, Cream and Amy are portrayed as best friends and they share a sister-like relationship, comparable to Sonic and Tails' brother-like friendship. This fact is strengthened by Sonic Advance 3, as when they're paired together, they are given the title Team Jubilee and serve as a counterpart to Sonic and Tails' Unbreakable Bond. The two also seem to hang out together almost completely throughout Sonic Battle, except when Emerl drags one of them away. Amy is also seen searching for Cream during one of the levels in Shadow the Hedgehog which could suggest how much she cares for her.</p>
<p>Amy has pretty well-balanced friendship with <a href="../../../m/i/l/Miles__Tails__Prower_8fae.html" title="Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower">Miles "Tails" Prower</a> (a pun on the phrase "miles per hour"). Tails is exceptionally nice to Amy, but knows not to get on her bad side. Amy is pretty much the same towards Tails; she'll usually be protective of Tails when he needs protection. Although, Amy uses Tails' bond with Sonic to see her love. Sonic usually figures this out and tells Tails to guide Amy away from him while he runs away. This will usually anger Amy and cause her to take out her anger on Tails. Nonetheless, Amy and Tails are very good friends, despite the very few conflicts they've had.</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/l/a/Blaze_the_Cat_8c83.html" title="Blaze the Cat">Blaze the Cat</a> is a princess from the future who became friends with Amy not too long after they met. In <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonic_Rush_5781.html" title="Sonic Rush">Sonic Rush</a> (when they first meet) Amy at first thought Blaze was interested in Sonic and told Blaze that Sonic is her man and she will take on amyone who tries to get between their "relationship". Blaze quickly opposed to Amy's misunderstanding; Cream explained to Amy that she was trying to get Blaze to ask for Sonic's help but really didn't know the hedgehog. Amy takes Cream's word since they are best friends and befriends Blaze immediately. Later on she helps to teach Blaze the value of friendship.</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/m/e/Emerl.html" title="Emerl">Emerl</a> had a literal mother-son relationship with Amy. Amy thought Sonic was trying to tell her that he got Emerl so they could start practicing raising a family (since she thinks they will later on in life). Amy teaches Emerl <a href="../../../b/o/x/Boxercise.html" title="Boxercise">boxercise</a> and haves him be her coach during her exercise sessions.</p>
<p>Amy didn't really have positive first impression toward <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_Chaotix_3b6a.html" title="Team Chaotix">Team Chaotix</a>. In Sonic Heroes, after the Lost Jungle stage, Team Rose and Team Chaotix would meet. The Chaotix wanted to ask Amy something but she thought that they wanted to go out with her; they actually wanted to take <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheese_the_Chao_7c19.html" title="Cheese the Chao">Cheese the Chao</a>. Cream refused and accused them for stealing Chocola. Big thought they were teasing his friends and told them to stop. Charmy then initiated battle by saying, "Yeah! Let's rock and roll!" They do however seem to have a friendly relationship and they were able to work together to defeat Metal Sonic without a problem.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Elise_9909.html" title="Princess Elise">Princess Elise</a> is revealed to be very good friends with Amy even before Sonic met her. In Silver's story, Amy is his amigo character and one of her missions is to protect the princess from robots.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Rose_667e.html" title="Edit section: Enemies and Rivals">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Enemies and Rivals</span></h2>
<p>Amy's main enemy and everyone else's is <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Eggman_4fa7.html" title="Dr. Eggman">Dr. Eggman</a>. Eggman first introduced Amy to Sonic by kdnapping her and forcing him to come to her aid, which Eggman's plan. Just like most of the other characters, Amy teases Eggman of his egg-shaped body and misguided attempts to rule to world. She often calls him a "bloated buffon" which slightly angers him. Amy also despises his machines and mechs, but has a tendency to turn them against their creator and put them on the good side.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Sonic_2d90.html" title="Metal Sonic">Metal Sonic</a> is one of Amy's enemies since he was the one who aided Eggman in her kidnap. Although, if it wasn't for Metal Sonic (and Eggman) Amy never would have met her love, Sonic. Later on in, <i>Sonic Heroes</i> Metal Sonic was the main villian of the game which automatically made him all the characters' enemy. Amy and her team was the first to fight him in his <i>Metal Madness</i> state. They figured out that he was the one who pretended to be Sonic, he stole Froggy and Chocola, and he lead them into a trap. They all swore to give him what was coming to him.</p>
<p>Another one of Sonic's rivals is <a href="../../../w/a/v/Wave_the_Swallow_1978.html" title="Wave the Swallow">Wave the Swallow</a> from Sonic Riders. Wave teased Tails for creating an Extreme Gear she disliked, this formed a defensive protection of Tails and a dislike of Wave. She challenged Wave to a race; unfortunately she lost.</p>
<p>Black Doom is also one of Amy's enemies, along with the Black Arms aliens who try to invade Earth in search of the Chaos Emeralds. While Black Doom is primarily Shadow the Hedgehog's main enemy, (or ally, depending on the route the player takes) he is still considered one of Amy's and all of the heroes' (including Eggman) enemies due to his actions against innocent people.</p>

<li>The nickname "Rosy the Rascal" is most likely a play on of "Rosy the Riveter", a feminist character and national icon which represents the women that had to work during World War 2 when all of their husbands were drafted.
