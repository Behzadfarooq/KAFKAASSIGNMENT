<p>Robsart was born in <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norfolk.html" title="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, and was the daughter of a wealthy landowner, Sir John Robsart and Elizabeth Scott. The Robsarts were the neighbours of the <a href="../../../d/u/d/Dudley.html" title="Dudley">Dudley</a> family, whose <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patriarch.html" title="Patriarch">patriarch</a> was <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Dudley%2C_1st_Duke_of_Northumberland_a1c1.html" title="John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland">John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland</a> and one of the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regents.html" title="Regents">regents</a> during the reign of King <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_VI_of_England_55c4.html" title="Edward VI of England">Edward VI of England</a>.</p>
<p>When she was 17, Robsart married <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Dudley%2C_1st_Earl_of_Leicester_376b.html" title="Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester">Robert Dudley</a>, a younger son of Northumberland. (Robert's younger sibling <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guilford_Dudley_6de7.html" title="Guilford Dudley">Guilford</a>, married <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_Jane_Grey_5231.html" title="Lady Jane Grey">Lady Jane Grey</a>, who was <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_of_England_c589.html" title="Queen of England">Queen of England</a> for nine days). The <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betrothal.html" title="Betrothal">betrothal</a> between Robsart and Dudley did not appear to be a love match, since both families were wealthy. Also, their marriage contract stated that they would be wed only if they did "condescend and agree" to the match.</p>
<p>The wedding was held with Edward VI in attendance, but soon proved to be an unhappy marriage. Following the accession of <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I</a> to the throne, Dudley spent most of his time at court with the new queen, nursing his own apparent ambitions to gain the throne. It has been widely speculated that he carried on an illicit love affair with the Queen during her early reign and indeed gained a highly favoured (and envied) place at her side. He did not allow Amy to come to court, as he did not wish to remind the Queen her favourite was indeed a married man. Early in 1560, Robsart was living in the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manor_house.html" title="Manor house">manor house</a> of Cumnor Place, near <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abingdon%2C_Oxfordshire_4e48.html" title="Abingdon, Oxfordshire">Abingdon</a> in <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berkshire.html" title="Berkshire">Berkshire</a> (now <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxfordshire.html" title="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>). The house was owned by friends of Dudley, some of whom lived with Robsart. Although legend has it she was a sort of prisoner, it is more likely she had complete freedom of movement.</p>
<p><a name="Death" id="Death"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Robsart_fa07.html" title="Edit section: Death">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
<p>Robsart is best known for her death, which occurred at Cumnor Place on Sunday, <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_8.html" title="September 8">September 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/5/6/1560.html" title="1560">1560</a>, the day of the "Our Lady's Fair" at Abingdon. Robsart gave all her servants permission to go to the fair, and even insisted so when several refused, believing it was unfit to attend a fair on Sunday. However, Robsart's companion, Mrs. Oddingsell, refused to leave, believing it unfit for her to mingle with servants. Thus remaining at the house were Robsart and Mrs. Oddingsell, as well as Mrs Owens, the elderly mother of the house’s previous owner, and Mrs. Forster, the wife of the current owner of the house; additionally, Mrs. Oddingsell and Mrs. Forster would also both have had servants with them at the time. When the rest returned from the fair, they found Robsart lying dead at the foot of a shallow flight of stairs, leading from her room to the hall, her neck broken. The death was announced to Robert Dudley and Queen Elizabeth at the same time, who both seemed genuinely shocked at the news. Dudley was immediately sent to his country home, while he and the Queen both ordered immediate inquests to determine the true cause of death.</p>
<p><a name="Aftermath" id="Aftermath"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Robsart_fa07.html" title="Edit section: Aftermath">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Aftermath</span></h2>
<p>Due to these suspicious circumstances, many believed Dudley had ordered the murder, which would rather conveniently open the way for him to marry the Queen. However, as he must have understood that the controversy created by her death could potentially ruin any chance he had of marrying Elizabeth, it is unlikely that he would have orchestrated her demise. Some allege that Queen to have been privy to the plan, and mayhap to have even ordered it; it is known that she had mentioned to the Spanish ambassador de Quadra that Dudley's wife was near death, but another close friend to the Queen, the future 1st Earl of Sild, provided vital evidence on her behalf. Yet another theory is that her death was ordered by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Cecil_9f19.html" title="William Cecil">William Cecil</a>, the Queen's secretary. Cecil had fallen out of favour upon the rise of Robert Dudley, and it was possible that if Dudley became King Consort, he could undo all that Cecil had worked for in the past several years, thus Cecil had a strong motive to prevent the Queen and Dudley from marrying. Cecil was certainly perceptive enough to understand that the controversy of Robsart's death would disallow the Queen from ever marrying Dudley, which would, in turn, bring Cecil back into favour; indeed, this is what happened. Cecil had perhaps the strongest motive and the most to gain from Robsart's death, which makes him a likely suspect, though there is no strong evidence to prove this theory. In any event, the scandal surrounding Robsart's death was enough to discourage the Queen from marrying Dudley.</p>
<p>Another factor known prior to her death was that Amy suffered from an ailment in her chest, which may have been <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breast_cancer.html" title="Breast cancer">breast cancer</a> or possibly an <a href="../../../a/o/r/Aortic_aneurism.html" title="Aortic aneurism">aortic aneurism</a>. Relatively recent cancer research has proven consistent with the idea that she suffered from breast cancer, and she may have subsequently had porous bones. This could have caused her neck to break under only limited strain, such as a fall which might occur when coming down even a short flight of stairs, or even just coming down the stairs. It is also often mentioned, and perhaps quite feasible, that Amy committed suicide, either because of the pain in her chest or the strain of mental anguish of knowing her husband to be the favourite of the Queen. This may explain her strange behaviour in wishing to send her servants away on that day. Thus, she may have poetically died of a "broken heart."</p>
