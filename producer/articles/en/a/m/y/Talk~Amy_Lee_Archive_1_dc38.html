<p>Ms. Lee's dedicated fans, now that they've explicated her food allergies, her favorite movies, her appearance at age 13, and her childhood nicknames, may wish to add some of the facts many people like to know about singers. Namely, what is her vocal range: contralto, alto, mezzo-soprano, or soprano? And what musical training does she have? She was in a choir, that much is clear, but was there anything else?<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirv_2479.html" title="User:Mirv">Mirv</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/r/User_talk%7EMirv_53de.html" title="User talk:Mirv">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mirv_7a27.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mirv">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Amy Lee is a brilliant artist, and growing up Amy took Piano Lessons. I find myself calling Amy Lee an original artist, because they're so many artifical people out there who pretend to be something their truly not. I feel that Ms. Lee has come a very long way, and I'm happy to have her sound in my own personal music colletion. Also, I think Amy has a love for McDonald's food. Jeffrey Buford. vampire_12002</p>
<p>Amy does not "dislike" fast food, as seen from the "Anywhere But Home" DVD and the thank-you note that came with the package:</p>
<p><i>"We also have to thank all of the things we just couldn't live without on tour: Nintendo, <b>McDonald's</b>, House of 1,000 corpses, South Park, Red-Bull, Coors Light, and dear God -Pedia-lyte!"</i><small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 140.254.113.198 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_140.254.113.198_12bf.html" title="Special:Contributions/140.254.113.198">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Amy is the best singer in the whole world.We Love her!Her view is really good, because she doesn't say "I need to be annorexic or sing bad stuf to be well known." Her music is about real life, and problems people face. Like other artist, they try to sing like that, but then they end up in something bad, and doesnt influence good.

Subject : Minor copyright violation

Dear Webmaster of AmyLeeWorld.com,

I am pleased to see that your website, "AmyLeeWorld.com" uses content from Wikipedia ( http://www.wikipedia.org ),
 the free encyclopedia. This is the sort of reuse that those who contribute to Wikipedia wish to promote.

However, I’d like to point out that when you use content from Wikipedia you ought to include a link back to the 
source Wikipedia article as is suggested on Wikipedia’s copyrights page, which is located at 
&lt;http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights&gt;. Additionally, you should also include a GFDL notice. One way
 of doing this would be to add the text "This article is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License, which 
means that you can copy and modify it as long as the entire work (including additions) remains under this 
license", and provide a link to &lt;http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html&gt;. Text such at "This page contains text from
 Wikipedia, the Free Encyclopedia" is a good way to acknowledge the general source of the text.

One way to do this is add the following HTML to the bottom of the page in question :

    This article is licensed under the &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html"&gt;GNU Free Documentation 
License&lt;/a&gt;. It uses material from the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy Lee&gt;Wikipedia article "Amy 
Lee"&lt;/a&gt;.

Sincerely,
Matthew /Surname/

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The song "You"</span></h2>
<p>I have heard the statement about Amy Lee not wanting "You" distributed, or the lyrics posted, but I have never seen any proof that she actually said this.</p>
<p>I saw that it was removed from A-Z Lyrics Universe and a comment of this sort was in its place. I went to research it, looking on message boards, etc. On one message board I saw it referring to the official home page ( <a href="http://www.Evanescence.com" class="external free" title="http://www.Evanescence.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Evanescence.com</a> ) as having the request. I searched and searched, but never found it.</p>
<p>If it is true that Amy Lee actually did make this request to not distribute the song "You", or even its lyrics, I would love to see an official source referenced here, before it is put in the article. Also, that it was written for "her family and friends" makes no sense -- if you have ever heard it, or even read the lyrics, it is a very romantic and intimate song about someone in a relationship with her. I would support this statement with the lyrics, but I don't want to post them in case the statement is actually true.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and patience -- Pat McCroskey</p>

<dd>I'd be interested in hearing it and seeing the lyrics. Is there a place you can find either right now? I'm going to look into this a little further. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERoguegeek_d28b.html" title="User:Roguegeek">Roguegeek</a> 18:32, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wrote that bit in. I have the song - but when I went looking for the actual lyrics I found that it was rare to find it and when I did find what was supposedly a link to the lyrics, I was faced with a comment saying that they had been removed because it was never supposed to be released as it was a personal song for her family and friends. I only wrote what it said, but I forgot to reference and can't remember where I found it. Will have a look again and reference.</p>
<p>I will leave the section about "You" in for another week to give a chance for references to be found, but if none are, I will take it out, as I truly believe this is just a rumor or urban myth that started somewhere and has been spread by fervant fans. 66.119.4.119 21:16, 18 September 2006 (UTC) Thanks, Pat McCroskey</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm sorry to be a pain about this, but the source you have sited is an exact example of what I was talking about. It says:</p>
<pre>
  '"You"
</pre>
<pre>
   these lyrics were removed
</pre>
<pre>
   At request of the band Evanescence and lead singer Amy Lee,
   all websites containing the lyrics or mp3 to the song "You"
   are supposed to remove said lyrics or mp3s immediately. 
   The song was never supposed to be released,
   it was a personal song dedicated to her friends and family... 
   The band has made many announcements on their official site
   to please stop circulation of said song. '
</pre>
<p>But I went to research it on the Evanescense official site, and could never find any corroborating statements anywhere, which casts doubt on the veracity of the above statment in the first place! In fact, there is a long long discussion about the validity of it at the first site that the 11 September post mentions above. On page 8 of that discussion, one person even claims to have asked Amy Lee about this song, and she didn't mind that it he had heard it, and even told him who it was about, etc. See the comment by Masochist at <small><i>[Links to copyvio websites removed]</i></small>. But during those discussions on that page you also see the ferver of the fans against the lyrics being posted, which would show how the fans themselves might have sent the emails and comments to the lyrics sites telling them to take it down. Those sites would probably rather just take it down than take the chance of legal problems or spending the time to verify if it is true. On some of the other lyrics sites there is now also a quote from Ben Moody, but no supporting link for it so it can be verified. Here is an example of that from <small><i>[Links to copyvio websites removed]</i></small>:</p>
<pre>
  'OK...for the LAST TIME. It is NOT an "Evanescence" song. Period. 
   The end. No ifs ands or buts about it. It is an AMY LEE song. 
   Amy said so herself. It was NOT meant for people other
   than the person she made it for. 
   Some jerk decided to take it and give it to people. 
   He even had the odasity to put it on a 
   "bonus" CD for people that bought Origin.
</pre>
<pre>
   Here is what Ben had to say about it on V1 of the board:
</pre>
<pre>
   "Since Origin, he has taken the liberty of connecting himself
   with everything we've ever done. He even has gone to a studio 
   that we recorded at (the owner of which was a friend of his) and
   made cd's of songs he was never supposed to have. 
   One song in particular, was VERY private.
   He was FORBIDDEN to show it to anyone, since there was 
   no way I could actually be sure I had every copy. 
   COUNTLESS times people have commented on that song
   and how he showed it to them. 
   When confronted, he just denies it or says that they
   heard it on accident or some bullshit. there's a very 
   good chance some of you have it on your 
   computer RIGHT NOW."
</pre>
<pre>
   So that's it. That's all you need to know. NO MORE QUESTIONS.
</pre>
<pre>
   So please if you do have it delete it, 
   or respect amy's wishes and don't listen to it!'
</pre>
<p>First, where is this V1 board? Second, even if this quote is true, Ben is talking about things that happened in the past, and how that person was forbidden to show it to anyone, but nowhere does Ben say that Amy or the band wants people now to not listen to it, not read the lyrics, or delete it if they have it, now that it is out there. Only the author saying that -- it is his/her interpretation. He/she says "respect Amy's wishes and don't listen to it!!", but no-where did he show Amy expressing any such wish. It is simply he/she that is saying to delete it or not listen to it. Am I making sense in my arguement? I am simply saying it sounds like conclusions drawn by fans, and passed on and on until so many sources are quoting the same thing that it seems like truth. I want to know if it really IS truth! And I think when we are talking about a singer, and a song she wrote that is supposedly forbidden, that the subject would be important to this article. And I think that a Wikipedia article would be the perfect place to clear it up, one way or another, for all to know! &#160;:-) Thanks again for listening to my ranting/rambling! 66.119.4.119 15:19, 19 September 2006 (UTC)Pat McCroskey</p>

<dd>I've reverted so that the name appears because this is an encyclopaedia, not a fansite.

<dd>Apparently it was revealed on an unofficial dvd, therefore it should not be revealed. If you read reference one it does say that she doesn't want it revealed because it would upset her mother and some people may go looking for her grave.

My proof is reference one - you get proof she doesn't mind it being revealed and I will drop the issue, untill then leave her sisters name out of the article. The fact that wilkipedia is an encyclopedia does not mean that ALL information has to be revealed.

<dd>I agree that a source should be provided, hence why I put {{fact}}. I'm neutral on whether it should be included or not, but the reason you've given that it shouldn't be included "because she doesn't want it to" isn't valid. See <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html#Public_figures" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Public_figures</a>, particularly "<i>if an allegation or incident is notable, relevant, and well-documented by reliable published sources, it belongs in the article — even if it's negative and the subject dislikes all mention of it</i>". If whoever has sourced the name can provide a reference, then it's valid to include the name. If, after a reasonable period of time a reference can't be provided, then the name should be removed. I'll revert the article again to where I left it with {{fact}} showing. As you're now in breach of <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> I assume you'll leave it like that for now. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobwingfield_e0c6.html" title="User:Robwingfield">Robwingfield</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobwingfield_a2c8.html" title="User talk:Robwingfield">talk</a>)</sup> 14:54, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You didn't source the name and there is no known written source of this. Whoever put it in got it from an unofficial DVD and therefore there is no way to reference it for all to see. That was all I was saying. Haven't personally seen this DVD because I didn't know it existed. I don't know if it was actually a member of the Lee family who released the name. If it wasn't then I think that it can't be put it on the grounds that it may not actully be a fact and just speculation. Now, as I recall, you need to actual proof to put facts into an article. At the moment I believe that her sister's name is just speculation and will carry on believing that untill proof has been obtained. How long do you have to wait for a reference to be supplied before removing the information because the information has been there for quite a while and I thought it best to remove it after fully reading reference one. Maybe that was "wrong" of me but I thought that by respecting others then they would respect me --<a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluffy_Kitten_87a3.html" title="User:Fluffy Kitten">Fluffy Kitten</a> 16:01, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You're right, but what you're trying to do is censor information that is available and that is simply wrong. The article is meant to give people understanding as to who she is.

But <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> does <i>not</i> say that content should be removed if it upsets the subject.

Oh, and that exception to <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3RR</a> doesn't apply in this case. Revealing someone's name isn't libellous.

<p>Okay, despite tagging with {{fact}} nine days ago, no reference for Amy's sister's name has been provided. As Amy has herself stated that she won't reveal the name of her sister, I think we need to be strict with this particular fact... hence why I've now removed it, given the fair warning.

<p>I've reverted the edit by <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluffy_Kitten_87a3.html" title="User:Fluffy Kitten">Fluffy Kitten</a> that removed Category:American born-again Christians, as Jesus himself said "no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is <i>born again</i>" (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203:3;&amp;version=64;" class="external text" title="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203:3;&amp;version=64;" rel="nofollow">John 3:3</a>). You cannot be a Christian "all your life".

<dd>That would make a hell of a lot of people who are "born again christians". I would have thought that because she has been brought up as a Christian and has never stopped believing in Christianity would not make her a born again Christian, just a Christian. The way you have made it seem, well to me personally and some may agree, is that everyone who is a Christian is actually a "Born Again Christian" and a whole lot of these articles need editing to make them fit with your theory about the subject, which for one, and not to seem rude with this, I don't actually agree with it. --<a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluffy_Kitten_87a3.html" title="User:Fluffy Kitten">Fluffy Kitten</a> 14:53, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, precisely, there are an awful lot of people who are born again Christians. You can't be a Christian and <i>not</i> be born again. The distinction for Christians that are brought up in the Christian faith is that they may always have believed in Jesus, but at some point in their life they will have asked Jesus to be <i>their</i> personal saviour (otherwise they're not Christians themselves). A synonym for being born again that you may be more familiar with is "conversion". This isn't my theory, it's what the Bible says! Have a look at John 3:3 that I've linked above, and also check out <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_conversion.html#Conversion_to_Christianity" title="Religious conversion">Religious conversion#Conversion to Christianity</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobwingfield_e0c6.html" title="User:Robwingfield">Robwingfield</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobwingfield_a2c8.html" title="User talk:Robwingfield">talk</a>)</sup> 15:47, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was ready to agree until I read this: "<i>Christian musicians are musicians who make Christian music, such as choral music, gospel music, or Christian rock. This category is not for musicians who are also Christian, but who do not acknowledge Christian themes in their music. See also: Category:Christian musical groups</i>" which is at <a href="../../../c/h/r/Category%7EChristian_musicians_4c9f.html" title="Category:Christian musicians">Category:Christian musicians</a>. So on that basis, I'd say it's best to leave the category as is. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobwingfield_e0c6.html" title="User:Robwingfield">Robwingfield</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobwingfield_a2c8.html" title="User talk:Robwingfield">talk</a>)</sup> 16:12, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm hesitant to reference anything from YouTube these days unless the video owner specifically gives permission. It's a very nice video, considering it's origin, but I'd appreciate other's input. Beyond that, I'm leery of leaving your edit up, as a public statement of "I won't sing that" rather trumps a candid "I haven't sung it yet", at least the way I see it. It also possibly violates the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">"Not a crystal ball"</a> ideal.

<p>If you read all the comments the video was placed on evboard (is that the official name? It's off evanescence's official forum anyway) for a while by Amy. The guy who bought the piano also has a copy and is willing to put his copy up soon. Also, it is noted by many fans that she won't sing Hello live because it is so personal to her and can make her cry --<a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluffy_Kitten_87a3.html" title="User:Fluffy Kitten">Fluffy Kitten</a> 18:41, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh no, I'm not doubting that (however, there is no official Evanescence board, they are all technically fan-boards), I'm just saying that it probably isn't appropriate to write "but on a home video has said that she has not sung it live "yet", which leaves a possibility of her doing so in the future" for the above reasons. I'd suggest removing that part, and leaving the rest, making it something like "The song "Hello" from <i>Fallen</i> was written in her memory, however, Lee has stated she will never sing "Hello" live." This renders it NPOV and removes any possibility of crystal balling.
