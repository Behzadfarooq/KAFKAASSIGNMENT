<p>Hello all, I was just wondering if you were aware of the page <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motor_neuron_disease.html" title="Motor neuron disease">motor neuron disease</a>? I've just done quite a big edit over there to try and bring it up to date. Personally I think there shouldn't have to be two seperate articles. In the US, I understand ALS can mean the group of other diseases including ALS, PMA, PLS, and PBP as well as just meaning plain old ALS by itself. We use the term MND in the UK in the same way. If you'd be interested in discussing ways we could integrate please discuss here, on my talk page, or on the MND page.</p>

<dd>OK then, I take your points. How would you feel about putting more links between the two then. E.g. bits that could go in MND that are here and are not unique to ALS? For example the SOD1 stuff. Or convesely things that are covered in more detail in the MND article could be linked to from bits of the ALS article that are more sparse, e.g. the extra-motor change part, which renders this statement untrue: "Because ALS affects only motor neurons, the disease does not impair a person's mind, personality, intelligence, or memory" --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulWicks_5018.html" title="User:PaulWicks">PaulWicks</a> 11:24, 5 February 2006 (UTC) articles could definitlyuse

<p>I don't know why this article was created. It only leads to confusion. ALS is a term predominantly used in the USA whilst MND is used elsewhere. Most forms of MND are ALS and so it is a synonym in the USA. Havng this page detracts from the MND page. This page has "notable suffers of ALS" with Stephen Hawking listed and yet as I understand it because of his longevity most neoroligists believe that he has a different form of MND. <a href="http://brain.hastypastry.net/forums/showthread.php?t=10847&amp;page=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://brain.hastypastry.net/forums/showthread.php?t=10847&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. As for the other people listed on this page who knows. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 11:00, 25 February 2006 (UTC) - Note this article was 2 January 2006 created from a redirect to MND. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 11:05, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Jooler whilst I agree with some of your points I doubt our american readers would see it that way, and in fact they might even suggest we ditch MND and switch to ALS as they have the most patients and researchers!

<dd>&lt;edit conflicted&gt; - Having a page at ALS and one at MND will only mean that US readers will read and edit the ALS page and British and Commonwealth readers will read and edit the MND page and information will be duplicated. It is a situation that was only created in January of this year and it should be restored to the state it was in before then. It is wrong to list patients on this page that have other forms of MND other than ALS, just because ALS is the term used in the US and this is inevitable what is going to happen as US readers come to this page and ignore the MND page. Basically it will only cause confusion to everyone concerned. MND is all encompasing. The best and simplest solution is to restore the situation as it was before January. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 19:17, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>ALS is a type of MND</i> from the perspective of most people in the US this is simply not the case. In their eyes ALS and MND are synonymous. To have an article here as well as there is just too confusing. <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJooler_fb16.html" title="User:Jooler">Jooler</a> 19:17, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it should stay but you might want to try and edit it so that it is clear that ALS is the type of MND which differentialyl affects the upper and lower motor neurones. But yes Jooler I agree that there will become a split between editors from each side of the Atlantic. TBH I only have time to work on MND not ALS as well as it is, as you say, duplicative and not worth my time justifying my edits to two sets of editors. I'm not convinced by merge, nor delete, but I'd prefere a BOLD edit to make it clearer. The worst that can happen is someone can revert some of them, why not give it a go?--<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulWicks_5018.html" title="User:PaulWicks">PaulWicks</a> 14:40, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Because the articles have been fixed to clarify what is MND and what is ALS and becasue of this <a href="http://www.alsmndalliance.org/whatis.html" class="external text" title="http://www.alsmndalliance.org/whatis.html" rel="nofollow">link</a> I have removed the merge tag. -<a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavedave_48c1.html" title="User:Ravedave">Ravedave</a> 04:59, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see this article continue to drift off course on a few points. For instance, the stuff about ALS not affecting the mind is untrue. For instance, see Ringholz et al (2005)(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16116120&amp;query_hl=1&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" class="external free" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16116120&amp;query_hl=1&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=16116120&amp;query_hl=1&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum</a>). However I will continue to work on the MND article only as I don't have time to edit both. I've been working recently on an international website for people with this illness and I have been experimenting with the term "ALS/MND". This is what is used at the international symposium and also the ALS/MND Alliance. What would people think of merging the articles into ALS/MND and having a one-stop shop for all your needs? --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulWicks_5018.html" title="User:PaulWicks">PaulWicks</a> 21:14, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't believe Stephen Hawking was ever diagnosed with ALS. He has some form of motor neurone disease, but I've never heard it described as ALS. In fact, he's lived with his condition for 40 years, which would make an ALS diagnosis extremely unlikely. vpoko 18:39 05 Apr 2006</p>

<p>From the MND talk page: Stephen Hawking says in his introduction to "A Brief History of Time" that he has ALS. If he was being non-specific about his dx, as he is British, he would have said he has MND. Therefore he has ALS, albeit the most slowly progressive occurrence known.

<dd>Stephen Hawking is the person with the longest recorded history of ALS. However he is severely disabled and in a continuing state of deterioration, albeit a slow one. ALS is a heterogeneous disease; sometimes it lasts upwards of 10 years, the quickest I ever heard of was only a couple of months. There are extremes at both end, and Prof Hawking is the greatest extreme of longevity. The fact that he is famous makes him stand out more but I always ask people how many other astrophysicists they can name. Usually none. Prof Hawking is obviously very gifted but he is also regularly endorsed as the most intelligent person on the planet; this is quite unlikely. I think part of the interest in Prof Hawking is that there is a seductive notion of a brilliant mind trapped in a failing body. It is a theme that often appears in science fiction and is a manifestation of mind/body dualism. If someone wishes to claim that Prof Hawking does not have ALS, please provide some suggestions for what he does have, and cite the evidence they have to suggest such a thing. The original issue was this: Vpoko stated that Prof Hawking had never stated he has ALS as opposed to MND. Myself and Ravedave have provided evidence that he has in fact stated he has ALS. The alternatives are that he is lying (why?) or that you know more than the neurologists that have examined him. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulWicks_5018.html" title="User:PaulWicks">PaulWicks</a> 09:08, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My copy says: A brief history of time, originally published in Great Britain by Bantam Press 1988. Page ix says "Apart from being unlucky enough to get ALS, or motor neurone disease, I have been fortunate in almost every other respect". So far I have seen a "recognized" instead of the more British "recognised" but this is not a hard and fast rule. "Behaviour" is spelt with a u, as is "colour". So I am not entirely convinced by Jooler's suggestion.--<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulWicks_5018.html" title="User:PaulWicks">PaulWicks</a> 09:21, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>I have discussed Steven Hawking’s case with some Neurologists. Most expressed the opinion he probably does not have ALS but PMA, which is another way of stating he probably has only lower motor neuron disease and not upper motor neuron disease. I also understand he refuses to be tested for upper motor neuron disease. One neurologist told me Hawking refused to let the neurologist test his reflexes for upper motor neuron disease. If Steven Hawking is a PMA case, it would explain why he has progressed so slowly. PMA is often very slow and is often not considered life threatening.</i></li>
<li><i>My neurologist several years also volunteered to me that he didn't think that Hawking has ALS. He told me what he thought he had and it may well have been PMA. It was before ALS was on my radar screen and prior to my own diagnosis.</i></li>
<li><i>I think your right he probably does not have ALS but in the Uk we only have one catagory when describing this condition for the majority of the time and that is MND, for the punters anyway.</i></li>
<li><i>Harry and John's neurologists share the view of ours: it is highly unlikely that Steven Hawking has ALS. Unfortunately most people immediately associate Steven Hawking --- and his longevity -- with ALS because they are not as educated as the average neurologist.</i></li>

<dd>There have been other conversations like this one including on BT and a website I run at www.build-uk.net. First off you could try emailing Prof Hawking's assistants and perhaps asking them to help edit the wikipedia article on him. You could ask about the sorts of things that are listed in the BT thread but I imagine he gets asked that a lot. PMA is a slowly progressive form of MND but it is still fatal sadly. The only form that might qualify as non-fatal is <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_lateral_sclerosis.html" title="Primary lateral sclerosis">primary lateral sclerosis</a>. However the thing with the subtypes is that pathologically there is a great deal of overlap, so when we say PLS or PMA we might really mean LMN- or UMN-predominant rather than "exclusive".

<p>I belive this whole discussion started because I added a Lou Gehrig picture someone else uploaded, which apparently was a copy-vio, so the next best person I could think of was Mr. Hawking, who's picture I added. If anyone can find a good image of Gehrig we can use, I belive it would be much better. If Hawking does have ALS is is an outlier, so Gehrig would be a better pic.-<a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavedave_48c1.html" title="User:Ravedave">Ravedave</a> 01:01, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think this line of thought occurs frequently in people discussing MND or ALS so I don't think it's attributable entirely to your picture. Also, as Hawking is by far the most recognised person with MND and the only well-known person currently alive with it I think his photo should stay. Perhaps Gehrig's photo in addition would be an improvement though.--<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulWicks_5018.html" title="User:PaulWicks">PaulWicks</a> 11:55, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've been researching ALS for several years after learning of my family history. My grandfather died of ALS, as did his mother. My uncle (7th person in the family to be diagnosed) and mother have both been diagnosed. Based on my mom's diagnosis and genetic testing, I have a 50% chance of having the defect - That's a very strong motivating factor to find out more information. -<a href="../../../s/t/g/User%7ESTG0459_c0c1.html" title="User:STG0459">STG0459</a> 24 October, 2006</p>

<p>I don't mean to be offensive, but is it just me, or as time goes on are the people being added as "famous" getting considerably less famous? Is there any kind of guidance on how well-known someone should be? I would have said that Richard Olney the neurologist who is an ALS expert and now has it himself is significantly more famous than a sports coach or musician.

<p>I've been googling people who are on the list so far and they've generally been people who can be classified as famous insofar as they achieved national or international recognition in a particular field; such as Viola Tunnard who has a biography on Amazon, or Roy Walford who was in the Biosphere 2 project. My view at present is not to include people who only are famous within a local region or a particularly narrow field, such as someone well known in a single US state. Reason being that if you extend it out far enough this list will become a fairly all-enveloping one; after all ALS is rare but it's not that rare! I'm still flying blind on this one though and would appreciate some input from other editors, even if it's only a "me too" or a "I disagree". Finally, it'd be great if people adding names to this list would consider registering usernames.

<p>Please sign your comments. Stephen Hawking is outside the US, as was Jimmy Johnstone and David Niven. However these latter two are probably less widely known internationally. --<a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulWicks_5018.html" title="User:PaulWicks">PaulWicks</a> 22:34, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>A couple more people have been removed from the list after recent updates. As a general pointer, if the person does not have a wikipedia article written about them, or it is impossible to find any evidence on Google that they exist, or if they can not really be considered as well known outside of a relatively small sphere of influence, they are unlikely to remain on the list. This is not meant to cause offence to people by suggesting their friends or relatives are not "notable people", but Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and to list everyone affected by a disease with ~80,000 patients worldwide would soon become unmanageable. There is an ALS/MND patient registry available online at <a href="http://www.patientslikeme.com/registry" class="external text" title="http://www.patientslikeme.com/registry" rel="nofollow">PatientsLikeMe</a> which has more than 350 names from around the world and will act as a permanent monument to the hundreds of great people who have been afflicted by this terrible illness.

<p>Want to avoid a copyvio but this is a good summary: A-myo-trophic comes from the Greek language. "A" means no or negative. "Myo" refers to muscle, and "Trophic" means nourishment---"No muscle nourishment." When a muscle has no nourishment, it "atrophies" or wastes away. "Lateral" identifies the areas in a person's spinal cord where portions of the nerve cells that signal and control the muscles are located. As this area degenerates it leads to scarring or hardening ("sclerosis") in the region. from <a href="http://www.alsa.org/als/what.cfm" class="external free" title="http://www.alsa.org/als/what.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.alsa.org/als/what.cfm</a></p>

<p>I took a bunch of websites that were in the references section and put them into external links because they didn't seem to be serving as citations for specific statements, and because with the footnote style referencing the numbers started over with them and it was confusing (because a statement in the text will have the citation 3, e.g., and there are two 3's in the refs). Of course, if my edit was wrong, you can undo it. But i'd suggest rather than that making everything consistent by putting them all into the footnote format with this template: &lt;ref name=" "&gt;{{cite web | url= | title= | author= | date= | publisher= | accessdate=2006-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

<p>I made revisions to the etiology section (formerly known as "Aetiology" and "Causes"). I changed the first two paragraphs to reflect the current scientific opinion that free radical damage does not likely play a major role in pathogenesis. This is based on a number of studies which showed that both active (dismutase-active; retains antioxidant capacity) and inactive forms of mutant SOD1 can cause ALS-like disease in murine models of the disease. Additionally, when tg SOD1 mutant mice also expressed wild-type SOD1 (which functions in a normal antioxidant manner, to the best of current knowledge), no change in disease course was found (even in the case of over-expression). I also adjusted the second paragraph to omit the use of "amyloid-like" as a phrase to describe protein aggregates, as amyloid accumulations are generally considered to be extracellular. Also, I added information about current theories on SOD1 mutant aggregates in disease pathogenesis. <a href="../../../j/h/u/User%7EJHUbme24_8c15.html" title="User:JHUbme24">JHUbme24</a> 07:09, 24 January 2007 (UTC)JHUbme24</p>
