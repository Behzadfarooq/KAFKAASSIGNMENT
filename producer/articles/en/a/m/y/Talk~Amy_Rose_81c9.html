<p>I respectfully request that everyone stop deleting Archie relationships from the section. Amy is a character featured in the Archie Comics, and so her relationship information in those comics should be displayed on this page, since she doesn't have a separate page for her comic self like Sonic and Knuckles do.<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenjo_59ed.html" title="User:Denjo">Denjo</a> 14:03, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, who put "Like Sonic, Amy has no toes."? Now where is proof of this. Amy HAS never been without footwear. Neither has most of the other Sonic characters.

<p>That was in Sonic X. It's not even considered official game canon. Please remove it or I will. And besides it's not even worth knowing. <a href="../../../u/n/d/User%7EUnDeRsCoRe_0e72.html" title="User:UnDeRsCoRe">UnDeRsCoRe</a></p>

<p>Has she really chased him for "well over a century?"</p>
<p><br />
I changed the first sentence of "Recent appearances" and I think it makes more sense, but I still don't think that's quite the right way to put it. If anyone has a better idea, by all means.

There is a Sonic wiki, and Amy's article was pretty short. O_o</p>
<p>There is absolutley no point in stating that "She is considerd an orphan" simply cause her parents have not been seen. Cause neither has Sonics, Tails, Knuckles, Rouges, Vectors, Charmys, Espios, Bigs, Eggmans or ANYONE elses parents (except Creams). So saying that makes her an orphan would make just about all Sonic characters orphans.</p>

<p>How can Amy have possibly chased Sonic for "well over a decade" if she is 12? Yes, I'm aware she made her first appearance some 12 years ago, but speaking canonically, Amy can't have been BORN that long ago, or at least not old enough to be in love with Sonic! If she had retained her former age of 8 and aged as Sonic apparently has (Yuji Naka says he was 5 in <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> and has aged), she would be old enough for the previous statement to be true. But since Sega reduced her age by quite a bit to the current 12 years old, it doesn't make sense to say she's chased Sonic for 12 years.</p>
<p>I'd suggest a rewording, something like:</p>
<p><i>For over a decade now, Amy's role within the Sonic franchise has been that of a young girl who longs to be married to Sonic. Though he cares for her, Sonic doesn't seem to love Amy- at least not as strongly as she loves him. Regardless, Amy refuses to stop chasing her dream, in the hope that someday she'll be able to change Sonic's mind and make him her husband.</i></p>
<p>That doesn't have to be the exact phrasing, but it makes more sense from a storyline point of view, since it's a tad more explicit on the fact that her character has EXISTED for more than 12 years, but she's actually not that old. Of course, this is just another factor that completely throws into doubt the question of "When the heck did Sonic CD take place, anyway?"</p>

Amy is 2 years old in sonic CD. Sonic is now 7, so Amy was born in 1991.That would make Amy 15, &amp; Sonic 17... err..18.....19? Apparantly Sega gave each character an "age" at the time of "Sonic Heroes",no matter their original age. Clear things up?</p>
<p>Amy couldn't be two years old in Sonic CD! That's way too young. But, according to my Prima's Official Strategy Guide for Sonic Heroes, Amy's 12, and Sonic's 15. According to my official BradyGames Sega strategy guide for Sonic Adventure, Amy's 12, and Sonic's 15. No change. --anon</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure when they say over a decade, SEGA means the amount of time in human years since Amy was 1st introduced. They're not talking about the time period during the games. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackEDGE_MkII_cf44.html" title="User:BlackEDGE MkII">BlackEDGE MkII</a> 02:29, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have to disagree with the person who wrote the first part. In the comic book (Sonic the Hedgehog), Sonic has a family. I know Espio, Charmy, and Vector don't, but Tails does. In the comic book, he mentions that they're missing or stuck in some zone or something. Amy Rose's parents are missing, not dead. And although Big and Eggman (he has a cousin in the comic book, though) don't have a family, when you say 'like an orphan', you don't account for Sonic. And Tikal the echidna has a family mentioned in the game. Her dad is Pachacamac, her mom died when she was a child, her grandmother raised her, and then died, so Tikal is left with her father, who Chaos kills later. Therefore, I think we should add that Amy's parents are missing. If you don't mind, I will write it. --anon</p>

<p>How would you ever hear of Baby Amy Rose or make her up on her own. --ZachKudrna18@yahoo.com</p>
<p>It's a fair point. Amy is 12. If she had parents, shouldn't she be living with them? Then again, nothing was mentioned by Sega.

Now, I'm near innummerate, but I'm pretty sure that 1973 plus 12 does not equal 2005, nor do I think she debuted before Sonic =P --<a href="../../../l/_/t/User%7EL_T_Dangerous_9308.html" title="User:L T Dangerous">L T Dangerous</a> 22:59, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, if it doesn't equal 2005, Tails would be older than her. If she was born in 1993, she would be just a baby that hasn't become a year old. In any Sonic stuff, Amy Rose would say "I was born in 1973,". If she came to real life in your imagination, she'd tell you or anyone else that she's 32 years old. --ZachKudrna18@yahoo.com</p>

<p>Actually, you should see Amy's debut game's year and then subtract 12 from that. The characters don't age you know! --anon</p>
<dl>
<dd>Actually, yes they do. I can't link you to it as it was years ago, but Yuji Naka once did an interview stating Sonic was 5 in <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> and was in his teens in the DreamCast games. And let's not forget, Amy's age was altered by the time <i>Sonic Adventure</i> came out. Either way, the sentence was still inaccurate even if you took 12 from the year of her video game debut because she still didn't debut in 1973. --<a href="../../../l/_/t/User%7EL_T_Dangerous_9308.html" title="User:L T Dangerous">L T Dangerous</a> 15:32, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I didn't mean the 1973-year. Just put the correct one! And Amy might have aged, but did people like Sonic ever age? --anon</p>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I'm still gonna have to take Yuji Naka's line on this one, that Sonic was 5 in the original game and 15 in the Sonic Adventure games. Coming from any other source it may not mean so much, but since he's the head of Sonic Team, he's probably an authority on the matter. I can see where you're coming from, though, because the characters don't necessarily age one year for every year that passes- depending on the continuity, Sonic may be 18 now or he may still be 15, it depends how Sonic Team see the whole series as a story. Other characters have had their ages altered too, Amy, Rouge and Knuckles come to mind (not 100% certain on Knuckles, mind). I think it's probably for the best we don't give a year unless Sega do. I mean, who's to say the characters won't still be going strong in a hundred years? They won't necessarily be 100 years old in terms of the storyline. --<a href="../../../l/_/t/User%7EL_T_Dangerous_9308.html" title="User:L T Dangerous">L T Dangerous</a> 13:18, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oaky, but was Amy just mad that time? And besides, they probably arent't going to fight every time they see each other. And if they fight in Sonic Battle, it's probably just because Sega wanted it that way. I mean, the whole game is all about fighting! --anon</p>
<p>Um, Amy never said that. She and Rouge were actually just fighting over Emerl the whole time really. And they definitely don't fight every time they see each other - just look at Sonic Adventure 2, Sonic Heroes, and Shadow the Hedgehog. --Evilradiodude</p>
<p>And I'm pretty sure that Amy and Rouge don't have a strong dislike for each other, right? I mean, once Emerl is gone, I'm pretty sure they won't be angry at each other anymore. --anon</p>
<p>Yeah. They insulted each other and fought, but I'm pretty sure it was just over Emerl. And besides, they managed to hold a civil conversation in Shadow. So I don't think they really care about each other unless one has something the other wants. --Evilradiodude</p>
<p>Actually, I'm pretty sure they could possibly be friends if they had the chance to talk more to each other. And I'll be getting rid of the sentence about Amy disliking Rouge if there are no complaints. --anon</p>
<p>No complaints from me. I also think the "culinary skills" line should be gotten rid of, that was only in Sonic X. And there's another whole section for that. --Evilradiodude</p>
<p>In Sonic Battle, one line of Amy's to Rouge is "What dirty little deed are you up to now?" That's before Emerl is even mentioned between them, and it's a rather personal comment. They do technically fight over Emerl, but I feel that there is also a deep-seated conflict implied between them. -- Some girl called Harley.</p>

<p>You know, this whole "Amy dislikes Rouge" thing reminds me of "Amy dislikes Blaze/sees her as threat"...this is hardly true. She most definitely views Blaze as a friend; one only needs to watch the last story scenes to see this. The only time she ever felt threatened was when Sonic said he was looking for "some girl". He didn't state who she was, so Amy immediately jumped to conclusions. After finding out it was Blaze, she calmed down and told Sonic where she was. I think that proves that she doesn't feel threatened by Blaze in the slightest. I thought I'd mention this considering the love life section states that Amy sees Blaze as a threat.</p>
<p>According to some people they get along fairly well in Sonic X's new season, and as my edit stated Rouge sort of saves her later on. Sonic Battle was a fighting game anyway, they were just giving them reasons to beat eachother up.</p>

I am assuming good faith, but I'm not sure the link should be removed. For the record, I agree that the last point of the removal rationale is probably a good reason for not saying what Amy weighs. However, I just visited the link, and most of the information (in its 'History' section) comes from the Archie series. If this is the reason, a proper location for the citation is instead in the Archie or Family section, and I'll see if I can restore the reference to the appropriate location. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidHOzAu_f632.html" title="User:DavidHOzAu">DavidHOzAu</a> 22:36, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I apologize--I'm the culprit. None of the information there matched up with the most recently stated official information, and, actually, I just removed the reference again before noticing your comment here. However, if that information is still considered official for the Archie continuity, it should probably be restored. I just can't help but feel that it could be confusing to the average reader to be linked to a reference site that openly contradicts the information we have here, especially regarding height and weight. Does every reference need to be a website, or can we instead simply reference the particular comic itself in which the info appears? --Matt S. 03:10, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whoops, forgot to put a signature on that. Anyway, yeah, this seems a bit weak. Google isn't really an authoritative source or anything, but I'd say that when all it comes up is a single piece of adult fanfiction regarding the name of a popular video game character, we can assume there's something wrong.

<p>If you ask me I don't think sonic is even good enough for amy! I mean you remember sonic riders where she got hit by sonics tornado attack, and sonic heroes where he fought her to get away from her? I say it's injustice that she chases a guy as ... as reckless as him. If you ask me, most of the games give mention of sonic not fond of Amy in the least. It's annoying even if it's cute but it's to the point Sonic can't STAND her at all is why he tries to get away from her. She got lucky to be even 5 feet near him at sonic riders without him just rushing off leaving her in the end.</p>
<p>I MEAN ALL HE DID WAS SAVE HER LIFE! THAT'S NOTHING TO HAVE LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT WITH! In fact, I even started to dislike sonic for even having a girl as Amy who's unrequited love is being shown as broad as the obvious fact of George Bush's ill leaderships of being president of the USA, and that's just putting it the nice way! I say, SEGA should try to find someone else to keep Amy distracted. That way, Sonic can feel safer and she can have a guy to finally wait on her hand and foot lovingly to her attentive care. I, for one, if made a character, would be willing to give my life for her! At least I would treat her right. - Mialover730 09:22, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>"This is from a site I found: Disclaimer: This is a factor as to why sonic's popularity has dwindled from what used to be in the west. It in no way suggests that Sonic has faded entirely.</p>
<p><br />
sonics failing partly because of sonic Team’s ethnocentricity. They adhere to cultural tastes of eastern culture (particularly the Japanese), while alienating, and demeaning values in western culture.</p>
<p>Blaze and Cream are key examples. Sonic Team portrays exclusively eastern ideals to be "right". Cream is called a girl "no one can hate", someone who is immune to hatred. Cream reflects eastern ideals for youthful, innocent girls (like many anime female protagonists). Western ideals like being tenacious, sassy, smart, and athletic (like the Disney princesses) are seldom if not entirely void in Cream's character. She is not marked for being bright as noted by Blaze after she ignorantly insults Knuckles in his presence. She does not fight which deemphasizes athleticism. She also has a hard time keeping resolve that is shown in Heroes, when she wants to give up her search for finding her kidnapped friend, Chacola. This is the perfect girl that in Sonic Team's opinion, cannot be hated, which is further implied by a lack of testimonial criticism for her nature by other charachters.</p>
<p>Blaze is opposite of Cream. She has traits that westerners hold ideal in women. While Cream's eastern traits go uncriticized, Sonic disrespects Blaze’s very western resolve to get the Sol emeralds alone, calling her “overzealous" while he respects Knuckles' constant resolves to restore the Master Emerald by himself. Both Blaze and Knuckles mirror the other's duties as guardians to their respective emeralds. Both are qualified to be lone gaurdians. Blaze can attain the Sol emeralds alone, and KNUCKLES restore Master emerald alone. But Sonic, whom viewers hold bias for, (as we experience the game through mainly his points of view), believes Blaze is wrong for being tenacious while Knuckles is not Knuckles is not questioned for his endeavors.</p>
<p>And it's not just Blaze; taking charge is not rewarding to any female characters, in the games. Tails can be praised for saving Station Square on his own, while Blaze is criticized for being independent. Tikal fails to convince her father, and Amy’s tenacity to woo Sonic falls on deaf ears because Rouge, as well as Cream and Tails imply to her, is that being physical to gain respect is quote: "too persistent". Yes Amy aggressively takes charge with Sonic, so do his male rivals (KNUCKLES and gay shadow) their own agendas like Amy. Sonic has unspoken respect for them, not her.</p>
<p>He trusts them in decisions he makes: Shadow helping him defeat the Biolizard, and trusting Knuckles to take care of Amy and Tails in his place before his last battle with Shadow in Sonic Adventure 2. He will not run from them. When Amy is as aggressive as Sonic's male rivals are, Sonic runs away from her as he does in Sonic Heroes and Battle. The double standard between males and females suggests that western aggressive ideals are wrong, particularly in women. While eastern ideals for more passive women is "right" because characters like Cream go uncriticized.</p>
<p>Sonic Team is aware of the other continuities of Sonic outside of their games. But while Sonic Team has largely recognized the Japanese continuities, they almost totally ignore Sonic continuities in the west.</p>
<p><br />
In the early 1990's there was a Japanese continuity of Sonic outside of the games, a manga in Shogakukan's Shogaku Yonensei. In this very manga, the original versions of game characters Amy Rose and Charmy were born. Sonic Team recognized this Japanese continuity of Sonic, and even decided to place these two comic book characters into the games Sonic CD, and Knuckles Chaotix. Compare this recognition to characters in the west. Not a single character in western continuities outside the games set foot in a game directly made from Sonic Team.</p>
<p><br />
Many argue that Sonic Team rejects western characters for their games because they are involved in continuities/ storylines that are too different from their games. But Sonic Team changed Amy and Charmy from their original selves as much as necessary, so that they could fit into game premises should parts of their original basis be incompatible with the games. So it certainly was not a matter of compatibility or incompatibility between the manga and the game's storyline. It was not an issue that they were more popular than western characters. Because Sonic Team could be almost entirely changed from the way supposed fans of the manga might have originally recognized them, which they were. Sonic Team has never taken these extremes for characters of western continuities.</p>
<p>Amy's role as Sonic's girlfriend in the manga was negated to that of a fangirl in the games. Their original mutual, affectionate relationship is not incorporated in the games, which changes their dynamic. Charmy's role in the manga as Sonic's advisor is nullified. Charmy is a member of a detective team now. Again, this indicates an unfair bias Sonic Team has against continuities outside of Japan.</p>

Sonic Team does not take responsibility to incorporate in their games what westerners typically affiliate with the name Sonic which take westerners out of their comfort zone. In the newer Sonic games, they constantly incorporate only what the Japanese affiliate with Sonic, confusing and alienating people from western countries, who identified with, "Coconuts" instead of "Kiki", "Robotnik" instead of "Eggman" to simply list a few examples.</p>
<p><br />
Robotnik was the name given to Sonic's mustached arch nemesis in the west. Eggman was his name in Japan. Nowadays, Sonic Team has merged the names together. In the west Eggman is supposedly a nickname for Dr.Robotnik according to Sonic Team. That way, the names can both used simultaneously without cultural confusion, right? Wrong.</p>
<p>Sonic Team does not live up to their claims to "merge" the cultures. Culture alienation still exists in the western version of the games since the name Robotnik is rarely recognized in Sonic Team games, possibly only once. "Dr. Robotnik" is not actually called "Dr. Robotnik" in the English version of the games and even refers to himself as Dr. Eggman. Other characters including protagonists address him as such, even during serious situations when using a nickname, which is used to infer teasing/friendly familiarity is not appropriate (such as when Robotnik places a gun to Amy's head and she cries "Dr. Eggman!" in Sonic Adventure 2). The non-usage of traditional western elements in the more recent games infers what the west has established about Sonic is wrong, while what has been established to be Japanese is right. Despite both are correct terms SEGA has approved of since Sonic began on the genesis. Both names were originally products of localization, which exists in order to make different cultures connect with a product. Neither is more "right", as both names hold the same purpose for the character.</p>
<p><br />
What's more, even Sonic Team's management of the games also implies bias to Japan. The famous incident that has recently occurred for instance: when the original game voices actors were fired, and replaced with the Sonic X ones. The reason for this decision was because Yuji Naka wanted to have smoother continuity, in which the game's voice actors were synonymous to the shows, like it is in Japan. There are two things that are problematic with his rationale:</p>
<p>In Japan, although the voice actors in the games were the same as in the show, it did not affect the overall popularity/unpopularity of the show, and these concepts were certainly not enough to save the show from cancellation. Despite this, Yuji Naka wants it managed like Japan.</p>
<p>Secondly, the sudden transition of voice actors was unsettling to western fans, after growing accustomed to the game actors, which existed longer than the show. This has caused resentment towards Sonic Team, especially since many of these fans would equally argue that the voice talent in the show is too melodramatic and mediocre. Naka did what he did for the sheer sake of making the west follow the east as has been policy for so long. Not because this move would be well accepted by the western fanbase..</p>
<p>Sonic Team has turned their backs on western culture, and has even gone through the trouble of disrespecting, and ignoring it. Westerners are subtly told not to be, or like western concepts in the Sonic games they buy. This despite the fact Sonic Team has the audacity to bring their games to the west which suggests they expect us to buy the games, when the anti western content make their games incompatible for the west. During the genesis era, Sonic was successful because there was no dialogue, or other identifiable themes in game itself that could be biased to a culture, and manuals could be made to localize the game.</p>
<p><br />
People need to wise up. We are supposed to pay Sonic Team to play games that we are supposed to enjoy through personal connection, not the other way around. It is not fair that Sonic Team provides a take it or leave it attitude in which, you either tolerate their Japanese ideals, and accept the “wrongfulness” of western culture, or not buy their games at all. Japan is not an evil culture despite flaws, which can be present in all cultures, but as such can also be said for western ones. People who appreciate Japan's culture should be freely able to do so, but people who appreciate western culture should be as well, without someone inferring that they are "wrong" for doing so.</p>
<p>Sonic should belong to the world as SEGA originally intended, and not simply Japan."</p>

<p>Should that really be there? I mean we don't really care about her panties do we? I'm just asking for opinions from other people because I just removed it. --Coconutfred73 02:32, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Um, hate to say it Coconutfred73, but I think you were a little late to revert. Yeah, as I said in my edit summary, I just don't think very many people will care to know about her panties, whether this piece of trivia is verifiable or not. I left the IP a friendly custom message on its talk page, just to say that it isn't necessary. --<b><a href="../../../l/u/i/User%7ELuigiManiac_c98a.html" title="User:LuigiManiac"><span style="color:#32CD32">LuigiManiac</span></a></b> | <b><a href="../../../l/u/i/User_talk%7ELuigiManiac_87a2.html" title="User talk:LuigiManiac"><span style="color:green">Talk</span></a></b> 02:43, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sonic is 15 and Amy Rose is 12, though they're too young to get married. They have to be at least 18 years old to marry each other, because they're anthropomorphic. --<a href="../../../p/j/_/User%7EPJ_Pete_cdc8.html" title="User:PJ Pete">PJ Pete</a></p>
