<p>I've just removed an external link I added a couple days ago, to <a href="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/laetrile.html" class="external text" title="http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/laetrile.html" rel="nofollow">The Rise and Fall of Laetrile</a>. I added the link because the external article covers a lot of the publicly known information about clinical tests, double-blind studies, etc, involving Laetrile (a 'refined' form of amygdalin marketed as a cancer preventative/cure by Krebs and others). However, when I added the link, I didn't realize that the article is hosted at a site called <a href="http://quackwatch.org" class="external text" title="http://quackwatch.org" rel="nofollow">Quackwatch.org</a>. Looking over the other articles at the site, they seem unduly biased - for example, their list of '25 Ways to Spot a Quack' is pretty dubious - 'Quacks say organic food is better for you', 'They'll tell you to take vitamins' (paraphrase). I'm not trying to state an opinion about the worth of organic food or vitamins, but equating such banal and widely held views as 'take vitamins' with the belief that amygdalin/Laetrile is an effective anti-cancer agent... well, the whole thing just seemed suspect, so I didn't feel confident keeping the link in the article. If anyone thinks the link is useful and up to Wikipedia's standards, by all means, feel free to add it back in - I'm new here and still feeling my way around. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMathtinder_3eb6.html" title="User:Mathtinder">Mathtinder</a> 07:29, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think the way that the cancer studies are presented are not neutral. Mainly because it is only stated halfway through the discussion (about it being a cancer cure, preventitive), that none of the studies are double blind, and the discussion concerning it seems biased. Just speaking from a standards point of veiw, it is not beyond reason to state that the studies occured, however conversly it should not appear to be biased in presentation. i think they (the studies) should be included, however, it should be made clear that in all fairness, more studies, that are double blind or otherwise safeguarded against bias are needed, for one to make any kind of informed decision on the matter. The article seems to use its non-approval by the FDA as reasons that it is not a cure/preventitive, when what it really means is it is like any other unproven drug, in that it needs to be proven. It hasnt been disproven. More so, I think the whole issue concerning cancer should really be its own section within the article, and in that section both sides be presented. I do not think creating another article, just for the cancer studies, would be prudent, but it wouldnt be beyond reason either.</p>
<p>Concerning such statements as these:</p>
<p>"One Phase II study with 175 patients had some patients reporting improvements in symptoms, but all patients showed cancer progression 7 months after completing treatment"</p>
<p>While I do not disagree with the facts of this study, it may be prudent to note that other cancer treatments (if terminated too early) have extremely high remission rates as well, or it should be clarified whether or not those studies had terminated treatment of the patients earlier then other cancer treatments or not.</p>
<p>"While no double-blind clinical trials may have been conducted"</p>
<p>This should be stated first, for both sides, as i myself am also not aware of any double blind studies that concluded that it had a definitive, measurable impact on the cancer (positivley). It should be duly noted the medical position of both sides for comparison and contrast.</p>
<p>It is simply my opinion that, in general, the studies should either be more clarified as to the circumstances under which they were conducted, measures be taken to reduce or eliminate bias, and the point be made clearly that in all honesty more studies are needed for any ultamite conclusion, or that the matter simply be stated as a stalemate, and summarized, with the possibility that another article is authored with the specific intent of dsicussing the seperate facts and views of the issue. However, if one side is measurably more factual then the other, it should be properly noted and clarified.</p>
<p>If no one contests what I have said, I will just make the changes myself.</p>

<p>FYI - HHS / NIH Press release</p>
<p>--News National Cancer Institute 1/24/2007</p>
<p>Positive results of a phase III cancer clinical trial in an uncommon form of leukemia were released today. The results showed that adult patients with previously untreated acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) who had standard chemotherapy to induce remission of their disease, and then received the chemotherapy drug arsenic trioxide to maintain remission, had a significantly better event-free survival (more patients free of leukemia) and better overall survival than those who received only standard chemotherapy. The trial was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and was led by one of its Cooperative Clinical Trials Groups -- the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB).</p>

<p>The NPOV tag is most definitely needed in this article. The article reads biased against laetrile and amygdalin. For instance, the paragraph about Jason Vale spends more time about him being convicted of something totally unrelated to Amygdalin and almost no time on what amygdalin did for him. <small>Unsigned comment added 12:47, 13 February 2007 by User:130.126.208.84 <a href="../../../1/3/0/User_talk%7E130.126.208.84.html" title="User talk:130.126.208.84">talk</a></small></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>biased against laetrile and amygdalin</i> - er, biased how? The most reliable evidence available says "the claim that laetrile has beneficial effects for cancer patients is not supported by sound clinical data". How is this biased? Can you provide credible evidence that this study was inaccurate? Difficult since there are amazingly few scientific studies that support the claim.</li>
<li>the article is not biased against amygdalin, it is biased against <b>the unquestioned assumption</b> that amygdalin cures cancer. There is plenty of evidence that it doesn't and is in fact toxic. Stating those facts <i>as well as</i> the claims for cancer cure is not bias, it is balance, providing NPOV.</li>
<li><i>something totally unrelated to Amygdalin</i> - Laetrile and Amygdalin are the same thing, so how is that biased?</li>
<li><i>spends more time about him being convicted of something totally unrelated</i> - he was convicted for "heavily advertising and selling Laetrile, a highly toxic product that has not shown any effect on treating cancer" - fact. How is that biased? How is that unrelated?</li>
<li><i>almost no time on what amygdalin did for him</i> - we have no credible references for what amygdalin did for him. For example, a friend of mine was diagnosed with bowel cancer last year. My wife, trying to help, gave her apricot seeds. Didn't help, the friend died 2 weeks ago anyway. So where was the magic power of amygdalin there? Suppose she had survived. Would that prove amygdalin cures cancer? NO! It would have been a correlation, but correlations do not imply causality. And on the sample I have had direct knowledge of, it was completely useless.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>- Note: This is anecdotal. While in life, we are forced to make many decisions based on anecdotal information, it really has no place in a discussion where more sound data is available. As any scientist will tell you, one case is not a statistic. It tells you nothing about the probabilities. How do I know that two seeds a day was the right dose? How do I know that treatment was started in time? How do we know if this was a type of cancer that is responsive to amygdalin. How do we know your friends death wasn't the result of a complication? Perhaps he was responding to the amygdalin, but in was a case of too little to late. Even the most optimistic people, say amygdalin is only 40% effective, when given with proper treatment, which also includes changing diet. So, if all your friend did was take two apricot seeds a day, I would say his chances were not much better than doing nothing, even if amygdalin is as effective as people claim. <small>Unsigned comment added 05:22, 12 March 2007 by User:67.55.8.65 talk</small></p>

<dd>Of <i>course</i> it was anecdotal. That's the whole damn point. Although it occurs to me that you may have misread the above, most of which was in reply to the first paragraph added by an anonymous user in defence of the NPOV claim. I then disputed that claim. It was not immediately obvious that this was the sequence of events in the conversation because the anonymous user who added the NPOV tag did not sign their post. I have now added a signature for them to make it clearer.</dd>

I would suggest that someone, other than myself or those who have continuously removed the NPOV tag review the article for its neutrality. There are obviously multiple people concerned with its content's neutrality. I have read, and suggest the people removing the NPOV tag read, the Wikipedia standards of neutrality. This article fails on several tenants, including fairness of tone. Removal of this nomination without a neutral party reviewing it is a violation of Wikipedia standards.

<dl>
<dd>The only reason the NPOV tags were removed was because they weren't backed up with any statement of what was allegedly wrong with the article. If you think that was a violation of standards, please tell us which standard it violated so we can improve our behaviour.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You can always ask for an independent peer review if you wish at <a href="../../../p/r/_/WP%7EPR_690c.html" title="WP:PR">WP:PR</a>. This may help to allay fears of bias.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will reread <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and review the article for "negative tint" and "fairness of tone" over the next day or two. Meanwhile, do you have any other criteria for bias? Fairness of tone and negative tint seem to me to be a bit of a vague peg on which to hang bias. Do you have anything more specific? In particular, you say you have done reading on this subject in the past, so can you supply us with credible references?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am quite happy to talk about these issues, I just get a bit impatient when bias is claimed without telling us what specifically you are unhappy with. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhaedrus86_4bd1.html" title="User:Phaedrus86">Phaedrus86</a> 01:33, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As an afterthought - this topic generates strong opinions. Even if it a consensus is achieved, anonymous editors will keep changing it. Wikipedia doesn't guarantee stable articles. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhaedrus86_4bd1.html" title="User:Phaedrus86">Phaedrus86</a> 05:07, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which is why I feel very strongly that NPOV tags not backed up with reasons here should be deleted after a suitable delay - max 1 day. --<a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERifleman_82_610c.html" title="User:Rifleman 82">Rifleman 82</a> 05:36, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Amygdalin does work and works VERY well. Try it if you have cancer! Better yet, become a raw foodist.</p>

<dd>Right. And you have proof of this, of course? <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhaedrus86_4bd1.html" title="User:Phaedrus86">Phaedrus86</a> 23:02, 5 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>
