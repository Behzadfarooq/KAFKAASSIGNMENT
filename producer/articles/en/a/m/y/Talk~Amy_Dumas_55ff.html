<p><b>RUMOURS</b></p>
<p>Please note as this is urgent to the page:</p>
<p>I've removed comments relating to her current relationship status as it is unknown if she is with Adam Copeland and it will remain so until one of them (not Matt Hardy, not a wrestling "news" site, not a random "source" but Adam or Amy) states conclusively the status of their relationship and a link is provided to back this up. Unless this is so, any comments on the situation should be REMOVED! I hope I have your agreement in this.</p>

<p>To anyone in any doubt, Amy does not currently have a Bebo or MySpace. When she does, it will be announced via ADORE or via the Luchagors MySpace where Amy definitely posts messages. This is a band MySpace so therefore more reliable than Adam's gimmicky MySpace which is unlikely to be controlled by him.</p>
<p>Therefore, anything said on "Amy" bebos or MySpaces shouldn't go on her page. Unless its confirmed by her, her personal info needs to stay as it is. No exceptions.</p>
<p><br />
Amy does have an official myspace now. Look on luchagors top for it!</p>

<p>I've moved all the notable and/or salient points of the "Trivia" section to fit in the article.

<p>I have removed comments related to this. There is no evidence other than Internet heresay as to whether she is dating Adam or still friends with Matt so it is best left blank either way. It could be mentioned that Matt and Amy have had dinner but it should be said that Edge said this on Byte This and he said that the reason was for "closure". Any speculation on the status of Adam and Amy's relationship and Amy and Matt's relationship, is just that, speculation. She may well be with Edge. She may not be friends with Hardy</p>
<p>You don't know.</p>
<p>Can we NOT paste articles from wrestling "news" sites? A wrestling news site should be considered unreliable until proven right as they have been wrong many times before.</p>
<p>Also, nothing relating to Adam and his relationship status (again, according to news sites which are falsely reporting him as still married). This is an Amy page, not Adam's.</p>
<p><a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathanemile_b1d0.html" title="User:Nathanemile">User:Nathanemile</a>- Even though this is not Adam's page. I would like to put up the fact that he won the title last week. I think it's important because Lita was a factor in the match.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just to point out, whether it'll be used on this page or not, it doesn't matter but since it was brought up, Adam has confirmed that he is in fact single and eyewitnesses at one of Lita's concerts with her band have said that it seems Lita's dating one of her bandmates but at this point, that is neither confirmed or denied: <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.121.95.188_7984.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.121.95.188">74.121.95.188</a> (<a href="../../../7/4/2E/User_talk%7E74.121.95.188.html" title="User talk:74.121.95.188">talk</a>)</small></dd>

<p><br />
MySpace status does not count as confirmation - by confirmation, I mean a quote in an interview seeing that MySpace automatically sets the status to single. There is no evidence whatsoever to back up the claim that Lita is dating one of her bandmates so the relationship status should stay as unknown. In fact, I've heard eye witness accounts state the opposite. In fact, if we're going by MySpaces, Lita is not dating anyone from her band. Nothing should go up unless quoted by Amy Dumas or her other half, whoever it is.</p>

<p>For the record, the term 'Lita DDT' only appeared in the Smackdown! video games. I wonder what makes you think that is the official term?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Fr3nzi3, what are you nagging about? If you're so hung up on getting the official names of Lita's moves, then you have to go by WWE and not by JR. For one, I've have plenty of media on my computer than can prove you wrong that Lita's moonsault is officially regarded as a Litasault. It isn't. It's been documented by the WWE to be the moonsault. Her DDT is regarded as just that, a DDT by the WWE BUT, she uses a variation of the DDT which is a snap/pendulum DDT which JR most recently called an Impaler DDT but otherwise, the WWE and not even JR considers the DDT to have Lita's name associated to it. Her top rope hurricarana is called a Litacarana but that's the only thing that's both officialized by both the WWE and by JR's commentating. Relying solely on what JR commentates isn't reliable seeing as how other commentators don't always use the same terms as JR does when calling a match. I'm not saying the Litasault hasn't been used before, but don't make it seem as though it's been officialized, otherwise, the WWE would be the first to have it listed: <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.121.95.188_7984.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.121.95.188">74.121.95.188</a> (<a href="../../../7/4/2E/User_talk%7E74.121.95.188.html" title="User talk:74.121.95.188">talk</a>)</small></dd>

Who sez it is the Lita DDT? You? If so, then stop wasting your time making pointless contributions. Use a credible or official source to back up your claims, like WWE Fantasy or JR's commentary for 'Litasault'.</p>
<p><br />
The WWE site calls it a DDT, so it should be named DDT and in paraenthesis Leg Swing Snap DDT,cause thats the technical name for it. Lita DDT is used in the Smackdwon Vs Raw 2006 game and thats the only time ive heard it been called that</p>

I've read the sections dealing with stage names (where BG James is discussed), and that section was not added by the person who created the guideline. In fact, the guideline's creator, when editing the section, actually only added the paragraph at the end warning people not to disambiguate between the politician and the wrestler using "BG" and "B.G." Furthermore, B.G. James isn't even indexed under his character's name, but under his real name. That's hardly a resounding endorsement of ring names over real names.

<p><b>This remains currently unknown to the public and therefore (unless you have any hard evidence ie a statement from either Adam or Amy) should be stated as such.</b></p>

<p>What do you mean he changed his story? I would like to hear his new story. lol@-w/hardy. Anyways just fyi, rumors suggested they(Amy/Adam) broke up in November, citing the pressure from the fans as the reason. Just a rumor. I was just being open to the possibility.</p>

<dd>Adam has confirmed that he's single and looking on his myspace page so that obviously means that they're not together...if that's information that would still like to be added to the page: <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.121.95.188_7984.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.121.95.188">74.121.95.188</a> (<a href="../../../7/4/2E/User_talk%7E74.121.95.188.html" title="User talk:74.121.95.188">talk</a>)</small></dd>

<p>MySpace is not a proper source so it shouldn't go up. MySpaces are done for a variety of reasons - as gimmick pages, publicity stunts and they automatically set you to single and besides, there's nothing to say that Adam is controlling it. In fact, considering his schedule, he probably isn't.</p>
<p>A proper source would be a quote by either Adam or Amy which can be linked or proven. Otherwise, it shouldn't go up.</p>
<p><b>In this case Myspace would be an appropriate source considering that Edge runs the site along with a close friend of his who would know the status of his personal life as far as dating goes. No WWE star has a myspace up that is in character or following their own gimmick and if that were the case, then Edge would be cited as being in a relationship with Lita but that isn't the case so his myspace being filtered through his WWE character is false. Therefore, his myspace can be considered an actual personal page that isn't set up with the intent to follow through on his character and therefore him saying that he's single and looking for a woman on his myspace is a credible source. Also, fan sightings of reported that Amy is possibly dating the guy from her band judging by the very intimate interactions seen between the two at their local gigs.</b></p>
<p><br />
Just to say I read this on litas bebo page</p>
<p>Adam Copeland! I Love This Guy So Much he Means The World 2 Me, Hes My Everything, Hes So Great 2 Me Hes really Sweet and He Knows Just How 2 MAke Me Happy When Im Sad and I Just Wanted 2 Say I Love You So MuCh With all My Heart Babe!</p>
<p>wether this is her I am not sure but i believe it is due to the amount of profile veiws, friends, and comments-</p>
<p>Bebo's and MySpaces should not be used as evidence. Lita does not yet have a personal MySpace or Bebo. A MySpace entitled "The Rated R Superstar" is not a definitive source on the actual real life of Adam Copeland as the Rated R Superstar is a gimmick.</p>
<p>There are more fan reports stating that Amy is not dating a member of her band then there are otherwise. There is absolutely zero evidence.</p>
<p>[edit] Finishing and signature moves</p>
<p>Basically, unless she personally says it, don't put it. Simple as that. Ends all arguments pretty nicely.</p>
<p><br />
Amy and Edge are not dating, in fact Adam Copeland (Edge) has reunited with his wife.</p>
<p>She didn't want the breakup of her and Matt to be public, huh? Blame Vince, he wanted to make it into a storyline, and in some cases her for hurting Matt, and Edge for screwing his boy like that. Some will say there is two sides too every story, and I'd love to know why Amy cheated on Matt, but the fact remains that amy did Matt wrong and to cheat with a married man that was his best friend, that was low.76.197.249.52 17:58, 23 February 2007 (UTC)BigBoi29</p>

<p>Lita's WWE contract expires soon (in 1-2 months) and Lita has shown interest signing with TNA. This is because she wants to wrestle but the WWE writers have nothing for her besides being Edge's valet. TNA has wanted for a while to grow it's women's divison with good wrestlers and signing Lita would be something that would help make it grow. Should this be added to the article?</p>
<p><br />

Apparently she has told fans that she is taking a little bit of time off but will be back sooner rather than later. The "acting" thing is untrue, she has previously stated that acting is not for her.</p>
<p>It shouldn't go up unless WWE or Amy herself publicly announce it.</p>
<p>Lita isn't going to TNA. She'll just end up groping men twice her age like poor Gail Kim and Jackie Gayda.</p>

<p>Hi yes I actually read this on litas official bebo</p>
<p>My WWE contract is scheduled to expire on December 1st. As of a week ago, the feeling was that I would actually finish things up at Cyber Sunday or the night after on RAW, but I'll be staying at least a little while longer because I am added to the U.K. tour that starts on Wednesday. Maria and Candice Michelle were pulled from the tour in favor of Myself vs. Mickie James title matches. Once my contract expires, I plans on concentrating on my punk rock band and doing some indy film work. The general feeling within WWE, which is pretty accurate since I am sick and tired of them, is that I will eventually sign with TNA due to the easier schedule.</p>
<p>So guys, in not too far future.. You can all say,</p>
<ul>
<li>Mimicks Christopher*</li>
</ul>
<p>TNA is Lita!</p>
<p>Lita doesn't have an official bebo, this person is pulling your leg. They just took the exact news reported on a wrestling newsite and replaced the name 'Lita' with pronouns such as 'I' to make it seem like it's really her.

<p>This page should be reopened for editing, it has not be "vandalised", but added to. It dose not mention any thing about Lita's actions on RAW, which as of recent have been major (Edge winning his second WWE Championship, SNME). Second, the images that were posted were improvments. The image at the top of the 2005/2006 shows Lita much better (Her mouth is not open, her head is not tilted up, her eyes are fully open). Third, the championship images are important to the article, any time an image is available it should be added to illustrat the subject. Fourth, her move set. the " Spinning Out Powerbomb Into A Kneeling Pin" is not valid. She has done a spin out powerbomb once, to Jazz and even so it should be under "Litabomb" (Powerbomb or Spin Out Powerbomb). Pluse the Suicde Dive which she has used many times through out the 2004 period is not up there. Then the "Standing Hurricarana" directs straight to the tope of the Professional Wrestling Aerial Techniques page. It should be under <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_throws.html#Frankensteiner" title="Professional wrestling throws">Frankensteiner</a> since a Frankensteiner is the proper name of a hurricarana ( a hurricarana ends in a rana pin). Last the Twist Of Fate is no longer her finisher it should not be in bold. It is now soley by Matt Hardy and Lita has not used it since late 2003. Information in an article should only be deleted if it is off topic, a rumor or and opinion. It should only be put in proper format not deleted. And when ever possible, a good image should be used to show the topic. Were or not it's "utterly pointless." Please reopen this page for editing. Thank You.</p>

<dd>Last I recall, hasn't there been pure evidence posted in this very talk page that the Litasault/Litabomb names have been recognized names for the moves? Go find it and you'll find that it was deleted by the user. Which means, it was there. And you really can't say Edge winning the WWE Championship has nothing to do with Lita, when she was his valet and she helped him get the job done. That's kind of like saying that King Booker winning the World Heavyweight Championship has nothing to do with Chavo Guerrero, and last I recall, Chavo screwed Mysterio. Lita helped Edge.

<p>Lita is a huge asset to the accomplishments of Edge. Even though Lita only used the spinning out powerbomb a couple of times it has been called Litabomb by Jerry Lawler. Go to this video and you will hear Jerry clearly calling it Litabomb. <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=VdAw25yxZDo" class="external free" title="http://youtube.com/watch?v=VdAw25yxZDo" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=VdAw25yxZDo</a></p>
<p>I agree, the spinning out powerbomb she's used has always been regarded as a Litabomb. She doesn't do it hardly enough for me to personally consider it a signature move but considering that they've personalized the name of the move for when she uses it, I guess it would count. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.121.95.188_7984.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.121.95.188">74.121.95.188</a> (<a href="../../../7/4/2E/User_talk%7E74.121.95.188.html" title="User talk:74.121.95.188">talk</a>)</small></p>

<p>McPhail your constant vandalizing of Lita's page is becoming a major problem. We have discussed previously on the talk page and came to a conclusion that the moves are called The Litasault, the Litabomb, and the Lita DDT. You leave it for a while, then go back and delete it. It seems that you sre trying to be difficult and use your power as an experienced wikipedia editor to intimidate people with your clearly wrong point of view. Considering I and others have tried <b>so hard' <i>in trying to resolve this matter in a civil fashion, including showing you an abundance of proof--you still persist on being a nuisance.

<p>Stop talking out of your ass!!! They have consistently called the move the Litasault and Lita shown like five more examples where they have called it these moves, but someone still has Bomb for years now, even on Smackdown when she waas wrestling Stacy Keibler, they called the move the LitaBomb and Litasault! Don't be a jackoff, and stop just deleting things for the sake of an argument! I don't know if I can be bothered to find any more proof because there are some very obstinate and obnoxious people on here who are just around to be an annoyance, plus I have something to say to dispute it!!

Excuse me?You obviously don't stand anything about prowrestling if you think a move used one time is a finisher so all I'm going to do is make sure this page stays TRUE to the facts and not what one person thinks.Sorry kid but face it you are wrong its a moonsault and a DDT read the website I think the WWE knows more about its own talent than you.</p>
<p>A proof that the move is called the Litabomb--look at 7:40 of the video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChXeckaASoQ&amp;mode=related&amp;search=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChXeckaASoQ&amp;mode=related&amp;search=" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>
<p>ONE match does not make it a move and AGAIN THE WWE'S OWN WEBSITE LISTS HER MOVES AS A DDT NOT A LITA DDT</p>
<p>^^You blockhead! I am sorry I had to call you that because I have been battle with your dumb ass for months now! I dont give two hoots what the WWE has on their website (which still states Torrie Wilson's finsiher as a springboard elbow!) Which is very wrong!! Go by what the announcer calls the move, and they have consistantly called the move the Litasault, and Litabomb for years. Plus another shitstain has gone and deleted the Litabomb entirely! WTF!

<p>This is almost the excact same situation as the Backcracker argumet on Carlito's page. The WWE does not always care to go by what anouncers call moves.

<p>That is stupid! On Torrie Wilson's WWE Page it lists her finisher as a springboard elbow! Everyone knows her finisher is the Nosejob, so then we should delete the Nosejob from her wikipedia page then! Similarly, if you hear JR calls the move Lita's DDT or he calls it an Impaler DDT!

<dd>Lita's powerbomb is called a LitaBomb. But as for her moonsault, here's a list of just a few of the matches where she's performed the move and it has been called a moonsault and NOT a Litasault:</dd>
</dl>
<p>-Trish vs Lita&#160;: Unforgiven 2006 -Lita vs Ivory&#160;: 9/11 match -Lita vs Ivory&#160;: Survivor Series 2000 -Team Extreme vs TnA&#160;: SD (Trish's first match in the WWE) -Team Extreme vs Tna&#160;: Heat (don't know the exact date) -Lita vs Stephanie McMahon&#160;: (Lita's first title win) -Lita vs Trish (Lita's second title win)</p>
<p>Yes, JR has called the moonsault a Litasault before, he did so when she use to mimmick Essa Rios, but most of the time, he calls it a moonsault. The last time JR called the moonsault a Litasault is at Unforgiven 2003 when Lita made her in ring return from her neck injury. The fact that moonsault is used more than Litasault should be enough indication that the moonsault s her finisher is the most applicable term for her move: <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.121.95.188_7984.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.121.95.188">74.121.95.188</a> (<a href="../../../7/4/2E/User_talk%7E74.121.95.188.html" title="User talk:74.121.95.188">talk</a>)</small></p>
<p>Now to that fat idiot Fr3nZi3 I WILL TYPE IN CAPS SO YOU UNDERSTAND A FINISHER IS A MOVE THAT ISN'T USED ONCE OR TWICE HENCE WHY THE LITA BOMB IS NOT WORTH NOTING OK DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ANYONE IN THE WWWE CAN DO A POWER BOMB AND THEY WOULD CALL IT A EDGE BOMB OR A ORTON BOMB OR A KING BOMB DEPENDING ON THE WRESTLER THAT DOES NOT MAKE IT A MOVE WORTH LISTING SHE HASNT USED THE MOVE VERY MUCH SO SORRY AGAIN YOU ARE WRONG SAME GOES FOR THE ENZUGIRI A MOVE USED A FEW TIMES IS NOT WORTH BEING NOTED sorry MARK and as for why I am insulting you well you did it to me many times first so how does it feel to know other say you are wrong because guess what YOU ARE WRONG as for Torrie Wilson she does not wrestle enough to have a known finisher and as for Carlito's Back Cracker ..well that move is known as a Lung Blower and Matt Striker used it on Heat before him. So feel free to edit as you want and I will do the same but do not insult me because you dont even know what a mark is if you do insult me I will insult you back.</p>
<p>Probably they weren't watching WWE at all... All they do here is ban. Those who have power abuse that power, but like I said, they can't stop them all... The truth shall set you free. Lita DDT, Lita Bomb, and Litasault are correct terms for her moves.</p>
<p>The truth sorry but last night on RAW Lita said MOONSAULT AND LITACANRANA.</p>
<p>Yep. Lita said Moonsault and Litacanrana which should prove the fact that her moonsault is called just that while her hurricanrana is called a Litacanrana. 83.233.58.44 22:38, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I deleted the bit about Lita being the first woman to attempt a top rope moonsault. That is FACTUALLY incorrect. I know for a fact that Bull Nakano has used the top rope moonsault in the WWE and I don't need to convince people of who came first. I believe there are other women who have done the move before Lita but all you need is one name to disprove that trivia post and therefore it should not be there.</p>
<p>Also, what's the point of saying that Lita along with Ivory, Moolah and Trish have had the title more than any other WWE diva? That's irrelevant and it seems like you're trying to magnify the amount of title wins by saying that she's among the divas who've held the title many times but the fact remains that she hasn't held it the most and unless that's the case, it's not relevant and is ridiculous to add on the page.</p>
<p>Also, Lita and Victoria's cage match wasn't the first diva cage match in history of wrestling. It was the first divas cage match in RAW history...at least, that is how the WWE cites it and therefore, the article should do the same to avoid it possibly being incorrect. Here's the wwe.com exert:</p>
<p><b>RAW - Lita vs. Victoria, Steel Cage MatchNovember 24, 2003 | Approx. run time: 6 mins.It was the second edition of RAW Roulette live from Salt Lake City, UT. The matches throughout the night were determined by a spin of the wheel and it was determined that Lita would face Victoria in the not-so-friendly confines of a steel cage. It was the first women's Steel Cage Match in RAW history and it looked like Lita had things well in hand. Matt Hardy made a surprise appearance, but how would he factor into the outcome?

<p>She also isnt the first woman to doo a moonsault</p>
<p>She's not the first to do a moonsault, but she is the first to do a tope rope moonsault.<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngli_Cado_Primoris_be61.html" title="User:Angli Cado Primoris">Angli Cado Primoris</a> 20:42, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Tomoko Watanabe did a moonsault at Survivor Series 95 if I'm not mistaken and yes it was from the top rope and if it wasnt her like stated above Bull Nakano did one so Lita is not the first.</p>
<p>The Steel Cage match between Lita and Victoria was not only the first ever women's Steel Cage match in RAW history, but also in WWE history as well. I edited in references to the other trivia that were needing them as well. Thanks! 58.165.68.237 22:40, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know it's listed that Lita has been in 7 main events, however, that is only when regarding her matches. She was only promoted in the main event when she married Kane so that means that she's been a part of 7 main event matches but all together, she's been a part of 8 main event segments and I think that should be corrected to specify both her specific main event matches and also to include the Kane/Lita wedding since the wedding was promoted as being the main event of the night.</p>

<p>Someone typed in this article that Amy Dumas and Adam Copeland never slept with each other.

<dd>Your edit was reverted (by me) because in an attempt to clean up Wikipedia, we try to keep rumors, speculation, and play-by-play/future events out of the WWE articles. The reason the retirement text is in the article because it's just merely stating what WWE said, but lets not change the retirement date until it happens.&#160;;).

<p>Should this section (fan moves) be put back into the page? LitaDDT is from the game, thats widespread acknowledged by fans, and Litasault is used very often. JR isn't the only one hyper over the word, most fan posters in the stadiums and commentators sitting there use 'litasault' whenever shes does the moonsault.</p>
<p>As for litabomb, well thats a JR creation, any opinions on whether it should be there?</p>

No editor replied. And the nutcase who kept reverting edits seems to have gone too. As per the comments in the source-file and from whatever I have managed to understand from this talk-page, I put the fan moves section back. For the love of God, whichever new editor has an issue with that, please discuss it on the talk page first!</p>

<p>No I dont think there is any need for it, as those are just fan names and are not offical in anyway it was just put there to make some Lita fanboys happy who can't accept that those are not the move names. There is zero reason for it to be on the page.<br /></p>
<p>I hope I'm not the 'nutcase' that you're referring to. I will admit, I've reverted back quite a few times and apparently a lot of people don't agree with me, so allow me to explain. A couple of weeks ago, someone came up with the idea of creating the 'Fan Names' section, because the 'fanboys' kept coming in and changing the main finishers to the incorrect terms such as 'Lita DDT'. The Fan Names section will probably prevent this from happening as much, and it doesn't contradict the names of her finishing moves, because it's off by itself. Do you see what I'm saying? <a href="../../../l/e/v/User%7ELevodevo_48e5.html" title="User:Levodevo">Levodevo</a> 05:48, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I removed it a while back because the fan name section is not an encyclopediac section; it's just fannism. Having a list of what fans have also called her moves is not something to be mentioned in an encyclopediac entry. BTW, I added the edit war over names to the list of pointless edit wars. <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnakinjmt_7c04.html" title="User:Anakinjmt">Anakinjmt</a> 03:15, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

No problem,Levo. It was an IP, btw, and the editor was very hostile. You seem more sensible than that bugger&#160;;) As for the fan moves section, at the time I figured it was a better way to keep vandalism out. Now I believe the article looks fine. Perhaps we could have the names the fans have given to it in brackets next to the official names, but other than that, I think the moves section is alright as it is. <span style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;"><a href="../../../x/c/e/User%7EXcentaur_defa.html" title="User:Xcentaur">xCentaur</a> | <a href="../../../x/c/e/User_talk%7EXcentaur_db5b.html" title="User talk:Xcentaur"><font style="color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;">☎</font></a></span> 06:27, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
