<p>Noticed your new defence commentary on Timothy Usher. I find your protecting him inexplicable. He incidentally happens to be particularly interested in that bit of the Aisha article that speaks on her being 6 at marriage. He incidentally supports FNB's freedom of speech rights when FNB posts a picture on his user page, of a pig with "Allah" superimposed on it in Arabic. He happens to edit Musaylimah to point out that he's a false prophet, just like Muhammad. Other than you, every other communication he's had with a Muslim had been in a form of an attack, either directly or through references to denegrating Islam and Muhammad. I can't make any interpretations of your behavior without violating some bloated or twisted form of some WP policy for another, so I won't. I would think it a terrible idea that a barnstar or two and some flattering words would be all it took to make a person acquience to hate speech. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 15:56, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>H.E., please let me go through your evidences. I haven't read your comments to this detail but I will and I'm always open to change my mind 100%. Also, FYI, I have told Zereshk about this ArbCom. I've asked him to inform all other related editors here. Surely Zereshk doesn't have a good view towards Timothy Usher, and I did it intentionally and in fairness since you were thinking I am not a good sample here. I didn't want to be responsible for it, so I informed Zereshk. Everyone should speak up. Your point that the way Timothy talks about Muhammad is sometimes offensive to Muslims is a valid point, it was the same to me, and we had discussions over it through email. He claims that he does so not only for Muhammad but also for Jesus and other people. He told me some jokes... I didn't find it to be his specific attitude towards Muhammad. You may think I am doing a mistake. Maybe. I am not free from it. But my responsibility is to decide based on whatever I have seen. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 16:13, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BTW, re the Aisha age, I am more inclined to accept she was married at 6 but stayed in her parents' home till she had reached puberty (at 9 or maybe 10 according to Ibn Hisham). Aisha reached pubetry early and this is stressed by all her accounts (Spellberg points out). So, there is absolutely nothing wrong with her marriage at age 6. And this not only my own view, but the view of the dominant majority of Muslims. Now indictment of Muhammad based on this just shows rank of ignorance (to my mind of course) and I don't think Timothy has done so. If he has, I can argue with him and convince him but I don't think he has done so in the first place. I need to check your other evidences... --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 16:28, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even I will say that anyone marrying a 6 yr old is a pedophile. Anyone having sex with a 9 or 10 year old is also pedophilia. Timothy knows that, and it's with that knowlege he edits the article to emphasize that aspect of Aisha's life. The majority of Muslims aren't even aware of the Hadith that makes that claim, much less the long dispute over the authenticity of that claim and the opposing views on that. Timothy Usher made it quite clear he believes Muhammad is a murderer. "Muhammad himself violated a woman named Safiyah after torturing her husband and beheading him" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Battle_of_Khaybar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47027545" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Battle_of_Khaybar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47027545" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> "Muhammad would be considered a war criminal - executing POW's, ransoming others, poisoning wells with dead bodies, etc." Does it take an ounce of intelligence to see what tilt his arguements aim to support? In "Criticism of Islam" you justified the existence of the article by saying "I am a Muslim and support the existence of this article for I believe it is constructive." An article that is larger than WP policy would suggest as a normal size, documenting and analyzing every single claim against Muhammad that can be vocalized. Fixing the POV in that article becomes a difficult task when a person who calls himself a Muslim uses the "I am Muslim and I endorse this article" line, despite criticism of the article's POV by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. You've brought the same hurdle to Arbcomm now, defending someone whom most objective readers see as indefensible because of the obvious bias in his works. And sorry, but I don't buy it that you are unaware of Usher's edit history, you're as well-acquainted with him as I am...just as I don't buy your ignorance plea when <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> was stating as a matter of fact, that the Muslim marriage amounted to slavery. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 17:59, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Starting from the end; Man, Why don't you buy my "ignorance plea when <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> was stating as a matter of fact". If you have a look at my edits to Dhimmi article, you'll realize that I have been working on the article from the top sections (because they are read first) and the Shia ritual purity section (which I was more familar with and was picked up first). Just check it. I am going to make a claim and I'm sure you'll not accept it from me: See this edit of mine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dhimmi&amp;diff=65631890&amp;oldid=65629809" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dhimmi&amp;diff=65631890&amp;oldid=65629809" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. There was a dispute between Pecher and Itsmejudith on the section of "Places of worship" &amp; other passages. Now, do believe me if I claim I haven't read this very section closely? I have read the first paragraph closely and have an idea of what's going on there, but just an idea.</dd>
<dd>Now, I should say I remember once Faisal and Timothy were discussing marriage somewhere and sometime. Faisal believed husband should be Muslim since the children go for the religion of husband. This, I remember. But still you are willing to accept that I am a liar as you have evidences of that. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 19:45, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You've been editing this article for a month. You're telling me you've been editing it for a month but you never read it? The same content has been disputed in the talk page time and time again with Muslims taking strong opposition to the inclusion of the notion that Muslim marriages are relations between slave-owner and slave. Faisal was arguing precisely over the content I later argued about. You do all this in-depth research, it doesn't make sense to me that you'd be oblivious to the content of the articles you work on. From your earlier request for info on Timothy Usher's support of the pig image, it's apparent you intend to claim you don't know of Usher's antics either. Read through the evidence I posted on the Arbcomm page, on Timothy Usher. Read through the pages you've been editing for so long. I won't pretend to give you the benefit of the doubt. And please do not use "I am a Muslim" to express your endorsement of things you haven't even read, things written by hate mongers to defame Islam and insult Muslims, just because they were written by your friends. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 20:09, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For a month!!!! Did you know that I was editing (well, never succeeded to insert more than a sentence into this article till recently) this article long time ago. I, together with Farhansher &amp; Pecher were involved in an unsuccessful mediation over this article. I then left, then Faisal came instead of me. I was little active when Faisal was there. And he left when I came back. Funny Huh?! <i>H.E., do you want me to show you a diff from the very past (when you were not here but I was involved in this article for 'awhile'), expressing the same thing that I have only read parts of the article??</i> The same situation.

<p>Continuing our discussion: H.E., I have studied some of the first evidences you provided in the ArbCom. I <b>think</b> Timothy is inspired with an imperfect (if not incorrect) understanding of 'how <i>mainstream</i> Islam (safely mainstream shia per my knowledge) views and interprets itself.' His view of Muhammad is formed based on the secular western sources; but the Muslim picture of Muhammad is formed from Muslim's own sources and interpretations. For example, many stories accepted by Muslims (and influencial in how Muslims view Muhammad) are simply rejected by western academics. Another example is the battle of Khaybar. To shia, the important thing there is Ali's power in taking out the door of the castle. Thus Khaybar is wellknown for <i>its door</i> to shia. They barely (to best of my knowledge) get into other details (similar to Christianity in which [I think] pastors usually focus on moral issues rather than theological issues). Here is how Muslims view, interpret the battle of Khayabr <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Khaybar&amp;diff=47144017&amp;oldid=47062738" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_Khaybar&amp;diff=47144017&amp;oldid=47062738" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. Timothy on one hand considers this story to be *POV*, and later after the article becomes more *NPOV* considers the NPOV version as how Muslims really view the battle. This is not true! If Muslims want to learn something moral from Muhammad, they learn it from that *Muslim POV* version, not from the version compiled by secular sources.</p>
<p>H.E., Still, I am not convinced that he is an anti-Muslim bigot. He is an american after all. I'll continue reading. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 07:15, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>

<dd>There may be truth to what you say - at least, that few Muslims gloat in the details of these events as recorded by early Islamic scholars - but the real point here, in my view, is that a view of seventh century Arabian history is not an indictment of any living person or people. I'm aware that some might take it as such, but that's rightly their problem (though in practice, thanks to Wikipedia's wilful publication of personal attacks, after Bishonen, it's been made mine). It's not helpful to the encyclopedia that <i>anyone</i> be allowed to designate a portion of the past as "their" sacred history, for them and them alone to describe or suppress - particularly when that history is held to span nearly thirteen hundred years of a vast quarter of the old world.</dd>

<dd>The leap you keep making is that a critical view of Muhammad's life, as recounted in hadith and sira, equates to bigotry against Muslims. <i>Non sequitur.</i> When you attacked Jesus as a "coward" for failing to resort to violence, was that an attack on 2+ billion Christians?

<dd>If I made those kinds of comments REPEATEDLY, directed AGAINST Christian editors on articles like "Criticism of Christianity" or "Jesus", then yes, it would be bigotry against Christians. It would be repugnant and disgusting. If I made a regular habit of editing articles on Judaism and mocking their religious figures on talk pages dealing with Jewish issues, THEN I'd be a true anti-semite. When I said "Jesus was a coward", it was in direct response to a Christian saying a Hadith had some 'erotic' theme to it. I was angry. I have a right to be angry. WP editors are human too, after all. It's not JUST these comments that are offensive, though they are offensive enough. It's that your works all over Wikipedia are a product of these opinions.

<p>The word murderer means (according to a dictionary): "a criminal who commits homicide (who performs the unlawful premeditated killing of another human being)". This word means much more than one who has done the act of killing. Thus, using this word in the context where only killing is established is offensive to Muslims.</p>
<p>"By modern standards Muhammad would be considered a war criminal": Assume the technology progresses and we would be able to produce "meat" in labs. Then people will stop killing animals. Now some may come and claim that all of those who have killed animals in previous periods of time are the most savage people one can ever imagine. The question is why some may ask such question? If it is the question of whether Muhammad is the exemplar, well, I don't know anybody who have married with a young girl and have justified it religiously. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 02:25, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Marriage regulations are defined by Shia religious law, although non- Shias are permitted to follow their own religious practices. Before the Revolution, the legal marriage age was eighteen for females and twenty- one for males, although in practice most couples, especially among lower- class urban and rural families, actually were younger than the law permitted when they married. Consequently, the average marriage age for both sexes was 18.9 years. Since the Revolution, the minimum legal age for marriage for both males and females has been lowered to fifteen and thirteen years, respectively, although even younger boys and girls may be married with the permission of their fathers. The average age of marriage is believed to have fallen as a result of official encouragement of earlier marriages.</i><a href="http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-6430.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-6430.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> I guess, in cities, average marriage age for boys should be around 26-27 (sometimes later since it is hard to find a good job and all these things) and for girls should be around 22-25 I guess. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 18:40, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your comments. As to citing the Qur'an... I didn't know that, so thanks for telling me. As you can perhaps tell, I'm new to the Wikipedia world and there are some things I don't know, or forget. I'll look for a secondary source to back that statement. As to the other reference, although I'm sure there are numerous better reference choices than Karen Armstrong, I read her book recently and she was the first who came to mind. The section seemed to be in bad need of cleaning up, and I chose expedience over thoroughness, knowing that Armstrong was not the first to express those opinions. "Muhammad" does give a very thorough treatment of the historical context of the Qur'an, however, and though no Montgomery Watt, she is well-respected in her field, so I felt comfortable citing her. I'll definitely look into your suggestions, though. Thanks again. <a href="../../../j/s/h/User%7EJshepp_65ab.html" title="User:Jshepp">Jshepp</a> 08:03, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Probably it is off-topic for the arbitration, so I will reply here. I supported, for example, including Karen Armstrong, even though her scholarship is not comparable to Lewis'. She presented what some editors saw as a more favorable perspective, and I was willing to trade accuracy for harmony. As things have turned out, I see my idea was misconceived. Live and learn. And of course you are right: what Mehmet II (for example) did five hundred years ago says nothing at all about Islam today, or the character of the Turkish people, or anything else. George Washington owned slaves, grew hemp, and distilled his own whiskey. Those are all illegal today. That does not mean Washington was a bad man, just that he was a man of his time. Well, almost all of us are. Anyway, I like history, but I look forward to spending more time working on the mechanical engineering pages. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 00:36, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, Tom. I remember you were supporting Karen Armstrong. Tom, your presense was very helpful until you decided to leave the article. And I would say your block of H.E. was quite right. H.E. was making personal attacks badly. And your comment on the arbitration page shows your good faith assumption. It is true that I am not assuming good faith in the case of Pecher. But Tom, I am <i>tired</i>. Do you remember the view of lankarani on the ritual purity? Pecher first wanted to add it to the footnotes. The whole mediation was wasted on something that could have been solved very quickly. I have this problem over and over again. The article Dhimmi was completely written by Pecher. I want to bring neutrality back to it by not trading accuracy for harmony, but by using accurate sourced material. But that's even painful. Anyways, Tom, BTW, is your major mechanical engineering?

<dd>I agree with BhaiSaab. Also see the Manual of Style. It says that there should be a capital letter for the Prophet (of Islam). But the section on Islam-related articles says to avoid using "the Prophet" at all. There is a discussion page for each of these that you might want to comment on.

But the meaning of the story is <i>not</i> that the sinning son is more righteous - the story is entirely about God and His mercy. In Jesus' eyes (in the Bible, of course) being "more rightous" isn't even a question.

<dd>I am still studying it myself Tom. His name is not mentioned in Qur'an but I *guess* there should be verses that indirectly refer to him. Websites like "answering-christianity.com" had caused me to have a negative view of Paul to start with. HOWEVER after reading parts of the book of Romans, I can clearly see his "sincerety". Furthermore, I am sure he could not have been this much influential if God’s blessing wasn't with him. But I am still on the first line. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 03:23, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Basically, Paul is blamed for everything that went wrong in Christianity (even centuries after his death), and isn't creditted with any positive innovations. Paul's philosophy isn't strictly incompatible with that of Jesus, but it is somewhat different. I, too, used to have a negative view of Paul, but like Aminz have come to see this as influenced by propaganda, both Islamic and skeptical. The traditional Christian narrative likewise shortchanges Paul by pretending that he merely continued Jesus' teachings, when really he creatively built upon them.Timothy Usher 07:24, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And you will be surprised to see the deep connections between Shiasm and Paul's philosophy. My theory is that the <i>shortest</i> bridge between mainstream Christianity and Islam passes through Shia’sm. If you don’t believe me, wait for a couple of years till I establish a theory on that.&#160;:D --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 07:32, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are right that it is difficult to find good Islamic scholars. Some become too much liberal, who seem to twist the history according to their own interpertation, others, you know.... I find <a href="../../../j/a/v/Javed_Ahmed_Ghamidi_654c.html" title="Javed Ahmed Ghamidi">Javed Ahmed Ghamidi</a> really well-balanced. He is a very knowledgeable person who got education from two big Islamic scholars of 20th century, he is not liked by liberals because he still thinks that Islamic punishments in Divine law should be applied in Muslim countries, and he is not liked by conservatives either because he believes that punishment for Apostasy is no longer applicable after the Prophet, militancy and <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proselytization.html" title="Proselytization">proselytization</a> has no place in Islam, and with a few exceptions, Islam puts women equal to men.

<p>On the basis of the stars you deserved, i think you know alot about the islam. Hence, i would like to ask you whether you know if there was a polytheistic Allah. Thanks in advance. <a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERead3r_bd68.html" title="User:Read3r">Read3r</a> 12:24, 14 August 2006 (UTC) Damn i spent some valuable minutes seeking after the new messages i have. [Practical Joke]<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERead3r_bd68.html" title="User:Read3r">Read3r</a> 12:25, 14 August 2006 (UTC) More explanation: In this <a href="http://www.khayma.com/ftat/Mj/gess.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.khayma.com/ftat/Mj/gess.htm" rel="nofollow">arabic site</a>, you read that Talha [in the first story on the site] has claimed that "al-lat" and "al-'ozza" are daughters of Allah. This seems to be a common believe in the pre-islamic period, and this is the proof: "{أَفَرَأَيْتُمُ اللَّاتَ وَالْعُزَّى(19)وَمَنَاةَ الثَّالِثَةَ الْأُخْرَى(20)أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الْأُنثَى أنثى}(النجم:19-21)". Thus, Allah is denying the claim has daughters, wich means it was an influencial story in the pre-islamic period [Jahiliyya]. My own conclusion is that Allah is a pre-islamic god [I'm not trying to insult the islam]. Because he has already existed in the Jahiliyya. Maybe, some one would say that Allah is common word for God, but i will then disagree since, it is senseless to say: there is no god but god. where as it sound very logical when sayying "There is no god but allah". So, even the well-known "tawheed" is supporting the thought that allah was a polytheistic god. Sorry, for writing all this nonsense, but i do appreciate your personal contribution in order to understand that.<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7ERead3r_bd68.html" title="User:Read3r">Read3r</a> 12:54, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>i have heard about this book. i currently have "Muhammad: A Short Biography" by Martin Foward (was lecturer of islam at leicester, bristol and cambridge, and is a member of the camrbidge university faculty of divinity) out on loan. he does not speak too highly of the shi'ite ameer ali (whom he describes as a modernist) when he cites "the spirit of islam" (as well as ameer ali's other works), and finds him at times to be rather exaggerating in his prose. that's what i gather from Forward's analysis.</p>
<p>also: do you have access to watt's book "prophet and statesman"? i am currently working on something and would like to cite it a lot more than i already have, and currently all copies are out on loan at the local library (&#160;:-( ). <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 00:47, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>yes i have been using google books and amazon, but the content i require isn't present on it. just to update, i took a look at Forward's book again and he attributes some strange views to ameer ali (regarding the qur'aan), and he criticises ameer for his attitude towards umm al-mu'mineen aa'ishah, for which he cites ameer's sectarian influence. i'm not really working much on the battle of mu'tah article, although i hope to soon in the future when i get some free time. what do you think about EoI? if you have access to EoI, then some articles on the events of hudaybiyyah, the unification of aws and khazraj by Muhammad and/or correspondance between Muhammad and other leaders would be very much appreciated (if it isn't asking for too much!). thank you. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 01:20, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am the one, whome you just messaged. I believe that Shariah is definitely applicable, if applied properly. Interestingly, Shariah is very simple and asks for a more democratic society than most people think. In its interpretation, it got strong influence from persian, indian, and especially christian (byzantine) culture. As there can be faults in our understanding, not in the laws which God sent to His Messenger. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 02:58, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The problem is what which I just stated above. As <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghamidi.html" title="Ghamidi">Ghamidi</a> believes that if someone is a professional thief, the punishment is to chop the hand, if someone has murdered, kill him, if someone has commited adultery (irrespective of its marital status, as Quran doesn't differentiate and respect privacy and asks four witnesses to register the case) whip 100 lashes. But if these crimes go to higher degree, like theft becomes robbery, murder becomes terrorism, adultery becomes rape. Then punishments mentioned in Quran <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/005.qmt.html#005.033" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/005.qmt.html#005.033" rel="nofollow">5:33-34</a> will be applied. Secondly, there is no difference mentioned in Quran or Sunnah between women and men for these punishments. Most Muslims interpret on some hadith which doesn't give enough good reasons to prosecute married people for adultery with punishments mentioned in <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/005.qmt.html#005.033" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/005.qmt.html#005.033" rel="nofollow">5:33-34</a>. Punishment of simple adultery as stoning is not an Islamic punishment rather a Jewish one. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 03:28, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think punishments are according to the nature of crime. People who become beasts and rape children and women, and those who slaughter people. I believe that people should fear from such punishments more than crimes so that even psychos would think twice to do something like that. And I have heard real stories from my friends, that they were about to kill someone, but when they thought that they would also be killed if caught, they stopped it, because they were so much angry at that time, that even life time imprisonment would not hurt their emotions. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 03:42, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
