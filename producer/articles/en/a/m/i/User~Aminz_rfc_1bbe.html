<p>Particular wiki-policies that are violated in timewasting attempts to trash sound academic research. Please note that this is not a content dispute. Preference of a conservative journalist over scholars like <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a>, or outright dismissing scholarly works like <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_of_Islam_e80f.html" title="Encyclopedia of Islam">Encyclopedia of Islam</a> by users who are apparently well aware of the policies is not a content dispute.</p>
<p><b>1. Violations of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a></b></p>
<p><b>#1</b> Removal of the quotes from <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_of_Islam_e80f.html" title="Encyclopedia of Islam">Encyclopedia of Islam</a>, the standard encyclopaedia of the academic discipline of Islamic studies. Examples: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antisemitism&amp;diff=89170450&amp;oldid=89169621" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antisemitism&amp;diff=89170450&amp;oldid=89169621" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antisemitism&amp;diff=89169150&amp;oldid=89168202" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antisemitism&amp;diff=89169150&amp;oldid=89168202" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antisemitism&amp;diff=89167578&amp;oldid=89140693" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antisemitism&amp;diff=89167578&amp;oldid=89140693" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>The article in <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_of_Islam_e80f.html" title="Encyclopedia of Islam">Encyclopedia of Islam</a> is written by <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Cahen_df5e.html" title="Claude Cahen">Claude Cahen</a> a distinguished Islamic historian (According to Prof. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Cohen_d89d.html" title="Mark Cohen">Mark Cohen</a>), "an eminent authority" (in words of S.D. Goitein another renowned scholar whom these editors themselves approve and use). The above quote was taken from the Dhimmi article by Cahen. S.D. Goitein describes this article as <i>"For Islam, see the concise, up-to-date, and authorative article "Dhimma" by Claude Cahen in EI, which registers also the relevant material."</i> Another example of removal of sourced material is <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">User:Beit Or</a>'s edits on <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Cahen_df5e.html" title="Claude Cahen">Claude Cahen</a>'s article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Claude_Cahen&amp;diff=91128654&amp;oldid=89369222" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Claude_Cahen&amp;diff=91128654&amp;oldid=89369222" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>Other evidences presented in support of Cahen's quote: Encyclopedias writing about anti-semitism and Medieval times don't mention Islam at all: examples: <i>Encyclopedia of The Medieval World History on Anti-Semitism</i>, <i>Encyclopedia of The Middle Ages on Anti-Judiasm</i>, <i>Dictionary of The Middle Ages on Anti-Semitism</i></p>
<p>When User:BhaiSaab asked User:Humus Spaiens to read the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_of_Islam_e80f.html" title="Encyclopedia of Islam">Encyclopedia of Islam</a> article, he dismissed the reliability of the source based on his own views <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Antisemitism&amp;diff=89206191&amp;oldid=89176508" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Antisemitism&amp;diff=89206191&amp;oldid=89176508" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>. To Humus sapiens, <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_of_Islam_e80f.html" title="Encyclopedia of Islam">Encyclopedia of Islam</a> is a POV teritary source which must be removed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=89180712&amp;oldid=89178067" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&amp;diff=89180712&amp;oldid=89178067" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p><b>#2</b> Usage of unreliable sources over reliable ones. These users consider <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Johnson_%28journalist%29_db19.html" title="Paul Johnson (journalist)">Paul Johnson (journalist)</a>, a conservative journalist who has only a <i>lower-second class degree in Jesuit method</i> (which is not even Islamic studies or Jewish studies), to be more reliable than <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a> &amp; <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Cahen_df5e.html" title="Claude Cahen">Claude Cahen</a> for the following reasons:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Johnson's publications are have likely outsold those of Lewis by a wide margin (diffs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jayjg&amp;diff=89123312&amp;oldid=89121968" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jayjg&amp;diff=89123312&amp;oldid=89121968" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aminz&amp;diff=89124411&amp;oldid=89077061" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aminz&amp;diff=89124411&amp;oldid=89077061" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>)</dd>

<dd>Johnson has a lot of publications.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In fact, the book written by Johnson, the conservative journalist, is <b>not peer reviewed</b> either. It is published by "New York: HarperCollins Publishers", not a univ press or other ones which particularly publish scholarly books. I have introduced many sources to them including <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Cahen_df5e.html" title="Claude Cahen">Claude Cahen</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Stillman_0160.html" title="Norman Stillman">Norman Stillman</a>, etc etc but they insist in using the conservative journalist despite existence of several other sources.</p>
<p>Humus Sapeins believes Johnson is a notable historian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aminz&amp;diff=89385342&amp;oldid=89385205" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aminz&amp;diff=89385342&amp;oldid=89385205" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and I was accused of attempting to remove material that does not correspond to your POV.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aminz&amp;diff=89385952&amp;oldid=89385342" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aminz&amp;diff=89385952&amp;oldid=89385342" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.</p>
<p><br />
<b>#3</b> Removal of views of scholars such as <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Stillman_0160.html" title="Norman Stillman">Norman Stillman</a> and S. D. Goitein. Before that, we need to to see the views within academia of the subject. My research shows that there are two academic POVs regarding traditional Islam:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. There was no antisemitism. Examples of scholars who state that: Claude Cahen, <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a>: Quotes:</li>
</ul>
<p>- <b><a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a></b>: "Prejudices existed in the Islamic world, as did occasional hostility, but not what could be called anti-Semitism"</p>
<p>- <b><a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Cahen_df5e.html" title="Claude Cahen">Claude Cahen</a></b>: "There is nothing in mediaeval Islam which could specifically be called anti-semitism." (This very sentence is also quote by <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Cohen_d89d.html" title="Mark Cohen">Mark Cohen</a>)</p>
<p>- <b>Nissim Rejwan</b>: "Anti-Semitism, then, is an exclusively Christian phenomenon and, as such, a predominantly Western one. It is therefore both historically wrong and morally inexcusable to try to apply the term to non-Christian and non-Western societies."<a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813016010&amp;id=vPnfmxTcyL8C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;vq=anti-semitism&amp;dq=Israel%27s+Place+in+the+Middle+East:+A+Pluralist+Perspective&amp;sig=dnFSXMt5uGsnfWpyt5TWAOo3_tM" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0813016010&amp;id=vPnfmxTcyL8C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;vq=anti-semitism&amp;dq=Israel%27s+Place+in+the+Middle+East:+A+Pluralist+Perspective&amp;sig=dnFSXMt5uGsnfWpyt5TWAOo3_tM" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>
<ul>
<li>2. Antisemitism was not absent as it is assumed. There was little antisemitism:</li>
</ul>
<p>- S.D. Goeith: "Still “anti-Semitism,” that is, hostility directed against the Jewish community, was not entirely absent from medieval islam, as has been assumed." The footnote for "as has been assumed" says: "Even by such an eminent authority as Claude Cahen (in the EI article quoted above)"</p>
<p>- <i>The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion</i> writes: "In the Muslim world, antisemitism developments were far less overt, except in periods of religous extremism. There was little specific antisemitism, and Jews were treated (or ill-treated) like other infidels."</p>
<ul>
<li>3. In modern times, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Stillman_0160.html" title="Norman Stillman">Norman Stillman</a> writes: "Increased European commercial, missionary and imperialist activities within the Muslim world during the 19th and 20th centuries introduced anti-Semitic ideas and literature into the region. At first these prejudices only found a reception among Arabic-speaking Christian protégés of the Europeans in Syria, Lebanon and Egypt and <b>were too new and too palpably foreign</b> for any widespread acceptance among Muslims. <b>However, with the ever-increasing conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine</b> during the period of the British Mandate, the language and imagery of European anti-Semitism began to appear in political polemics both in the nationalist press and in books."</li>
</ul>
<p>I was progressively working on this section. The last final version which I ended up with but was reverted is as follows: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antisemitism&amp;diff=89564361&amp;oldid=89563176" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antisemitism&amp;diff=89564361&amp;oldid=89563176" rel="nofollow">[13]</a></p>

<p><b>#5</b> Dismissing reliable sources by calling them polemic, or being anti-Zionist:</p>

</ul>
<p><b>2. Double Standards</b></p>
<p>User:Humus spiens, used the scholar S. D. Goitein (a famous scholar of Jewish studies) when it was quoted by the journalist but removed it when I added it. In fact, even the journalist refers to Goitein as a "great scholar". I was expecting and requested User:Humus spiens to add back the scholarly quotes but instead he added another quote from the journalist.</p>
<p>User:Jayjg while accepts the *un-peer-reviewed* work of a journalist, is over-skeptical of a peer-reviewed article from the <i>Journal of Palestine Studies</i> which could be found in <a href="../../../j/s/t/JSTOR_27a2.html" title="JSTOR">JSTOR</a> .<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:New_antisemitism&amp;diff=95392921&amp;oldid=95387540" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:New_antisemitism&amp;diff=95392921&amp;oldid=95387540" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>.

<p>I used to follow these pages actively, but I don't any more, and I don't know the current condition of the articles. Based on past experience, I think Aminz has a point. There are two views, and both should be presented with due weight, as they are supported by reliable sources. At least some of the sources Aminz mentions are reliable works by respected scholars, and should be included.</p>
<p>I do not think any of the involved users is insincere. Based on our study and experience, we all have an understanding of history. We naturally find more reliable the sources that support that understanding. Within those sources, we find most significant the quotes that support our understanding.</p>
<p>These are large and complex subjects. Part of the problem in my view is generalization. Islam was not one thing over 1500 years of history, it was not uniform, and not everything that happened was attributable to Islam. The way Jews were treated in Constantinople in 1830 was probably not the way they were treated in 16th century Isfahan. Smaller, more focused articles might help.</p>
<p>None of this should be personal. My ancestors did lots of things good and bad, none of which say anything at all about me. Almost everyone is a man of his time. George Washington grew tobacco, distilled whiskey, owned slaves, and went to church. That does not in some way invalidate the US presidency as an institution, or show that Christianity is morally bankrupt, or that Washington was a bad man. There is no point in explicitly or implicitly applying today's moral standards retrospectively, and doing so is contrary to good scholarly practice.</p>
<p>We enforce our policies on sources and neutrality by editorial consensus. As a result, a majority of the editors who work on a page determines what sources to use on that page. This does not always give the best result, but I don't know an alternative.</p>

<p>Tom makes some good points here. Regarding the first few diffs, BhaiSaab was wrong in removing the Paul Johnson material, but Humus was wrong in removing the Enc of Islam material, and he was wrong in classifying that enc as POV - perhaps he mistakingly thought it was an Islamic enc as opposed to an enc about Islam? Anyways, both sources were reliable (enough) and could easily have been summarized and included in the article.</p>
<p>Humus' reversion of the material presenting the views of scholars who didn't think there was traditional Islam was overly aggressive. Again, there was a place in the article for that material.</p>
<p>Jayg's comments that Johnson has outsold Lewis seem not very relevant; for example, Karen Armstrong has outsold all of them, yet she's an absolutely terrible historian. As far as the comments about how notable the views of minor scholars like Rejwan are, I don't know enough about them to comment. If their views are truly a small minority, they only deserve small, if any, representation in the relevant articles. This has to be hashed out on Talk with lots of evidence. - <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 00:24, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your comment. User:Humus sapeins was asked to read the article on <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_of_Islam_e80f.html" title="Encyclopedia of Islam">Encyclopedia of Islam</a> (edit by BhaiSaab on 05:56, 21 November 2006 (UTC); antisemitism talk page) Humus sapeins replied&#160;:"After that quote it doesn't seem trustworthy." Humus sapiens argues that evidences like <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiraz_blood_libel.html" title="Shiraz blood libel">Shiraz blood libel</a> are antisemitism but only a reliable source is required to make such connections. Antisemitism is a theological hostility towards Jews.</p>
<p>I believe <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Johnson_%28journalist%29_db19.html" title="Paul Johnson (journalist)">Paul Johnson (journalist)</a> is not a reliable source on Islam, for the reasons stated in the RfC page. He has only a second-lower class degree in Jesuit studies and more importantly, his work is not published in a university press in which blind peer-review is practiced. Rijwan is not a minority view. <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Cahen_df5e.html" title="Claude Cahen">Claude Cahen</a> in the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_of_Islam_e80f.html" title="Encyclopedia of Islam">Encyclopedia of Islam</a> says that "There is nothing in mediaeval Islam which could specifically be called anti-semitism." <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a> says that "Prejudices existed in the Islamic world, as did occasional hostility, but not what could be called anti-Semitism". --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 01:49, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've been looking over some of the blood libel articles. I think decisions on sourcing necessarily have to be made there. I lean toward inclusion, subject to due weight, article length, and good writing - pages should stay on topic, and topics should be spun off to their own pages and summarized. Beyond that I can't say much, having really not much expertise in the area. I am surprised to hear Antisemitism described as theological hostility. I thougt it was based on ethnicity, but maybe the pretext for ill treatment has varied with time and place. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 02:06, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion states (and has only to say the following on Islam):</p>
<p>"In the Muslim world, antisemitism developments were far less overt, except in periods of religous extremism. There was little specific antisemitism, and <b>Jews were treated (or ill-treated) like other infidels.</b>"</p>
<p>Therefore the discriminative nature of the persecution is very important. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 02:09, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_of_Islam_e80f.html" title="Encyclopedia of Islam">Encyclopedia of Islam</a> states: "<b>there had been scarcely any difference in the treatment accorded to Christians and Jews</b> (at most they were distinguished by prescribed differences in dress); but it later came about that some categories of d̲h̲immī s were looked on as friends of foreign powers and were worse treated, and naturally some Christians were in this respect more of a target than the Jews. There is nothing in mediaeval Islam which could specifically be called anti-semitism." --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 02:12, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
