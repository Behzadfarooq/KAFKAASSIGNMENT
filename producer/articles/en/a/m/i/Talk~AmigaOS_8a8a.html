<p>When did AmigaDOS become AmigaOS?

<dd>It was never really AmigaDOS, although some users called it that. AmigaDOS refers mostly to the DOS library, and device system. Most people called the operating system "Workbench", or when referring to requirements for games that didn't use workbench, "Kickstart" was used. AmigaOS became the prevailing term around the time that AmigaOS 3.5 was released. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumpbucket_afd6.html" title="User:Lumpbucket">Lumpbucket</a> 08:48, 12 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note that pretty much all of those (including the only official one) refer to the CLI, which is only a small part of AmigaOS. I'll gladly add the CLI to the "list of stuff" to which AmigaDOS refers up there, however it is not a "catchall" term, and does not cover Kickstart, Workbench, intuition, the graphics library etc. As I said though, some people did use AmigaDOS to mean the whole OS. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumpbucket_afd6.html" title="User:Lumpbucket">Lumpbucket</a> 09:44, 12 Aug 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I suspect that "DOS" was pretty much synonymous with "Operating System" for most people back then. If it manages files on disk, then it must be "a DOS". (an OS can print stuff to screen, a DOS can write to disk too, sort of.) Plus, of course the fact that when you booted a game from floppy you only saw the "AmigaDOS" window title might have contributed. You rarely saw much of Workbench if you had the machine mostly for games. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagetoo_30b1.html" title="User:Magetoo">Magetoo</a> 13:33, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)

<dd>AmigaDOS just kinda turned into AmigaOS during the nineties. They're both mostly the same thing, and the CLI window will say AmigaDOS, but calling it AmigaOS just kinda came into fashion at one stage. I don't think either are technically incorrect. --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathan_Drain_9ea0.html" title="User:Jonathan Drain">Jonathan Drain</a> 02:54, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>More terminology: I don't believe the phrase "Workbench is the native graphical user interface for the Amiga computer." is correct. The Workbench is the desktop environment, to put it in standard terms. I have rarely, if ever, heard people who know anything about the Amiga call the GUI anything else than Intuition.</p>
<p>The part that without Workbench "...the application will lose the ability to multitask with other applications" is just plain wrong. It might be difficult to launch other applications though.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and the IPC efficiency is more due to the lack of memory protection and nothing else. (you can pass around pointers to any area of memory as long as you can coordinate things somehow, so no need to copy memory.)</p>
<p>Comments? I assume the article is written this way for some reason, and I'd like to know it before I start changing things.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe the article is written this way for a reason, but it must be a wrong reason, since it says false things ;-) I've noted your criticisms and changed the paragraph about Workbench accordingly, although I've left some big confusion between WB and Intuition untouched (for example, multiple screens are <b>not</b> a feature of WB, but of Intuition, of course!).</dd>
<dd>I'll probably rework the entire subchapter tomorrow or like that. Anyway, why are you afraid to edit? I'm new to Wikipedia, but from all the tutorials etc. I understand that you should <b>not</b> be! At least if you have valid reasons for editing. Which, in this case, you definitely had. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../l/j/l/User%7ELjL_5e2c.html" title="User:LjL">LjL</a> (<a href="../../../l/j/l/User_talk%7ELjL_9c16.html" title="User talk:LjL">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LjL_511f.html" title="Special:Contributions/LjL">contribs</a>) 2005-04-10 03:12:05 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>Some day I'd like to write something about the separation between kickstart and the disk-based part of the OS too.. <a href="../../../m/a/g/User%7EMagetoo_30b1.html" title="User:Magetoo">Magetoo</a> 13:33, 11 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<hr />
<p>Some explanations</p>
<hr />
<p>No problem you too. There is a little confusion but I will try to explain it all.</p>
<p>AmigaOS was the original name of the OS.</p>
<p>Due to a mistake of marketing of Commodore in printing vaste amount of labels of OS disks, the first release of Disks were labeled just "Kickstart" and "Workbench" and so the OS was sold on the market. People who bought Amigas believed that the name of the whole AmigaOS was WORKBENCH because they read Workbench on the disk label. Other people referred to AmigaDOS 1.3, because unexperienced people beliee that AmigaOS WAS AmigaDOS, beacuse they were influenced by MS-DOS and its way to indicate releases. Even Commodore employees sometimes referred to the AmigaOS with same terminology. But to be correct in definitions, the AmigaOS is a well balanced mix of different components. All this common consents in using incorrect names ended when Commodore released AmigaOS 2.0 (and more 2.04) and decided to re-introduce proper names to any installation disk (Fonts, Kickstart, Workbench, Tools, Extras), and to refer to all OS with its right name.</p>
<p>@ Magetoo:</p>
<p>Workbench is the GUI of Amiga. Intuition is the ENGINE of this GUI. AmigaOS components are strictly tied each one and Workbench is strictly tied with intuition. With introduction of BOOPSI (Basic Object Oriented Programming System for Intuition) Object Oriented System, Workbench could be improved or replaced by other GUI interfaces such as ScalOS. AmigaDOS is only the part of entire OS which deal with filesystems and commands, and DOS commands of AmigaDOS can be accessed thru CLI or SHELL interfaces. Amiga CLI windows are always named with "AmigaDOS" on the titlebar of the windows. This explains one of the images that user Mintguy linked to. Hope I was plain clear and get you away of your doubts.</p>
<p>--Raffaele Megabyte 09:47, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, I was mostly trying to put myself in the position of those who used the term "AmigaDOS" for the whole OS and think of a reason why they did that, I think it's pretty clear myself. And my shell windows are labelled "AmigaShell", by the way.  :-)</dd>
<dd>Actually, I'm not so sure about your divisions. Workbench is more like a "desktop environment", imho. It's basically an application like any other. Intuition is the GUI (and "widget toolkit", I suppose). I personally replaced Workbench with DiskMaster (a file manager) for a period; that didn't make the GUI disappear from all programs I used.<br />

<dl>
<dd>People... Workbench is not the GUI and Workbench is not a "desktop environment" (besides, let's leave this term alone, since today it's mostly used as a catch-all term for just about everything that pops on your screen).</dd>
<dd>Workbench is a <a href="../../../f/i/l/File_manager.html" title="File manager">file manager</a>, and it's also the default <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shell_%28computing%29.html" title="Shell (computing)">shell</a> of AmigaOS. Just like <a href="../../../m/a/c/Macintosh_Finder_c8bb.html" title="Macintosh Finder">Finder</a> on the Macintosh. Just like <a href="../../../p/r/o/Program_Manager_5742.html" title="Program Manager">Program Manager</a> on Win16 (well, err, except that ProgMan is <i>not</i> a file manager because the filesystem structure was too encumbered for them to use a file manager as default shell). Note that the articles for all of these mention the term "shell" in the first sentence or so.</dd>
<dd>Don't be confused by the fact that "shell", on the Amiga, is traditionally used as a way to refer to the CLI ("AmigaShell"): the term "shell" itself doesn't imply a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Command_line_interface.html" title="Command line interface">command line interface</a> at all.</dd>
<dd>Adding to that: Intuition is the GUI (i.e. what in <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unix.html" title="Unix">Unix</a> and <a href="../../../x/1/1/X11.html" title="X11">X11</a> terms would be called the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Window_manager.html" title="Window manager">window manager</a> + GUI toolkit, examples of the latter being <a href="../../../q/t/_/Qt_%28toolkit%29.html" title="Qt (toolkit)">Qt</a> and <a href="../../../g/t/k/GTK_26a9.html" title="GTK">GTK</a>). Except that, since OS 2.0 on, applications could use GadTools instead, a more advanced toolkit, which itself uses Intuition at a lower level. Then you have <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_User_Interface_f966.html" title="Magic User Interface">MUI</a>, ClassAct and all that... but originally, the GUI was simply Intuition.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I agree. (I was even going to compare WB to the Win32 <i>shell</i>, but decided not to, since I wasn't sure about all the facts. What is/was it, "explorer.exe"?)</dd>
<dd>Still, the name "Workbench" was chosen to relate to "Desktop". Sure, for marketing reasons most likely, but still. I don't think I ever heard anyone call the Workbench a "shell" back then, but is was referred to as "a desktop" lots of times (a catch-all term even then). Terminology changes I guess...<br />

<dd>Yeah, I too avoided mentioning explorer.exe, as it's anything from a web browser to a file manager to a taskbar (though I "suspect" it's just a relatively small program that uses a lot of DLLs). But all in all, yes, explorer.exe <i>is</i> the Windows shell now: just open win.ini or system.ini, don't remember which of the two, and you'll see <i>Shell="explorer.exe"</i> (at least in Windows 9x).</dd>
<dd>As for the name "Workbench" relating to "Desktop", that's true. There's the "Workbench screen" too. But I think that was just Amiga's (or Commodore's) choice to let the user consider the Workbench program and the "workbench-as-in-desktop" as intermixed, for better user experience or somesuch. But that shouldn't distract us when we're trying to reason in more technical terms.</dd>
<dd>Also, technically the AmigaOS doesn't even <i>have</i> a "default" shell (like Windows with that entry in win.ini): after all, Workbench is simply loaded by a command in a very normal script (the startup-sequence). Just put in another command, and you get another shell. You could even argue that the <i>default</i> shell really <i>is</i> AmigaShell (aka CLI) -- since if you <i>have no</i> startup-sequence, what you get is a CLI window. <a href="../../../l/j/l/User%7ELjL_5e2c.html" title="User:LjL">LjL</a> 23:59, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I reverted Lumpbucket's edit.</p>
<p>One of the main features of Amiga, Inc is that it's a software (and IP licensing) company, and one of the main features of AmigaOS 4 which ultimately is controlled by Amiga, Inc is that it's meant to run on third party hardware. Unless Amiga, Inc, who (allegedly) owns the "Amiga" trademarks, have ownership of or control over hardware development, it's not only entirely meaningless but also confusing and possibly dishonest to talk about "new Amigas". Amiga, Inc has no such control whatsoever.</p>
<p>The current marketing of hardware as "AmigaOnes" is a logical result of Amiga, Inc's third party hardware direction. The "AmigaOnes" may or may not be the only hardware to ever become licensed, Eyetech may or may not be the only hardware distributor that applies for and/or is granted a licence, and the Terons may or may not be the only hardware that this company decides to market under the "AmigaOne" label. There is no "official continuation of the Amiga line" of computers. "Amiga" today is the name of a corporation, and it used to be the name of a now obsoleted line of computers.</p>

<p>Please keep an eye on the stuff I'm writing, with some particular attention of terminology (like my use of "specifier": is there a better, standard, AmigaOS term instead?).</p>
<p>Also, if you plan to add to it, please consider that in my view it should be an <b>AmigaOS overview</b>: a detailed overview maybe, but without going into details that are not strictly related to the OS. For example, I don't think one should talk about draggable screens there, because (besides the fact that it's mostly a hardware feature) it's not quite an inherent feature of AmigaOS -- and in fact, screens are not draggable on most today's screen. Should one even talk about screens (or stuff like that, of course this is just an example) at all? I'm not sure, but I think not. The concept of a screen is part of AmigaOS, yes, but it's more specifically part of Intuition, and for reason of length, it would possibly be better to talk about it in a separate chapter or in a separate article.</p>
<p>This is obviously all just IHMO since "anyone can edit", but my hope is to have an Overview section that's coherent, interesting and not unnecessarily long, and I'm sure that everybody agrees with this.</p>

<dd>/Johan Gill, not registered</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Surely the Intuition and thus screen dragging and the concept of multiple screens is an inherent part of the AmigaOS. OS stands for Operating System and Intuition was intergral to the GUI of that Operating System. While the ability to see the screen below while dragging a screen was dependant on Amiga custom hardware, the actual concept was part of the OS. You can still drag screens with a chunky graphics card installed, and use the screen switching gadget, but you can not see the screen below (to the best of my knowledge). Prior to the use of the term AmigaOS, Kickstart refered to the OS required at preboot as held on chip or preboot disk, and Workbench the oeprating system as held on disk. The GUI was configured by elements of the Workbench disc so Workbench has to be considered part of the OS. McGonicle 12:12, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I made some technical corrections to the overview. Amiga libraries are dynamically loaded on demand and relocated - static libraries are "link libraries" and are not often found on users' machines, only developers' machines. They're not dynamically <i>linked</i> (SAS/C had an option to automatically work out the functions/bases you needed and open libraries as necessary, but this was not inherently part of LoadSeg()), but they are dynamically <i>loaded</i>.</p>
<p>I added an infobox.</p>
<p>What the article <i>needs</i>, imho, is a good overview that describes the main components (kickstart, exec, amigados, intuition, workbench, autoconfig), but without resorting to the deeply technical facts (which i renamed "technical overview"). It can then point down the page to explain the concepts of libraries, devices, handlers, amigados naming conventions and so on. I wanted to trim the amigados/handlers section because there's too much, but it's <b>all great stuff</b> and very relevant to AmigaOS.</p>

<p>I believe the official documentation (RKRM:Autodocs? Libraries?) in at least one place called the operating system microkernel-<i>like</i> and <i>nearly</i> realtime, or something similar.

<dl>
<dd>To add my own views to this debate, exec.library can, for all intents and purposes, be considered a microkernel. Why is there debate? Because in operating systems, even pre-MMU pre-memory protection pre-virtual memory ones, there is a distinction is between "user mode" and "supervisor mode". The kernel derives its "authority" by forcing the system into supervisor mode to run any of the "kernel". Exec eschews this mechanism. Instead of using the INT instruction (like MS-DOS) or the TRAP instruction (GEM-DOS and SunOS), you just point at a list of functions and jump to the one you want. If they need supervisor mode, they'll use it, otherwise they wont. Any Amiga program can use the Supervisor(), SuperState() or AddIntServer() functions of exec to run arbitrary code in what's traditionally considered "kernel" mode, meanwhile exec very rarely runs in this mode itself, as it doesn't need it. However, the <i>design</i> of exec is entirely a microkernel design, with exec only covering the very basic system management. It leaves all else (device driving, maths, I/O devices, file systems and access, timers, etc.) to other libraries, devices and resources, which either run as seperate processes and talk via message passing, or as libraries which run under the context of the caller.</dd>
<dd>Executive summary: exec is certainly a "microkernel", we're just not sure if it's a "kernel". 195.173.23.111 14:41, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, it's quite "microkernel-ish" but not very "macrokernel-ish". I think that section is perfectably acceptable as it stands (and better than either of my edits!). I don't know of any authoritative statements about whether exec.library is or is not a microkernel. Until such a statement turns up, "can be considered a microkernel" is true, informative and encyclopedic.

<p>Here's something interesting I just found: <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linus_Torvalds_1ecb.html" title="Linus Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> has <a href="http://www.realworldtech.com/forums/index.cfm?action=detail&amp;id=66656&amp;threadid=66595&amp;roomid=11" class="external text" title="http://www.realworldtech.com/forums/index.cfm?action=detail&amp;id=66656&amp;threadid=66595&amp;roomid=11" rel="nofollow">written</a> that AmigaOS</p>
<dl>
<dd>was <i>not</i> a microkernel. Exactly because it lacked the <i>one</i> thing that makes a microkernel: separate access spaces.</dd>
</dl>
<p>To understand what he is really saying here, you will need to <b>read this <a href="http://www.realworldtech.com/forums/index.cfm?action=detail&amp;id=66630&amp;threadid=66595&amp;roomid=11" class="external text" title="http://www.realworldtech.com/forums/index.cfm?action=detail&amp;id=66630&amp;threadid=66595&amp;roomid=11" rel="nofollow">comment</a></b> to find out what he means by "access spaces". Linus's point, as I understand it, is that (1) AmigaOS differs from "real" microkernel systems by having only a single, shared access/address space and (2) that makes AmigaOS radically different. For example, Amiga tasks can exchange messages containing arbitrary pointers, whereas true microkernels have to serialize data and/or provide object references of some kind. (See Solaris doors for an excellent example; they're powerful, fast and (IMHO) much harder than Exec messages to program with.)</p>
<p>Linus is using a particular definition of Microkernel here, which not everyone would agree with, so I don't think we should change the article's description of exec.library. In fact, I would say that Linus has just agreed with the article as it stands.

<dd>Linus is absolutely correct. I don't see any way that Exec can be considered a microkernel. The features mentioned by some people above are shared by virtually all operating systems.

<dd>Linus's definition of microkernel involves multiple address spaces and memory protection, which is something the 68000 didn't even support. In this case, it's just his (wrong, IMHO) opinion. On <i>modern</i> CPUs, an MMU comes for free, which is why modern microkernels also implement memory protection. Does AmigaOS manage its address spaces? Yes, it manages its singular address space with AllocMem() and FreeMem(). Does it need to provide memory protection to be a microkernel? No. Linus presumes that memory protection is a necessary feature of <i>any</i> kernel, microkernel or otherwise. With that attitude, there were no operating systems on microcomputers until the 1990s (which I would disagree with - TOS, MS-DOS, MacOS and AmigaOS were all bona-fide OSes, despide the lack of virtual memory support)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Lots of operating systems aren't modular, for example MS-DOS. You call INT 21h, you get one thing. You call INT 15h, you get something entirely different. Internally, the entire operating system is one monolith hiding behind the INT call, and each section of the OS can look up the private state of other parts. This is not modular. By comparison, AmigaOS and MacOS were modular - you had to access different components, which couldn't see into the innards of other components.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>AmigaOS was also entirely <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reentrant.html" title="Reentrant">reentrant</a>, whereas quite a lot of problems in UNIX stem from the lack of reentrancy. AmigaOS did not have the kernel-user distinction and the design laziness that comes with that basic principle. Operating systems with a kernel-user privilege mechanism often have a big sprawling non-reentrant mess in kernel-land, only made threadsafe by a global kernel semaphore - have you heard of the Big Kernel Lock (BKL) in Linux? AmigaOS didn't have this problem, it used semaphores and queues to service requests whereever possible. On occasion, it was used via Forbid() and Disable() to stop task-switching and interrupts, respectively, but only for microsecond-long periods of time defined in the documentation, because of the perceptible lack of interactivety and missed interrupts that could arise. AmigaDOS was completely seperate from the filesystem, which in turn was completely seperate from block device drivers. On occasion, I've seen filesystems (such as ARCHandler, the filesystem that treats archive files as directories) hang, and trying to access them hangs the current process, but opening a new process and going to a different filesystem is not a problem.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, if you don't realise how non-modular some operating systems are, and how little they use message passing, then perhaps you won't realise how distinctive the AmigaOS design was from its contemporaries. 195.173.23.111 11:20, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In fact, if you read Linus's argument, he's disputing the claim that "microkernels are simpler", by stating that microkernels would be forced to provide finer granularity memory protection than a monolithic kernel and thus would be more complex than a monolithic kernel - this is a strawman argument. AmigaOS also has this "feature" (lack of memory protection) of monolithic kernels, it just doesn't need to jump into "kernel mode" to get it. 195.173.23.111 10:47, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>195.173.23.111 is correct. The Exec <b>is a microkernel</b> in the sense of the term as used at that time, and in the strict sense of the word. Since then, microkernel has gained some additional semantic baggage in some people's minds, mostly because the term has largely been used in reference to machines with MMU/VM support and as an alternative to large monolithic kernels on such machines. Exec is based on one of the classic textbook microkernels, Xinu. It is similar in philosophy to Minix.

<dd>Most A3000s used ROMs, but some (like mine) had a small "Super Kickstart" in ROM which read Kickstart from floppy or hard disk. (Super Kickstart was based on AmigaOS 1.4, which never appeared anywhere else.) IIRC, only the machines manufactured in Europe had "Super Kickstart", but I may well be wrong on that detail. I do know that I never got my machine to boot a v3.x AmigaOS :=(.

<p>(This is relevant to a different Wikipedia article). I have the statement in front of me that, when a program terminates in AmigaOS, memory assigned by the program is <i>not</i> freed, and that it is therefore vital for the program to release all memory that it asked for, otherwise it is permanently "leaked". Is this the case? <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 10:48, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Memory that is not freed before termination of a program in the Amiga OS is leaked (assuming it was supposed to be freed - in some cases a program may have allocated structures and attached them to system objects, such as a device node). One of the most common modes of testing on the Amiga was checking free memory after program exit; there were many tools that automated that. Normal behavior of a program was to free all memory, and all malloc'd memory was automatically freed via exit-time hooks. (I.e. leaking memory typically only happened to memory obtained via AllocMem() and the like.) <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesup_c788.html" title="User:Jesup">jesup</a> 12:02, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Indeed. AmigaOS does little to no resource tracking in order to save the memory overhead that it costs to include tracking. There was also a third-party program that patched many allocate/free resource functions (e.g. AllocMem/FreeMem, OpenWindow/CloseWindow) and added resource tracking to them, however this would break any software that deliberately allocate memory then exited, for example programs which installed patches on system functions. Programs assume the responsibility for freeing all allocated memory. The standard C library implementation in most Amiga C compilers used an onexit handler that freed any memory allocated with the malloc() implementation, but if the program crashed or the AmigaOS memory allocation routines were called directly, memory allocations were not freed. Other languages had varying degrees of support for tracking memory, usually (like C) only if you used the language-specific memory allocators. 195.173.23.111 13:50, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you for your replies. The reason for the question relates to a discussion I've been having on <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memory_leak.html" title="Memory leak">memory leak</a>. I'm going to post a question which is very subjective, but maybe there's a consensus. The article includes "In modern operating systems, normal memory used by an application is released when the application terminates". Part of the debate is over whether this is really true, and whether it should say "In some operating systems...". The leading question is: is AmigaOS a "modern operating system"? A supplementary dispute, where it says "The application assumes that the request for memory has succeeded, and continues on this basis. This will typically result in an <a href="../../../a/c/c/Access_violation.html" title="Access violation">access violation</a> but in some cases may result in damaging information belonging to this or (in primitive systems) some other application." Should this have "some systems" in place of "primitive systems"? Thanks in advance. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 19:44, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The amiga would be included in "modern operating systems", and it does release "normal memory" (i.e. malloced) when the application ends. Program crashes on an Amiga do not release memory, so you could say it leaks on process crash. And a program that uses things like OpenFile() instead of open() will leak a filehandle (and some memory) if the program calls exit() without closing the file. As for your second question, the answer would be "some systems" - many "modern" embedded systems (including running unix variants like uclinux) do not have memory protection, and can read (and possibly write) structures using NULL as a pointer without an access violation. Personally, I HATE programs that don't check malloc (or any other calls) for failure. Good programming practice on the Amiga (due to the lack of VM) was to test programs and the OS against random memory allocation failures to see if they recovered cleanly or not. All allocations (and all system calls, etc) should be checked for failure and proper rollback/error-recovery done, unlike the typical Unix/Windows/etc method of "if (NULL == (foo = malloc(N)) exit(1);" or equivalent. But that's another rant.... :-) <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesup_c788.html" title="User:Jesup">jesup</a> 19:59, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would say "in most operating systems". Only (1970s/80s/early 90s) microcomputer operating systems and some embedded systems, especially those running on hardware without an MMU, would have no resource tracking. The number of such operating systems is quite small. I wouldn't use "modern", because almost all "old" (since late 1960s) operating systems running on expensive minicomputers or mainframes definitely had resource tracking, and some modern embedded operating systems don't have resource tracking. 195.173.23.111 13:21, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
