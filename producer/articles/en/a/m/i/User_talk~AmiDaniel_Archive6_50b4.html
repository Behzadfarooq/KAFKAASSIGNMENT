<dd>That's no problem at all! There's absolutely nothing wrong with making a few mistakes--we all do. I certainly appreciate your efforts on Wikipedia and hope that you will continue editing. Just a couple of tips: If you could please sign your posts (not your articles) with four tildes, like so: ~~~~, that will produce your username (or IP address in this case) and the date/time, which makes it a lot easier to follow conversations and respond to questions without having to dig through page histories. Also, using <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEdit_summary_0886.html" title="Wikipedia:Edit summary">edit summaries</a> with your edits will alert other editors of what changes you have made and will prevent your edits from being reverted. Thanks for your message, and happy editing! Feel free to contact me if you need help with anything. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 23:09, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you want adspace, then you're going to have to pay for it, and Wikipedia won't be the one providing it to you.

<dd>I wonder how much Jimbo could get for you on the open market... I think the above must be a joke; the combination of ortography and syntax doesn't, to me, suggest non-native speaker but, instead, native speaker feigning a less-than-proficient command of the English language; it's not great satire, of course, but it'll do, I suppose. Also, if he elects to purchase only your ass, may I buy a kidney; the removal of the latter is surely much less intrusive than that of the former... <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:58, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, I thought I fixed it the last time, but apparently not. The error is actually resulting from nothing that I'm doing, it's a JS error that occurs whenever some JS engines try to render Wikipedia pages that IE supresses to the toolbar, but I have no ability to that. However, I'm now using Wiki API to retrieve page histories (where a lot of the errors were occuring), and the API doesn't utilize javascript so I'd have to think those errors are now gone. Likewise I'm now retrieving recent changes from the RSS feed, which doesn't use javascript either. Time will tell, I guess. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 01:40, 26 May 2006 (UTC)

Clicking on one will revert the change and post a message on a user's talk page.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Concerning a "page vandalized" warning</span></h2>
<p>I noticed that such a comment was recently left on the IP user talk page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:217.155.0.238" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:217.155.0.238" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:217.155.0.238</a></p>
<p>The reason I arrived at that talk pace was because I noticed a problem with the current Muhammad_Ali article - that there was a second copy of the "First Title" section. The history of the article tells me that this user actually corrected this problem (a correction which was later reverted).</p>
<p>For the specific diff during the history, please see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_Ali&amp;diff=55044202&amp;oldid=55039522" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_Ali&amp;diff=55044202&amp;oldid=55039522" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_Ali&amp;diff=55044202&amp;oldid=55039522</a></p>
<p>Whether or not the user performed other acts which were actually vandalism I do not know. I just saw a mistake, and someone chastised for correcting it. I'm sure you'll agree it was likely an honest mistake of wrong identification.</p>
<p>We all love Wikipedia and take the folks that spend hours moderating for granted. I just wanted to say thanks for all your work.</p>

<dd>Well, that edit looked to be about as clear-cut vandalism / content blanking as you can get, that is until I saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_Ali&amp;diff=55306054&amp;oldid=55226317" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_Ali&amp;diff=55306054&amp;oldid=55226317" rel="nofollow">this later edit</a> where User:82.207.201.63 explained in his edit summary that the entry was a duplicate. It was an honest mistake, and thank you for bringing this to my attention--I have no attention of chastising anyone for trying to improve articles. I do, however, still believe that he had no intention of improving the article--that is what merely a coincidence of sorts that he removed the duplicate entry--as he went on to blank the page, including sections that <i>should</i> be there, twice more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_Ali&amp;diff=55044344&amp;oldid=55044258" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_Ali&amp;diff=55044344&amp;oldid=55044258" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_Ali&amp;diff=55044846&amp;oldid=55044354" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad_Ali&amp;diff=55044846&amp;oldid=55044354" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

That seems to be the case on the German and Polish versions, though there was apparently some minor quarrel about that a while ago, thus the fork.

<dd>Alright, well although I didn't hear a response from you, I went ahead and finished up the script. I'm going to play arund with it for a day to see if there may be some things that need tweaking, and I'll post a download sometime tomorrow. You can see my testing of the tool <a href="http://test.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/AmiDaniel" class="external text" title="http://test.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/AmiDaniel" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It now works for all diacrtics, not just ä, ö, and ü. Let me know if I did anything wrong. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 05:23, 24 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think there are quite a few others, such as
<ul>
<li>a, aa -&gt; å (Swedish, Danish, Norwegian)</li>
<li>ae -&gt; æ (Danish, Norwegian, and various languages using the Latin ligature æ, including English)</li>
<li>o, oe, ö -&gt; ø (Danish &amp; Norwegian; redirects from forms with diacritics to other forms with diacritics may be useful, if for instance a Danish name is taken from a German or Swedish source, but only within reason of course),</li>
<li>c, ch -&gt; č (Czech)</li>
<li>c -&gt; ç (French)</li>
<li>L -&gt; Ł (Polish)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sure there are others, but I think you will need input from people with different language backgrounds. As for redirects from other forms with diacritics, the script obviously doesn't need to suggest redirects from anything graphically similar, but where the pronunciation is the same (as with ö -&gt; ø, ø -&gt; ö), and there is a significant chance for historical reasons that either spelling may occur in the same name (as with Danish and Swedish). <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 07:37, 24 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay, there are some problems with non-ASCII characters like Ł, and I don't really have too much experience dealing with UTF string manipulation--I may be able to work these in later, but let me go ahead and show you the conversions I have currently:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
    Case "ä", "á", "à", "â", "ã": FirstAlt = "a"
    Case "å": FirstAlt = "a"
    Case "æ": FirstAlt = "ae"
    Case "ë": FirstAlt = "e"
    Case "ö", "ó", "ò", "ô": FirstAlt = "o"
    Case "ø": FirstAlt = "o"
    Case "ü", "ú", "ù", "û": FirstAlt = "u"
    Case "ÿ", "ý": FirstAlt = "y"
    Case "ç": FirstAlt = "c"
    Case "ñ": FirstAlt = "n"
    Case "ä", "á", "à", "â", "ã": SecondAlt = "ae"
    Case "å": FirstAlt = "aa"
    Case "æ": FirstAlt = "a"
    Case "ë": SecondAlt = "ee"
    Case "ö", "ó", "ò", "ô": SecondAlt = "oe"
    Case "ø": FirstAlt = "ö"
    Case "ü", "ú", "ù", "û": SecondAlt = "ue"
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, for not converting it back into an easy-to-read table, but I think you can get the jist of it from the code. Essentially, FirstAlt is the first possible alternative to the diacritic, and SecondAlt is, naturally, the second alternative. As it is currently, the number of different transliterations is quite large (2*[Number of diacratics]!), and adding a third alternative for each diacritic (or even just certain ones like ø) would make this number even larger. Anyway, for now I think I'll just upload what I have and see if it works for you. We can deal with unicode characters later. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 08:39, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The following are overkill in my opinion:</p>
<pre>
Case "ö", "ó", "ò", "ô": SecondAlt = "oe"
Case "ü", "ú", "ù", "û": SecondAlt = "ue"
Case "ä", "á", "à", "â", "ã": SecondAlt = "ae"
</pre>
<p>It is really enough with:</p>
<pre>
Case "ö": SecondAlt = "oe"
Case "ü": SecondAlt = "ue"
Case "ä": SecondAlt = "ae"
</pre>
<p>(Not sure if the code makes any sense, as I just took out stuff, but you get my point.) In addition, ø needs redirecting from oe (<a href="../../../o/l/e/Ole_Roemer_3f5f.html" title="Ole Roemer">Ole Roemer</a> -&gt; <a href="../../../o/l/e/Ole_R%C3%B8mer_9797.html" title="Ole Rømer">Ole Rømer</a>). OE, UE and AE are variants for the umlauts, not for every other possible diacritic. Even though it is conceivable through OCR error or for other reasons that a "ü" may end up as a "û" in a name, I think it is a bad idea to start mass-producing redirects such as Ole Rómer, Ole Rômer, Ole Ròmer -&gt; <a href="../../../o/l/e/Ole_R%C3%B8mer_9797.html" title="Ole Rømer">Ole Rømer</a>. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 13:13, 26 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Okay, first of all, in response to the 27 alternatives that you had found. My thinking with doing it this way was that people would either use the diacritic (ä), the one-char alternative (a), or the two-char alternative (ae). In other words, I thought it conceivable that one would search for Hagerstromüng, but not for Hagerstromueng. Reworking the algorithms to deal with possible combinations of first alternatives and second alternatives is quite a bit more complicated, though certainly do-able, and, as you noted, would create for a three-diacritic article name 13 additional redirects. Let me sleep on this a bit and get back to you. Then, for the second part, I definitely see your point that one looking for ó would likely not search for oe, and I'll fix that accordingly as usually only the umlauts can be translated to ae, oe, ue. And then lastly, I apologize for taking so long to get back to you--it got barried beneath the other messages on the talk page and I didn't notice it until just now. Okay, let me make those couple of changes and then I'll put up the tool, and you can play around with it a bit and tell me if you need it to handle combinations of first alts and second alts. I'll probably have it up either tomorrow or the next day. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 08:11, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Your VandalProof application is being used in an edit war on the article "Golden Dawn tradition".</p>

<p>Strangely, the user name "YankSox" declared the use of VandalProof, but all the edits being produced by it appear to be coming from a anonymous user.</p>
<p>At one point (about six months ago) the matter was submitted to the Mediation Cabal for ajudication, but shortly after that the edit abuse ended. It has recently started up again, and I have requested Mediation again.</p>

<p>Hey listen up, it is quite hypocritical for you or anyone to threaten or accuse this page of being vandalism. As for others people’s pages, please be aware that it was only in retribution. As for you calling this page nonsense, then please refer to the hundreds of pages on this site that are also nonsense. Furthermore, just because you have absolutely no idea what the intentions behind the page are please stop trying to rationalize your behavior for deleting it as valid, because it is not. The page was created for educational purposes at two well respected universities, and was used in three different class room exercises so as for you calling it nonsense it is laughable. We will continue to post this page as a protest to you and the others who are ignorantly using your abilities to delete pages without any real knowledge of what is valid, and what is nonsense.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Weepwoo (<a href="../../../w/e/e/User_talk%7EWeepwoo_aa66.html" title="User talk:Weepwoo">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Weepwoo_7fab.html" title="Special:Contributions/Weepwoo">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>Thanks, Avillia, and now I have a few comments I'd like to add too. First of all, if you can point me to some of these pages that are also nonsense, I will see to it that they are deleted as well. Secondly, as I've said before, you can recreate this article in <i>your own userspace</i>, where no one will even think to delete it, and you can spare yourself all of this stress. You can even contact one of the administrators listed at Category:User undeletion to have the exact contents of the article prior to its deletion moved to your userspace for you. Thirdly, if you disagree with the article's deletion then <b>seek a <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a></b>. If a deletion review believes the article merits inclusion, it will not be deleted again--even if they simply concur with you that it was not an appropriate candidate for speedy deletion, then the article will go through the AfD process before it is deleted again. Fourthly and finally, if you recreate this article again without seeking a deletion review first, you will be blocked. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 22:25, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm drawing a complete blank--have we ever even interacted? I don't see any posts from me on your talk page, and I don't remember ever tagging any of your articles for deletion. I'm assuming this is in regards to Brian james connor, the article that begins "Brian James Connor (pronounced) bry-ann jayms Con-or Is thought to be the coolest kid in the world. He was born on September 21, 1993, though some scientists debate that he was actually born closer to Halloween." Unfortunately, the article does not even begin to assert notability, let alone defend it with verifiable sources. The website www.BrianConnorIsTheRestoration.com does not even exist. Please read over <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A7" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#A7</a>, the speedy deletion criterion relevant to this article, and also read over <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">Wikipedia's notability guidelines for people</a>. You can gladly create such articles in your userspace, for instance on <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlourgus_32fa.html" title="User:Flourgus">your userpage</a>; however, the main article namespace should not be used for vanity articles. Once the article is deleted, feel free to contact any of the administrators listed at Category:User undeletion to have the article userfied (restored and moved to your userspace) for you.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Parma Witch Hunt</span></h2>
<p>The suspected paragraph, which was originally copied from the Parma history section, was blanket put on the Witch Hunt page temporarily with the intention of further editing planned for that very day. No one is trying to restore the paragraph that you deem suspicious. Thus, there is no respectable reason to keep up the copyright page when this matter is of no concern and especially since the suspect paragraph was not intended to be there for long any way to begin with. As for why the Witch Hunt page exists, this was part of an edit dispute resolution, i.e. that a separate article would be created for the Witch Hunt so that the Parma, Ohio page would not be overwhelmed with history. Best, --172.131.104.155 15:39, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I fail to see what was so difficult about simply working on the temporary subpage until the article was deleted--given that the current text is blatantly biased text taken in whole from the article on <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parma%2C_Ohio_fdad.html" title="Parma, Ohio">Parma, Ohio</a>, it wouldn't shock me if someone goes, "Oh, look, there's actually well-written text in the article's history" and restores the copyvio text. But, whatever, I'll try to calm down my process wonkishness. I do, however, still have to return to the question posed by Wizardman, "What is the point of this article?" I could almost see this as a POV fork, as its only purpose seems to be an attack page on a certain group of politicians in Ohio. A <a href="http://www.google.de/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLD,GGLD:2003-39,GGLD:de&amp;q=%22Parma+Witch+Hunt%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.de/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLD,GGLD:2003-39,GGLD:de&amp;q=%22Parma+Witch+Hunt%22" rel="nofollow">search</a> for "Parma Witch Hunt" returns exactly <b>0</b> hits, so again I ask, is this topic really notable enough to warrant an article unto its own? Is it even notable enough to warrant inclusion in the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parma%2C_Ohio_fdad.html" title="Parma, Ohio">Parma, Ohio</a> article? <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 18:26, 28 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, that's just fine with me. I'm assuming you can probably figure out how to decipher it yourself--I just put in a tid bit of encryption to keep it from being abused by the casual vandal--but I'll be glad to send you the code used to encrypt/unencrypt it. Ironically, I was just about to ask you a similar question--I've now begun using the RSS feed to retrieve recent changes, and I implemented a filtration method based upon your badwords list (can't think of the exact link right now); I suppose I should probably show you the same decency in asking whether or not I may use it :-). <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>)

<p>Hi AmiDaniel. I have a question... I use Mozilla FireFox to browse Wikipedia, and I do a lot of vandalism monitoring and reverting. Is there an anti-vandalism tool that works with Mozilla? It appears your VandalProof only works with IE. Any suggestions? <a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKasreyn_b042.html" title="User:Kasreyn">Kasreyn</a> 16:04, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are several - go to <a href="../../../r/e/c/Wikipedia%7ERecent_changes_patrol_3ff8.html" title="Wikipedia:Recent changes patrol">RC patrol</a>, and you will find a long list there. Unfortunately, there is nothing like VandalProof because this imports a Microsoft-written control, something which I don't believe is available for any other browsers. --<span style="text-decoration: none;"><a href="../../../x/y/r/User%7EXyrael_9044.html" title="User:Xyrael"><font color="#696969">Xyra</font></a><a href="../../../x/y/r/User%7EXyrael_Esperanza_c145.html" title="User:Xyrael/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../x/y/r/User%7EXyrael_9044.html" title="User:Xyrael"><font color="#696969">l</font></a> <a href="../../../x/y/r/User_talk%7EXyrael_2e82.html" title="User talk:Xyrael"><sup>T</sup></a></span> 18:33, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As above, VP does not require you to use IE, just to have it installed. I've actually found myself in the past quite frustrated by how many tools are dependent upon FF! I'd suggest having a peak at <a href="http://sam.zoy.org/wikipedia/" class="external text" title="http://sam.zoy.org/wikipedia/" rel="nofollow">godmode and godmode-light</a>, tools that give rollback functionality to non-admins (for FF-users only).

<dd>Oye. Try doing a hard refresh, and perhaps clear out your IE tifs and cookies. Have you made any changes to your monobook.js recently? I could go look for myslef but I'm just too lazy :-). <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 21:40, 29 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sure specifically, but somehow certain tifs get corrupted and IE tries to load them, which leads to errors. I actually think that most of these JS errors result from that, and so I'm try to figure out some way to prevent the Browser control from trying to load pages from cache but have no luck yet. I'm glad you got it working again. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 22:05, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Just to clarify, you are using 1.2.1 and not 1.2.0, right? Confirm that you are using the monobook skin and that you are logged in within the VP browser. Click on the "Try Logging into Wikipedia" link, and log in with "Remember Me" checked. If that doesn't work, check that you do not have any strange cookie settings in IE. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 00:49, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
