<p>The notion that Hebrew, or any other attested language, is the "original language" is demonstrably false. Not that you'd said that, but it's a common interpretation.</p>
<p>Who is the author of Genesis? Or, receiver of revelation if you prefer? There is no claim that anyone witnessed the events described, nor is there any claim that they were revealed. It's just an old story, and doesn't claim to be anything more. Several other claims of Genesis have been unambiguously and indisputably debunked.Timothy Usher 06:02, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aminz, yes, Muslims did that. Also read about the persecution of the Bahais in Iran. That was even WORSE -- and it's still going on.</p>
<p>I don't think that there's a religion in the world that hasn't been used as justification for horrible, horrible things. I don't know if you've heard of the Nagasaki Martyrs -- they were Japanese who converted to Christianity in the 17th century, and were tortured and killed because they wouldn't give it up. Buddhist priests, Zen priests, approved of the torture. That's MY religion.</p>
<p>It has less to do with religion than it has with human nature. A warning to us not to be too self-righteous, lest we end up killing and feeling completely justified. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 10:05, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes even people without religion can do this for example. I don't think that the article like other articles is particularly neutral though, so you should probably question what's written. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 19:21, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Because, impersonator or no, "This user will be condemned in the Judgment Day and will go to Hell" is an attack, something explicitly forbidden on Wikipedia.

<dd>I know. It's too bad, but that's the way it goes. However, attacking him won't solve the problem. If anything, it inspires him to do it again.

<p>I'll take a look at this and try to understand the situation.</p>
<p>Since you're Persian too, you might want to help out at <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_people.html#History" title="Persian people">Persian people#History</a>. We're having an inter-Iranian problem over the broader definition of who Persians are. Even though some sources clearly state Persians are of mixed ancestry, some users insist on saying Persians are "descendants of Aryan tribes", which is immediately contradicted by the next statement saying Aryan tribes intermingled with the local populations (Elamites for example, but also others) upon their arrival on the Iranian plateau.</p>
<p>All I'm asking is for the statement to be replaced with something more neutral. Perhaps something like "Aryan tribes began migrating from Central Asia into what is now Iran in the 2nd millennium BC." I don't know why some users insist on using the terms "descendants" and "Aryan" next to each other.</p>
<p>The other side shows very little flexibility or respect. This issue has escalated beyond imagination and some users are actually trying to get me banned from Iran-related articles. As a result I've had very little time for anything else (such as the dhimmi article, which I've visited before).</p>
<p>Could you look into this and let me know what you think?</p>

<p>I agree that we shouldn't get into the rest of it. One of the editors involved here has a substantial record of abusive diffs, establishing a pattern of bullying, gratuitous insult and unrecanted false charges alike. To me, that's not the immediate issue. 3RR was the reason given for the block, and when they realized AE'd miscounted, AE changed the subject while Sean Black blanked his talk page. The honorable response is to publically admit that the charge, and the block which was explicitly based on it, was wrong without further qualification. That's what I'll be requesting.Timothy Usher 10:44, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aminz,</p>
<p>I saw your comment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aucaman&amp;curid=2992761&amp;diff=51742338&amp;oldid=51665002" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aucaman&amp;curid=2992761&amp;diff=51742338&amp;oldid=51665002" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and I think you don't entirely understand what the page is about. It's not about the Iranian nationality (which includes Persians, Kurds, Azeris, Baloch, etc.), it's about the specific Persian ethinc group. As you know, Persians comprise 51% of Iran's population. By looking at <a href="../../../i/r/a/Image%7EIran_peoples.jpg_9ce7.html" title="Image:Iran peoples.jpg">this map</a> you can see that Persians, Azeris, Arabs, and Kurds in Iran are all separate ethinc groups, but are the same nationality, Iranian. —<a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoikhoi</a> 22:00, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello Khoikhoi,</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I personally do not belong to no minority group of Iran but after coming to US I feel I can understand them better. As to your comment, I am afraid I disagree since based on what I have read about Judaism, being a Jews unlike being a Musim or Christian implies descending from Issac(like being "Seyed" in Iran but with the difference that being "Seyed" has nothing to with being a Muslim). So, Jews believe they are <b>descendents</b> of Issac who was Hebrew. Now, saying Iranians are <b>descendents</b> of "Aryans" automatically proves Iranian Jews are not Iranians. All the issue is about the word <b>descendent</b>. To persians this may not have much importance but to Jews it has. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 23:11, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Aminz, first off, you agree that <b>most</b> Persians are descendants of the Aryans, right? Incidentally, the term has nothing to do with the Nazis, and is not an "outdated racial theory", as Aucaman claims. Secondly, I'm Jewish too, and I can tell you that things in the Torah are not necessarily historically accurate.</dd>

<p>Hi Aminz, you are possibly right, however on wikipedia we are not supposed to state the author of the source in the articles text unless there is an opposing reference *and* if the original source is considered unreliable. Bernard Lewis however, is considered reputable and reliable enough. Feel free to add another reference so that you can spell out your complaints without it being original research. Usually by virtue of the name of the author of a source appearing most people will assume the article is suggesting that the person is biased.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 06:30, 6 May 2006 (UTC) P.S. Can you respond on my talk page as I tend to forget to check the other people's talk pages.</p>
<p>Well its not common sense to me. I am admitedly not an expert on shiism or anything, but I think I am probably more knowledgable on it than an average person and I really wouldn't have the foggiest idea that it is common sense to Shiite Jurists.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 06:49, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
The reasoning you provided not only doesn't seem like common sense but seems quite esoteric (to me, probably not to you though). I think you are just going to have to provide a reference for this one man. I understand what you mean though, for every culture there are things that have become so ingrained in their collective consciousness and memory from such a young age that it is near impossible to understand how some poeple do not already know it. I guess that is a problem with having such a heterogenous community on English Wikipedia.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 07:04, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would say that Bernard Lewis is definetly reputable and reliable enough to stay in the article. I do understand that he is sometimes controversial, but I would argue that for an academic who writes on controverisal subjects and is as well-known as Lewis is, the criticism that has been directed towards him is relatively mild. Compare what has been said about Edward Said and you will see what I am talking about.</p>
<p>My suggested solution for you would be to add opposing references that ilustrate your viewpoint, but be careful to use reliable sources and not add original research.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 07:20, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes this name is the compromise even if Isa was the best in my opinion. We can't have it moved anymore. If RM is made, then I am definitely sure that no consensus will come out of it and the article will have to remain at Isa under policy.

<dd>I think I reacted as if you were criticizing this edit I'd made earlier <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Islam&amp;diff=52612454&amp;oldid=52607990" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Islam&amp;diff=52612454&amp;oldid=52607990" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Someone had writting "Critics such as Muir have argued that Muhammad ordered the torture and execution of her husband after the battle at Khaybar", but the source (at least one of them) is not a critic but an unqualified Muslim admirer, Ibn Ishaq, while "...but this is disputed by some Muslims, who argue that he was killed in battle" is unsourced.Timothy Usher 07:11, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Montazari's explanation:</p>
<p>"After Safiyah became a hostage, there were a few people who wanted to marry her. But since she was the daughter of the chief of the tribe, the Prophet in consideration of he social status, did not allow others to marry her. Safiyah herself was reluctant to marry ordinary people. Therefore the Prophet (pbuh) for the sake of protecting Safiyah, accepted to marry her."</p>
<p>Is completely at odds with Ibn Hishaq's of Muhammad tossing his cloak over her. Where is he getting this from? What verses? What hadith? Perhaps there are some, but from what I see here (perhaps editted?), Ali Sina has gotten the better of the Ayatollah.Timothy Usher 07:35, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sorry I've not responded to your hadith, which as you say, contradicts Ibn Hashaq...although does not speak to the specific issue with the husband, nor does it quite say that Muhammad married her for charitable reasons, only that she was presented to him on this ground...but it <i>does</i> contradict Ibn Hashaq, so there's some confusion here. I think we need to find more hadith to see where the apologists are getting this from.Timothy Usher 04:33, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks - looking forward to it; hope things go well w/ your exams. I understand the general background; though Al Ahzab gives good context, not sure if it is 'the' cite we need. Would also humbly suggest that militarily it would not make sense to attack there 'just because they broke an oath' - there really wasn't very much to be afraid of tactically, (esp from perspective of a presumably intelligent &amp; courageous commander....). Kind of bizare to chase folks out of town - and then pursue them a while later to kill them: why not just kill them right away. Which makes me think some of the more recent Islamic interpretations may be apologism, which I think is uneeded and in many ways insulting to Islam. But the point needs to be made that there is a heck of a lot more to this than what Stillman and the encyc of Islam assert. Personally would like to see this thing get to where Badr is (i.e. FA status). <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridesmill_4b81.html" title="User:Bridesmill">Bridesmill</a> 17:33, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aminz; I don't think I can usefully mediate on this, and I can't act as a neutral admin. I've begun to wonder if this is an area to which I can usefully contribute. I have no special knowledge, beyond having read a few books. The pages are tremendously divisive and time consuming, and I really end up making little significant improvement. I'm going to try to move away from these, into areas that I know more about, and that are less difficult to edit. I'll look in from time to time. Good luck with your exams. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 23:26, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

I've already seen this, though thank you for forwarding. I think this is a real mistake, and somewhat an indictment of WP, that it's as lopsided (so far) as it is. Joturner is bright and hard-working. These are good. But he is too young to stand in judgement over anyone, a point underscored by recent experience with Sean Black, and admin tasks include this. Would you want teenagers on your jury? Although he does use his real name, a very big plus to credibility in my book. Further, will he take <i>or solicit</i> admin action in Islam-related articles? The second point is very important, because the current system invites favor-trading between admins. Two admins can functionally evade the rules simply by agreeing to block on one another's behalf. It's important to know they won't <i>solicit</i> it, either, as per Anonymous editor.08:38, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aminz, I can't be an administrator. I'm too abrupt and short-tempered. Not only that, I've made so many enemies (especially Iranian, Salafi, Shi'a, and Hindutva ones) that my RfA would go down in flames. It would be interesting, in an ugly way, but I'm not up to it now. I appreciate the thought, but I just don't have the temperament required.</p>

<dd>Aminz, I can't think of a Persian editor other than you who approves of my edits. Zereshk and ManiF are particularly vociferous. I'm an anti-nationalist and I want that POV included too when I work on Iran-related articles. I have Indian editors angry at me, but I spend less time on South Asian articles. Oh yes, I have one American angry at me too, he thinks I should leave the US, since I'm not a loyal patriotic American&#160;:) No one understands.

<p>Salam AminZ,</p>
<p>No single user has <b>ever</b> put so much endless time into attacking, discrediting, reducing the significance, encouraging ethnic separatism, and outright revising history in Iranian articles on Wikipedia more than Zora. There is a reason that she has so many enemies. Do you know how many Shia related articles she has nominated for deletion in the past 2 years? I dare say a good dozen couple. Striver I bet can verify this. Zora has endorsed the deletion of <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misconceptions_about_the_Shi%27a_8f7f.html" title="Misconceptions about the Shi'a">Misconceptions about the Shi'a</a> artticle 3 times alone. Why? Because she considers people like Goldziher, Scacht, and Lammens as academic sources, while calling <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasr.html" title="Nasr">Nasr</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tabatabaei.html" title="Tabatabaei">Tabatabaei</a>, and the entire Howzeh Elmiyeh Qom as "suspect" and "unrelaible".</p>
<p>For crying out loud, Lammens' paper for the Scripta Pontificii Instituti Biblici reads:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Ali was the least intelligent" and intellectually "incapable".</li>
<li>Ali was "ugly".</li>
<li>Ali was "fat".</li>
<li>Mocks how Allah wished to keep his representative Muhammad in poverty.</li>
<li>Writes of Muhammad "kicking Fatima brutally" and telling her to "shut up".</li>
<li>Writes: "Fatima screamed: You are marrying me off to a beggar" (i.e. to Ali).</li>
<li>Muhammad's wealth came from "plundering the Jews".</li>
<li>Doubts the existence of Al Muhsin.</li>
<li>Accuses Ali of having extramarital affairs and betraying her wife Fatima.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such are the sources that Zora calls "academic", while dismissing the likes of Tabatabaei, Makarem Shirazi, and Nasr.</p>
<p>It always irritates me how she openly and arrogantly dismisses a pluralistic setting in articles, stating second hand research by western authors as fact, while dismissing Shia/Iranian sources as unreliable merely because she thinks they are "nationalist". She doubts that "Hazrat e Muhsin" ever existed. Have you asked her? She doubts the existence of "Shahrbanu". She has repeatedly deleted any reference to the fact that Umar ibn al-Khattab in fact carried out the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_conquest_of_Persia_936d.html" title="Islamic conquest of Persia">Islamic conquest of Persia</a> by spilling blood. She was so in denial that I had to scan actual pages from books recounting atrocities from Hajjaj ibn Yusof against Iranians and Mawali. And for an entire goddamn month or two, she even voiciferously clashed with me <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_Muhammad_f25d.html" title="Succession to Muhammad">(here)</a> because she thought (thinks) that Islamic <b>Hadith</b> are not worthy of being considered as sources (astaghforellah!). She was the one who in fact nominated the article <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Hadith_cd90.html" title="List of Hadith">List of Hadith</a> for deletion under the most ludicrous pretext. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_notable_Muslim_reports" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_notable_Muslim_reports" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Now you tell me AminZ, give me one reason not to think of her as esaalatan zedd-e-shi'a. How would you react to somebody who actively keeps broadcasting the view that Shias are a fabricated spinoff of Islam? For a month, she even refused to accept an <b>alternative second view</b> that Ali (AS) was the first man to embrace Islam. When I showed her sources that do accept this view, she exported the entire debate <a href="../../../i/d/e/Identity_of_first_male_Muslim_361e.html" title="Identity of first male Muslim">here</a> supposedly so that it wouldnt have enough exposure.</p>
<p>See, my problem with her is that:</p>
<ol>
<li>She constantly looks for a way to re-write the history of Iran along separatist ethnic lines (which is the colonialist view of the old british orientalists), either by stating that Khwarazm is historically not a cultural province of historical Persia (<a href="../../../k/h/w/Talk%7EKhwarezm_68e2.html" title="Talk:Khwarezm">Talk:Khwarezm</a>), or that <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sheikh_Khazal_ee53.html" title="Sheikh Khazal">Sheikh Khazal</a> was a martyr for the supposed cause of Arab independence in Khuzestan, or that <a href="../../../s/i/a/Sialk.html" title="Sialk">Sialk</a> is not nearly 7000 years old, simply because "Sazman e Miras e Farhangi" is not a reliable source according to Zora. engaar Irani haa ersiyeh babasho khordan. She has claimed that: "Elamites were not Iranian", "Iran was not one of the oldest civilizations of the world" (na faghat <i>the oldest</i>, but not even <i>one of the oldest</i>), that she goes around injecting views that people like Kharazmi were "possibly" Arab, that "Persian culture does not exist", etc etc etc. I mean, it doesnt take long for one to start wondering <i>what does Zora have against Iranians?</i> She even supported a separatist noticeboard called "al-Hurriyah" that advocates a <i>free</i> Khuzestan for Arabs.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Hurriyya_notice_board" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Miscellany_for_deletion/Wikipedia:Hurriyya_notice_board" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> SouthernComfort even believes that the user "Ahwaz" is actually a sockpuppet of Zora. I wouldnt be surprised if that were true.</li>
<li>She refuses to accept and incorporate other views into articles, contrary to her claims on talk pages. When faced with mounting counter-evidence against her view, she exports the debate elsewhere by creating a new sub-article. That's how and why articles like these were created: <a href="../../../i/d/e/Identity_of_first_male_Muslim_361e.html" title="Identity of first male Muslim">Identity of first male Muslim</a> <a href="../../../s/u/c/Succession_to_Muhammad_f25d.html" title="Succession to Muhammad">Succession to Muhammad</a> <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_Shi%27a-Sunni_relations_0fee.html" title="Historical Shi'a-Sunni relations">Historical Shi'a-Sunni relations</a> <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birthplace_of_Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib_6654.html" title="Birthplace of Ali ibn Abi Talib">Birthplace of Ali ibn Abi Talib</a> <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamicization_in_post-conquest_Iran_e6f2.html" title="Islamicization in post-conquest Iran">Islamicization in post-conquest Iran</a> ad infinitum.</li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly, Zora voted against my adminship last year, and quite viciously too (which came as a surprise to me since I wasnt even thinking of ever using admin powers to block or condemn people. My intention for adminship was strictly to organize the articles into proper categories, stubs, wikimedia links and databases, Farsi-English WP collborations, etc). I for one am certain that she did and does use backdoor communications and lobbying against me among other things. And I am certain that she does hold some nasty negative views against Iranians. Why, I will never know. But it is quite easy to see her pro-Arab bias fueling her anti-Iranian tendencies. And,...I always have doubted her truthfulness. She says something, acts the exact opposite.</p>
<p>But it's not just me, AminZ. Save you and maybe one or two tak-o-took others, I think I can safely claim that the vast majority of Iranian editors are unanimously against Zora's adminship of any kind. Ask them yourself if you dont beleive me. Zora only remembers me in particular only because Ive been here the longest. But she has clashed with almost every single Iranian editor no matter what their political/religious background. Zora indeed has made herself many enemies by relentlessly attacking Iranian articles left and right for the past 2 years. As we speak, she is trying to convey that Khwarazm is not (and never was) a cultural member of Iran.</p>
<p>But then again, meedoonam ke Zora gaahi vaght haa komak haaye shaayaanee be maqaalaat e Islam kardeh (in General). But when it comes to Shia articles, I digress. And when it comes to Iranian articles, I even fear her revisionism. It scares the hell out of me the way she calls me a "nationalist" just because I try to include sources and references that show <i>Irani ha ham eftekhaaraati daarand, che Islami, che ghabl az Islam</i>. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Academy_of_Gundishapur" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Academy_of_Gundishapur" rel="nofollow">(e.g.)</a>)</p>
<p>In short, Zora is unable to contribute without injecting her personal opinions into an article, when it comes to the Shia and especially Iran.</p>
<p>Yet, as a credit to her numerous contributions in protecting the Islamic articles in general, I would approve of her vote on 2 conditions. It's simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>That she stay away from all Iranian related articles, always, everywhere, no matter what (even if asked to come in and join).</li>
<li>That <b>two</b> Iranian-versed admins (whom everyone agree on) also be nominated, voted, or even instated into adminship en par with Zora. Maybe ManiF and Kashk. I dunno. If Zora can get admined, so should her opposites. After all, Zora is someone who claims Richard Frye is an Iranian nationalist (!), <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Iranica_91ff.html" title="Encyclopedia Iranica">Encyclopedia Iranica</a> is "outdated" (!!), and <a href="../../../t/e/h/Tehran_University_d4a3.html" title="Tehran University">Tehran University</a> is not a reliable source of information. I mean, with such a strongly opinionated person, how else must one deal with? Think about it, is she going to start blocking articles because, for example, she thinks <a href="../../../e/h/s/Ehsan_Yarshater_c509.html" title="Ehsan Yarshater">Ehsan Yarshater</a> or <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran%27s_Cultural_Heritage_Organization_3f33.html" title="Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization">Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization</a> are "nationalist"s?</li>
</ol>
<p>I dunno AminZ, people like Zora damage the historical integrity of Iran, and Shias. Do you honestly trust someone who beleives <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasr.html" title="Nasr">Seyyed Hossein Nasr</a> is not "academic"? I find that incredibly problematic. I mean, juse judge for yourself:</p>

<p>Hello. Could you please stop by <a href="../../../c/h/r/Talk%7EChristianity_8d07.html" title="Talk:Christianity">Talk:Christianity</a> and give your opinion? We are debating whether the word 'monotheism' should be included in the intro to the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> article. According to most dictionaries, the definition of monotheism is <i>The dogma or belief that there is one God</i>. Now, all Christians believe there is one God and all Christian creeds (such as the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicene_Creed_e8a2.html" title="Nicene Creed">Nicene Creed</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalcedonian_Creed_f85b.html" title="Chalcedonian Creed">Chalcedonian Creed</a>) profess a belief in one God. The point of contention is the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Trinity_1d2e.html" title="Holy Trinity">Holy Trinity</a>. Christians believe that <a href="../../../g/o/d/God_the_Father_5aa3.html" title="God the Father">God the Father</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/d/God_the_Son_78ac.html" title="God the Son">God the Son</a> (Jesus), and <a href="../../../g/o/d/God_the_Holy_Spirit_32a7.html" title="God the Holy Spirit">God the Holy Spirit</a> all make up one <a href="../../../o/u/s/Ousia.html" title="Ousia">essense</a> of God, i.e. are three parts of one God (known as <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypostasis.html" title="Hypostasis">hypostasis</a>). Now, several editors think that because this is different from the Islamic view of <a href="../../../t/a/w/Tawhid.html" title="Tawhid">Tawhid</a>--and they alledge Muslims think Christians are not monotheistic, but <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tritheism.html" title="Tritheism">tritheistic</a>--we cannot say Christianity is monotheistic like is done in the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> article. Many editors content, however, that the definition of monotheism is based solely on <i>belief</i>, not truth. So if Christians believe their God is one God, they are by definition monotheistic, even if they may not be right. All it takes to be monotheistic is to believe there is one God. Others, however, think we can only say "Christianity is a monotheistic religion according to its followers." Again, some editors (including myself) have issue with this because it's basically like saying "Christianity believes it believes that there is one God," which of course is redundant. In my opinion, monotheism by definition <i>is</i> the belief! None-the-less, we would like to know from a Muslim editor: 1) Do Muslims view Christianity as <a href="../../../t/r/i/Tritheism.html" title="Tritheism">tritheistic</a>? 2) Even if so, considering Christians still <i>believe</i> there is one God, are they still not monotheistic? Sorry for the long post, but there's a lot of debate I had to summarize.

<p>Aminz, it's simply inappropriate that coreligionists vote as a bloc to promote one of their own, asking him as some have, to misuse his admin priviledge to alter the future course of Islam-related articles, even mentioning particular articles that need action. Given the breakdown of supports to opposes, <i>unanimous</i> support from Guild members would be statistically supremely unlikely, were there not the expectation of future partisan support.</p>
<dl>
<dd>1. Same logic: Faisal did that, not Joturner. Again, you are using Faisal's action to condemn Joturner exactly as you did with me and Joturner. You neglect Joturner comments in this regard.</dd>
<dd>2. Here co-religons are usually friends. People working on the same article sharing the same culture (persian, muslim, mathematician, etc) tend to become each other's friends and it is natural that they support each other. Compare this with other RfA's. Joturner gained 120 votes, of which too many are not members of Muslim Guide. Again, you are neglecting that I informed everybody I knew. Were there a project page that other people working on Islam related, I would have informed them. I see this nothing more than a pretext. Majority of those Muslim editors would have been voted anyway. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 18:51, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Well, that's your conclusion, may be true, but it is your conclusion. You believe Joturner is a liar and don't trust his words. That's your position but the way you are writing your arguments from your perspective rings as a sign of "dishonesty" in my view. Your insistence on the "targeted advertisement for this RfA" idea tells me that once you decide to oppose someone, you will use whatever tool you have, no matter honestly or dishonestly, to achieve your goal. You treat similar cases differently just because one of them is according to your desire but one is not. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 19:45, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"...it is also injustice to oppose one based on what "may" or "may not" happen." - no, it's not. First, this is not about doing justice to Joturner. Nothing bad is going to happen to him either way. Adminship is <i>not</i> a reward for making a large number of edits, for pushing Mosque to FAC, for changing ones userpage, for answering questions "correctly" or for being a good guy. Second, it's inherently speculative - the supports project a vision of how he might conduct himself as an admin just as do opposes. I am not saying that I know for a fact he will act this way or that way. I <i>don't</i> know. And that's exactly the problem.</dd>

<dd>This would be true, were adminship a right to which he'd be entitled in the absence of demonstrable wrongdoing, but it is not. It's not a disciplinary proceeding, where he might be punished - just as adminship isn't a reward, so it's denial is not a punishment. The candidate is asking to be entrusted with priviledges not afforded to regular editors; as such, the burden of trust is on the candidate.Timothy Usher 20:03, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You are right in correcting me. So, the matter is about the community's trust that he will not misuse his power (e.g. blocking users wrongly, etc.) It is completely personal of course. I am willing to trust Joturner and think he will not betray my trust but you don't. Fine.

<p>This must not be allowed to become a trend, and it seems I'm hardly alone in this judgement. As you yourself are a member of said guild, I don't expect you to share it.</p>
<p>As I've already been unjustly blocked and falsely accused by an admin who is also a guild member (and supported this RfA) - one whose user page was likewise changed to gain promotion - and as the candidate stood idly by, knowing this action was wrong but apparently unwilling to confront a fellow Guild member on behalf of a non-member, I consider it a matter of self-defense, and the defense of wikipedia. Islam-related pages can be contentious. It's easy to say, oh, "people are edit-warring" and lock the page into one's favored version, as we've also seen.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You could criticize Joturner for being dishonest in your case with AE. That's a valid and honest criticism. (To Joturner, you were indeed dishonest when you decided not to involve yourself in the case). Timothy, Tell this to people and they will judge. But this is one argument independent of others you made. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 19:00, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>And as stated, the denial of the obvious - that the Mosque FAC, user page changes and recent avoidance of Islam-related articles (excepting Mosque) were intended to aid his RfA - casts doubt upon the sincerity of his intentions not to engage in this sort of behavior, because it shows him flexible enough to say whatever he needs to say to gain promotion.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Timothy, while agreeing with you, I still abide by my comments on your talk page. My comments were not about these points. These are valid points that you could state on the talk page. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 19:04, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What I <i>know</i> is that there are two things about which the candidate is passionate and to which he is dedicated - Islam and becoming an admin. If we could make pledges of non-involvement in Islam-related articles clear and binding, such that trust would no longer be an issue, then I'd support. If we could hand him the tools he needs to do innocuous things without also giving him the power to block users and lock pages, I'd support. But there is no mop here that isn't also potentially a sword, and once it's handed over, there's almost no way to take it back.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Being passionate about becoming an admin can be very well motivated by things other than those you think (e.g. for its prestige). You could have entered into a discussion on this with him. Of course, there can be lots of misuses, but unless you provide evidences that these happen, I will not buy it. While we should be careful to not to give the sword to an unqualified person, not giving it to the one who is qualified is the same injustice. You should have provided evidences on the page and left people to make a decision.

<p>Keep in mind that it can be pretty intimidating being one of thirteen (?) opposes in what was once a page of supports. In such cases, many keep their misgivings to themselves, as it appears the candidate will succeed anyhow, so why give cause for future resentment? An understandable dishonesty, but one which I chose not to pursue.Timothy Usher 18:27, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It must be noted that I am not a co-religionist, and still hope that as an admin will bring in an understanding of Muslim matters to the admin team. You cannot create NPOV without understanding the various POV's. I just have the feeling that these constant attacks on Joturner are of the same quality like the constant mentioning of someone else being "a sockpuppet" despite a checkuser proving differently.

<p>If I may make a suggestion, if you want an online gathering place where you meet interesting people and do useful things, try Distributed Proofreaders. We turn old books into free ebooks. The chat forums are fun and supportive, and the people are great. You could do two or three pages a day, learn something, feel that you are contributing to the world, and it wouldn't eat your life.

<p>That's a great link. Thank you. Will read. I never doubted that Muhammad was a thoughtful man and an ideological and creative genius, nor assumed that his most controversial actions were particularly heinous by the low standards of his time. Watt's point about him being a moral exemplar or not is on-target - it's the assumptions of modern religion which compel us to test him to according to contemporary standards whose scrutiny other, often much worse, rulers escape.</p>

<p>Personally I think McKhan just wants his attacks on the Al-Ahbash to stay up - or at least the mention of his attacks. I've added more archive info to the talk page, but I really think any mention of whatever is in the archives is useless because taking a look at text in there, all of info in the archives seems useless. <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhaiSaab_b765.html" title="User:BhaiSaab">BhaiSaab</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/h/a/User_talk%7EBhaiSaab_a911.html" title="User talk:BhaiSaab">talk</a></sup> 01:18, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yes of course he deserves to have a say in it. He's an editor on here. He's welcome to write criticisms on the Al-Ahbash, but I don't think he should use polemecist websites as they tend to be unreliable. <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhaiSaab_b765.html" title="User:BhaiSaab">BhaiSaab</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/h/a/User_talk%7EBhaiSaab_a911.html" title="User talk:BhaiSaab">talk</a></sup> 01:28, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm happy to see that you agree with me. You wouldn't want to see sources like ansar.org or kr-hcy.org to be used to write articles on the Shi'a, would you?

<p>Good that you are back, at least on one Artical&#160;:-) any way after reading this artical I have found that alot of information was noticiably direct to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) with fals claims and intents.

<p>Salaam, I was thinking that if an article can be created which would discuss all the reasons why Prophet Muhammad prosecuted these people. What I have understood so far, I wrote on <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Nadir_mpov_4505.html" title="Banu Nadir/mpov">Banu Nadir/mpov</a> under <i>Muslims explanation for prosectuion</i>. It is very important because the battles and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:People_killed_by_order_of_Muhammad" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:People_killed_by_order_of_Muhammad" rel="nofollow">People killed by Prophet Muhammad</a> is a very important part of Islamic history. And then a link to this article can be given on every page which would discuss such killings. This proposal can also be posted on Muslim Guild project. The work has to be top class because the way he is being portrayed, that doesn't make a good sketch of prophet Muhammad's personality in one's mind. SaadSaleem 07:21, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Bro, I think it's better to give up. There's an absolutely zero chance that any of these articles will ever be NPOV. What us editing them only serve to do is create the illusion that the articles are credible because 1 or two Muslims participate (i'm actually not a Muslim, but I'm seen as one here). Let them win here. JuanMuslim has a 'boycott Wikipedia' thing running, and I think that's the best idea. There is no knowlege here, just opinion and sentiment. If I were a Shaikh, I'd pronounce a fatwah saying Wikipedia is haraam for muslims.&#160;:) <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 21:22, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Aminz, Listen I'm willing to assist with editing this article (as much as I can... I do have other Wikipedia projects&#160;;-). It's important that you <b>calmly</b> and <b>consistenly</b> edit and calmly make your points in talk. I find that when I am as calm as can be I tend to edit and interact with other editors much better. I realize that it is likely difficult for an editor who has religious convictions to edit on religious topics (particularly <i>their</i> religion) calmly all of the time particularly when there are other editors who seem to want to portray said religion <i>negatively</i>. But if you let emotion rule you in such cases then it is likely that you will not be succesful in editing. I also realize that <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> is a controversial article so if you truly have it in your mind to help render it <i>neutral</i> you're likely going to have to work hard to do so. You've done very well to get yourself a copy of Lewis' book. As you no doubt saw, I had concerns about the fact that most citations were from books and now I'm beginning to think that my concerns were well founded.

Relative to the other cited sources <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">H.E.</a> is saying that Bat Ye'or is a poor source of info for the article. Unfortunately, I think many Wikipedia editors are less than fully aware of who's a good source and who is not on <i>most</i> articles here (including ones on Islam). My advice to editors is faciliate knowledge aquisition by fellow editors through utlization of reliable online sources as much as possible.

<dd>You're going to need more than just Lewis' book to strengthen your arguments. As well the other sources and how reliable and worthy they are of citation in the article should be discussed.

<p><s>What am I? The defense for the accused? Stop presenting me with your research and telling me to make the edits based on your findings. What keeps you from doing the work yourself? And don't take their statements on face value. If they say "WP:So-And-So says this", read the actual policy.

<p>Sorry about those comments. From what you've given me, I thought you were afraid to do the editing yourself and instead were throwing the burden on me. It's clear now you want to do deeper research before proceeding, and that's perfectly reasonable. My suggestion to you, and myself for that matter, is to give up this Wikipedia matter altogether. Bernard Lewis's works and Bat Ye'ors and all that are not relevant to ongoings in our lifetime. It's ancient history. It's a waste of your time to be re-evaluating midieval human rights standards. If people like those editing here want to waste their lives creating an encyclopedia full of hate rhetoric to disenfranchise Muslims, let them. Not to be all mullah-ish, but idle-talk is clearly haraam, and given there's no positive outcome in your (or my) participation here, it's better to invest energy elsewhere- like in real life. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 05:12, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Aminz, I'm going to empty my watchlist and hopefully stop participating here. It's a bit addictive actually. If you're busy with real life, stick to real life and give up this Wikipedia thing. It's not productive. Who cares about what Muslims did in the year 900? Does reading Lewis or Stillman or Ye'or have anything to do with our lives today? When I first came to Wikipedia, I edited articles dealing with current events, particularly Islamism. This haggling over ancient history is meaningless- everyone treated outsiders like shit back then. We don't owe an apology to the world's Jewish population because Umar bin Whatever made Jews wear funny slippers in Yemen. If Merzbow or Usher or Pecher wants to waste their lives reading that drivel, let them. It's not my problem and it shouldnt be yours. Read books that will give you knowlege and understanding that'll improve your own life. I don't read Lewis because that information would do nothing to benefit me. Don't waste time with those who devote their time to things they hate. In practice, that is islamically haraam.

Maybe Lewis is right and Muslims didn't persecute them. Maybe Ye'or is right and Muslims did persecute them. All I know is that I never mistreated a Jew, not even the one who was my roommate and stole my food regularly. It's better to give it up. There is no productivity in working here, and engaging these people who hate so much is just agitating. From an Islamic perspective, this is considered 'idle talk' and is explicitly haraam, since it benefits nobody. I don't consider myself much of a Muslim these days, but I do see the wisdom in doing what actually benefits you. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 05:23, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You mentioned you'll learn more about Islam from these dialogues. Western sources selectively cite history to give the most negative impression. For example, take the Banu Nadir and Banu Quraiza incident; the killing of men from the two Jewish tribes. From the Sira (Ar Raheequl Makhtum is a great one), it's clear Muhammad (SAW) authored an undeniably considerate set of terms in his treaty with the Jewish groups. It is clear that the Banu Quraiza worked against the Muslims despite the treaty, and violated its term. The Islamic historical documents point to an incident where members of the Jewish tribe 'exposed' a Muslimah and ridiculed her, and then killed a Muslim man who tried to defend her honor. Bat Ye'or will omit all that, as would Lewis. Many incidences took place, many not documented, to ferment the situation. A battle broke out. Now after a battle, our modern standards demand that POWs be protected. These days we have large facilities to contain POWs, with cameras. We have IGOs and NGOs to monitor them. In the middle ages, no such facilities were possible. People didn't have firearms to guard 2000 or 20,000 male prisoners, or cameras to monitor them. Killing the males was the norm of the time because there was no other option. The killing of women and children was forbidden, as was the killing of the elderly or those devoted to monastic service. Jizya was ONLY ever taken from young males (according to Umar, those who trim their beards), not from women or the elderly. Why? Because if there was reason to fear a revolt, it would come from the men amongst the Dhimmi, and that they're paying Jizya was a sign that they intended to continue playing by the rules.Not paying was indicative of an intent to break away from the ruling government and revolt, so not paying Jizyah was highly punishable. Abdullah Yusuf Ali's translation of "subdued" in the Qur'an is a less-than-perfect choice of words, but there really isn't a good substitute. "Made to submit" is a phrase that is more suitable. You know Muhammad made it clear that the level of Jizyah was to be an amount easily affordable (latter Caliphs might have abused that, but that's out of Islam). Anyway, I've learned all this from Muslim teachers I've spoken to. They've never published books, so it's not 'verifiable' by Wikipedia standards. . You won't get these details here, nor will you find them in the books of orientalists who wish to frame Muslims as medieval barbarians. Their misleadingly selective recollection of history is meant to corrupt their audience with a negative image. Other than Ahmed Deedat, I know of no other Muslim who made a career out of addressing the polemicists. Maybe that's a good thing. Maybe we shouldn't waste time over what Christians or Jews think or say about us.A better attitude towards them might be what's suggested in Surah Kafirun: "to you be your way, to me be mine". <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 06:20, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there, I will give soon the page numbers, it is true that the that make the section lengthy, actually, I had alot more information then you see there, and It was for me difficult to curtail it in such short period and space. Any way, I try another way to see what can we do. To answer your remarks about the that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) thaught himself as a Prophet or not, I think it is clear to all, yes he repeatdly announce that, that he is from God and his last Prophet. If we just look the life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) it is absolutly clear that the transformation from early stage of his life when he started preaching his teaching and in the end of his life, there is a clear signs of advancement, in any way, his general life, wars, marriages reformer and a teacher. We dont have to forget that he has to preach first to people of Arabia, with certain mind set. Some of the backword people on planet at that time and then turn them into something totally different with his teaching, is not possible for a man, in my eyes who is not true in his thaughts and action. As you are working on this section, if you suggest we can remove one or more paragraphes from that section. And also although I try some time my best to improve my knowledge I still lack something in english or in editing techniques. May be with time, will be better, so you are allow to re-write, if you think wording is not at the standard etc. It may help me too&#160;:-) and yes... we are hopeful that our team will atleast in the finals.. let see what happend.. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 00:43, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aminz</p>
<p>Thanks for your message. I agree that if we are going to make any inroads into removing the POV in this article we need to summarise the case on Bat Ye'or. First, though, I must point out that I don't at all have the same major as Esposito and Lewis. I work as a university researcher, but my field is quite different. I came upon the dhimmi article more or less by chance and contributed my tuppence-worth because I was struck by the POV line - apparent even to me. I had just been reading the Wheatcroft book, which I have some criticisms of, but it is most definitely a scholarly account and makes every effort to be even-handed. Another source who is 100 per cent scholarly and who could be used as a starting point is Albert Hourani. I do not mind emailing Esposito with a brief question. He may be very busy at this time of year and we may not get a response. Another thing I am doing is trawling through academic databases for articles and books that may be relevant. I already have a long list and would appreciate advice about how best to use that list. <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 07:44, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Neither book is specifically about dhimmis, but both touch on the question. Wheatcroft's book is a history of the conflict between Christianity and Islam. Therefore it mentions in several places the status of Christians living under Islam as well as the status of Muslims in Christian states. It contains footnoted sources that can be followed up. My criticism of this book is that it focuses on the conflicts and does not give much attention to non-conflictual relationships, e.g. trading relationships. It had very favourable reviews in the serious UK newspapers, especially those on the centre-right. The author teaches at a leading Scottish university. Hourani wrote A History of the Arab Peoples as well as other books and articles that may be more relevant. He taught at Oxford University for many years and was a very important figure in Arab and Muslim history. There are a few paragraphs in his book on the dhimmi relationship. The important thing for this article is that Hourani's points shed light on what a balanced discussion of the issue should look like.<a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 08:13, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aminz</p>
<p>Here are a few sources that might be useful for the article. Some of them may have been discussed already. REL means it seems to me to be highly relevant. ACAD means it is from an academic source. ACAD? means it may be an academic source, the publisher could be checked out. I have not discriminated at all according to the apparent point of view. There are lots more, particularly more articles, which should be preferred to books, but it takes a long time to sift through them.</p>

<p>Hi .. you know <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> its seems to me some time, issues like Dhimmis or death penalty of a person who convert to other religions and other critism on Islam, no matter what you do there will be people who will never satisfied. I think part of the problem is the Muslim world itself. Its difficult but not impossible, but at the same time if some one dont want to understand then you can not do any thing. Present what you think is right.. and I hope you will keep doing that. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 00:10, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I also wonder why on name of God we need first of all an artical like Critsim of Islam&#160;? I mean should we research just to find evidence and counter evidence just to tell the critism on this great religion.

<p>Glad you liked the sources. I have a whole lot more that I am sorting through. I also want to work on this slowly. I am going to set myself a time limit per day and stick to it so I don't get burned out. I am picking up lots of book reviews in the peer-reviewed journals. this should help to establish which sources are considered reliable in the academic community. I'm glad to see some movement out of the deadlock, thanks to Merzbow, but I don't think we should be too quick to compromise on using only top-quality sources. See User:Taxman/Featured article advice. Don't be too quick to spend money through Amazon. Can you borrow books through an academic library? If not, I can, and I am also looking at how I can track these sources down. Some of the references I have given you are UK PhD theses and will only be available by academic inter-library loan.<a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 08:04, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I understand what you mean, but it is always relative.. no matter what you belief, you will always find counter "facts". There is just no "Universal" formula, on which we can satisfy our self and agree. When I see any thing which I can belief but can not proove.. troubled me. It is some time just to satisfy my own self that I belief something which relaxed me. Any way, like I asked you before, if you see the bigger picture, there will be no end of discussion, just limit less arguments. That is why I think such pages should be created under strict limited rules. And I know you are a wise man, still wise to know that your good arguments (I personally belief that) will always motivate others to find something against it..&#160;:-) .. it is just my openion, take care <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 23:44, 3 July 2006 (UTC) Oh yea.. it certainly was like that, I wrote something, I turned away to other page, got back and the answer was there.. wow&#160;:-) <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 00:10, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I find your editing very strange. The statement presuming marriage amongst Muslims is modelled after slavery was in the article since February. All this time it's been there, and you took no exception to it. Given the amount of work you've put into this article, I can't imagine you just noticed this now. On the other hand, you're very diligent when it comes to either deleting my edits or reverting my contributions, regardless of how solid my sources are or how well my edits reflect actual Muslim thinking. Ayatollah Sistani is a major leader of the Shias, second to Khomeini himself. His view on the issue of ritual purity was certainly noteworthy...Your edits suggest uncompromizing faith in Western interpretation of Islamic practices, while incredible skepticism when it comes to Muslim writings and opinions. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 02:45, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can laugh at whatever you want. I've made a reasonable observation, not an accusation. This article has included this commentary of "Muslim marriage is slavery" for over 3 months. For all the time he, and you for that matter, invested in this article, you found no reason to question whether or not that allegation was properly interpreted. And yet you're very cautious when information suggesting a different perspective is added. If you're claiming coincidence, or that you simply missed it...I'm not buying it. I know that both you and Timothy Usher have been loading compliments on his efforts here. I'm opposed to the whole barnstar thing in how people can easily be goaded into seeking such approval rather than working here objectively. I'm merely suggesting that a level amount of skepticism be directed at all entries, regardless of who inserts them. I've been familiar with your work long enough to know not to bother directing the same suggestion to you. That Pecher, whose work has repeatedly been criticized in the past for misinterpretation, could introduce a statement such as this here and neither you nor Aminz bothered to check on it is astounding. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 05:18, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it is natural for H.E. to feel that I am "very diligent when it comes to either deleting my edits or reverting my contributions" since I almost removed all his edits today&#160;:P <i>But it was accidental.</i> The sistani quote was good and I'm sure he had spent much time finding it, but I really didn't think it was a good addition and it was better if I had somehow added it to the article, or had discussed it more before removing it. Having said that, I don't agree with H.E.'s later statements. Of course, it is true that Timothy Usher gave me a barnstar, or that Merzbow gave me compliments (thanks Merzbow btw), but I have had conflicts with both of them, well, mostly with Timothy Usher. I admire both Merzbow and Timothy Usher as excellent editors. They really are. Anyways, H.E., believe me, I don't have any personal preference on your edits or Merzbow's or Timothy Usher's. I am sorry for being so hasty to remove your comment. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 06:09, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Both comments were responses to behaviors, the latter one to someone lecturing me that the West created Wikipedia to educate me and 'my children'. My response mirrored the comment directed at me. There is no personal attack to speak of. Also, seeing as we're on opposite ends of the POV spectrum on two different articles, it would be laughable for you to suggest your vandalism of my talk page with this unfounded 'warning' wasn't actually rooted in the ongoing content dispute. If that weren't the case, we'd see the exact same warning on the page of that other fellow whom I was responding to. The addition of this warning to my talk page was a crass and malevolent act aimed at intimidating me. Your talk page shows a similar tactic employed against another user. Using the vandalism and personal attack templates for the purpose of vandalism. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 00:37, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is, of course nonsense. We get along not because we always share the same POV but because we are civil with each other and can compromise. And FWIW, I do not hate Islam. Like any religion it has its moderate and its dangerous forms; I will oppose the latter, but have no beef with the former. I'd love to visit the Middle East someday, perhaps once the political situation cools down. (And even this is irrelevant to Wikipedia, where I am obligated to maintain NPOV in all articles regardless of what I personally think).

<p>Hey Aminz, it was absolutely unacceptable for me to take a swipe at you using the religion card. I lost my temper and swung out, once again. I know you're just a decent guy, a good Muslim one at that, trying to keep the peace; you're just alot more patient than I am. You're more the Jesus type, I'm more the Joshua type. Anyway, several users here are defending you and holding me responsible at my Arbcomm case, as they should. Feel free to swipe back at me at the Arbcomm case (link's on my talk page). Suggest a permanent ban even; God knows I could use that. Also, I know you once considered going to Arbcomm regarding Pecher's POV-pushing and obstinate selectivity with sources. Pecher is a party in this dispute, and his POV-pushing on pages is part of my response. Arbcomm welcomes all information that could be useful, so this is a good opportunity to address the Islam-bashing that's been going on here. And seriously, do add whatever you feel is due on my personal attack against you. There's no excuse for it at all, and I'll hold nothing against you. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 00:04, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes VERY nice to see you back! Basically, sections 36 onwards are still live. But I want to concentrate on finding sources and even get to the stage of reading some of them&#160;;-) There is one instrumental reason why it is good that you're around, and that is that I think you have good library access.

<p>All the articles from the <i>Encyclopaedia of Islam</i> are copyrighted; posting them on Wikipedia talk pages is copyright violation.

<p>I actually inserted the whole articles from <i>Encyclopaedia of Islam</i> on two talk pages (Jizya &amp; Apostasy in Islam) for public use which was not proper (I thought it is okay to have them on the talk pages since it is sort of informal).
