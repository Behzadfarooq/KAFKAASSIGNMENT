<p>Hi Aminz. The Encyclopedia of Islam is certainly a reputable, authoritative source. Paul Johnson may be presenting an accurate or inaccurate view. Perhapas he should not be considered a reputable or authoritative source. However, the fact is that he <b>is</b> considered reputable and an authority <i>in some circles</i>. Although it is tempting to try to determine which source is in fact "right", my understanding of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> policy is that in cases such as this, the article should report <b>both</b> conflicting views, and attribute them to their respective authors. I would be happy to make that case on the talk page if you like. However I wished to inform you of my opinion before I took any action. Please let me know. Sincerely, --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 03:33, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>you are welcome. Paul Johnson may have his own POV, and may not be an <b>accurate</b> source, but he has academic credentials and a wide readership. We can discuss it some more, but not tonight (US time) as I am signing off soon.

<p>"Certain Jews were transformed into "apes" because they broke Sabbath."</p>
<p>You can't be serious. Do you really believe that?<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 07:11, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There are some types of stories which I've heard a lot but I don't know if my Sunni brothers share or not. The theme is that one's "other-worldly" eye was opened and he saw Muslims doing pilgrimage as monkeys, apes, ... It might have come from the Qur'ans description of those who eat what belongs to orphans actually eat fire. Anyways, I was just explaining that the Qur'an says. Some Jews in the past who were persistently sinning and breaking Sabbath were transformed into apes probably spiritually. My mother used to tell me that if you tell lie, in the resurrection day, you'll be resurrected with a big tongue on which all people will step on. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 07:26, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Salaam! I was just passing by your talk page. What do you think of the comments about pre-Badr events! You told me that you had problems with that!

<dd>Thats fine! I am glad that you are still surviving Wikipedia's rough and cruel environment. I myself is running short of time in completion of a document.

<dd>Well! Tafsir literature, to the best of my knowledge, refer this whole chapter of Qur'an to the event of Badr. The most of important verse is the next one:
<dl>
<dd>008.007 YUSUFALI: Behold! Allah promised you one of the two (enemy) parties, that it should be yours: Ye wished that the one unarmed should be yours, but Allah willed to justify the Truth according to His words and to cut off the roots of the Unbelievers;-</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This verse says that some wanted to attack the caravan (the unarmed one), but the last part of the verse says very clearly that God instead chose a target that would cut off the roots of the Unbelievers, and that essentially was the Meccan army. Hence, according to this understanding, the Meccan army was already mobilized to destroy Muslims. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 04:29, 23 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Done! In "The sealed Nectar", the initial raids were more of securing a piece of land than looting caravans. It is the final raid of 300 people that is being disputed. Now, Muslims have accepted these traditions and this is why they justify these allegations. But as a Muslim, I simply can't accept looting a defenceless caravan, as it is not only against morality but also Qur'an should allude to such an event. And how easy for Muslims to say that Muslims attacked the defenceless caravan and Abu Sufyan rescued his caravan. I think if the caravan was attacked, it wouldn't go unharmed and secondly, the looting of caravans would become part of the religion which actually never has become. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 04:52, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well I note that Opiner hasn't actually been on Wikipedia for the last four days. Perhaps now when he sees that other users who agree with him such as <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">User:Arrow740</a> have signed up he'll be willing to participate.</p>
<p>My understanding of mediation is that for it to go ahead, all parties need to agree upon it. This is unfortunate, but hopefully Opiner will come round.</p>
<p>As for the article more generally... I understand there is this dispute over the source and there appear to be two versions of the page that had been reverted between but could you just give me a brief summary of the conflict as a whole? What (if anything) do you think should be done to the article to remove the non-netural tag? Alternatively, what do you feel others are misunderstanding in order for them to have put the tag there?

<dl>
<dd>I don't see why a reform need necessairily be poistive. The article should state:
<ul>
<li>What Muhammad and His followers saw as wrong with the previous social systems (an expanded version would say why things were wrong, and why Muhammad was in a position to change them)</li>
<li>What He and His followers proposed to do about the system (an expanded version would compare this witht the position of their contemporaries)</li>
<li>What actually happned: how many of the planned reforms went through (all of them, some, none?)</li>
<li>Their effects both positive and negative.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the semantics of that quote - it is fair to point out that the article contains more quotes and more attributed statements than most other aritcles on Wikipedia. I would leave it as 'Muhammad preached against what he saw as the social evils of his day', followed by a reference. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 12:35, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have been involved in the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">antisemitism</a> article for awhile and have tried my best not to engage in any revert war (i have repented from that&#160;:)) but at the same time I can not really continue working on that anymore because of persistent violations of wiki policies.</p>

<dd><a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_of_Islam_e80f.html" title="Encyclopedia of Islam">Encyclopedia of Islam</a>, Brill academic publisher, the source in which <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Cahen_df5e.html" title="Claude Cahen">Claude Cahen</a> has published his article is a POV teritary source.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In fact, the quotes from the quotes from <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Cahen_df5e.html" title="Claude Cahen">Claude Cahen</a> are removed and quotes from Johnson are replaced.</p>
<p>Here are the diffs: Please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jayjg&amp;diff=89123312&amp;oldid=89121968" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jayjg&amp;diff=89123312&amp;oldid=89121968" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aminz&amp;diff=89124411&amp;oldid=89077061" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aminz&amp;diff=89124411&amp;oldid=89077061" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>

<p>In fact, the book written by Johnson, the conservative journalist, is <b>not peer reviewed</b> either. It is published by "New York: HarperCollins Publishers", not a univ press or other ones which particularly publish scholarly books. I have introduced many sources to them including <a href="../../../b/e/r/Bernard_Lewis_9c79.html" title="Bernard Lewis">Bernard Lewis</a>, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Cahen_df5e.html" title="Claude Cahen">Claude Cahen</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norman_Stillman_0160.html" title="Norman Stillman">Norman Stillman</a>, etc etc but they insist in using the conservative journalist.

<p>It is a violation of <a href="../../../a/s/s/WP%7EAssume_good_faith_cd17.html" title="WP:Assume good faith">WP:Assume good faith</a> to persistently and flatly accuse others of misrepresentation of sources when they haven't even read them. They need to first make sure that they have not misunderstood the case before making any accusations. Here I am going to mention the sentences I've written together with the sources and their accusations:</p>
<p>Here is user: Jayjg's accusation: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Antisemitism&amp;diff=89124141&amp;oldid=89123925" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Antisemitism&amp;diff=89124141&amp;oldid=89123925" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and here is User: Beit Or's accusation: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Antisemitism&amp;diff=89278511&amp;oldid=89216706" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Antisemitism&amp;diff=89278511&amp;oldid=89216706" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Accusations of user:Humus_spiens could be frequently found in different talk pages.</p>
<p>The sentence in dispute is:</p>
<p>"There was not such a thing that would be called Antisemitism in Muslim lands before the establishment of the state of Israel (However S. D. Goitein argues that anti-semitism was not entirely absent as it is assumed and aims to prove its existences through Geniza letters. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>) However many scholars believe that antisemtism arosed in Muslim lands after establishment of the state of Israel though this is disputed. (see <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_antisemitism.html" title="New antisemitism">new antisemitism</a>). "</p>
<p>User:Jayjg didn't notice that many sources was given for the sentence and simply because one particular source didn't say what was written addressed such an accusation towards me. I provide two quotations from Lewis and Stillman, word by word, which show will refute all these accusations:</p>
<p>Bernard Lewis says: "Prejudices existed in the Islamic world, as did occasional hostility, but not what could be called anti-Semitism...".</p>
<p>Norman Stillman says:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Increased European commercial, missionary and imperialist activities within the Muslim world during the 19th and 20th centuries introduced anti-Semitic ideas and literature into the region. At first these prejudices only found a reception among Arabic-speaking Christian protégés of the Europeans in Syria, Lebanon and Egypt and <b>were too new and too palpably foreign for any widespread acceptance among Muslims.</b> However, with <b>the ever-increasing conflict between Arabs and Jews in Palestine</b> during the period of the British Mandate, the language and imagery of European anti-Semitism began to appear in political polemics both in the nationalist press and in books (Stillman, New attitudes toward the Jew in the Arab world, in Jewish Social Studies, xxxvii [1975], 197-204; idem, Antisemitism in the contemporary Arab world, in Antisemitism in the contemporary world, ed. M. Curtis, Boulder and London 1986, 70-85). For more than two decades following 1948, this trend increased greatly, but peaked by the 1970s, and declined somewhat as the slow process of rapprochement between the Arab world and the state of Israel evolved in the 1980s and 1990s; it remains to be seen how the tensions arising in 2000 will affect the trend.</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>3. Double Standards</b></p>
<p>User:Humus spiens, used the scholar S. D. Goitein (a famous scholar of Jewish studies) when it was quoted by the journalist but removed it when I added it. In fact, even the journalist refers to Goitein as a "great scholar". I was expecting and requested User:Humus spiens to add back the scholarly quotes but instead he added another quote from the journalist.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I didn't want to bring this issue here but have found it vert hard, if not impossible, to work on this article, to see these and at the same time not to edit-war; to see editors go around and accuse me of misrepresenting sources while they haven't even read the sources. When I have already asked Humus spiens to let this dispute be resolved in the talk page rather than ANI but he told me that I am threatening him. All I am asking is the un-peer-reviewed sources written by journalists be replaced with Lewis, Cahen, Goitein, et al and that the unestablished accusations be stoped especially noting that some of these editors are admins.</p>

<p>Just checking in to see how you're doing. Wikipedia is an interesting place... people come and go from articles, there's a mostly new crop of people working on Criticism of Islam/etc. I see lots of good changes and some bad. I think the key to keeping one's sanity on this website is not to get too heavily invested in one area or article. Myself, I think I'll be more active than I've been last few months, but never on the level I was in the summer. - <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 09:09, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm doing fine, mostly involved with other hobbies now, but perhaps I'll give a few hours a week to Wikipedia. The whole H.E. thing was a tough ordeal for everyone involved. I got too involved with specific articles and too concerned with specific people for my own good. This hobby is definitely more fun if taken slowly. It's good you and Itsmejudith are still editing.- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 04:59, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What do you think about him.

<p>One says that his writings are polemic and inconsistent. Other says at the end that "it is hard to recommend his writings but maybe useful for someone who wants to read for antiquity".

<dd>I would say the same thing that if prophet Muhammad would conquer the lands, this would be much peaceful and much better than people who conquered after Sahaba. And as Israelites always had a prophet to guide them, hence their struggle should be peaceful, otherwise I'd be surprised. But in any case, there are incidences when there is no option left but to use force and sometimes when enemies of God challenge God himself infront of His messenger, those are badly punished. I believe that these all incidences actually point to this very fact, e.g. killing of worshippers of <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_calf.html" title="Golden calf">Golden calf</a> etc. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 10:52, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If I will come to know that Huris are angles, I might mend my lifestyle drastically! Huris are definitely humans, as Qur'an explains their features well, unlike angles which are made from light (<i>Noor</i>) or energy. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 01:56, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The hard proof is Qur'an itself. Angels are made from light, Jinns are made from fire, and human is created from mud (or matter). Former one's can take other forms because they can interact with our psychology, but they don't become humans. For example, when two angles came to Abraham in human form and Abraham (as) gave them food, they didn't eat it and Abraham knew that these two men are not humans. So they can look like humans, but their desires and needs are still like angles. But Qur'an tells us about Huris that they will look like humans and also feel like humans. If I can remember properly, in Surah Rahman, skin of huris will be like membrane of an egg. And we will only be enjoying their company if they act like humans, what is the purpose of having sexual companionship when the other doesn't feel like humans as angles don't even have sexes, at least according to what I know! <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 02:12, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I do believe that bible has translated hence, there can be small mistakes in it, but the text you sent me says: <i>"as the angels of God in heaven</i>".

<p>Muhammad banning non monotheism like Mecca religion are you saying thats not true? Qur'an says monotheism followers have to pay tribute and be subdued isnt Qur'an from the time of Muhammad? Or maybe Qur'an is from Umar?</p>
<p>Lets ask another way are you saying non monotheism ISNT banned by Islam? Then why theyre destroying all the beautiful Mecca god statues in the Kaaba? Qur'an makes a much bigger deal about polytheism than about any of the other things youre talking about. People still debating many of these things but NO ONE debating polythesism is banned completely. Since Arabia is mostly polytheism at that time this is the biggest reform.<a href="../../../o/p/i/User%7EOpiner_8286.html" title="User:Opiner">Opiner</a> 08:45, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I dont know if taxation under early Islam was much less than that under Byzantium and Persian Empire its not sounding right. Why attack people to make them pay less when usually just say were charging less? but its not the tribute to the Muslims just the tax. How much tax you pay now? OK divide that by two and pay it as the tribute owed by the Muslim to the Jews. What are you getting more upset about?</p>
<p>Sabians also monotheism? I think. Zoroastrian monotheist as much as Christians. Muhammad didnt know Hindus and this is about the Muhamma reforms not what someones doing later thats another reform BUT judging from Mecca polytheists hes not going to smash all their beautiful statue take their temple for Islam and make them convert?

<dd>This is a very common mistake. The whole verse should be understood in the context. Out of the context, every verse has unlimited meanings. The context tells us that Moses told Israelites that they should strive (essentially militarily), and God has destined for this this land. Mentioning of "written" should be considered in this context that God ensured them victory but still they didn't proceed. IMHO, the context of the verse shows the promise to only the direct addressees of Moses, and not for all generations of Jews. I wouldn't make a final statement as this only my opinion.

<p>Aminz, when you solicit a large number of select editors to comment on a page, resulting in a flood of like-minded individuals supporting your proposal, it angers other editors, who feel the process is being unfairly manipulated, and poisons the transpiring discussion. It also tends to reflect poorly on its respondents, who begin to look like interchangable POV warriors rather than respectable editors, even when they are the latter.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 07:24, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Request For Comment was on <i>existence of a dispute</i>. To me, every reasonable person should support it (that's what I personally think, no offense taken). I didn't ask people to say that I am right but only that there is a dispute. Personally, I find it unacceptable that the fact that there is some dispute angers some editors. I am sorry but there are many more serious things in this world one can be angered at. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 07:30, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I am not angered by the fact that there is a dispute, to which I will attest shortly, per Tom harrison. It is obvious to me that your material should be represented, and that your early version, leading the section as it did by stating that anti-Semitism did not exist, was tendentious, perhaps contributing to the response you received from its regular editors.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 07:40, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My suggestion for the lead has changed over time as I have learned more about it. At the beginning I had only seen Cahen and Lewis who say explicitly and unambigiously that there was no antisemitism. So I said there is none. But then I found others saying there was a little bit. So, I added that as well. The last version which I prepared and was ruthlessly removed is this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antisemitism&amp;diff=97035413&amp;oldid=97030754" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antisemitism&amp;diff=97035413&amp;oldid=97030754" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.

<dd>I would agree that the existing version is unduly dismissive of this view; however it is absurd to open this section with the assertion that all that follows does not actually exist. That would be considered tententious even in articles such as <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigfoot.html" title="Bigfoot">Bigfoot</a> or the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Loch_Ness_Monster_861a.html" title="Loch Ness Monster">Loch Ness Monster</a>, where scholarly consensus is overwhelmingly that they do not exist, and in these cases existence isn't dependent on definition. Jews didn't - and still don't - have the same rights as Muslims, and this is enough to merit a discussion on anti-Semitism even where we are aware that the terminology might be debated. English does not have a well-established term which captures all the nuances of Islamic "anti-Semitism," but that something like this exists, today and in history, cannot seriously be questioned.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 08:03, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The section actually starts with "<i>while prejudice and sometimes hostility existed in the Islamic world</i>". And of course the most authorative POV should go first. When <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shelomo_Dov_Goitein_a7d2.html" title="Shelomo Dov Goitein">Shelomo Dov Goitein</a> wants to contradict Cahen, he writes: Antisemitism was not absent <b>as it is assumed</b> (+footnote). In the footnote, writes even by such an eminent authority as Cahen" (please see footnote 13 (and 2) here <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0520221591&amp;id=QH3BHQulNpsC&amp;pg=PA586&amp;lpg=PA586&amp;ots=TYxOznpGcQ&amp;dq=A+Mediterranean+Society+cahen+eminent&amp;sig=vMLGc3YsNMe_hDdhFvq4JxElKxo" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0520221591&amp;id=QH3BHQulNpsC&amp;pg=PA586&amp;lpg=PA586&amp;ots=TYxOznpGcQ&amp;dq=A+Mediterranean+Society+cahen+eminent&amp;sig=vMLGc3YsNMe_hDdhFvq4JxElKxo" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>). Phrases like "as it is assumed", "by such an eminent authority as Cahen" can justify that the lack of antisemitism is among the most authorative POVs (and probably the most authorative POV at the time <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shelomo_Dov_Goitein_a7d2.html" title="Shelomo Dov Goitein">Shelomo Dov Goitein</a> wrote his book). --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 08:15, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>If being Jewish means adhereing to Judaism, then being Jewish and Muslim are not reconcilable (because Jews reject Jesus). Being both (non-mainstream) Christian and Muslim is though possible. But I can not get its relevance here. There has been hardly any difference between Jews and Christians in terms of Dhimmi laws etc etc. When they were discriminated and persecuted, they were both discriminated and persecuted, and when they were relaxed, both were relaxed. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 11:26, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Salam. I've worked on this article and I have some problem with Zora. She doesn't trust in my edits. She recognized the most reliable narration of Karabla which has written by AbiMekhnaf as Shi'a POV and when I told her OK look at Tabari and we can write whatever in both of these books she said I don't have that volume of Tabari. I remember she trust in you. Please look at this information "<i>Kitab Maqtal al-Husayn</i> by Abu Mikhnaf (died in 157 AH, 774 AD). He was the first historian to systematically collect the reports dealing with the events of the Karbala. His works was reliable among later historians -Shi'a and Sunni- like <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_ibn_Jarir_al-Tabari_70f7.html" title="Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari">Tabari</a>.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup>He has based his work on the eyewitness testimony of Dolham, Oqbeh, and Homayd bin Muslim." and the talk page of battle of Karbala and speak with her or tell me what should I do with her.--<a href="../../../s/a/2E/User%7ESa.vakilian_5dc3.html" title="User:Sa.vakilian">Sa.vakilian</a> 18:12, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aminz, I'm very distressed by your edits to the academic section. Your writing is not clear, your references are incomplete, and you're paraphrasing rather than quoting. Furthermore, you seem to be citing scholars who are talking about what the battle means to the Shi'a, rather than what actually happened. Hugh Kennedy is a military historian. He specializes in Islamic military history. He makes a clear distinction between an account of what happened at the battle (without speculating as to Husayn's intentions) and the effect on the Muslims of the time. Please, let's keep the outline of the what happened distinct from speculation as to intentions, significance, etc. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 11:26, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wellhausen was giving his emotional reaction to the events -- that's not the same thing as a considered academic judgement on what happened. Furthermore, Wellhausen died in 1918! He's hardly representative of current scholarship.</p>
<p>Halm is taking a very Shi'a POV -- as one might expect from someone who had spent many years studying the Shi'a. He titles his section "The Martyrdom of Husayn" -- which is hardly academic even-handedness. He seems to have taken the standard Shi'a account of events at face value, down to the pathetic stories about the desecration of Husayn's body. I'm not sure that he's that well-regarded in academia, as I haven't found him in any of the bibliographies of books that are "state of the art". Nor any of the graduate school bibliographies re Islam that I've copied off the net.</p>
<p>Esposito is also well-known for taking a sympathetic view of Islam. He's an essayist, primarily. I don't think he's known for work in primary sources.</p>
<p>Kennedy specializes in military history; he knows how the armies were organized and just what was at hand to throw against Husayn.</p>
<p>Now Kennedy also talks about the effect of the battle on Muslim opinion at the time. I can suggest a compromise, which is we have a section on "contemporary reactions to the battle", where we can quote Kennedy to the effect that "al-Husayn became the symbol for the sufferings of all the weak and defenceless". Other academics as well. I don't mind quoting academics when they're talking about what the battle meant at the time. I think the Shi'a interpretation of it, more than 1000 years later, is already well-covered. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 11:53, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Madelung thinks that Hasan was treated very badly by the EofI 2 and devotes a whole section of his book to refuting the article. I find his arguments persuasive. However, I don't think that Halm's acceptance of the EofI article makes him "unsympathetic" to the Shi'a. I think he's just following other people's narratives here, whether they're EoI or Shi'a. This period is not his specialty. I've been digging for info about him, and he seems to have focussed on the Ismailis and especially the Fatimids.</p>
<p>I've noticed this in other general histories of Islam. When authors are discussing the period that they have studied, in detail, from primary sources, they're very good, very sharp. For other periods, they're summarizing other people's work. Frex, the Hugh Kennedy book that I like re Umayyad and Abbasid military history is a general history of Islam up to the later Abbasids. The section on early Islam is not Hugh Kennedy's specialty, and he's not very illuminating there.</p>
<p>So I would assume that Halm's book on the Shi'a is going to be the most reliable when he's discussing the Fatimids. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 12:11, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>SV has added some material re Shi'a who want to remove some of the invented, dramatic trappings from the story of the battle. However, I see no reason to believe that their "stripped down" version is stripped down enough for academic consumption. The "modern" Shi'a POV still seems to start with the assumption that Husayn deserved the caliphate, that he was unjustly treated, that he was a perfect human being, that he knew he would die but accepted it as necessary for Islam, etc. Academics have to toss all that out. They should try to be completely neutral. Which is why Halm's use of the term "martyrdom" is disturbing. That's accepting the Shi'a interpretation of what happened.</p>
<p>So far, I haven't seen anything from the Shi'a POV re history that meets Western academic standards. The text that SV wants me to accept as authentic is just not up to snuff, in the form presented. This business about "reconstruction" is just too fuzzy. At least when Guillaume reconstructs Ibn Ishaq, he marks the passages from al-Tabari and Ibn Hisham so that you know exactly where he got each passage. It's possible to check his work. The Abi Mekhnaf is "reconstructed" but from what? by whom? The introduction makes a big deal about how Abi Mekhnaf is so early, so reliable -- but why would I trust that? Why would I believe that? It could be "reconstructed" from documents written 300 years later, in which case the reconstruction is highly suspect. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 12:47, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I did my best and find academic research about Abi Mekhnaf and the fact that Tabari has admitted it as reliable source but she doesn't want to accept. Now it's not important for me what she thinks. She insists on her position without any reference which supports her. What should we do now.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It's funny that Shi'a accepts Abi Mekhnaf because Tabari narrates his report:"<i>Abu Mikhnaf was the earliest historian who took testimonies from eye witnesses and compiled his maqtal. There is in existence today an book in Arabic called Maqtal Abi Mikhnaf. It is doubtful whether this is the original text. However we do have the excerpts quoted by Tabari and other historians.</i>"<a href="http://www.al-islam.org/history/history/br1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.al-islam.org/history/history/br1.html" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></dd>

<dd>Thanks Fayssal. The argument that some editors bring is that it is not neutral to say that Muhammad was sincere.

<dd>I'm not clear that the concept of an "unconscious" is nowadays broadly accepted as useful. It is futile, for example, to ask to what degree a poet, painter, musician, etc. is creating material from their "unconscious," just as it is useless to try to identify "prophets" on the basis of this indefeasable attribution.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 20:57, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aminz, this material is already in the article: "Other historians, such as Watt, Reeves and Schimmel, accept Muhammad's revelations as sincere.<sup id="_ref-Cambridge31_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cambridge31" title="">[4]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-Cambridge31_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Cambridge31" title="">[4]</a></sup>, <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[6]</a></sup>." The trouble is that you wish to turn these into a dedicated section, with a decidedly POV title, including each quote redundantly given in full.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: if half the readers walk away from this article believing that Muhammad was the prophet of God, and half walk away believing him to have been an imposter, would you feel the need to correct this second group? Neutrality means allowing people to arrive at their own conclusions, without being confronted with a long list of generic testimonials. These add nothing factual to the article, and are only topical because Muir's allegation broached the subject. Even so, I'm not clear from your quotes that any of them were saying Muhammad was <i>invariably</i> sincere, only that he wasn't an outright fraud. It is often taken to be a sign of insecurity to feel the need to rebut what is never said.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 20:45, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aminz, despite the astonishing advances of 20th century, there is as of yet nothing like a scientific methodology for determining the sincerity of the living, much less the dead. Do you imagine Watt possesses some calculus which in this regard is superior to Muir's? Alternately, why should not Muir's be advanced against those of the 7th century? Many who knew Muhammad believed him; many did not. You, I, Watt and Muir have far less basis to determine this than those who knew him, and they disagreed.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 04:21, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Arrow740, I prefer not to have any communication with you so please don't edit my talk page. Bernard Lewis commenting on the Medieval conception of Muhammad as a self-seeking imposter writes: "The modern historian will not readily believe that so great and significant a movement was started by a self-seeking imposter. Nor will he be satisfied with a purely supernatural explanation, whether it postulates aid of divine of diabolical origin; rather, like Gibbon, will he seek 'with becoming submission, to ask not indeed what were the first, but what were the secondary causes of the rapid growth' of the new faith" --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 05:58, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't remember the exact quote but the context Ghazali used it was that in God's eyes, in polemical discussions, admitting a truth which may cause some people to turn away from the God's true religion is better than telling a lie in order to convince people of God's true religion. Ghazali at some period of his life used to extensively engage in religious polemics but he later changed his manner finding it prone to such sins. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 11:38, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, you are asking to be bored to tears but lets try. In religions there are so many of these that they get lampooned by the <a href="../../../i/n/v/Invisible_Pink_Unicorn_1b4b.html" title="Invisible Pink Unicorn">Invisible Pink Unicorn</a> and the like.. if you are prepared to accept statements about people then this is quite possible. It is all about intent IMHO. e.g. My children will never meet my late father because he died before they were born. If I tell my children a story about my late father in order to try to get them to know what he was like I may succeed in being entirely "true" to his personality without being historically accurate (particularly if I am not trying to be historically accurate, and they understand I am not trying to be: e.g. I might compress two different things he did on different days into a single tale). Then the personal descriptive story might be true to him but contradict the historical truth. In going from the massive data set of his life to a small number of words I could choose one type of projection (history, broadly) or another {perserving personality). The statements in English end up orthogonal. Both types of projection are accurate projections. Whether you can ever accept that the "non historical" one is true is up to you but if not please hand over all your personal collection of paintings since you must believe photos are better.

<dd>Hmm...lets try... "My father was such a considerate host that when he had a black tie dinner party and one friend arrived in a lounge suit he immediately went and changed into a lounge suit himself to make his friend feel more comfortable". Historically false but entirely true to my father's personality. I could turn it into a longer statement which is both historically and personally true (if my three year old could understand a subjunctive) but the short statements (the statement in quotes is true and is false) are two contradictory truths. Truth in a statement depends on intent; as long as everyone knows what you are trying to do of course. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 12:29, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Lets take "Rape is Wrong". If this is not semantic then you cannot define Rape in a way in which makes the statement true (e.g. by defining rape as being wrong non-consensual sex). For this statement to be an "objective truth" you would be saying that there is no circumstance anywhere in the animal kingdom in any context in which rape was acceptable. Not where the last remaining female of a species was in coma and it was the only way to prevent extinction? Not where it was perpetrated by someone in complex societal context to avoid a greater evil. Objective truth "wrong". Hmm. Last time I had that argument it was with <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Polkinghorne_9e70.html" title="John Polkinghorne">John Polkinghorne</a> and he tried "torturing children is wrong". I reckon you could construct circumstances where most things were right (but I rarely disagree with JP). I don't suppose we will convince each other on that.

How about these: the Earth orbits a star, and there either will be a nuclear bomb exploded in the US in 2007 or there won't. The really interesting question is, what would it be like if two truths could contradict each other? How could that possibly happen?

<dd>However, more seriously "truth" means different things in different contexts. If it makes you feel better I do believe in formal and consistent logic and I do not believe in perpetual motion machines. However when you trying to map the real world to language there are always holes. In some cases (earth-star) the holes are vanishingly small (orbits is not really perfect). "Truth" is a value function (0 to 1) on a set of relations between the real world and language (i.e. is a statement true) which we sometimes take by mistake (although it is nearly true as most bad mistakes) as the set of all statements with a truth value of 1. Viewed as a function it makes perfect sense: taken as a set of statements and logic framework it all falls apart... in my view.

<dd>We're not restricting ourselves to the first definitions of words according to some dictionary, so the bomb one is alright. Though the language is inaccurate the truth I was expressing with the orbit example is correct. My statement is really a pointer to some objectively true statement of possible infinite length which may only exist as an abstraction. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 14:40, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Now, I agree at least with the notion that statements of infinite length can be convergent to objectively true. But when a bomb on the Mexican border is in or out of the US is something you can explain another time. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 14:43, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Here's an obscure question. This change keeps getting re-inserted by an anon:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islam&amp;diff=100165277&amp;oldid=100160463" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islam&amp;diff=100165277&amp;oldid=100160463" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Islam&amp;diff=100165277&amp;oldid=100160463</a></p>
<p>My view is that it's redundant and confusing to call the first three caliphs "Sunni" because the Shi'a do not believe in caliphs at all; instead they refer to Ali and his descendants as Imams. Do you agree? - <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 06:23, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK... so it looks like keeping the text as "Sunni caliphs" might be OK since the word "calipha" that some Shi'as use sounds so similar. - <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzbow_28f9.html" title="User:Merzbow">Merzbow</a> 21:34, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks you very much. Great help. I think "History of fundamentalism in Iran" is now more or less in a good shape. I am now working on religious intellectualism in Iran. It's a tough job.

<p>Salaam! I've added the article in my watchlist. Pakistan is a very new country, maybe India might have intellectuals but still alot less than <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>. To the best of my knowledge, <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad_Iqbal_2024.html" title="Muhammad Iqbal">Muhammad Iqbal</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shibli_Nomani_6600.html" title="Shibli Nomani">Shibli Nomani</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/w/Mawdudi.html" title="Mawdudi">Mawdudi</a> (though he was an Islamist whose ideas were even penetrated <a href="../../../q/u/t/Qutb.html" title="Qutb">Qutb</a>), and <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islahi.html" title="Islahi">Islahi</a>.</p>
<p>I was actually listening to a talk and I am a bit depressed (at the moment) from the last 800 years history of Muslims. Interestingly, for Muslims Qur'an has never been a real arena of research. Our best research on Qur'an was conducted in first 200 years after prophet Muhammad and still now we are using it. Hence, we are lingering along with all the shortcomings and good things of that research. And our <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madrasah.html" title="Madrasah">Madrasahs</a> have no ability to educate themselves properly from Qur'an. This is why, I find western scholarship on Qur'an sometimes more superior to our Muslim scholarship on Qur'an.</p>
<p>I just came to know that when Iran was going through revolution, <a href="../../../m/a/w/Mawdudi.html" title="Mawdudi">Mawdudi</a> invited all his close friends to discuss the matter as the situation was changing in the region and he said that he was very much hopeful from the new regime. In the meeting, <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghamidi.html" title="Ghamidi">Ghamidi</a> said, "To the best of my knowledge, there is nothing new in <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shiism.html" title="Shiism">Shiism</a> that would bring drastic changes in society." And he was right, our religous knowledge has now become stagnant.</p>
<p>The good thing is that Qur'an is such a book that even modern scholarship cannot remain unimpressed. The <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunnah.html" title="Sunnah">Sunnah</a> is present in <a href="../../../u/m/m/Ummah.html" title="Ummah">Ummah</a> with all its glory. The problem is that the interpretations which we have for Qur'an from last 1200 years may very well be defective in some areas (such as western scholarship doesn't agree with presence of Hijab in Qur'an for all women). In short, we need a huge reform in our regligious education and their methodology, and put alot of effort in social sciences. *sigh* <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 03:47, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

The first two assertions are based on <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Luke&amp;verse=19:29&amp;src=31" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Luke&amp;verse=19:29&amp;src=31" rel="nofollow">Luke 19:29</a>. The mount of Olive is the place where, after Jesus (sws) was lifted, the punishment of those who had rejected him which was to continue till the Day of Judgement, was declared. Fig is a village situated on this mountain.</p>
<p>Hence, Qur'an first takes the name of those places which have seen the God's judgement and then summarizes their story in <a href="../../../a/t/-/At-Tin_d1ac.html" title="At-Tin">At-Tin</a>. I found this explanation fascinating and very logical if the whole content of the Surah is seen at the same time.<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 06:15, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He writes, "In the Bible, it is referred to as Beth Phage. Here the word “Phage” is actually the word “Fig”." Maybe <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islahi.html" title="Islahi">Islahi</a> would have translated the same way, but because I don't have access to it, I can't say.

<dd>Interstingly, he has different explanation for fig in his different writings. I know that Ghamidi strongly believes in evolution of thought (ie being a student, you are always exposed to new knowledge hence your understanding of something can differ), but I am not sure that which one is his latest publication. Most probably the first one, as the translation was done in 1995, but Mizan was published in 2001. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 06:55, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Aminz. I'm not fully sure what to think of it.

<p>He will then move again to the start of the line (some editors add a note "indent reset" but I don't that's necessary).</p>
<p>Below the wrong way of doing it is represent by Editor B.</p>
<p>Editor A</p>
<dl>
<dd>Editor B
<dl>
<dd>Editor C</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Editor B
<dl>
<dd>Editor D</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Editor B</dd>
</dl>
<p>Editor B here always goes one step back instead of one step further.</p>
<p>This serves well enough to distinguish different editors but it botches the sequence, especially in the light of the common practice of an editor E replying to an earlier posting but not to later postings. He will post it behind the relevant comment, moving his further to the right, say like this:</p>
<p>Editor A</p>
<dl>
<dd>Editor B
<dl>
<dd>Editor C
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><b>Editor E</b></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Editor B</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This now looks similar to the way Editor B posted above, but it isn't. Without E's posting the sequence here would be perfectly linear and only E's posting makes it complicated. But one look will tell us E replies to C but only after B had posted already. E does not reply to B.</p>
<p>If you editor B indents in the wrong way of indent, people will at first consider his posting a reply to A (and himself) and not to C, when in fact he is replying to C. Only a comparison of the dates of the posting will reveal that.</p>
<p>So, rule of thumb: always move further to the right until you can no more. Make sure your comments stays to the right of those comments you reply to.</p>
<p>I hope my explanation is not too confusing. Cheers, <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStr1977_cbd8.html" title="User:Str1977">Str1977</a> <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStr1977_095d.html" title="User talk:Str1977"><sup>(smile back)</sup></a> 08:59, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The concept of praying or asking for mercy for someone else is different from intercession. I can pray for you to God that "May God give you success in your work". But to actually affect the God's decision, is simply not possible. And you've given a very good example yourself. Even Abraham's (as) request wasn't accepted because it was simply against the rules set by God. Similar concepts can be found in Qur'an, when God says to prophet Muhammad that even though you pray for them, but you can't save them from going astray (a pre-requisite for salvation). Hence, I do believe that people can pray for you, but it must not be seen more than a request. Secondly, asking to pray from someone who has already died is completely out of question in this case as the person is not listening (unless you believe in <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost.html" title="Ghost">Ghosts</a>). <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 22:15, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I believe that for this world, or here after or even for Judgement day, others can pray for us. There is a very find line between these concepts. First you ask someone else to pray for you, then you consider him the only hope to be successfulness. This shift takes this request into the realm of <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shirk.html" title="Shirk">shirk</a>. Just like polytheists of Arabia were still believing in <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a>, but they also used to consider others as intercessors.</dd>
<dd>This concept has been strongly purported by Qur'an e.g.</dd>
<dd>O Children of Israel! Remember My favor wherewith I favored you and how I preferred you to [all] creatures. And guard yourselves against a day when no soul will in aught avail another, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be received from it, nor will they be helped. (2:47-8)</dd>
<dd>Allah! There is no God save Him, the Alive, the Eternal. Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him. Unto Him belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. Who is he that intercedes with Him save by His leave? (2:225)</dd>

<p>Hello. I have noted the "dispute" at the RfC. I acknowledge up front that I am a rather devout Christian, so that my own perhaps disputable position in this is known in advance. However, I and several others are beginning to try to work on the major articles regarding religion as a part of the recently-revived <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7ERELIGION_9da2.html" title="WP:RELIGION">WikiProject Religion</a>. I know up front that all sides in religious wars have generally overemphathized their own "innocence" in the world, Christianity among the more obvious of them. However, I also note that there often are other articles relating to the specific religions in addition to the main one, and that in many cases these other articles might be the best place to put the majority of such content. So far as I can tell there are very few featured articles regarding specific faiths (<a href="../../../b/a/h/Baha%27i_Faith_be4d.html" title="Baha'i Faith">Baha'i Faith</a> is the only one I can think of off the top), so I believe that all of these articles can and should receive more attention and work. I am curious as to whether you would be interested in perhaps joining the project above. Right now I am still in the process of trying to "discover" all of the articles relevant to the various existing smaller-scope religion projects, and think that perhaps it might be awhile before I can return to working on articles in earnest. However, I do think that that body, which is trying to represent a more universal view of the various religions, might be the best place for discussion of the perhaps more negative sides of all faiths to be discussed. Thank you for your attention. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadbilltucker_7b20.html" title="User:Badbilltucker">Badbilltucker</a> 23:24, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As soon as I get all the articles "pigeonholed", I expect to be set up a to-do list. Right now, the problem I have is that I don't know what all articles are out there. However, if you do know of any articles that you do think are in need of work of any sort, please feel free to add it. Like I said, right now I'm trying to assess and categorize all the articles in the field, an incredible number, so that we can know which projects best relate to which articles.

<p>Hi Aminz I said on the <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> talk page that I would try to come up with a single sentence summarising the sincerity question. I am thinking of something like "A number of historians have addressed the question of whether Muhammad was sincere when he reported receiving revelations. A nineteenth century historian concluded that he was not sincere.(ref Muir) The contemporary historians reject this interpretation and say that as far as can be ascertained Muhammad did believe that he was hearing the word of God."

<dd>It is. She does talk about the sword verse, the purpose of warfare, etc etc. Further, the main response to critics is that they misinterpret the text, so giving an scholarly view on the issue explains the contrast.

<dd>Crone does not respond to criticism because she doesn't say "Critics say X; however, they are wrong because X is flase and Y is true". She only talks about an interpretation of the verse that she finds conceivable. The interpretation of this verse by Muslim scholars is different, though, and she does not deny it. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 14:30, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>She talks about those verses. The main response to critics is that they pick verses out of their context, so a short explation of the relevant verses is part of the response. Also, please note that the size of the criticism section (if we include Crone) is 2.5 more than the size of criticisms. Also, the response section contains Spencer's responses to the responses as well which makes it more unfair. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 18:35, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>I personally think that all these arguments are valid if you are looking at God from Judaic-Christian perspective. As Beit Or also gave a very good comment on my talk page. Muslims believe that God knows everything, but it is in our hand to take decisions in a certain framework, provided to us in that situation. God has no limitation, it is simply the very nature of this world that brings bad things to this world i.e. world was created to test people, not to reward them. And lastly, God doesn't have any analogy to humans. It is a very Judaic-Christian thing. As some of my Jewish friends, they even consider God as another bloak.

<dd>I fully agree. When I first listened to Ghamidi, I still remember, he said that "Islam is a code of life" is not a hadith, and is not a Qur'anic verse rather it contradicts the basics of Islamic law which interfere human life in only a given framework e.g. ethics etc. (these are those spheres in which humans mostly go wrong). All other things which we do in life, we use our knowledge, our senses and our intellect. This is why God never told humans that how to make cars or how to progress in science, or how to make a good political system rather it just gives to basic principles. But unfortunately, Muslims want to follow the whole Khilafah system (which is a primitive type of tribal system) but they are not ready to implement democracy, which Qur'an clearly demands from the community of believers or democracy is kept restricted to scholars (a hypcratical interpretation by clerics). <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 03:43, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I don't know what to say. Some of the points are really "absurd" or maybe even against Islamic teachings, like "we will not teach Qur'an to our children"! I would strongly look at it with suspicion. Also, the first appearance is in Al-Tabarri, which is famous in his Qur'anic exegesis as "compendium of the opinions of authorities of the past", so sometimes Al-Tabarri just presents that information for the sake of preserving the information, unlike Muhaddithin, who scruitinize hadith. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">reply</font></a></sup> 04:23, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The undiscussed POV rewrite that you're doing on that article is precisely the sort of editing that has triggered the RFC on you. At this point, I can see only two options. The first one is that you will</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Discuss any major edits to any article</b>,</li>
<li><b>Respect the opinions of other editors</b>, and</li>
<li><b>Refrain from edit warring</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second option is that you will persist in your behavior. In this case, the dispute resolution will have to proceed to the next stage. Hopefully, you realize that the second option is obviously inferior. However, the choice is yours. <a href="../../../b/e/i/User%7EBeit_Or_17e0.html" title="User:Beit Or">Beit</a> <a href="../../../b/e/i/User_talk%7EBeit_Or_8e68.html" title="User talk:Beit Or">Or</a> 20:34, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have completely rewritten the section on Jews in the Qur'an. Anything negative (e.g., Leon Poliakov) was buried deeply near the bottom of the section. Instead you have inserted vaguely positive quotes that are not in any way relevant to the subject of the article at the top of the section. This is your signature: anything positive must go straight to the lead or at least to the top of the relevant section, anything negative must be buried near the bottom. Before I did any edits to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam_and_antisemitism.html" title="Islam and antisemitism">Islam and antisemitism</a>, there had been a long and painful discussion about Islam and antisemitism on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">Antisemitism</a>.

<p>I removed the clause "...although according to Watt many of the old prejudices still linger on" becuase it added nothing to what was already stated from the same source - "Most are gone but some remain" is no different from "most are gone" - except for POV. We don't learn which prejudices lingered on - the last one stated was "The development of the concept of Mahound started with considering Muhammad as a kind of demon or false god worshipped with Apollyon and Termangant in an unholy trinity" which I challenge you to find <i>anyone</i> saying today. I'd never ever heard of that until you added it (good work). Neutrally-stated informative topical sourced material I do not remove, ever.</p>
<p>In contrast, Funnypop12 edit-wars to remove <i>all</i> of your hard work by blanking the <i>entire section</i>, falsely claiming it was unsourced, but you're upset about one phrase, the meaning of which was entirely preserved (sans POV)? That's a bad reason to join mediation. <i>You yourself</i> uploaded a depiction of Muhammad! See <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>.</p>
<p>I guess the fact that I reverted Funnypop12's section blanking whenever I saw it (missed it that last time) counts for nothing. Were I to act like you're acting here, I would join Funnypop12 in blanking the section after the article is unprotected.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 04:03, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>You did the same thing on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>, jumping in to bring up completely unrelated issues against Karl Meier. That's disruptive, really.</p>
<p>If you had something specific about contemporary Western negative conceptions of Muhammad, I suppose we might add a sentence or two (not longer, to avoid recentism.) Usually it's critics who add things like that, though, and I'd be reluctant to re-add the "Criticisms" section, because they are magnets for POV-pushing. Just saying "Westerners are prejudiced against Muhammad," however, isn't informative, and certainly isn't neutral.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 04:34, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For a good laugh, head on over to <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a> where someone has added a sourced but very marginal claim that "Allah" stands for "Arm, Leg, Leg, Arm, Head" - should we remove it? It's sourced and topical, but marginal, and mainly serves to make the sect in question look ridiculous.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 05:20, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's funny but it should be kept.</dd>
<dd>Re: Contemporary views of Muhammad, Watt says: "Since that time much has been achieved, especially durin the last two centuries, but <b>many</b> of the old prejudices linge on.", he doesn't say "some", he says "many". Proabivouac, it is not so hard to show that.</dd>
<dd>The passage I referenced from the Cambridge History of Islam, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521291356&amp;id=j15MBH-FIwkC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;ots=_YTVQYSlGt&amp;dq=grave+difficulties+in+attaining+Cambridge&amp;sig=WkKxcT2NeGdwLkiHmYv_k80iFl8" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521291356&amp;id=j15MBH-FIwkC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;ots=_YTVQYSlGt&amp;dq=grave+difficulties+in+attaining+Cambridge&amp;sig=WkKxcT2NeGdwLkiHmYv_k80iFl8" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>] is (I've seen) quoted in two other scholarly works. I don't think that it is not citable.</dd>
<dd>ALSO, this might be aside but please compare the story of addition of the unfactual POV sentence: "<i>Contemporary scholars believe</i> that Muhammad moved to attack Khaybar in order to raise his prestige among his followers, as well as to capture booty to sustain subsequent conquests." with the story of "sincerety of Muhammad".--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 07:08, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>ta-marbuta (ة) is not pronounced unless the word is succeeded by another. on its own, it is pronounced and written: <i>salāh</i>. when it has something following it, like in <i>salāt al-janāzah</i>, then the ta is pronounced. i think in persian and other derivative languages they say "salat" anyway, but the most appropriate rendering is probably the former. same with <i>zakāh</i>. thanks. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 02:07, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
