<p>Roberts entered the school at approximately 9:51 a.m. EDT with a <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shotgun.html" title="Shotgun">shotgun</a>, a <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handgun.html" title="Handgun">handgun</a>, wires, chains, nails, and flexible plastic ties which he used to bind the arms and legs of the <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hostages.html" title="Hostages">hostages</a>, and several stout wooden boards which he used to <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barricade.html" title="Barricade">barricade</a> himself inside.<sup id="_ref-BBC_Oct22006_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC_Oct22006" title="">[7]</a></sup> Police found a length of two-by-six wooden board with ten pairs of metal eyehooks, presumably to secure the ten hostages. Provisions for an extended overnight stay, such as candles, toilet tissue, and a change of clothes were found at the scene. Two tubes of sexual lubricant were also later discovered at the scene, and Roberts indicated to his wife over the phone that he had dreams about molesting children, but police have found no signs that any <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_sexual_abuse.html" title="Child sexual abuse">molestation</a> occurred<sup id="_ref-cnn_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-cnn" title="">[5]</a></sup>. He ordered the hostages to line up against the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chalkboard.html" title="Chalkboard">chalkboard</a>, and sent away from the classroom a pregnant woman, three parents with infants and all fifteen male students. One female student escaped: nine-year-old Emma Fisher (whose two older sisters stayed inside).<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[8]</a></sup> The nine-year old, who had just started to learn English, left with the male students because she did not understand the gunman's orders. She had been sitting beside her brother and followed him out when he left. The gunman, a father of three children (two boys and a girl), remained inside the school house with the remaining ten female students. The school teacher, Emma Mae Zook,<sup id="_ref-lancasteronline_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-lancasteronline" title="">[9]</a></sup> contacted the police upon escaping at approximately 10:36 a.m.<sup id="_ref-BBC_Oct22006_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC_Oct22006" title="">[7]</a></sup> The first police officers arrived approximately nine minutes later and attempted to communicate with Roberts via the <a href="../../../p/a/_/PA_system_367a.html" title="PA system">PA system</a> in their <a href="../../../p/o/l/Police_car.html" title="Police car">cruisers</a>.<sup id="_ref-BBC_Oct22006_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-BBC_Oct22006" title="">[7]</a></sup> The 911 call transcript shows Roberts ordered the police that if they didn't pull back within two seconds, the children would be dead and he began firing when they did not comply.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>Police broke in through the windows when shots were heard.<sup id="_ref-AP_100206_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-AP_100206" title="">[2]</a></sup> The gunman killed five girls and himself. The oldest girl, 13-year-old Marian Fisher, appealed to Roberts to shoot her first, in an effort to spare the younger girls, according to her younger sister who survived. The younger sister, Barbie, appealed to him to shoot her next. She received 9mm bullet wounds in the hand, leg, and shoulder.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[11]</a></sup> Three died at the scene and two more died early the next morning, with five more girls left in critical condition.

<p>Roberts was last seen by his wife at 8:45 a.m. when they walked their children to the bus stop before leaving. When his wife returned home at 11:00 a.m., she discovered four suicide notes — one addressed to his wife, and one to each of his children. Roberts reportedly contacted his wife while still in the schoolhouse and stated that he had molested two young female relatives (between the ages of 3 and 5) twenty years ago, and had been daydreaming about molesting again. One note Roberts left indicated his despondency over his daughter who died shortly (roughly 20 minutes) after birth nine years earlier, and cryptically stated that he had "been having dreams for the past couple of years about doing what he did 20 years ago and he has dreams of doing them again", according to <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania_State_Police_6186.html" title="Pennsylvania State Police">State Police</a> Commissioner <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeffrey_B._Miller_5813.html" title="Jeffrey B.

<p>According to the Washington Post, Police and coroner accounts of the children's wounds differed dramatically. Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Jeffrey Miller said Roberts shot his victims in the head at close range, with 17 or 18 shots fired in all, including the one he used to take his own life as police stormed into the school through the windows. But Janice Ballenger, deputy coroner in Lancaster County, Pa., told The Washington Post in an interview that she counted at least two dozen bullet wounds in one child alone before asking a colleague to continue for her.</p>
<p>Inside the school, Ballenger said, "there was not one desk, not one chair, in the whole schoolroom that was not splattered with either blood or glass. There were bullet holes everywhere, everywhere." When questioned, a state police spokeswoman said that she could not immediately explain the discrepancy.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[19]</a></sup></p>

<p>CNN reported a grandfather of one of the murdered Amish girls said of the killer on the day of the murder: "We must not think evil of this man."</p>
<p>Jack Meyer, a member of the <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brethren.html" title="Brethren">Brethren</a> community living near the Amish in Lancaster County, explained: "I don't think there's anybody here that wants to do anything but <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forgiveness.html" title="Forgiveness">forgive</a> and not only reach out to those who have suffered a loss in that way but to reach out to the family of the man who committed these acts," he told CNN.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[30]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Amish have reached out to Roberts' family. Dwight Lefever, a Roberts family spokesman said an Amish neighbor comforted the Roberts family hours after the shooting and extended forgiveness to them.</p>
<p>An article in a Canadian newspaper the <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Post_afd6.html" title="National Post">National Post</a></i> stated that the Amish have set up a charitable fund for the family of the shooter.</p>
<p>The Amish do not normally accept charity, but due to the extreme nature of the tragedy, donations were being accepted. Richie Lauer, director of the Anabaptist Foundation, said the Amish community, whose religious beliefs prohibit them from having health insurance, will likely use the donations to help pay the medical costs of the hospitalized children.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[31]</a></sup></p>
