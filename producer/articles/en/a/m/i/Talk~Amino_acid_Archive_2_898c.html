<p>Some of the data in the two tables are same. I feel it is better to merge both and present a unified table listing all the properties.

<p>It looks like the arginine picture here and in the arginine article has an extra hydrogen atom. Shouldn't the imine group be =NH rather than =NH2&#160;?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The =NH2 would be correct if the protonated form (which will predominate at neutral pH) were intended, but in this case there should be a "+" to indicate the positive charge. It looks like all of the sidechains (other than this ambiguous, wrong one) are shown un-ionized, but the alpha-amino and alpha-carboxyl groups are shown ionized, which strikes me as a strange decision. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosh_Cherry_99df.html" title="User:Josh Cherry">Josh Cherry</a> 00:53, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If you guys don't mind, I'm going to redraw all these in ISIS/Draw and regularize this. I'm going to draw them as they are ionized at pH 7.0, in the style of the chart on p. 79 of Lehninger. Also, I'd like to actually make <i>two</i> forms of each image; one with a size corresponding to the current one (so it sits well in the infoboxes for individual amino acids) and one with a standard image size, so we don't have that slightly annoying "thumbnailed" look in some of the the amino acids in the chart. That way, they should all come out at the same size. Comments? John Sheu 02:12, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cysteine - hydrophobic</span></h2>
<p>The hydrophobic nature of Cys_SH seems to conflict with the polarized nature of the sulfhydryl group. However, we need to consider the fact that the sulfhydryl group is inactive toward water molecules.</p>
<p>According to:</p>

<dd>The majority of cys residues are NOT in disulfide bridges. Disulphide bridges (as a rule of thumb) will only form in oxidising environments, such as in <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extracellular.html" title="Extracellular">extracellular</a> and pericellular environments. To find a disulphide bridge in a intracellular protein is rare (although not unheard of). In protein structures, Cys residues can co-ordinate metal ions (eg Zinc-finger proteins) and are negatively charged at physiological pH. <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBassophile_9c30.html" title="User:Bassophile">Bassophile</a> 13:22, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Whether or not a cysteine residue is ionised depends on its pKa. When the cysteine is protonated it is hydrophobic, when it is in the thiolate form, it is hydrophillic. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimVickers_d98e.html" title="User:TimVickers">TimVickers</a> 19:46, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Some of these values surprise me, to say the least. I have no problems with the small variations in quoted values of the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dissociation_constant.html" title="Dissociation constant">dissociation constants</a>, but other sources (eg <a href="http://www.sigmaaldrich.com" class="external text" title="http://www.sigmaaldrich.com" rel="nofollow">Sigma-Aldrich</a>) give quite different values for melting points (often with decomposition). As for solubility, 162 g <a href="../../../p/r/o/Proline.html" title="Proline">proline</a> soluble in 100 mL water? Only 50 mg <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyrosine.html" title="Tyrosine">tyrosine</a> soluble in 100 mL water? Again, Sigma-Aldrich quotes different values for some amino acids.</p>
<p>Does anyone hvae comments or suggestions as to which data we should use for amino acid articles? Should we include a review of published data, as is done for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Elements_a2c2.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Elements">chemical element articles</a>? <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> 12:53, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>For the most part, the dissociation constants and pI's are the same as the ones I have in a table I found from a Lehninger book, except for tiny differences like alanine's pI is in my table 6.01 as opposed to 6.00, but like you said this isnt much of a problem. The melting points to have a siginificant difference with sources I have found (with help from walkerma), for example on chemfinder.com it says alanine's m.p is 314.5 - 316.5 C which is quite far off the 297 in the table you provided. Also in my own data book it says glycine decomposes at 262 C. I also have found some data for densities, glycine 1.607 g&#160;cm<sup>−3</sup>. Densities are proving to be the hardest to find the more I search.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think the dissocitaion values in the above table we should accept for use in the articles since they are the same across multiple sources. As for the other data, the differences are so large, maybe we should include a review of published data, although in some cases there isn't much published data. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorb_c31b.html" title="User:Borb">Borb</a> 13:56, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The different routes which organisms use to make amino acids are too numerous to include here. I am trying to put them into individual amino acid articles, although I've not got very far on it. Many articles have a "Biosynthesis" link in the External links section which gives more details until such time as someone gets round to putting the information in the actual articles. <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> 20:49, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">I have a question...</span></h2>
<p>Have amino acids been observed to form spontaneously in nature? Or have all the "primordial soup" experiments been caused through human experimentation? If they have been observed, where can I find this information?</p>
<p>As far as I know, spontaneous formation has only been observed when initiated by human experimentation. The conditions on most of the planet today would probably prohibit the chemical reactions necessary from occuring. The early earth had very different conditions though, which the experiments try to replicate as accurately as possible.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Amino Acid Definition</span></h2>
<p>An ammino isn't any molecule with both carboxilic acid and amine functional groups as the first paragraph implies they both need to be on the same carbon as in the general formualar.</p>
<p>The amino acid and carboxylate functionalities can't be on the same carbon, can they? I think the alpha amino acid terminology refers to a molecule where the amine is on the alpha-carbon to the carbonyl. If they were both on the same carbon you would have COOH-C-NH3 which leaves no place for the functional group. Can somebody clarify this for me?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Both the carboxylic acid and the amino group are indeed attached to the same carbon, which is referred to as the alpha-carbon. Since carbon is tetravalent (it can form 4 bonds) the side chain and a hydrogen are also attached to it. --<a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdgar181_7e9b.html" title="User:Edgar181">Ed</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/g/User_talk%7EEdgar181_fd91.html" title="User talk:Edgar181">Edgar181</a>) 18:52, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, free glycine is soluble in water, but when it forms part of a <a href="../../../p/e/p/Peptide.html" title="Peptide">peptide</a> chain, the polar portions are used for bonding and only the hydrogens are left exposed to water: as such, it does nothing to increase the water-affinity of the protein (unlike, say, <a href="../../../g/l/u/Glutamic_acid.html" title="Glutamic acid">glutamic acid</a> where a free -COOH group is left dangling off the peptide backbone). <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> 12:33, 20 October 2005 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">the table</span></h2>
<p>from the article: The three-letter symbol Asx or one-letter symbol B means the amino acid is either <b>asparagine</b>??? or aspartic acid, whereas Glx or Z means either glutamic acid or glutamine.</p>
<p>Isnt it Asn. And do these B/Z refer to the acid form (i.e. not the ion), if so, then this should be made clear in the article. But in proteins they will ionize or not depending on pH, so what's the actual point? (again, explain in the article please).</p>
<p>ALSO, why is there so much information in the table? Shouldn't there just be links to the individual articles (but it would be replicated anyway), and perhaps reorganize the diagrams of the strucutre? Does anyone agree with me?</p>
<dl>
<dd>The B/Z degeneracy codes date back to the earlier days of protein analysis. If you turn a protein into amino acids by cleaving peptide bonds, you lose the Asn/Asp and Gln/Glu distinction because the peptide bond in the sidechain gets converted to a carboxylic acid (it's a peptide too). Thus, when you report the amino acid composition, you can't tell how much of the Asp was originally Asn, so you just report the amount of 'Asx' in the protein. They were also useful in early crystallography, because at low resolution, it is hard to tell the oxygen electron density from the nitrogen. Modern techniques have mostly eliminated the need for those degeneracy codes. -- 20:22, 21 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>20 is the number of proteinogenic amino acids generally given. Post-translational modifications occur after translation so the amino acids modified in this way arguably aren't amino acids anymore (they have no amino or carboxylic acid function), they're really amino acid residues. It might be more correct to say there are 20 proteinogenic amino acids (in most organisms), but considerable more when their modified residues are considered.</p>

<dd>There are 20 common amino acids and 22 naturally genetically encoded amino acids (counting selenocysteine and pyrrolysine) so yes you are right.

<p>Personally, I feel that a better understanding of amino acids can be reached if they are presented in their zwitterionic forms, as the vast majority of conditions under which they exist has the dominant form being the zwitterion. Some textbooks note that this is true under physiologcal conditions, but this may lead readers to think that they are uncharged outside of a living organism, when in fact, even when extracted, amino acids exist as a salt.
