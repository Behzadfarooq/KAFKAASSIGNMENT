<h2><span class="mw-headline">Dilip rajeev just violated the 3RR rule</span></h2>
<p>Dilip rajeev who has been editing on the Falun Gong article just violated the 3RR rule again. His 4th revert is at this time 19:47, 3 June 2006. If you are serious about enforcing the 3RR rule, you need to block him for 24 hours. Dilip has been warned many times and his recent edit was again done without a consensus. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Luo_b505.html" title="User:Samuel Luo">Samuel Luo</a> 20:42, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He has been blocked for 12 hours. I would, however, like to point out that both you and <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomananda_51fe.html" title="User:Tomananda">User:Tomananda</a> are already (if I counted correctly) at 3 reverts. Just because he <i>technically</i> violated the policy, it does not mean that your actions are any less destructive or obnoxious. Refrain from edit warring immediately, and try discussing changes <i>before</i> implementing or reverting. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 20:53, 3 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for continuing to keep an eye on this page. I decided to go out and have a life today and was afraid this might happen.

<dd>Sorry it took so long; he had some puppet who kept removing the name from AIV, and finding log vandalism is a bit harder than standard edit vandalism. He's actually now been indef blocked as he's the same user as another obnoxious vandal by a similar name--I'm going to go post on AN/I to see if anyone has had similar problems with Stepp-Wolf vandals. Anyway, sorry it took so long, but I'm gladly we got him stopped for now. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 02:18, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ami:</p>
<p>You unfroze the Falun Gong page yesterday and an editor named Dilip Rajeev immediately started a series of edits, exceeding his 3RR limit. I blocked his reverts and exceeded my 3RR limit as well. You issued a warning to both Dilip and I. In response, I stopped doing all reverts or deletions, but if you check the history on the page you will see Dilip resumed several hours later. Check particularly his edit of 10:21 June in which he deleted an entire paragraph claiming it was unsourced. It is a pargraph we had discussed before and we had agreed not to discuss all source issues before making any deletions. If your words have any meaning at all, I ask that you block Dilip now. --<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomananda_51fe.html" title="User:Tomananda">Tomananda</a> 18:43, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, I agree that he is well in excess of three reverts in one day, but unfortunately I wasn't around when he did, and it's now been eleven hours. Blocking is a preventitive rather than punitive measure, and so if he's refrained from edit warring in the last eleven hours, I don't really see a need to block. I'll be watching though, and thanks for your note. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 21:11, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s>If you get the time and feel like it, could you do a revert count on the Falun Gong page again? I don't want anybody blocked, but a stern warning might be in order.&#160;:-) Samuel has one that I don't think should count, right after one of mine.

<p>When you mentioned RSS feed, it brought another question to mind. Do you want my current "in-progress" source code, where I'm working on a lot of cool dealios with precaching rollbacks and filters, or do you want the source code for v1.2.1? The new stuff is even messier and is potentially quite buggy (though the old features still work just fine), but I find it a lot more impressive than my old code.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rollback question</span></h2>
<p>Hi, I've pretty much gotten used to using VandalProof (impressive software if I say so myself!) But sometimes when I rollback articles, a message will pop up saying "The previous edit to this page was by the same user. Do you want to view all edits made by this user before rolling back?" Then you either have to click "Yes" or "No". I'm not sure what to do when this happens. Can you help me out? Thanks! --<a href="../../../t/u/s/User%7ETuspm_0ac8.html" title="User:Tuspm">Tuspm</a> 23:29, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>If you click "yes" it will load the diff between the last edit made by the current user and the last edit made by the previous user. If you click "no" it will simply revert one edit. It's probably best to review all edits by the on-top user as there may well be more vandalism by that user that you didn't notice in the current diff. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 03:31, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>so why are people constantly vandalising our article/page? we are new to wikipedia but we are entitled to post one page informing the public of our legally registered and fully traceable UK company. We have no desire to take action but people who vandalise our page by directing it to a competitor business against whom we have a court order protecting us are in breech of that court order so should refrain from their actions. <b>please lets stop before this gets out of hand</b> politakis</p>
<dl>
<dd>You can consider this your <b>final warning</b>. If you again threaten myself or any other contributor with legal action, you will be <b>indefinitely blocked</b> from editing per Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/l/t/WP%7ENLT_0807.html" title="WP:NLT">policy on legal threats</a>. As for EasyPizza, the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_EasyPizza_82bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/EasyPizza">AfD discussion</a> allowed the article to remain on Wikipedia provided the article be completely rewritten to conform to Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point-of-view policy</a>. Please bear in mind that Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a vehicle for advertising</a>, and the editors you refer to as having vandlized "your" article have quite to the contrary taken an article that began an advertisement and converted it into an <i>encyclopedia article</i> that is <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">unbiased</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, and <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">well-sourced</a>. In any case, you have already been blocked for violating <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a> on that article, and your first action after the block expired was to revert the article back to an advertisement yet again. Stop reverting <i>immediately</i>; your actions are highly counterproductive and disruptive. Instead consider using the talk page to discuss why you disagree with the changes being made to the article, and the same goes for the proposed merger--repeatedly reverting the article will get you no where; you <i>have</i> to discuss the article with its other contributors if you would like to see any of your changes implemented. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 07:13, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>Gah, you got any recommendations on this one? I've been tracing this since its AfD, which confused me due to another company (now at EasyPizza (easyGroup)) having a bunch of results on google, but none on this one in particular that I could find worthwhile(besides forum posts). Helped end the AfD by withdrawl to try to salvage the page to be about a corp. that seemed to fit WP:CORP. <a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowercase_608d.html" title="User:Lowercase">lowercase</a> is pretty much in the sample pickle as he withdrew the AfD for it to try to fix it. I'm now 'involved' through the subject of lots of contact with the first author of the page. Though now that the page can't as easily be confused with an article about this company, is it even right for me relist it on AfD? <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 01:06, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This whole situation is an absolute mess. I'm trying to sort out everything that's going on with it--this article EasyPizza (easyGroup) was cpmvd from the EasyPizza article, and I'm trying to calm down my obsessive-compulsive urge to merge the histories as I think it's relevant to keep the histories intact locally. The user also forked the article at Easypizza, but this was quickly fixed by <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">User:RHaworth</a>--I've now got all three watchlisted and am monitoring the user's contribs quite closely. I would personally recommend that you wait and see how the proposed merger from EasyPizza (easyGroup) into <a href="../../../e/a/s/EasyGroup_e8d6.html" title="EasyGroup">EasyGroup</a> goes, as I think the previous AfD demonstrated that the community quite strongly believed the article on the chain to be nothing more than, as lowercase stated, an SEO article that is unverifiable and non-notable. (God, am I sick of dealing with users whose only concerns are SEO.) However, I have the feeling that regardless of any overwhelming consensus, Politakis will consider his unbased reversions of any article until he gets his way. I'm not sure that an AfD on the matter would really accomplish anything, as the consensus has been clear since the very start--it's only Politarkis who stands adamently opposed. Lowercase suggested going through dispute resolution, namely mediation, and I think that may well be the best approach--that or a user RfC. In any case, I'm monitoring Politarkis quite closely as I certainly don't believe he is done with his disruption, and I will do my best to prevent any future forking of the article. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 01:53, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Wikipedia rule question</span></h2>
<p>Hey, how's it going? Anyway, there's this one user that I ran into: <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAcethebunny_5935.html" title="User:Acethebunny">Acethebunny</a>. On his talk page, he recently got a vandalism warning from Tawkerbot2 because he vandalised <a href="../../../m/y/s/MySpace_7190.html" title="MySpace">MySpace</a> by writing "Myspace.com sucks" or something like that. He keeps removing the warning even though he just got it like 2 days ago. I put it back once, but I don't want to get into a revert war. So I guess my question is this: Is it actually against Wikipedia rules to delete vandalism warnings from a talk page? If it isn't, I think someone should <i>definitely</i> propose it. It makes it a ton easier for me to be able to go to someone's talk page and see what sort of trouble they've gotten into in the past.

<dd>Hi Daniel, and thanks for your timely response. I was able to log on after following your advice. While IE cookie protection was only <i>medium</i>, I selected the minimum. I believe that the problem may have been that I wasn't "remembered" in login though - perhaps that should be noted on the instructions page.

<p>Thank you very much for protecting the page <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babur.html" title="Babur">Babur</a>. I just wanted to report that there is currently a mistake in the article. Certain parts of the following paragraph:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hence Babur, though nominally a Mongol (or Mughal in Persian), drew much of his support from the Turkic and Iranian peoples of Central Asia, and his army was diverse in its ethnic makeup, including <u>Persians (Tajiks or Sarts, as they were called by Babur)</u>[2], Pashtuns, and Arabs as well as Barlas and Chaghatayid Turco-Mongols from Central Asia [3]. Babur's army also included Kizilbash fighters, a militant religious order of Shia Sufis from Persia who later became one of the most influential groups in the Mughal court.</li>
</ul>
<p>... were lost in the edit-war, due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Babur&amp;diff=57378254&amp;oldid=57377857" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Babur&amp;diff=57378254&amp;oldid=57377857" rel="nofollow">this</a> edit of <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnstevens5_b4da.html" title="User:Johnstevens5">User:Johnstevens5</a>. Right now, the paragraph goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hence Babur drew much of his support from the Turkic and to a lesser degree Iranian peoples of Central Asia, and his army was diverse in its ethnic makeup, <u>including Tajiks or Sarts, as they were called by Babur)</u>[4], Pashtuns, and Arabs as well as Barlas and Chaghatayid Turco-Mongols from Central Asia [5]. Babur's army also included Kizilbash fighters, a militant religious order of Shia Sufis from Persia who later became one of the most influential groups in the Mughal court.</li>
</ul>
<p>... containing stylistic and spelling mistakes. So, this is not a question of contents, but one of spelling mistakes and "lost words". Please correct the paragraph by restoring the original version (of <a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikandarji_ae16.html" title="User:Sikandarji">User:Sikandarji</a> who is an academic at <a href="../../../o/x/f/Oxford_University_9d97.html" title="Oxford University">Oxford University</a>).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Zarqawi image</span></h2>
<p>No, they're pretty clearly the same image. If you look carefully, one of them has just made a goof and flipped it. The thing is, we have to remember that <i>neither</i> the AP nor the FBI produced this image, nor own the copyright to it (it's probably from some Jordanian source). Just because it's on the FBI website doesn't make it a work of the U.S. federal government (and hence PD); indeed unless some wacky conspiracy has hidden Zarqawi's time in FBI custody there is absolutely no chance this photo could have been taken by a U.S. federal government employee.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 11:09, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, apparently there is some dispute about the use of the word--I'd rather see changes other than minimal copyediting not be implemented until the article is unprotected. I did not revert because I disagreed with you about the word, but rather because I disagreed with making disputed changes to the article while it is protected. Although I do agree that there seems to be consensus on the matter, I'd much rather you wait for it to be unprotected to implement, otherwise I think it could easily be seen as admins excercising their "powers" to win the dispute. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 23:40, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
