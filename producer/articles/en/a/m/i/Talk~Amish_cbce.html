<p><i>one visible sign of the care Amish provide for the elderly are the smaller Grossvatihaus ("grandfather house") often built near the main dwelling.</i></p>
<p>The German word would be „Großvaterhaus“; the plural, as would be appropriate in this context, „Großvaterhäuser.“ The only Google hits for "Grossvatihaus" are from copies of this text, while there are thirty nine separate results for großvaterhaus, in German. The above is probably wrong. 195.170.118.11 16:01, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Pennsylvania Dutch term, in Amish varieties of Pennsylvania Dutch, is "Daadihaus" or "Grossdaadihaus" (which if you want to argue about spelling, could be probably found spelled as "grossdawdy haus" or "Dawdy Haus", etc.). The only High German terms that should be used are religious terms from the Bible perhaps, otherwise I think it is wise stick to Amish Pennsylvania Dutch terms for words like "Daadihaus" and "rumschpringe" etc. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStettlerj_0eda.html" title="User:Stettlerj">Stettlerj</a> 00:14, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Some comments on the article. Amish is said to be an ethnic as well as a religious group. Does this mean that if my grandparents are Amish that I am Amish? I have heard Amish used in this sense in one scholarly work, but if we are going to use this definition the article needs changed and it needs to talk about the Mennonite churches which descend from the Amish, which it does not. Second, the term Amish when used in this article, seems to exclude for the most part the Beachy Amish Mennonites, which is alright as long as it is consistant. However, it is not, For example, population figures given do not include the Beachy Amish, yet the phrase given in the same paragraph that says that there are Amish in 47 states inlcudes the Beachy Amish. Suddenly the article changes what it means by Amish to include the Beachy Amish (that is the only way to get this figure), but the population figure given prior does not include the Beachy Amish. So there should be consistancy, or explanations of what the figures include or do not include. About the population figures... what are the sources for these figures (I don't believe both figures are from 1990, I am in fact pretty sure the second figure given is much more recent) and why would we quote a figure from 16 years ago anyway when the Amish population doubles every 21 years or so. There are population estimates given by Kraybill that are very recent (this is where the 228 000 figure probably comes from). The first paragraph states that all Amish speak Pennsylvania German at home (a statement refuted in the language section - the "Swiss Amish" don't speak Pennsylvania German at home). Finally, "rumschpringe" does not translate as "jumping around" in Pennsylvania Dutch, that would be "rumtschumpe" and why is the Standard German "herumspringen" given, because it gives the impression that somehow "rumspringa" comes from "herumspringen" which it does not, although they are cognates. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStettlerj_0eda.html" title="User:Stettlerj">Stettlerj</a> 19:40, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, the Amish are certainly an <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_group.html" title="Ethnic group">ethnic group</a>, in the sense that they "identify with each other, usually on the basis of a presumed common genealogy or ancestry" and "are also usually united by common cultural, behavioural, linguistic, or religious practices." However, other Mennonite groups descended from the Amish likely do not meet this definition, since they have different "cultural, behavioural, linguistic, or religious practices," and perhaps have married outside the community and therefore have reduced "common genealogy or ancestry." Right now the article mostly is about the Old Order groups, but I tried to rewrite the intro to emphasize their diversity. Please feel free to make the other changes you suggest. Perhaps it would also be nice to throw in a paragraph more specifically describing the variety of different fellowships.

<p>"their pacifism and social conscience make them attractive to one major party, and their generally conservative outlook to another." This statement makes it seem as though only the followers of one of the two major political parties have social conscience and the followers of the other do not.</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the course of some stylistic patching, I adjusted this. It's one thing to be NPOV, another to pretend that pacifism is equally likely to be found in both national parties. I don't think NPOV requires us to pretend that "social conscience" is an equally winning slogan for Dems &amp; Reps, any more than "law and order" and "national security" would be, even though just about anybody in any party thinks all those phrases represent good things. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidOaks_7492.html" title="User:DavidOaks">DavidOaks</a> 12:55, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why are these statements under the heading Dress: "The Amish are noted for the quality of their quilts and for their farming efficiency. Some Amish have enthusiastically adopted genetically engineered crops for their efficiency."</p>
<p>I'm not very educated about the Amish way of life, but it strikes me as extremely confusing to read about them accepting the use of GM (oh, or is it GE, genetically engineered) seeds for farming. I do believe that this deserves a very good explanation, reference, or both. Oh well, there was a mention of recent vandalism on history. Maybe it's just that? 62.220.237.68 21:46, 15 December 2005 (UTC) -was logged out when I wrote the previous, anon comment.

<li>In Europe, GM is often seen as technology that is perhaps "too advanced" or "gone too far". Most people in here would recognize it as quite advanced and a recent invention, at least. With the supposed Amish aversion for technology, it would seem natural for them to shun the use of GM crops as well. I do understand that the perceived technological threat of GM food is not shared by Americans, but I would have expected it from the Amish. Just my two cents. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESanttus_5fb8.html" title="User:Santtus">Santtus</a> 23:17, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

I think the reason is, first of all, in North America, GM foods are not seen so negatively in general as they are in Europe. Also, most Amish accept some modern inventions such as solar power, rollerblades, sometimes even cell-phones, etc. It is not technology per se that is seen negatively. I guess that is the best explanation. There would surely be some Amish who would refuse or hesitate to grow GM crops, but there are no church rules against it in any congregation as far as I know. I don't know if the ultra-traditional Amish groups (like the <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swartzendruber_Amish_5e20.html" title="Swartzendruber Amish">Swartzendruber Amish</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Troyer_Amish_1220.html" title="Troyer Amish">Troyer Amish</a> and the White-top Amish) grow GM or not, but I would be interested to find out. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStettlerj_0eda.html" title="User:Stettlerj">Stettlerj</a> 02:14, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>In short, <i>the</i> reason that some Amish grow GM crops is that there are no church rules against it. Unless an Amish congregation and Bishop is prepared to shun someone who uses GM crops then it will be up to individual choice. I think at best some Amish may discourage its use, but I don't think the Amish will ever make it a test of membership. The Amish will follow their Bishop and community rules, and, maybe it is a small exageration but, if a given bishop said tomorrow "cars are ok" the next day half the families would switch to a different congregation, and the other half would buy a car tomorrow. In fact this has happened. (if you drive in certain amish communities, look who'se passing you on the freeway, he just might be an Amishman)<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStettlerj_0eda.html" title="User:Stettlerj">Stettlerj</a> 02:33, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Being a former Amish, I get very perturbed on some "fact" that I hear from time to time regarding the Amish. Even though I choose to abandon the community, I still have the utmost respect. Regarding the issue with a 16-year old being of age was not true in my community. Of age meant 21+ years-of-age, not 16.</p>
<p>Also, I keep hearing (from outsiders of course) about Amish teenagers being allowed to choose their lifestyle. That is almost an outrage. Amish beliefs forbid someone to choose, scripture says that one must remain in what they were taught - thus, born amish must remain amish. I would like to know where this originated from. What Amish community allows their children to choose the "outside", the modern lifestyle??? Yes, they may "choose" their lifestyle, but they certainly will then be shunned/banned or otherwise considered to have lost grace with God and will NOT enter the Kingdom of God for they live in great sin. Do not confuse allow with inability to control.</p>
<p>And by the way, the movie Witness has many, many flaws. It cannot be used as educational film.</p>
<p>If no one will provide me with a credible source to the above "choose your own lifestyle" claim, I will delete it.</p>
<hr />
<p>The place I saw about this period of going out into the "English" world and choosing whether or not to return was in the documentary <i>The Devil's Playground</i>. It referred to this time as "rumspringa" and followed the lives of a variety of Pennsylvania and Ohio Amish teenagers.</p>
<hr />
<p>Someone needs to fix up how clearly two people have written this page and one of them has copied a lot of stuff of the others. In 'Status' there is repetition of the Dutch/Deutsch comment, and also later a repetition of the Devil's Playground comment.</p>

<hr />
<p>As another person of Amish ethnic heritage I have to disagree withe first comments on lack of choice. As mentioned several times in the article different Amish communities choose different things. For example, my conservative relatives belong to Ontario Amish churches affiliated with the Beachy Amish groups in the United States. The Beachy Amish, like any other congregation of any other Christian denomination, expect certain agreements on issues from their members, but unlike the Old Order Amish or Old Order Mennonite groups the Beachy Amish do not favour strong application of the Meidung (the shunning) of those who transfer to a more liberal church or even different denomination.</p>
<p>My grandparents, when they were married, chose not to attend one of the two churches which their families did, but went to a near-by, more liberal Amish congregation, later to be followed by about half of their siblings. But nobody was ever shunned or banned or anything like that. Indeed, to this day we carry on a healthy tradition of yearly extended family reunions. Never once on meeting a more conservative relative in the streets or other non-family gatherings have they been embarrassed to chat for a bit. Clearly no shunning going on there. I would suggest that the tone of the initial comments, focusing as they do on lack of choice and shunning, as well as the use of the term "abandon", that the poster might have had some negative experiences with the Meidung in his or her community which are colouring his or her views. I am a man with long hair, both ears pierced with a hankering for electronic gadgetry and never once has a more conservative Amish relative or acquaintance made me feel that I am less Amish than they are.</p>
<p>I will, however, agree with the initial poster's comments about using movies as an educational source. Until a few years ago I had never heard of the term "rumspringa" before. Yes, unmarried young adult Amish are given a little more leniency, just like the surrounding society gives to early twenty-somethings, but nothing so extreme as to require specific term for it. When I asked my Grandmother about it, she referred to is a something some American Amish groups practiced but she wasn't too familiar with it. From my personal investigation it appears that the use of rumspringa correlates with how conservative the group is. The more conservative the community is, the more you have "Amish Tweenies Gone Wild" type of thing. Beachy Amish communities place less significance on the rumspringa, possibly due to their lack of insistence on the Meidung. When people know that they have a choice and will not be excommunicated from their community for differing opinions there is less of a chance of (extreme) rebellion.</p>
<p>Also, in the Amish communities of Ontario with which I am familiar, "coming of age" happens at 18, just like the surrounding Canadian society, though that phrase implies some major celebration which does not exist (except for perhaps a slightly bigger birthday party).</p>
<hr />
<p>My understanding of the rumspringa is that its use and extent varies, and that among some communities it has fallen out of use. I know of several people who went through it - and are now conservative Mennonite instead.</p>

If you think it is disrespectful to hate black people but someone doesn't that doesn't make them expempt from respect for a black person! Besides, you are forceing those Amish to break their own rules, they would be disgusted Christiandude32 00:56, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Christian, thanks for your opinion. I have not taken a photo of a baptized OOA personally that I can remember and I am not the one who put the pictures up. I am just stating an opinion, although your argument is valid. Anyway, I am not stating my opinion out of disrespect. Unfortunately it seems you imply I have been forcing Amish, among whom I have many cousins and relatives, to break their Ordnung. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStettlerj_0eda.html" title="User:Stettlerj">Stettlerj</a> 03:45, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>All I am trying to point out is that they would not appriecate their picture taken, we should accept their wishes, this is an article about them, we should make sure people realize that the Amish don't like thier pictures, they don't mind if it is their farm or something, but they don't want themselves in the photo.

<p>see <a href="../../../b/e/a/Talk%7EBeachy_Amish_f2f8.html" title="Talk:Beachy Amish">Talk:Beachy Amish</a> for my opinion about whether Beachy Amish are Amish or not. I can't understand why user 130... thinks they are not. Some Beachy Amish practices are much closer to Mennonite practices, sure, just like Old Order Mennonite practices are closer to Old Order Amish practices than they are to the Mennonite Church USA. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStettlerj_0eda.html" title="User:Stettlerj">User:Stettlerj</a></p>

<li>The Beachy Amish do not share Amish faith and practice. There are common elements among the Amish, and none of them exist throughout the Beachy Amish church. These include the use of homes for worship, Pennsylvania Dutch for language, the ban (and not just shunning), separated seating, uncut beards, shunning of electricity and automobiles, and more.</li>

<li>Although I would definitely consider the Beachy Amish to be Amish (perhaps in Lancaster there is a tendancy to keep the Amish identity for tourist reasons! I hope not), the Beachy Amish are definitely not what most have in mind when they think of Amish. However, I will admit, although I have Beachy Amish Freindschaft, I am not up to date on their opinions vis a vis the word "Amish" to describe themselves. Now I am interested to learn more.

<p>health care in canada is free, why were donations collected for the child?</p>
<p>Good point. It is probably just a fabrication. There is a small chance that it is not false. There is a chance that the Amish refuse to accept OHIP for example, and insist on paying themselves, but I dont think the Amish in Ontario refuse OHIP. Many Amish in Canada were in fact born in the USA, but then again, this child came from an Amish community that has been in Canada since the 1820's! <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStettlerj_0eda.html" title="User:Stettlerj">Stettlerj</a> 00:06, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>"The Amish are a tight-knit religious group, descending predominantly from Swiss German immigrants". The Sweiss German immigrants in where? The Swiss Germans in Austria are amish? The introduction is extremely ambiguous, as it does not specify where these immigrants live, or what country/continent/group of countries are we talking about. Personally, I do not believe that there are Amishes in North Italy, where there are Swiss German immigrants.

<p>The Pennsylvania Dutch are descendants of the Amish immigration for religious freedom. It started with widow Barbara Yoder and her 9 children, featured the docking of the "Charming Nancy" in 1737 and was essentially over by 1770 because of a healed schism in the European religious community.</p>
<p>What tourists call "Pennsylvania Dutch" are religious adherents. What Wikipedia calls <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pennsylvania_Dutch_32c3.html" title="Pennsylvania Dutch">Pennsylvania Dutch</a> are descendants of those people, regardless of their religious practice.</p>
<p>The religious adherents are not called "Pennsylvania Dutch" except in Pennsylvania, and they tell you they aren't necessarily Amish, either. Just as the term "Pennsylvania Dutch" or "jew" is ambiguous, perhaps meaning an ethnic group, and sometimes meaning those who practice a faith, the term "amish" is ambiguous, sometimes meaning a group that calls itself amish, and sometimes meaning a group that adheres to the primary thrust of Amman's theology, that of leaning an unworldly (plain) lifestyle, under the discipline of apartness (shunning.)</p>
<p>The Old Order Amish of Allen County Indiana are considerably more plain than the Old Order Amish of Lancaster County Pennsylvania. The hoosiers don't have phones in their businesses, don't wear tennis shoes, use umbrellas to protect themselves in weather that reaches -20F each winter, as opposed to spiffy fiberglass enclosed buggies in a climate where it doesn't always reach 0F each year. The Old Order Mennonites of Lancaster County will insist that they aren't Amish, yet they are plainer than the Beachy Amish.</p>
<p>The Lancaster New Era and the Lancaster Intelligencer-Journal use the term "plain sects" to include both Amish, and other religious adherents who do not call themselves Amish.</p>
<p>When a short question requires a long answer, that's indicative of a problem. George Bernard Shaw observed "England and America are two countries divided by a common language", but really, we don't need England to do a number on us; we are quite capable of dividing ourselves into myriad pieces with our ambiguous language. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClairSamoht_1970.html" title="User:ClairSamoht">ClairSamoht</a> 23:15, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>tourists say Pennsylvania Dutch are the Old Order religious people... I agree largely with you. The Wikipedia article, however, does not say that all Pennsylvania Dutch are descendants of the Amish immigrants. I believe this would be mistaken. The Wikipedia article says that (or should say that) the Pennsylvania Dutch descend from not only Amish immigrants, but Mennonite, Lutheran, Schwenkfelder, Dunker, Moravian etc. immigrants as well. I will quote the famous Amish-born sociologist <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_A._Hostetler_577a.html" title="John A. Hostetler">John A. Hostetler</a>:</dd>

<dd><i>The emigration movement encompassed many people of every known faith in the region [Palatinate]. Most numerous were the Lutherans and Reformed, but there were Catholics, Schwenkfelders, and a variety of mystics, as well as groups of Mennonites and Amish. All these groups spoke the Palatinate dialect known today as Pennsylvania German or Pennsylvania Dutch (Hostetler, 1993:52).</i></dd>

<dd>If you want to be even more confused... the Amish in Allen County don't even speak Pennsylvania Dutch and many many descendants of Mennonite immigrants to North America are not Pennsylvania Dutch at all <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStettlerj_0eda.html" title="User:Stettlerj">Stettlerj</a>. 00:47, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Amish in Allen County don't call it "Penncylvania Dutch", not do they call themselves Pennsylvania Dutch, but they call themselves Amish and speak Amish in their homes. Last time I was in Bruggeman's lumber yard in Milan Center, there was a sign that said "rauchen sie Nicht". When I lived there, the post office once delivered to me a copy of <i>Die Blatt</i> meant for a neighbor. I think it's safe to say you're incorrect in your assertion that they don't speak the dialect of Palatine German which you call Pennsylvania Dutch. And I don't see why it would be confusing that the son of a Mennonite who immigrated from Belize to Honolulu in 1968 should not be considered Pennsylvania Dutch. It'd be confusing if he WAS! <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClairSamoht_1970.html" title="User:ClairSamoht">ClairSamoht</a> 01:34, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I live in Pennsylvania and have frequently been in Amish areas and around Amish people, although I have never personally spoken with one. I have heard from two different sources that there is a sort of "underground" practice within some Amish communities of allowing outsiders to impregnate their daughters to avoid inbreeding. During the act, most of the woman is covered by a sheet, including her face. And during the whole thing, the parents of the daughter remain in the room. Now, I know that most of you will think this is off-the-wall garbage. But I heard it from two indepent sources that know nothing of each other. So there is a definite rumor here in Pennsylvania that this takes place. Of course, it would violate the conservative beliefs of most Christians to do such a thing, so I have my doubts. I have not been able to verify this on the internet. I would be interested in any comments on this subject.</p>

It fits better in the 'malicious lie' category. The idea of being covered by a sheet is particularly odd; the Amish dress conservatively in public, but they are not prudes. Neither does the idea of parents having their daughters impregnated by outsiders pass the giggle test: there are virtually no babies born to unmarried Amish women.

<dd>Well, I checked on Snopes, and they don't have anything on the subject. I doubt they would waste their time researching this. ClairSamoht--I am a highly skeptical person myself. I agree with you that this is extremely unlikely, but I figured I'd see if anyone else could substantiate it, in the spirit of Wikipedia being about the unbiased truth. I heard it from two separate people, who don't know each other, living about 100 miles apart in Western PA. Both people knew people who claimed to have been involved with this. Very bizarre. What we would have here is two separate malicious lies, remarkably similar, which makes me wonder. But if noone else can verify it, I guess I'll dismiss it in my mind as a local urban legend.</dd>

<dd>I too checked Snopes, with the same result. I agree 100% with Claire that it's a malicious lie, but that doesn't prevent it from being an urban legend (Brunvand's books contain a number of tale-types and categories that would qualify as malicious lies; the "Lights Out" gang-initiation comes to mind). I googled key terms, and came up with two more independent versions of what I'm ready to call the "Amish stud service" legend. I think it fits many of the descriptors well -- it's foaf- (friend-of-a-friend)authenticated, it shows multiformity, it demonstrably rides the line of believability. Some folkorists would classify it as rumor rather than legend, because it's a generalized report rather than a specific narrative, but that's not a reliable divide. As for wasting time researching -- well, folklorists aren't much interested since the old historic-geographic days in whether something's accurate or not (I agree, that would be a waste of time). More regularly, there's a functionalist inquiry: why is this story told? What does it do for the people and groups who circulate it? I don't think that would be a waste of time at all (or at least, I have decided to waste some time in this way). Counterfactual stories (as this one almost certainly is) are interesting for that sort of study precisely because -- in the absence of factual warrant -- one can be sure that whatever reason people have for believing it is something psychological or sociological. Claire is right to zero in on the detail of the sheet -- it's strange, gratuitous, therefore probably meaningful, but the best appraoch is not to use it as an index of unlikeliness, but rather one of meaning. I'd want to collect more samples, with some context, before venturing a detailed interpretation, but it's pretty clear (to me) on the face of it that it comes out of ambivalence towards the alleged saintliness and purity of the the Amish, and the telling of the story is a kind of vicarious corruption (maybe rape is not too strong a word) of people whose moral superiority (claimed on their behalf rather than by them, of course) is experienced as a reproach. The story expresses a kind of Schadenfreude. I would think that the psychology of this narrative is identical with the motives behind the common misunderstanding/distortion of the "rumspringa," and the enthusiasm with which incidents of incest or abuse among the Amish are reported in a way they are not in the case of (oh, for example) Ukrainians. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamdavis_30e0.html" title="User:Adamdavis">Adamdavis</a> 15:18, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you for such an intelligent response. I agree. I live near Pittsburgh, but the stories that I have heard come from Northeastern Pennsylvania, which is a nice place to visit. I don't think I'll be collecting any further samples on this because I don't want to bring people down, if you know what I mean. I think that they're misguided, but there is a certain charm to their philosophy (maybe that's why I like "The Village"). I would think them a bunch of sickos if this were the truth, as would most other people, so I don't want to ask around about this because it would just spread the rumor further, causing more people to come to this site looking for answers, and eventually raising it to the level of a true Snopes caliber urban legend.</dd>

<p>I don't find the story particularly credible, but it does have the virtue of being verifiable, at least in principle. Scientists routinely take genetic samples from whole populations of, say, birds so as to determine the precise lines of descent. In fact, this is how we've discovered the popularity of cheating among birds we once thought to be strictly monogamous.</p>
<p>So, if we really, really wanted to -- and they let us -- we could find out exactly how true the story is. If we found people whose biological father is not their mother's husband, this would confirm the story. Even in cases where the father is dead, we could use close relatives to rule out the possibility that a non-Amish stud was used. While we were at it, we'd also be revealing some cases of marital infidelity and showing precisely how imbred some people are. Somehow, I don't see this ever happening.</p>
<p>As for the sex through a sheet thing, that's been done before, at least in terms of unverifiable stories. It's been claimed for orthodox Jews, who supposedly make use of a hole in the sheet. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlienus_3d38.html" title="User:Alienus">Alienus</a> 20:31, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>"If we found people whose biological father is not their mother's husband, this would confirm the story." That would prove that the child is a bastard. It wouldn't necessarily provide support for this story. The story doesn't lack credibility because the Amish are especially saintly; they aren't, and the Amish don't claim otherwise. It's the details - the unwed pregnancy, the sheet, the motivation of improving genetic matter - that provide a lack of voracity. If you made up a story about a guy, having been injured by a kicking horse, enlisting his brother to repeatedly impregnate his wife so his kids would look like him, it'd be far more credible. If you made up a story about an Amish construction worker being recruited by an English couple to sire a child, that's far more credible, too. I suspect both of those circumstances have probably happened. But the story as given just doesn't make sense. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClairSamoht_1970.html" title="User:ClairSamoht">ClairSamoht</a> 04:14, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>To be more precise, if we determined that someone's father is not anyone in the Amish community, that would prove that it was an outsider. Depending on the sort of genetic markers that turn up, we might also be able to rule out anyone from other communities with which they often interbreed. Again, this comes down to the details. Not that it matters, since they'd never allow such an experiment to be performed.</p>

<dd>I´m from Germany and have corrected some German words, especially the nouns which we write with capital letters. Gelassenheit ist the right orthography. It might happen that according to dialect influence and area in Germany syllables and even vocals got lost in everyday language usage like with the word for "to go" which is written "gehen" but oftentimes just said "gehn". I think the same can be said for English, p.g. for the word "literature" which I heard just spoken as "littridgere". Standard High German is stronger on rules, but often softer on pronunciation. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_87.122.47.136_66ec.html" title="Special:Contributions/87.122.47.136">87.122.47.136</a> (talk) .</small></dd>

<dd>There are many non-Amish who write "tits" and "vittles", not realizing that those are the proper pronunciations of "teats" and "victuals", so it's not surprising that in a community where reading is not highly valued, spelling might be equally slipshod. You're also going to get a lot of variation between different communities. In Holmes County, they refer to non-Amish as Yankees; in Allen County, the term is "English". The language seems to vary as much as whether buggies must be open, or whether canvas shoes are allowed. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClairSamoht_1970.html" title="User:ClairSamoht">ClairSamoht</a> - <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check_47bc.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check">Help make Wikipedia the most authoritative source of information in the world</a> 04:31, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article in my opinion has a few problems, which I will perhaps correct later. Some are quite minor like rumschpringe is never translated as "jumping around" (that would be "rumtschumpe"), but others are more major like no mention of the word "Ordnung" anywhere in the article, which is a term that is fundamental to understanding the Amish. The article talks about teenagers and rumschpringe and seems to suggest that teenagers or young adults who choose not to get baptised ever are eventually shunned, which is not the case. The article could perhaps talk somewhat about the government and the Amish, esp. post 9-11, since U.S. security measures and the Amish Ordnung often conflict. There is no mention of the Amish history in Europe. I also don't like the references that non-Mennonites don't understand the Amish. A lot of Mennonites don't understand themselves let alone the Amish, especially those who don't live beside the Amish, and of course some non-Mennonites would understand them just fine.

<li>The extensive practice of helping one's neighbors (barn raising, expanded)</li>
<li>Amish religious services (long services held every other week at a member's home, unusual singing, method of choosing ministers for a lifetime of service, etc. After all, Amishness is primarily based on religion.)</li>

<dd>No, the Amish may seem ascetic since they choose not to do certain things we find pleasurable, but that's not the same thing as avoiding pleasure, or trying to detach themselves from materiality. You should see how those folks EAT! And they really like sweets. Nor do they have any problems with sex (really big families), though they are extremely private about it. They are very social (amongst themselves, of course) and enjoy parties (of a type many non-Amish might find dull, but whatever floats yer boat, y'know?) There is no tradition of self-mortification, and no rhetoric of avoiding pleasure, though they do talk about avoiding worldliness, by which they mean, vanity, selfishness, display, competition for status. In sum: I have not taken it on myself to delete these mentions, but I recommend doing so. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamdavis_30e0.html" title="User:Adamdavis">Adamdavis</a></dd>

<p>"The Amish therefore likely pay more in taxes, especially real estate taxes, than it costs for the minimal government services they receive."</p>
<p>I dunno about that. It seems to me to be very difficult to quantify monetarily the various benefits that the United States government provides (life, liberty, property, to name a few).

<dd>In terms of federal taxes, however, the Amish don't have a free pass. They pay the same income tax, and excise taxes on tobacco and alcohol as everybody else. The vast majority of federal taxes go to support the defense department and veterans administration, which has not needed to defend the US civilian population from foreign invaders since the Mexican War; these days, we fight wars mostly to benefit people who drive cars and trucks. The second largest category of federal taxes go for welfare, health and education programs, which offer minimal benefits to the Amish. They don't benefit much from the National Weather Service without radio and TV, and they aren't allowed to drive on the Interstate Highway System.</dd>

<dd>Regarding U.S. Social Security taxes, people who joined the federal work force after 1983 <i>are</i> part of the Federal Employee Retirement System and <i>do</i> pay Social Security taxes. (Prior to that time, federal employees were in the Civil Service Retirement System and did not pay Social Security taxes. Some employees remained with CSRS after FERS came into being, but anyone who started with the federal government in the last 22 years has paid into Social Security.) Members of Congress have also paid into Social Security since 1983. Teachers in public schools <i>do</i> pay Social Security taxes (I have taught in three states); likewise librarians, police offices, and other non-federal public employees.

<dd>Although the Amish are ethnically homogeneous, they are not an ethnic group. Here is why, there are families where the parents are Amish, the grandparents were Amish, but 2 children are Amish, 3 children are Mennonite, 1 child is Quaker, and 2 are Baptists.

<dd>The difference between the two scenarios is in the second one the different ethnic groups in the family result from marriage with spouses from different ethnic groups (and atheist is not an ethnic group so I don't see really the point). A mother and a child can be 60 and 40 years old, they still form a nuclear family, besides, the definition of nuclear family is beside the point. An Irishman who joins the Amish is still Irish. An Amishman who becomes Catholic is no longer Amish. He may still be Pennsylvania Dutch, but he is no longer Amish, and he does not consider himself Amish, nor do the Amish consider him Amish, because Amish, to the Amish and to those who left, is a religion. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStettlerj_0eda.html" title="User:Stettlerj">Stettlerj</a> 20:25, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It may be helpful to consider the example (as was included in a previous edit of the article) of the duality of <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Jewish identity</a>, as both a religious and racial/ethnic group. Or consider the definition of <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_group.html" title="Ethnic group">ethnic group</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>An ethnic group is a human population whose members identify with each other, usually on the basis of a presumed common genealogy or ancestry (Smith 1986). Ethnic groups are also usually united by common cultural, behavioral, linguistic, or religious practices. In this sense, an ethnic group is also a cultural community.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>From an objective standpoint, an ethnic group is also an endogamous population, that is, members of an ethnic group procreate primarily with other members of their ethnic group, something which is measurable in terms of characteristic average genetic frequencies. These differences, however, usually do not approach the magnitude of racial difference in that the genetic differences within an ethnic group are greater than the difference between any two ethnic groups. The characteristic of endogamy is reinforced by proximity, cultural familiarity, and also social pressure (in extreme cases, by legal command) to procreate within the ethnic group.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It seems to me that the Amish easily meet these criteria. In one of Hostetler's books he refers to the Amish as an ethnic group, and approvingly quotes an early anthropoligist (also formerly Amish) who described himself as a member of "the Amish race." I will go to the library and dig it up if there is serious dispute on this issue. <a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWachholder0_7148.html" title="User:Wachholder0">Wachholder0</a> 21:49, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When you claim that the Amish are not an ethnic group because members of a nuclear family are not all Amish, and it turns out that you're not talking about a nuclear family at all, then the definition of a nuclear family is <i>very much</i> the point. Suddenly your argument is that people who are NOT members of the same nuclear family are NOT of the same enthnicities, which is hardly much of an argument. An Amishman who joins the Roman Catholic church is <i>not</i> non-Amish. He is shunned, which is something that the Amish do only to themselves. And as for your case of the Irishman joining the Amish, that happens about as often as an Eskimo becomes an African-American. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClairSamoht_1970.html" title="User:ClairSamoht">ClairSamoht</a> - <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check_47bc.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check">Help make Wikipedia the most authoritative source of information in the world</a> 22:06, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am aware of the quote about the Amish race. It is true that the Amish are extremely homogenious and could be considered an ethnic group, however the term Amish is not used as an ethnic marker by those of Amish origin. I think the main problem with the use of Amish as an ethnic identity is that it does not meet the same criteria as Jewish. For example Jewish people regularly claim Jewish cultural identity even if they are non practising, secular, etc. People who leave the Amish do not claim to be Amish however. They lose their Amish identity. I suppose that is where I have trouble seeing Amish as an ethnic group, it is more with attidudes of those who leave. I personally am of Amish descendance, yet I do not consider myself Amish, and would be ridiculed by practicing Amish for calling myself Amish. If Amish were an ethnicity I should be able to say I am Amish but yet I can not, because I do not practice the Amish religion. Among the Amish, only those who practice the religion are considered Amish. All others, despite Amish background are not considered Amish, nor do they consider themselves Amish. This is where we differ from Jewish people in my opinion. I agree that besides this, Amish would meet the requirements of an ethnic group, it is just that the people themselves do not consider it as such and do not use the term in this way. If Amish were an ethnic group on the basis of a presumed common genealogy or ancestry then not only I but those Mennonites who descend from the Amish and others who left the Amish faith would be Amish because we share our genealogy and ancestry with the Amish. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStettlerj_0eda.html" title="User:Stettlerj">Stettlerj</a> 22:08, 6 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There's sometimes a lot of vandalism here, and I'm wondering what's behind it.

<dd>People know very little about the Amish. There are plenty of myths that can fool even those whom have grown up around the Amish -- particularly when it comes to topics such as Rumspringa. Basically, it's Human nature to mock what is unfamiliar. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThisisbossi_e64b.html" title="User:Thisisbossi">Thisisbossi</a> 21:48, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nah, I never really noticed any issues like that growing up in northern Lancaster County. Most people just accept it as a way of life, and when I was young I thought there were Amish everywhere -- not just primarily in Lancaster County. I'm sure there are some youths that have yelled nasty things and I can recall a couple times where the newspaper's police log mentioned vandalism or verbal abuse; but by-and-large it's not at-all a common occurrence. Oh, apart from when the Amish teenagers are playing with the electronics in the supermarket... I'll admit even I smirk at that, but people are usually respectful enough to keep their chuckling to themselves. All of the Amish I know are understanding that they lead a very different way of life and simply ignore any insults thrown their way. As they tell me, the major concern between them and the outside world consists of two things: rising costs of living and road safety. To them, public image is irrelevant. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThisisbossi_e64b.html" title="User:Thisisbossi">Thisisbossi</a> 01:18, 5 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The short paragraph about this has been edited and re-edited many times. If one Googles 'amish mormon', one finds many references to the confusion between the two religions, but no explanations for the confusion (at least I didn't find any). It seems like the main confusion was from the film subtitles.

<dd>The reason Mormons and Amish are confused is because no one really takes the effort to get to know about either group. Both groups are somewhat secret and mysterious from the outside. I'm just not sure why they're confused, they're vastly different.

<dd>The Amish in Pennsylvania do vote, a fact that was underscored by Jack Brubaker's column Tuesday. You may recall that in 2004, Jack broke the news that during Bush campaign stop in Lancaster County, in which Bush met privately with the Amish, trying to win their political support, he told them "I trust God speaks through me," and it was Jack's mention of Sam's story that got national attention.<a href="http://www.mennoweekly.org/AUGUST/08-02-04/BUSH08-02.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mennoweekly.org/AUGUST/08-02-04/BUSH08-02.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Bush's spokemen repudiated the quote. Well, in Tuesday's column, he reveals that when Bush was in Lancaster recently, trying to raise funds for quizmaster Lynn Swann's gubernatorial bid, he again met with the same Amish. I can't find the column online yet, but it was in the Tuesday New Era, so it ought to be on lancasteronline.com within a day or ten. <a href="../../../c/l/a/User%7EClairSamoht_1970.html" title="User:ClairSamoht">ClairSamoht</a> - <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Fact_and_Reference_Check_47bc.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check">Help make Wikipedia the most authoritative source of information in the world</a> 05:39, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't see much of a connection between "The Village" and the Amish. This would also open the floodgates to a whole slough of vaguely relevant pop culture references which plague articles of this type. Also, the Amish are indeed citizens of the United States (or Canada, Belize, etc.) and have no desire to form their own polity. Indeed, I believe doing so would be contrary to their beliefs. <a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWachholder0_7148.html" title="User:Wachholder0">Wachholder0</a> 17:04, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I expanded the section on the Amish in popular entertainment, and removed The Village because as pointed out above it is not about the Amish, but about an "Amish-like" community; I think this section should be limited to those that are clearly depicting the Amish, and I emphasized those which have the Amish as a central theme, rather than a passing reference of which there are many more. I'm sure I didn't get all of those that should be included, though, so would welcome additions. <a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a> 08:58, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is true that most people don't know this system but what system do they know? For accuracy reasons and because it is an international standard I think we should use IPA however. What phonetic writing system would everybody be familiar with anyway? The answer is probably none (what commonly understood way is there, for example, to show the difference between the vowel in <i>food</i> and <i>foot</i> which everyone understands?) Might as well use the internationally, scientifically accepted method and once learned, it can be applied to any language to show pronounciations. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStettlerj_0eda.html" title="User:Stettlerj">Stettlerj</a> 17:31, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although I can't really read IPA, I can tell there is only one pronunciation listed. On the news regarding the recent shootings two different pronunciations were used fairly consistently (in the UK at least): sometimes the first syllable as "arm" and sometimes as "aim". If there is a good explanation as to why one is more "correct" then it should be noted.

<dd>I did the IPA a few days ago and my researches agreed with Caliga 10 and suggested that the "ahm" pronunciation is the most accurate, and that is the one I transcribed. Just to add to the problem, I heard a third variation on the news with an "a" as in cat. This was originally in the article before I converted.

<dd>In addition, I know that folks in Kentucky and Indiana use the prononciation I sounded out above (there are a number of Amish communities in Indiana), so I've heard it used elsewhere. I've never heard anyone use the "AIM-ish" pronunciation except for people with no exposure to the Amish (i.e. who are just guessing at the pronunciation).

<p>I don't know that this article needs to address the shootings directly. But it does seem as though there might be questions raised by the shootings that this article could address. For example, I was wondering about how the Amish view modern medical technology, especially the use of respirators/ventilators or other life-support technology. It seems like this article could do a better job of discussing these questions, and it is certainly relevant at this time. –<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERholton_b2db.html" title="User:Rholton">RHolton</a><a href="../../../r/h/o/User_talk%7ERholton_ce4f.html" title="User talk:Rholton"><b><font size="3">≡</font></b></a>– 14:12, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Absolutely not (and an earlier section related to it was removed). To me, that would be like putting a similar section into the article on 'Pennsylvania'. Yes, this is a terrible tragedy, but it will likely not be a defining event in Amish society and history. If the shooting causes some kind of lasting change in Amish society (which frankly I find unlikely), then I'd want to see it mentioned in this article.--<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliga10_0ee9.html" title="User:Caliga10">Caliga10</a> 14:13, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry, but again I respectfully disagree. I also note the irony given the beliefs of the Amish, but it's apparent that they were not targeted because they were Amish, but instead because they were conveniently-located in relation to the killer. Given that it (pardon me for making another analogy) is almost akin to including a section on the Colorado shooting that happened last week in the article about 'Caucasians' because the victim happened to be a Caucasian. There is already a link to the Amish school shootings article in the 'See Also' section of this article and I personally think that this suffices, because we do have an obligation to provide information to the casual viewer who might look at this article hoping to find information about the shootings.--<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliga10_0ee9.html" title="User:Caliga10">Caliga10</a> 17:01, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Caliga- I too must respectfully disagree. First, your analogy of this situation and the Colorado situation doesn't work. Caucasians are an ethnic group, a very wide ethnic group, encompassing damn near everyone of European descent (including the Amish). They encompass many countries and cultures. The Amish, on the other hand, are a very small community and a very distinct culture. Secondly, as the commenter below mentioned, the Amish reaction to this tragedy is very telling about their way of life. I think we all have been moved by the voice of a mourning grandfather forgiving the killer, even before his grandchild is laid to rest. It is a very appropriate example of the Amish's philosophy of peace, pacifism, and above all, forgiveness. -- <b>Fogelmatrix 16:10, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</b></dd>

<dd>Would it not be a good idea to incorporate the tenants of forgiveness being shown by the Amish people in this situation, however. For example, they have welcomed the perpetrator's wife and have offered her charity as a victim in this situation. I would think it would be good to highlight this belief structure a little more in the article. Whether or not to reference this incident as an example would require a bit more thought though. --12.0.47.2 19:26, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd really like to see a better source if the 'fact' about the blue gates is going to stay. The practice isn't mentioned in any of the books I've checked (various Hostetler and Kraybill books, Scott's <i>The Amish Wedding</i>, and so on.......), and I don't know anyone who really relies on Aurand for information -- he's regarded as a bit sensationalist by the people I've heard mention him. The one mention I've found in a browsing my shelves is in Martha Denlinger's <i>Real People: Amish and Mennonites In Lancaster County</i> (Herald Press, 1993): "Some visitors have the idea that an Amish farmer paints his gates blue to announce that he has a marriageable daughter; that is completely untrue. Marriage outside the Amish faith is forbidden, and everyone in the church knows the status of everyone else. So what need to advertise! The Amish consider courtship a secretive matter."(p. 42) The definitely matches my observations in Holmes and Lancaster counties and the discussions I've heard Amish former neighbors have. If you have a more recent and reliable source than Aurand, I'd love to hear about it. killearnan</dd>

The article would be from 1997 so have fun finding it."). I suppose the point I am trying to make is that even though I am not the person who included this story about the beer incident, I know the story and so I think it must be stated that it was thrown by the Amish themselves, as reported in the media... I am trying to find a source but I can't. It might have been that the conclusion was that it was thrown by the Amish. I know in Perth Co. that is what the general consensus was but whether it was proven or not is another story. I think the entire story should be removed since it is doubtful it deserves mention especially when there is no proof of what happened, and that probably it was the Amish themselves. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStettlerj_0eda.html" title="User:Stettlerj">Stettlerj</a> 01:49, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This section was removed - perhaps inadvertently? - and I have reinstated it.</p>
<p>Also, the most recent edits of the telephone paragraph were incorrect. The article referenced noted that as cell phone use has increased in the general population across the country, the number of public pay phones has decreased. The impact this has had on the Amish in Maryland, and presumably elsewhere, is that fewer pay phones are available to them, so they are increasingly doing what Lancaster County Amish have been doing for a long time - they are building and using phone shanties at the edge of their property, or perhaps on a neighboring "English" farm, so that they can make phone calls but not have the telephone intrude into their homes. So the edit saying that the phone shanties have decreased was incorrect - I have reinstated the original wording, and clarified it. <a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a> 16:44, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Caliga10 completely on this and am reinstating the categories and adding a few others. Also will look for appropriate cats to add from other states. Although at present Ohio's Amish population is a bit higher, Pennsylvania and the Amish are closely intertwined and someone browsing on another PA page should be able to link back to Amish via categories.

<p>Thanks for your research and edits. Next time I'll add a question to the discussion page rather than deleting text. I did a bit of research. According to the two web sites you linked to, both of the web pages are describing the Amish in Pennsylvania. The Amish weddings I attended were in Holmes County, Ohio and Reno County, Kansas. I obviously don't know first hand what all Amish weddings are like. Tonight, I asked an Amish lady from Kansas about celery at weddings. She confirmed that the Amish in Pennsylvania do serve cooked celery at their weddings, but she said it's not the main course. Based on what she said, the original statement "Celery is the main food..." was indeed false. Even if celery were the main food in Pennsylvania, the original statement would still not be true unless it would be qualified to say that it only applies to Amish in some parts of the country. Your changes do make it more accurate. 70.167.35.146 01:24, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The photos of the Old Colony Mennonites in Bolivia are much more valuable because photos of them are hard to find. As for the Amish photos, I do not say it does not exist, but I have never heard about an Amish community in Bolivia. Is it just one family? The question is are they part of any community, and what kind of Amish are they? What are they doing in Bolivia alone? Their pictures should not be included because they definitely do not represent the typical Amish, especially since this is one family, that I am not so sure is even part of any community. Amish apart from their community, are just people in Amish clothes. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStettlerj_0eda.html" title="User:Stettlerj">Stettlerj</a> 15:26, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think we know enough at this point, so let's see what Panex says before jumping to a conclusion that they are just people in Amish dress. And it seems to me that with a few explanatory sentences this might be a good external link illustrating the AMish away from the usual settlement area, for example. So Panex, more information about them would be helpful - what are they doing there, etc. Thank you for wanting to contribute to the article - it is certainly of interest, and perhaps should be included when we have some more information. <a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a> 19:53, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Before comming to Bolivia something like ten years ago, they were members of an Amish community in Tenesse (USA). What are they doing now in such isolated place? Just live: Let the days pass and wait for the next life! May be this sounds excesively romantic or something like that, but it is just what they think. I would like to explain you a conversation I had with the mother as I remember it: I asked for the reasons they had for to finally decide to settle in such isolated place. She answered like that:</p>
<p>"We just want to be close to God and hope He will take care of us. And we won't find another place with the peace we found here. [...]It doesn't matter to me what happens with my clothes or to my body... It's just temporal! I don't belong here, I'm from Heaven!"</p>
<p>When I hear this last sentence I get goose pimples because I realize that it shows the essence of their thinking! They decided to left everything and came to this isolated place for to feel closer to God. So it is clear that they are not people in Amish dress. They were and are Amish. Of course this is not a typical Amish family, since the main part of Amish live in communities in North America. But it shows how can they react when they feel the presure of the modern world. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPanex_dd16.html" title="User:Panex">Panex</a> 23:59, 7 December 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd>Looking over Panex's website, I have to wonder i this is a case of mistaken identity. Amish men don't usually have beards that long, and the kerchief-style coverings worn by the women has more in common with Old Colony Mennonites in other parts of Latin America than what Amish women wear. Amish women usually wear bonnets, not kerchiefs, or coverings in the more modernized groups. It is also difficult to tell whether those are "proper" Amish-style cape-dresses that the women are wearing. I will allow, however, the small possibility that any Amish émigrés to South America might adopt the clothing styles used by other conservative Mennonite groups that have been living in Latin America for generations out of simple climatic pragmatism. As it stands, however, I'm going to say 80% not Amish but rather an ultra conservative Old Colony splinter.</dd>

<dd>To be sure, I would really like to hear a recording of the type of German they spoke amongst themselves as that would give us a truly definitive answer as to which type of Mennonite they are.

<dd>Hi Bytor, I should say that they are Amish without question. They told me that. And Mennonites never wears beard. By that time I was also looking for mennonites in that jungle. They told me that the only mennonite family in the zone live 20 km deep in the jungle. There was also another Amish family like one hour on foot from there. They came from an Amish community in Tenesse. Sorry, I have recordings of Mennonites but not of the Amish. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPanex_dd16.html" title="User:Panex">Panex</a> 16:53, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would be opposed to the link. Photos of isolated Amish outside any community, by the very nature of the Amish, should not be included in my opinion, despite their clothes or ethnicity. It is possible however that they are in fellowship with an established community. From time to time there are isolated Amish families but usually because they are the last family to leave a dying settlement and their isolation is temporary. This family is currently in communion with what Amish community, and who is their Bishop and under whose Ordnung are they under? I want to stress I respect this family, and I like the pictures, but I do not believe that their pictures belong until there is an established community there. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStettlerj_0eda.html" title="User:Stettlerj">Stettlerj</a> 17:40, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OK, I see that we are already far of a consense about the possibility of adding this link. May be the discussion can be reduced to that: Is a link usefull if presents a behaviour not shared by all the Amish people? I know that Amish who leave their community in order to go far away to live isolated is a minority. But this family is not the only case. There are a few more Amish families in Bolivia living alone. And as I said in a previous comment it shows the way that Amish can react in front social pressure from outside. In my opinion the link will be usefull if is presented like that: Not a common thing but a thing that happens sometimes. Because is not true that Amish ONLY can live inside communities. Let me know what do you think. (<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPanex_dd16.html" title="User:Panex">Panex</a> 21:46, 17 December 2006 (UTC))</dd>

In my opinion, a link would be ok as long as it is prefaced with a statement that says that this is an unusual example of a family who self-identify as Amish, living outside of a traditional Amish community, etc. It would have to be clear that this is an anomaly, but I think it is interesting to include as a parenthetical item. I'm not an expert, but it would seem that living outside of the community away from a bishop and ordnung would not prima facie make you not Amish any longer, but I could be wrong. I don't feel strongly about including the link - it is interesting, but not essential - but I don't think we should reject the concept that these people are Amish. <a href="../../../t/v/o/User%7ETvoz_babb.html" title="User:Tvoz">Tvoz</a> 08:43, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks Tvoz for let us know your opinion. I would agree in to indicate clearly that this family is not a common Amish family, but it is not the only existing case.

<p>Clearly, there are lots of ex-Amish families, Mennonites who still consider themselves Amish, and individuals associated with the Amish community who are not accepted members of any Amish church.

<p>I agree quite strongly in favour of an "Who is an Amish?" article. For example, my maternal grandparents grew up in Beachy Amish-associated churches, but when they were married they started attending a congregation in the then Western Ontario Amish Mennonite Conference. That was also the conference from which my paternal grandparents came. The WOAMC and the Beachy Amish associated churches both derived from the Old Order Amish community in Ontario and there was much "cross pollination," so to speak. A few years before I was born the WOAMC dropped the "Amish" from their name and eventually merged with two other conference to become what is now The Mennonite Church Eastern Canada. Approximately half of my larger extended family, which gathers yearly for family reunions on both sides, are still part of that Beachy Amish group, dress conservatively and use Pennsylvania Dutch at home. My personal understanding of PD is limited, but the core of who I understand myself to be is Amish. Indeed, cultural practices such as how my family celebrates Christmas, Easter and other holidays, weddings, funerals, the foods we cook, regulat large family reunions, are all Amish. The largest difference between me and my conservatively dressed relatives is not in faith, politics, cuisine or that stuff, but in how we dress. We agree, both culturally &amp; religiously, on far more than on what we disagree. And I'm not the only person in this situation. Similar spectra exist across the Amish Mennonite world. One would not split French Canadians (or Italian Americans, Chinese Canadians, etc...) into separate ethnic groups just because some members are not as socially conservative or liberal as others. So why is that done with the Amish? In the past (March '06, Feb '07) I have tried to add a one or two sentence minor edit acknowledging that this Wikipedia article is primarily about the visibly conservative buggy-driving Amish and the existance of more liberal Amish. However, my edits are always deleted or seriously weakened with no comment by the changer. If somebody wants to start an "Who is an Amish" article, I will help with it. <a href="../../../b/y/t/User%7EBytor_92ca.html" title="User:Bytor">Bytor</a> 10:29, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry for reverting you twice earlier. Reading your explanation, I see where you are coming from and about the WOMC and retention of the label "Amish" I agree with you. I also agree that there is so much more to being Amish than no electricity, etc. That is just what the people see. But culture is more than just clothes and ordnung, it is the food, the language, the traditions, a way of looking at life, a way one interacts with others, an attitiude.. those of Amish descendance often retain these Amish characteristics that are more profound. I don't know how to put it in the article without it being "original research" but what you say I could not agree with more. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStettlerj_0eda.html" title="User:Stettlerj">Stettlerj</a> 17:32, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I personally do not agree with an Amish identity article. I think it would be wiser to do it another way, because by far most Mennonites and Mennonite communities who are of Amish origin have lost this Amish identity, and do not have it. I think therefore a better way to deal with it would be to refer to these groups as "<a href="../../../a/m/i/Amish_Mennonite_c5b4.html" title="Amish Mennonite">Amish-Mennonites</a>" (which already exists) and this article already deals with Mennonite communities of Amish origin. This was their historical nomenclature anyway.

<p>Do what you want. I know Wachholder you are a good contributer, but I believe the label "Amish Mennonite" introduces a lot of confusion, especially since this title has designated various Amish groups that are not Old Order (to the exclusion of the Old Order) such as the Beachy and those that have merged with the Mennonites (because the greater article hardly deals with the "Amish Mennonites"... and introducing these terms as equals (which they can be on occasion, but usually not) is especially disorienting... so as I say, it introduces confusion. Larger problem, I still don't understand why Amish is listed as an ethnic group when everywhere else it is a religious community. In fact, Amish as an ethnic group... you could write an article about those who descend from the Amish but you would have to change the entire article, since most of those of Amish ancestry have computers, cars, wear modern clothes etc. At least I hope people know this is wikipedia and they should take everything with a grain of salt. But again, do what you want.

<dd>You know, Wachholder, the more I think about it, the more I think this article should actually be entitled "Old Order Amish" and then the "Amish Mennonite" article should be the "Amish as an ethnic group" article. That is the CAMEO usage. They use "Amish Mennonite" for all those of Amish descendance. This article deals almost exclusively with "Old Order Amish", (and deals hardly at all with Mennonites of Amish origin or with Beachy Amish - of whom there are more than there are Old Order Amish... for example "Amish Mennonites" in the CAMEO definition of the term exist in Germany, Switzerland, France, as well, and many more Amish communities lost their Amish identity in North America than kept it). Anyway, anyone who knows the Amish knows that the Amish don't bode well for generalities and it is not easy to make statements about the Amish that hold true everywhere. Since wikipedia is written by committee perhaps nothing much can be done. Those that really want to know about the Amish, please see CAMEO, not wikipedia... although there is a lot of good info in this article I think. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStettlerj_0eda.html" title="User:Stettlerj">Stettlerj</a> 00:38, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>For example, if this were "Amish" or "Amish Mennonite" as an ethnic group, the intro should be as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Amish (IPA: ˈɑːmɪʃ) or Amish Mennonites[1] are descendants of Amish Anabaptist Christians in the United States, Canada (Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta, British Columbia) and Europe (Switzerland, France, Germany, Luxembourg) that are historically known for their plain dress and among the most traditional of their continued use of limited use of modern conveniences such as automobiles and electricity. The most traditional Amish separate themselves from mainstream society for religious reasons: they do not join the military, they draw no Social Security, nor do they accept any form of financial assistance from the government, and many avoid insurance.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Most historically spoke, and the Old Order continue to speak, a German dialect known as Pennsylvania Dutch (or Pennsylvania German) at home and in church services, and learnt English in school. The most traditional Amish are divided into separate fellowships consisting of geographical districts or congregations. The most liberal Amish have merged with the Mennonite Church during the first half of the 20th century. In the traditional groups, each district is fully independent and has its own Ordnung, or set of unwritten rules. This article primarily discusses the conservative Old Order Amish fellowships that observe strict regulations on dress, behavior, and the use of technology. There are many New Order Amish and Beachy Amish groups that use electricity and, in the case of the Beachy Amish, automobiles, but still consider themselves Amish.</i> There are also many Mennonite communities of Amish descent.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry this is so long, but I think it is important to discuss just what this article is supposed to be about, the Amish as a contemporary religious group, or the Amish and Amish Mennonites as an ethnic group which includes such groups as the Mennonites in Switzerland and Illinois, etc. of Amish origin. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStettlerj_0eda.html" title="User:Stettlerj">Stettlerj</a> 00:59, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think you have hit the nail on the head. The current "Amish" article is pretty much all about the Old Order Amish. Transferring the bulk of this material to the Old Order Amish page, and making the Amish article a more general discussion of the different groups considered Amish, would negate the need for the "Amish identity/who is Amish" article. The revised Amish article would include the history of the Amish before they split into different groups, and include brief descriptions leading to the following articles:</p>

<p>Perhaps it would also be useful to mention people of Amish or Mennonite descent or heritage, since they could be ethnically (or "genetically") Amish. Also, I see why you object to the inclusion of "Amish Mennonite" in the intro and will remove it until it can be included in a more suitable spot. <a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWachholder0_7148.html" title="User:Wachholder0">Wachholder0</a> 14:45, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have created a draft as an example of what such a revision would look like. I think I may have removed too much material, but take a look and see what you think: <a href="../../../w/a/c/User%7EWachholder0_Amish_draft_4973.html" title="User:Wachholder0/Amish draft">Amish (draft)</a></dd>

<dd>I've thought about this also: how this page is really about OOA. One problem with the proposed change is that most people equate Amish and OOA and this article will continually have to be cleaned of bits about OOA that people have added because they think it is missing. I'm not opposed to changing how these articles are factored and will support whatever the consensus develops. Another possibility is to have an <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amish_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Amish (disambiguation)">Amish (disambiguation)</a> article that lists the types as above and then just redirect OOA here. That way most people will find what they are expecting when they come to either article. <font color="purple">✤</font> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JonHarder_9df4.html" title="Special:Contributions/JonHarder">JonHarder</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonHarder_604a.html" title="User talk:JonHarder">talk</a></sup> 22:01, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The <a href="../../../a/m/i/Amish_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Amish (disambiguation)">Amish (disambiguation)</a> page seemed the best and simplest solution. Please take a look and add (or subtract) material as you see fit.

<dd>To finish the job, I believe it is appropriate to incorporate anything of value from <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Order_Amish_0f41.html" title="Old Order Amish">Old Order Amish</a> and then make that page into a redirect that points here. <font color="purple">✤</font> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JonHarder_9df4.html" title="Special:Contributions/JonHarder">JonHarder</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJonHarder_604a.html" title="User talk:JonHarder">talk</a></sup> 22:40, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
