<p>Please, please, <i>please</i>...stop the edit war you're engaged in at this article. You may disagree with the community consensus, and that's OK. And, by all means, make a new article detailing your position, which we can link to from this article. But, the bottom line is that you are getting yourself into trouble for repeated violations of wikipedia policy. You'll end up losing your voice in the encyclopedia entirely, and that's not worth it.</p>
<p>The two alleged sockpuppets may or may not have been you. But neither one has seen much action since the vote; one doesn't even have enough contributions for the wiki program to bother listing them. That's problematic, and the community - for good or for ill - is not counting those votes as legitimate.</p>
<p>Given that, the vote was won by "very brief mention". Now, it was <i>almost</i> won by "no mention", so you may want to count yourself lucky. I hope, and I say this sincerely, that you abide by the results and leave well enough alone. The Zoroastrian issue is and will continue to be mentioned, with links to other sites for further information.</p>
<p>I really suggest that you make a new article detailing your position, which we can then link to <i>this</i> article. If you've never started a new article before and need help getting it underway, I'll be happy to help...just let me know.</p>
<p>But my hope overall is that you stop getting yourself into trouble, because, frankly, a Zoroastrian voice could be very useful and helpful in wikipedia, and I'd hate to see you give that up over one lost vote. <a href="../../../k/h/m/User%7EKHM03_7873.html" title="User:KHM03">KHM03</a> 13:32, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have responded to this charge that I am being biased. I respond that I am being objective, and asking for the results of the vote to be abided by.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is very little question that Zoroastrianism had a profound effect on all subsequent Abrahamic religions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Zoroastrianism was the state religion of large and powerful middle eastern empires for over 1000 years with only brief periods of discontinuity. It is almost unimaginable that this state religion of a vast empire would not have a profound effect on all religions that followed that developed in the middle east.</dd>

<p>The user Aucaman has been vandalizing <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_people.html" title="Persian people">Persian people</a>, as well as several other Iran-related articles, claiming that "modern Persians are mix of Arabs and Mongols" editing the article, or adding a dispute tag, based on his own personal assumptions and conclusions without any valid source to support such outrageous revisionist theory.

<p>Aucaman and a few others like Heja Helweda and Diyako have been repeatedly and systematically vandalizing the Iran-related topics such as <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_people.html" title="Persian people">Persian people</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_peoples.html" title="Iranian peoples">Iranian peoples</a>, propagating false information, maliciously editing/disputing/deleting without one shred of proof to backup their wild claims, applying the strawman falsification approach, trying to establish new 'facts" based on their own personal assumptions and beliefs.</p>
<p>In order to prevent this situation, we need to create an <b>Iranian Watchdog</b> on Wikipedia and guard the integrity and quality of all the Wikipedia articles that are related to Iran and Iranians.

<p>I've got nothing to hide, so here goes: I'm what is described here in Hawai'i as <a href="../../../h/a/o/Haole.html" title="Haole">haole</a> -- white. My mother was from Texas; she said that her great-grandparents moved there from either North or South Carolina, I can't remember. Not a rich family, poor farmers. My father was first generation Swedish-Finnish; his father was a carpenter from Sweden. I grew up in Oregon, moved to the Bay Area, went to graduate school in Chicago, and ended up in Hawai'i. I was raised Christian and converted to Zen Buddhism some 42 years ago. I maintain the website at <a href="http://www.diamondsangha.org" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.diamondsangha.org" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I did my dissertation research in Polynesia, but in the last 10 years I've been increasingly involved in studying Bollywood, filmi music, pop and classical music from Iran through Afghanistan and India, Islam, and Middle Eastern/South Asian history. It's so deep and complex! and I love melismatic vocals. I like <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamshid_%28musician%29.html" title="Jamshid (musician)">Jamshid (musician)</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shahram_Nazeri_ab29.html" title="Shahram Nazeri">Shahram Nazeri</a>, but I just don't like <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googoosh.html" title="Googoosh">Googoosh</a>.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I just wanted to let you know that user, khoikhoi (MOD) keeps including the very offensive term, "south azerbaijan" on the Iranian Azerbaijan page. We should not let him post this propoganda and false information. That term has no place in an encycolpedia article. It is not relevent to the content. What a few seperatists call that region should not be shown here. If we dont stop this, people will start including the "a#abian gulf" as an alternate name on the Persian gulf page.</p>

<p>It has been ages since these citations have not been verified. Verification is needed. If not delete the material. the amount of time granted has been generious. The Azaris Iranian background has been verified through various scientific and academic sources, but the Turkic claim has not. The only think that has been verified is the Turkic langauge. <a href="../../../7/2/2E/User%7E72.57.230.179.html" title="User:72.57.230.179">72.57.230.179</a></p>

<p>There are two entries at Wikipedia, which have falsely created -- they are <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turco-Persian_3a45.html" title="Turco-Persian">Turco-Persian</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turko-Persian_Tradition_42f7.html" title="Turko-Persian Tradition">Turko-Persian Tradition</a>. Both entries are factitious. I have requested the entries to be deleted. My reasons are:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The term <b>Turko-Persian Tradition</b> (or <b>Turco-Persian</b>) does not exists academically and it is a factitious entry! Check the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia_Iranica_05f3.html" title="Encyclopaedia Iranica">Encyclopaedia Iranica</a> to confirm -- The correct name for that culture is the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persianate.html" title="Persianate">Persianate</a> culture not the "Turko-Persian". Turkophones (mostly of mixed race and Persianized in culture) only spoke in Turkic dialects and were in the military. That is not enough participation in creating and forming the culture to deserve the name "Turko-Persian Tradition" – This is misinformation. All the elements in that area, which have to do with tradition and culture, were drawn from the Iranian culture (Persian, Kurdish, Azari, Baluchi, Tajik, Luri, Gilaki, Talishi, Mazandarani, etc.), and the Islamic faith, not much Turkic elements (like shamanism, yurts etc.) were incorporated in. That is what makes the name "Turko-Persian" an imaginary one and therefore the entry should be deleted.</i></dd>
