<p><br />
Thanks&#160;! I am stuck, tho. You suggest I re-write the definition of seeVote. It would be wrong for me to write something different than what I wrote on the seeVote website, since I took alot of research to write seeVote in the first place, it does not make sense for me to re-write it for you. I wrote it correctly the first time ..so you all would not screw it up .. but instead you insist on reverting to the WRONG definition of seeVote. Follow the link from your wikli .. to the ACTUAL seeVote.com website.. you can see for yourself that your wiki is InCORRECT..</p>
<p>Either take off the link or correct the definition please.</p>
<p>I am only attempting to prevent your wiki from broadcasting OBVIOSLY wrong and misleading inforamtion about my invention.</p>
<p>you suggest I write seeVote in my own words. now what? It IS IS IS in my own words ... I invented seeVote. thanks for taking the time to understand the situation. If I could describe seeVote in other words .. then I'd use those words for the website too.</p>
<p>PS ..seeVote.com is not copyrighted. Your are too quick to judge! Where does it say it has a copyright?</p>
<p>Maybe I should make the seeVote website wrong .. so that you will accept the correct definition .. then Ill revert the website back.. but that seems silly.</p>
<p>I thank you for your time, seeVoteDan</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Also, from your own Manual of Style <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style</a>&#160;:</p>
<p>"Clear, informative, and unbiased writing is always more important than presentation and formatting."</p>
<p>I am sure somewhere it says CORRECT information is more important than ERRORS too.. please take the seeVote entry off your site .. if you refuse to correct it.thank you. Please goto seeVote.com contact page and ask them what they should do... then you'll be talking to me.. and we can resolve this. thanks. you're the greatest!!</p>

<dd>From how I read your website, it seems like a reasonably accurate summary. Perhaps your website is not as clear to others as you think? By my understanding of copyright issues, everything is copyrighted (you do not have to assert copyright) unless the copyright holder specifically releases it into the Public Domain or applies another licence to it such as the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Underdown_0d41.html" title="User:David Underdown">David Underdown</a> 15:35, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>seeVote 03:36, 18 June 2006 (UTC)seeVoteDanseeVote 03:36, 18 June 2006 (UTC) David Underdown said: "Perhaps your website is not as clear to others as you think? " Perhaps, the need for clarification! ...ie my article update. get it? have you made my point for me?</p>
<p>I agree with you about the copyright issue. I, as sole holder of its copyright agrees to you publishing correct information about my self-copyrighted invention/theory. I do not grant you permission to broadcast wrong information about seeVote.. Certainly you may not link your wrong article to seeVote.com either.. only link the proper description .. found at the website. Please help me.</p>
<p>Your current wiki description states: seeVote... "produces two ballots (one for voter to keep; the other for a locked ballot box)"</p>
<p>This is misleading since seeVote keeps both ballots locked in two differnet places, counted by two different efforts (a precincts traditional counting system and the seeVote system of verification on the internet) ..etc..</p>
<p>Funny, I got a google alert today telling me how eBay now has seeVote in its wiki.. it came from your wrong article that I am desperately trying to change:</p>
<p><a href="http://listing-index.ebay.com/games/SeeVote.html" class="external free" title="http://listing-index.ebay.com/games/SeeVote.html" rel="nofollow">http://listing-index.ebay.com/games/SeeVote.html</a></p>
<p>get it? this is very painfull to all our effort of people here helping me with seeVote.</p>
<p>"Reasonably accurate to you" is exactly why I need to have this corrected. I hope my explaination of the issue is as important to me as it is to you.</p>
<p>I respect your time on this last issue ..and will accept a final careful judgement from your thoughts after a more careful reading of the wrong wiki article Vs. the correct definition on the seeVote website, which, by the way, should at least prove that your wrong article should STOP linking seeVote.com. thank you.</p>
<p>I'd rather you link your article to Diebold. sheesh.</p>
<p><br />
Just incases you had time to try the last demo version here it is .. I am currently working on version 5 of the demonstration .. not available yet. thanks so much! <a href="http://www.seevote.com/version4/introduction.html" class="external free" title="http://www.seevote.com/version4/introduction.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.seevote.com/version4/introduction.html</a> follow the links to the interactive demo. peace.</p>

<p>seeVote 12:26, 18 June 2006 (UTC) I finally read "The five pillars of Wikipedia" and I appreciate your efforts here much much more. I will be brief: I am attempting to write an objective article for your wiki.. it will be interesting for me to rethink seeVote in a more objective perspective. See how I do. until then, can we please fix the wrong article? thank you</p>

I usually use it when someone blanks a page, but should I use it for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Rome&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59249180" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Rome&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59249180" rel="nofollow">this</a>? —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi"><font color="">Khoikhoi</font></a></span> 09:11, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, you may want to ask someone else on that one. I personally find the bv template is used far too liberally given the bluntness of the warning--I personally regard it as a template synonymous to {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4_bd45.html" title="Template:Test4">test4</a>}} or {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest4im_97f8.html" title="Template:Test4im">test4im</a>}}; thus, it should really only be used following t2, t3, etc., but that's just my opinion. Others think its usage is justified after the first ill edit. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 09:15, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">WelcomeBot</span></h2>
<p>Hi AmiDaniel: I recently proposed the idea of a WelcomeBot at <a href="../../../b/o/t/Wikipedia%7EBot_requests_273d.html" title="Wikipedia:Bot requests">Wikipedia:Bot requests</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/l/Template_talk%7EWelcome_b7f9.html" title="Template talk:Welcome">Template talk:Welcome</a> and found that it was written off by Wikipedians almost immediately. After searching the 'pedia, I found that you've been kicking around this idea, too. Personally, I don't really understand the objection that this would "depersonalize" the Welcome process. Veteran users would continue to greet newbies: they'd just use a "Hi, I'm ABC!" instead of the rather impersonal {{subst:Welcome4}}. Anyways, I noticed that you said you could probably make such a bot. I have absolutely no programming experience but am interested in the idea of a pursuing this project. Would you want to bring a WelcomeBot to life? --<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex_S_5f20.html" title="User:Alex S">Alex S</a> 03:44, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Oh really! Glad to see I'm not the only proponent of this idea. Yes, I've been mildly pushing for a WelcomeBot for quite some time, and I would be more than glad to code the bot. I would however need to find someone else (or get a toolserver account) to host the bot for me, as I don't have a a server handy. I know that before I received my welcome I had no clue about the project, and after I received it ... well, I was an instant addict&#160;:). I agree that there is a central impersonal element, but I think a WelcomeBot would be quite advantageous. Is there a discussion going on about this somewhere? <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 03:52, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re: Your UBX on Registration</span></h2>
<p>Hi AmiDaniel. I was just looking over the userboxes on your main page, and I notice you have one which says you wish people would register with Wikipedia, but do not believe it should be required for them to edit a page. As an RC Patroller myself, and a member of the CVU, I have encountered numerous difficulties when it comes to dealing with Vandals who simply login thru an IP Address, rather than a username, which is easier to block and keep track of.</p>
<p>I would like to ask you why you object to people having to register in order to edit a page, since this would make both mine and your jobs a heck of a lot easier. Your may either reply here, as I will mark the page to my watchlist, or you may pin a message to my <a href="../../../t/m/a/User_talk%7ETmalmjursson_5780.html" title="User talk:Tmalmjursson">Large Hairy Icelandic Yak</a> and I will collect it when I come on next.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">From CVPJ</span></h2>
<p>Thanks for the courteous reply on Ajit Someshwar. I looked at WP Auto and I assure you this is a bio, not an autobio, and I am not the subject, I am not Indian, I have very little contact with Indo-Canadians, though through a colleague, I do know Ajit and I thought he would make a worthwhile bio. Better if his book were done of course. You could probably guess at my own background by looking at some of the other things I've chosen to 'volunteer' for Wikipedia, and they have nothing to do with India or Indians. I think Wikipedia is a fantastic enterprise, but it needs to be wary about its occidental biases (and I'm occidental myself). I've already made the point about 14,000 'American bios' by W search, 6,000 German, 4,000 French, 2,000 Indian (these are rough figures, you must have better ones).</p>
<p>A search for 'Indo-Canadian bios' kicks out some five people, two of them the director and the Indo-Polish star of the film Water. By adding Ajit, the overall Indo-Canadian category was at least boosted a little - there are about three million South Asians in North America, a small nation if you like and they include 45,000 doctors in their own US association. However, I don't really want to ask for a deletion review - the tone of some of your reviewers ('Who is this guy', etc) suggests that's it better not to be in Wikipedia at all than to be rejected by it. The current Google search for Ajit kicks out the Wikipedia deletion as if he were rejected or outed for some crime - it has to be quite humiliating for him, and I don't even know how to broach that. In some areas of my journalism career, that 'publication' of what should perhaps be internal Wikipedia documents could even be construed as repeating a libellous or at least slanderous statement, and the US first amendment doesn't protect Wiki or Google in many countries (try defending a claim for lible in the UK). So there are a lot of issues still to be discussed in all of this.</p>
<p>However in the end I bow to your own W wisdom in deciding what is notable enough. But perhaps in your 'internal' discussions you need to find a way to be more discreet in how you do a deletion. I know that may do some damage to the open source idea, and to the freedom of 'insider' debates. I am all for open sourcing, it's the whole point of Wikidom. Finally I can tell you I was considering putting some others I know (not Indian) who have authored books or have some notability and might be worthy of a place, but I'm not going to risk it for their sakes. As an author of no importance myself, my own bio won't go in unless someone I don't know does it (and I'd probably be the first to call for a deletion).</p>

If anyone had any sense at all, they would insist that the 3RR be read first before giving out a username. Situations occur at random, and Wiki is VERY inviting and helpful as you know. "EDIT ME" it says, and that is encouraged. A newbie really has no idea what the difference is between a vandal or an editor that simply blanks out what they wrote. And when that occurs, the editor will cite WP:VER. Reading that educates some about the edit and leads to the vandalism pages on which the VERY FIRST listing of a vandalism act is blanking out what a user has done. Having no idea about revert rules, or one-word clauses, or the difference between an edit, a change, or anything else, the user is instructed to bring it to the discussion, and that new user is CONVINCED that they are in the right. You know what happened to me, and now I read on your site to go and hunt vandals! I'D LOVE TO, well, NO, well, yes, I am still confused, when I ask a question like "What is the appropriate first step when one sees what "may" be advertising, what "might not" be, on good faith?" and everyone ignores me. I go to the WP:AIV screen and it reads, "if this is not an act of vandalism . . ." and so the porn and spam prevail. Then I hear, "Oh, no, it's okay, because you are carrying out "policy"". I propose, therefore, to the WikiDevGods and Gurus, that a template be made that puts an article into a Category "Blatant Advertisers", and that when that occurs, an alarm bell is rung somewhere on somebody's desk who the user knows will at LEAST get around to it sometime. I'd be more than happy to report every vandal, spammer, and advertiser with a template that would keep me, the newbie, out of the picture, AT LEAST to the degree that when it came time, I would be advised of what actions occurred. Call it training if you will, but I think new users would be a lot more productive if they were able to see by example what they should have done, without having to go through it themselves. Thanks! And I hope you're feeling better soon.&#160;:) Ste4k 10:24, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you, Xyrael! I'm trying my hardest to get better, but I'm likely going to be relatively inactive for the next few days.

<p>I removed the stub and merge tags as I merged the article into the Scout Association of Hong Kong Article. Please delete it as the article has been merged.</p>

<dd>It's probably best not to delete the article, as its history should be preserved for <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> reasons; however, its history shouldn't at the same time be merged. I'd suggest that you simply convert it into a redirect for now, which you can do yourself. If you'd like me to do this for you however, please let me know, and I'll do so gladly. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 00:57, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
