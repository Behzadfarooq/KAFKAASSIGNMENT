<p>Hi, Whenever I try to update my stats or view them, I get a "File Already Open" error (number 55). It seems to happen whenever the porgram tries to write to vandalismlog.txt. Also, I canot record mistakes and the program can refuse to allow me to revert. Should I do a clean install? If so, is there a way to keep the user specific stats? thanks <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp23_980f.html" title="User:Martinp23"><font color="green"><strong>Martinp23</strong></font></a> 23:42, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Like I said in the title, after I click the update button under the recent changes tab about 120 times (estimate, probably not the real number), it stops working completely, if I click it, it just does nothing.

<p>Hello...when I open links (like on mirc) they open in a new IE browser...is there a way so when i click a link in mIRC that it'll open in VP? <a href="../../../d/s/p/User%7EDspradau_c144.html" title="User:Dspradau">Dspradau</a> 17:28, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't believe so, since VP doesn't actually count as a browser, so HTTP links can't exactly be sent to it. But maybe AmiDaniel can do something that allows VP to be set as a default browser? --<a href="../../../m/1/s/User%7EM1ss1ontomars2k4_d48d.html" title="User:M1ss1ontomars2k4">M1ss1ontom</a><a href="../../../m/1/s/User%7EM1ss1ontomars2k4_Esperanza_41c3.html" title="User:M1ss1ontomars2k4/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../m/1/s/User%7EM1ss1ontomars2k4_d48d.html" title="User:M1ss1ontomars2k4">rs2k4</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../m/1/s/User_talk%7EM1ss1ontomars2k4_b66e.html" title="User talk:M1ss1ontomars2k4">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_M1ss1ontomars2k4_ef71.html" title="Special:Contributions/M1ss1ontomars2k4">C</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_M1ss1ontomars2k4_0011.html" title="Special:Emailuser/M1ss1ontomars2k4">@</a>)</sup> 22:59, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

Vandalproof is a fantastic piece of kit - If I have a user (which I did recently) who was intend on inserting pictures of gentials in all sorts of random articles, then manually removing all of the vandalism and posting warning takes time - with vandalproof, i could take care of the problem in a couple of clicks and then move onto a similar problem user. I don't think it's a "police state" - it's more like a park warden picking up the crap that people drop in the park. It has to be done otherwise the park soon becomes a mess.</p>

<p>Hello, I am leading a push to ban the so called "Vandal Proof" software from Wikipedia. I think this software leads to a negative impact on Wikipedia. It tends to attract those users who get an ego trip from asserting editorial control (speaking from first hand experience). Not a good thing. Remember that all editors on Wikipedia are supposed to assume good faith. This tool makes it easy for rogue editors to disregard this. I suggest that we provide an easy place to collect complaints about this "Vandal Proof" software. Perhaps the software could generate a link to a complaint area in every warning it produces so we can track abuses. <a href="../../../c/s/h/User%7ECshay_6274.html" title="User:Cshay">Cshay</a> 05:05, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Cshay, I'd be interested in seeing some diffs of problems you've seen with the software. I've looked through my logs and some other VP users but cannot see a non-vandalism revert that is not logged as a mistake. If you have a user who's misusing it then here is the place to raise it so that the moderators can decide if to discontinue their access. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripitus_dfdd.html" title="User:Peripitus">Peripitus</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeripitus_05d5.html" title="User talk:Peripitus">(Talk)</a> 06:01, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Granted, everyone who reads this page is a supporter of this tool and yes it is masochistic of me to post my complaints here for that reason. Yet, I feel I should be straight up with you guys that I am pushing to get this tool banned because of the negative effects it has on the Wikipedia community. I feel it tends to encourage the neo-nazi element... the police state as it were.

<dd>If you'd like to check the almost 1 edit per second that we get for vandalism, 24/7, manually, be our guest. VandalProof, like other tools, are nessecary if you want to keep our 1.2million+ articles free of vandalism. Like I said, if you see anyone reverting anything except vandalism with the tool, talk to them about it - the tool is specifically for reverting vandalism, where you assume good faith by assuming that it was a test edit ("Can I really edit this?"), reverting it to keep the article in pristine condition, and droping a friendly note ({{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest1_2f2b.html" title="Template:Test1">test1</a>}}) on the user's page. <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBornhj_aa00.html" title="User:Bornhj"><font color="#3366CC">--<b>jam</b></font></a><a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBornhj_E_1d10.html" title="User:Bornhj/E"><font color="green"><b>es</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../b/o/r/User_talk%7EBornhj_2497.html" title="User talk:Bornhj">(talk)</a></sup> 08:13, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your opinion, James. Yes, there is a functional need for something like Vandal Proof. Unfortunately, it is also and strong attractor for exactly the wrong kind of editors that Wikipedia needs. We need less policemen, and more negotiators. Vandal Proof is all about the police state. I think once the majority of Wikipedia editors are aware of the features of Vandal Proof, they will vote to ban it.

<dd>And meanwhile, rampant vandalism is reverted, cleaning up Wikipedia for those who wish to use it. Out of many cases of vandalism that was easily reverted using VP, perhaps 1% are "errors"? We are humans Cshay, and so are you, and everyone makes mistakes. I've made two known mistakes, and those two were pointed out to me by those respective users to which I apologised and did edits on my behalf to correct the situation.

<p>Sorry if this has been mentioned before, but I've looked everywhere in the discussion and such and have found no mention of it anywhere.

<p>Hey, I've been away for a while, but since V1.2.2 was released, I've not been able to log in using VP. I'm logged in under my user name on Internet Explorer, but whenever I try to set my username I tries to connect, then takes me to a page saying that it couldn't log me on. Have you got any idea why it's doing this? Thanks. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBeno1000_c5f1.html" title="User:Beno1000">Beno1000</a> 23:55, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi guys, I was just wondering if we have an approximate time when we can expect the next version of VandalProof. —<span style="font: small-caps 14px times; color: red;"><a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMets501_2e06.html" title="User:Mets501">Mets<small>501</small></a> (<a href="../../../m/e/t/User_talk%7EMets501_fc50.html" title="User talk:Mets501">talk</a>)</span> 15:30, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wow. I am having a boatload of technical issues with this software. Is this the right place to post about them? I first downloaded VandalProof from <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_VandalProof_1bdb.html#Download" title="User:AmiDaniel/VandalProof">User:AmiDaniel/VandalProof#Download</a> using the "ZIP file for new install". This installs version 1.2.0. Everything seemed fine; I logged in and received a prompt that I "may no longer user this version" and to "[p]lease download the newest version of VandalProof". I did this, both from the browser inside VandalProof and from my external browser. Both times the software installed, and the application started, froze for awhile, and then brought me to a page with a dialog box stating "Your log-in request failed." even though I properly entered my username. I followed suggestion #2, "You might not be correctly logged into Wikipedia with that username. Try logging into Wikipedia within the current browser." and logged into Wikipedia again through the VandalProof browser. I got the "Login Successful" message, and then the software froze again, and finally came back to the page telling me "Your log-in request failed." I closed down VandalProof and restarted it from the Windows -&gt; Programs menu where the start shortcut was placed. VandalProof 1.2.0 started and I was greeted with the prompt that I "may no longer user this version". Lather. Rinse. Repeat. Assistance needed! <a href="../../../c/p/a/User%7ECPAScott_7db1.html" title="User:CPAScott">CPAScott</a> 12:48, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've had some of these problems. The login one I can't help you with, though I've sometimes found just retrying fixes it. I also found that the start program version of VP is the old one; I just fixed this by removing that icon from the start menu and dragging the 1.2.2 version to the start menu. Once you've done that, try starting 1.2.2 again; I've never had it fail to log in more than twice in a row. Hope that helps. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> 14:16, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks, but I'm still stuck. One, I don't know where verison 1.2.2 is located. In C:/Program Files/VandalProof only 1.2.0 appears. Two, I'm still getting the log-in errors. <a href="../../../c/p/a/User%7ECPAScott_7db1.html" title="User:CPAScott">CPAScott</a> 23:38, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am also registered in the german section of the Wikipedia. There I am having about 500 edits <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spezial:Contributions&amp;offset=20051212153043&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Wendelin" class="external autonumber" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spezial:Contributions&amp;offset=20051212153043&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Wendelin" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I am wondering authors from other locale section are also accept or only the english section is allowed to use VP?</p>

<dd>Bearly541 is back, and has made edits today. From my review of those edits, they don't appear innapropriate although one was a higher level warning than I would have used for a first warning. It does appear to me that Bearly is still using VP. I think revoking his VP rights is in order, but if there is a process we should follow where we cite the inappropriate uses of VP, I'd be happy to follow that process. Just let me know.
