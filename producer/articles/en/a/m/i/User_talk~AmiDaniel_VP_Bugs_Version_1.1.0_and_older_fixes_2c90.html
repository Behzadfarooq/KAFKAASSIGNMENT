<dd>The setup cab is corrupt ... I've just now discovered that I can't get it to install correctly on <b>any</b> machine. Those who have managed to run by simply extracting the files were just lucky. I'm working on a new setup, but for now you can try copying all of the files from the cabinet <b>except for the .exe's</b> to your System32 directory.

<dd>Oh, that's really not good then. It sounds like a memory leak, especially since you've been able to fix it by deleting the setting files (thus, the app thinks it's an initial run). This might have to do with the Customization ability I just implemented for the Rollback buttons on ... I believe, Thursday ... I haven't had much time to test since I made those changes, and it's entirely possible that I accidentally forgot to close a thread. Thanks for bringing this to my attention! Let me proofread my code a bit more and hopefully get this fix by the weekend. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 17:07, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank God!!! I think (crosses fingers) I finally fixed it ... possibly the most annoying bug I have <b>ever</b> encountered in my life. I absolutely hate this browser control, not because it's a bad control but rather because there is practically no documentation on it. What seems to have been the problem is that I was passing it too lengthy a string, and rather than simply producing a normal, debuggable error it would simply crash (unhandled exception in IE). I think I've finally got it all sorted out though, and so it should now work in version 1.0.1 when I upload it. Sorry about that, but I'm surprised no one else reported this bug; it began for you (and eventually for me) when the Welcome page became too long for the control to handle. Now the app simply strips <b>everything</b> unnecessary off the page when it loads. Sorry if I'm not making any sense... my brain's a little fried. But I fixed it!!! <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 23:54, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

In the beginning I thought this (missing rollback) wouldn't be a problem, as I have popups and godmode-light, but godmode crashes VP (only works with FF anyway) and popups don't show any link, therefore I need you to correct this. <b><a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFetofs_45e3.html" title="User:Fetofs"><font color="blue">F</font></a><a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFetofs_Esperanza_24d7.html" title="User:Fetofs/Esperanza"><font color="green"><i>e</i></font></a><a href="../../../f/e/t/User%7EFetofs_45e3.html" title="User:Fetofs"><font color="blue">tofs</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../f/e/t/User_talk%7EFetofs_75a9.html" title="User talk:Fetofs"><font color="maroon">Hello!</font></a></sup> 16:41, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm guessing, as you hinted, that this is a g-mode light problem. I did, however, test it with godmode-light running a couple of times and didn't have any problems ... but I have made some changes since then. Could you do my favor? Open up a diff in your normal browser, click "view source code", and then copy and paste the cource code in an email to: dccannon@hotmail.com. That might help me sort it out.

<dd>I wonder if perhaps you might advise as to how one turns off "Enhanced Recent Changes" mode; I'm having the same problem as Computer Joe but haven't his computer acumen. One other question, if I may (I can post this question separately in a new section, if you like): I've used the tool just twice, each time to PROD, but after neither use did any edit summary appear (see, e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Profit_monger&amp;diff=48377946&amp;oldid=48377737" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Profit_monger&amp;diff=48377946&amp;oldid=48377737" rel="nofollow">here</a>); though I dummy-edited in order that my edit summaries might note the PRODding, I wonder if there's a change I need to make in order that edit summaries with the relevant info and "using VandalProof" appear.

<p>Hi, thanks for approving me (and with such speed, I might add). I'm sorry to immediately dump problems on you, but <a href="../../../2/2/0/User_talk%7E220.240.241.185.html" title="User talk:220.240.241.185">this</a> is just embarrassimg: the rollback+warning button puts the correct warning and link on the vandal's page, but does not in fact <i>revert</i> anything. Am I just doing something wrong? Oh, and the user colors are just black.</p>
<p>Seeing the questions you asked from another user with a similar problem - Win XP, IE 6.0.2900.2180.xpsp_sp2_rtm.040803-2158, MonoBook, <b>no</b> enchanced recent changes (removed prior to installing), <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupin_anti-vandal_tool_6a1f.html" title="User:Lupin/anti-vandal tool">anti-vandal tool</a> and <a href="../../../k/b/h/User%7EKbh3rd_Vandal_warning_toolbox_988d.html" title="User:Kbh3rd/Vandal warning toolbox">Vandal warning toolbox</a>.

<dd>Don't be sorry. You've designed the best anti-vandal tool I ever heard of. So what if it isn't working properly yet? That's why it's called "development".

<li>Im in partly the same situation as Chodorkovskiy. I installed last night and get no errors or problems (running from the extracted CAB), but i just noticed today that its not actually reverting, just leaving warnings. Pressing just "Revert" takes you to the save page but doesnt actually push save, if this helps. Maybe that step is somehow not happening, because when i revert+warn i see the save page go by. -<a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELanoitarus_7ca8.html" title="User:Lanoitarus">Lanoitarus</a> <sub><sup><a href="../../../l/a/n/User_talk%7ELanoitarus_979b.html" title="User talk:Lanoitarus">(talk)</a></sup></sub> <b>.:.</b> 17:19, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This also just happened to me. I found vandalism in progress at <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Belzer_d343.html" title="Richard Belzer">Richard Belzer</a> being done by an anon, hit the first "test" button and it placed the warning on the talk page but otherwise left the article itself unchanged. I'm getting the script errors but otherwise there's no sign I had any problems with the download. Incidentally, is it possible to set the tool to flag certain "catch phrases"? There's one vandal who keeps hopping IP addresses, but the common denominator is his repeated use of the term "hen fap". <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 04:58, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>You need to install popups (add {{subst:navpop}} to your monobook). Unfortunately, VP is currently, as a result of my mistake, dependent upon popups--the next release won't be. As to flagging catch phrases, VP does not retrieve the rss feed and as such the contents of the change are not known until you load the diff--I earlier had a function that would filter edits in much the same way that Lupin's tool did; however, it was simply too slow to use. If the vandal's using the catchphrase in the edit summary, however, that could be easily implemented. I'll try reincorporating some form of search in the next release, but I'm not promising anything. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 05:12, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>When a vandal makes several consecutive edits in a row, it's important to fully revert all of these edits, rather than just the last edit. The "rollback" function available to admins automatically does this, but many of the vandal-reverting tools ("godmode-light", VandalProof, and others) don't seem to do this. See for instance this VandalProof revert, which doesn't do the right thing and leaves vandalism in place: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Cardinal_Zen&amp;diff=47765709&amp;oldid=47765669" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Cardinal_Zen&amp;diff=47765709&amp;oldid=47765669" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 06:45, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>When you click rollback and the last edit was made by the same user, it will prompt you to view all the edits made by that user. If you click yes, you'll then see a diff between the last edit by the current user and the last edit by the previous user, and clicking rollback again will revert all the way back to the last edit by the previous user. As there are often cases where a user makes a series of good edits and then some random test edit, in other words where only the last edit need be reverted, I leave this in the hands of the users to either do a "full" revert or a simple one-edit revert. (The user can also open up the page history and load a diff between any two edits and can revert to any version.) Thus, VP will revert all edits by the user, but only if you want it to. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 20:57, 10 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>(I'd asked this question with one above, but I'm moving it to a new header in order that anyone else similarly affected might comment.) One other question, if I may: I've used the tool just twice, each time to PROD, but after neither use did any edit summary appear (see, e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Profit_monger&amp;diff=48377946&amp;oldid=48377737" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Profit_monger&amp;diff=48377946&amp;oldid=48377737" rel="nofollow">here</a>); though I dummy-edited in order that my edit summaries might note the PRODding, I wonder if there's a change I need to make in order that edit summaries with the relevant info and "using VandalProof" appear. Thanks in advance. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:07, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I truly don't know why it didn't add an edit summary. I use the prod quite frequently and I've never once noticed it not leaving an edit summary. Do you receive any warning messages, such as '.wpSummary is null or not an object'? <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 05:25, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>With respect to the edit summary, I didn't get an error message, and I haven't been getting edit summaries with any other edits (see, e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJahiegel&amp;diff=48382439&amp;oldid=48373598" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJahiegel&amp;diff=48382439&amp;oldid=48373598" rel="nofollow">here</a>, where I gave myself the {{preview}} template without edit summary), whether at user talk or in article mainspace. It doesn't seem that anyone else reports this problem, so perhaps it's something on my end, although I can't imagine what it might be. In any case, no hurry in resolving it, inasmuch as it seems isolated. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 19:43, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just a thought: Do you maybe have "force edit summaries enabled"? That hopefully shouldn't be make a difference, but it might. Another user had problems with a script that did essentially the same thing, that wouldn't let you save without providing a summary. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 19:49, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps my Wikipedia illiteracy rears its head again, as the only similar button of which I know is the "Prompt me when entering a blank edit summary" box under "Editing" at "My Preferences"; I have tried VP with that feature both on and off without success. If the "force edit summaries" toggle is elsewhere, I'd very much appreciate your pointing me there. It'd be alright if the program were forcing me to provide an edit summary, but here it actually seems to prevent my adding one. In any case, it seems strange that I should be the only one to have this specific problem, but I haven't any clue as to what I might've done to engender it. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 19:56, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yep, that was the setting I was talking about. If that didn't do it, then these seems like a java problem. In looking at your monobook.js, I see that you're not running any tools at all, so that can't be causing it (or can it?). Let me just a list a few possible causes: 1) Is your Wikipedia skin set to "monobook." 2) What version of Java are you using? 3) What version of Internet Explorer are you using? 4) What version of Windows are you using (hopefully shouldn't affect it)? 4) Are you having any other problems with VandalProof (that may be related)? <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 20:05, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>(1) Wiki skin is "monobook". (2) I'm using version 5.0, which I know isn't the most recent; I can surely download a newer version if you think that'd help. (3) IE 6.0 (SP2?). (4) Windows XP. (5) No other VP problems at all; it's quite a great program. (Edit: Well, there is one problem I've had that I assumed was altogether unrelated, but I suppose I should let those who know more determine that. When I use any of the buttons that provide "rollback" and "test" templates, the program inserts the "test" warning at the relevant talk page but does not actually rollback the edit.) <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:21, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That may actually be quite relevant. Can you try something for me? Try clicking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:AmiDaniel/Sandbox&amp;oldid=48526319&amp;action=edit&amp;autoclick=wpSave&amp;autosummary=Test%20rollback" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:AmiDaniel/Sandbox&amp;oldid=48526319&amp;action=edit&amp;autoclick=wpSave&amp;autosummary=Test%20rollback" rel="nofollow">this link</a> and see if it reverts my sandbox to the version that states "Your attempt to rollback the page has worked." <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 05:08, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just as I thought, it's not actually reverting the page. For some reason the autoclick and autosummary ampersand switches aren't working on your computer. I have no idea why, but they're not. I've actually been thinking about using java instead of the Wiki switches to do the autoclicks and autosummaries because I think it might be faster ... once I make the transition to java I think your problems will go away (though most likely not in this release). Still seems strange though. Could you maybe go to My Preferences / Editing (in Wikipedia) and tell me what you have checked on? <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 05:15, 15 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sure. I've checked "Enable section editing via [edit] links", "Edit box has full width", "Show edit toolbar (JavaScript)", "Show preview before edit box", "Add pages I create to my watchlist", "Add pages I edit to my watchlist", and "Prompt me when entering a blank edit sumamry" (although, as noted supra, I've tried VP with the last setting toggled both on and off). Once more, inasmuch as I seem to be only one thus affected and insofar as you've a prospective fix already in the works, please don't feel that you need to spend time resolving this problem; you've done a great deal of good work here already. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:26, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Although you may be the only one so far, others may later have problems with it, and the bugs you're reporting are pretty major, so let's get 'em sort out if we can. Let me first of all try getting you setup the way I am to see if that cures it. Try unchecking all options under My Preferences / Editing except for Enable Section Editing via Links, Show edit toolbar, and show preview before edit box. Then try clicking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:AmiDaniel/Sandbox&amp;oldid=48526319&amp;action=edit&amp;autoclick=wpSave&amp;autosummary=Test%20rollback" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:AmiDaniel/Sandbox&amp;oldid=48526319&amp;action=edit&amp;autoclick=wpSave&amp;autosummary=Test%20rollback" rel="nofollow">this link</a> again. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 05:33, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My apologies for taking so long to get back to you. The good news is that, upon installing popups and clicking on the link, I did successfully revert the page. The bad news is that, when I use rollback + test with VandalProof, the test template is given but the page is not rolled back; edit summaries also don't appear. But it seems like we're on the right track... :) <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 17:09, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I downloaded the 1.1 and found that each of the problems about which I wrote above (viz., the absence of edit summaries and the failure to rollback when using "rollback" and "test") is resolved.

Hmmm, how to view it in Wiki...then I finally thought, maybe it made a subpage for me and I was right, seeing there are three: VandalismStats, VandalismLog, and VandalismMistakes. I'll write this up on the Help page for others so they don't go through this.

<p>Okay, I'm really sorry for not explaining this better--it is sort of one of those things that, since I wrote, I know its quirky way of working, but no one else does. I'll update the help page with some more info about this (as I should have earlier), but just briefly to answer your (plural) questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>In order to load the log, stats, and mistake to your page, you have to go to <i>Update Log</i>, and then click the respective buttons on the dialog to load the log's contents to your user subpages. The log will be stored at /VandalismLog, the stats at /VandalismStats, and the mistakes at /VandalismMistakes (all in your individual userspace).</li>
<li>If you edit a user talk page where you left a warning, you will see commented out &lt;!--the ID number--&gt; of the revert before your signature and after the warning. It corresponds with the entry in your vandalism log.</li>
<li>Thank you so much Rlevse for all your hard work on the help page. I've been extremely bogged bown with many non-wikipedian things lately and have spent all my Wikipedia time dealing with bugs/problems; in other words, I've had little to no time to work on the help pages myself. I also appologize for not responding to your question the help page's discussion page--I saw it go by my watchlist a couple of times but never got around to responding. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 00:36, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hmm ... well, you're on the list (I just checked). Are you using the monobook skin? If not, try switching your skin to monobook.

<dd>Oops, terribly sorry for not replying. As it turns out, the problem fixed itself. I'm guessing it was a problem in IE as I had the same problem with AWB: Every page I opened with it had a "An error has occured: do you wish to debug?" I had to click "No" every time to continue, very annoying, natch. It seems to have fixed itself in both programs: lord knows how. Could be because I ran Windows Update again, I don't know, the error simply stopped occuring. (I was running monobook before as well, so I'm pretty sure it was a problem at my end).

<dd>I just checked and you're on the list, so that shouldn't be the problem. Check that in the upper-right corner of the browser screen your user name is displayed (as it typically is within Wikipedia). If you typically use FF, Opera, or Nerscape (in other words, not IE) as your primary browser, it's likely that the Wikipedia auto-login isn't stored in IE's cookies (VP uses IE components, so you'll need to be logged in within IE). That should fix it. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 10:41, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

Now when I start VP, I initially get the login failure screen, but then instead of getting the "try logging into Wiki" screen, I now get the successful login screen-;) <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 00:16, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Aha, yes I was just going to suggest that you check your LAN settings. Unfortunately WP has some weird issues with cookies and IP addresses... I don't totally have it all figured out. Glad you got it fixed! <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 00:18, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's a bit quirky still. Usually it logs me in, but sometimes I get the "try logging into wiki" page. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 00:02, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Now, eventhough I haven't changed my settings, it doesn't log in initially at all. I have to use the "try wiki" link every time, sigh... <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 11:52, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>NOW it DOESN'T WORK AT ALL AGAIN, even though I didn't change the settings. GO FIGURE. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 16:23, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have determined that the problem is not with vandal proof, but with the user's browser settings. The problem is being worked out on my talk page.<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> <a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a> 23:01, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
