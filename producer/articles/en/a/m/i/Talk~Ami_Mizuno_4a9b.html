<p>Articles dealing with fiction should follow the <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">guidelines for writing about fiction</a>. In short, articles dealing with fictional subjects, characters, objects, or locations, must establish and discuss significance outside the "fictional universe," together with the process of authorship.

<dd>2c first part can be over-rided. The Tokyopop translations are not reliable in giving the kind of source material we need to support statements. Alex Glover also admits fault with his own translations, thus the best translation for stats and other things tends to be the original manga or shinzoubon. I can fairly well contest that the TP manga is a pretty awful representation of the manga and what it stands for. It's not just individual words, but plot changes, and meanings also change. There are censorship issues as well. Besides the stereotypical teenager register it also has lots of other problems as well. If need be, I'll present my links for Japanese language translation (and dictionaries) with Alex Glover's... Given that the TP manga is not a translation word for word, it can safely be nixed out.--<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHitsuji_Kinno_8c45.html" title="User:Hitsuji Kinno">Hitsuji Kinno</a> 09:21, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Note that James Bond is former GA. I do like the descriptions on Voldemort and then that idea to model it in that fashion for these articles might be a good move... anyone disagree? --<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHitsuji_Kinno_8c45.html" title="User:Hitsuji Kinno">Hitsuji Kinno</a> 00:34, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Bondy must have been delisted recently, then. How do you plan to use the "descriptions on Voldemort" modelling in our articles? I'm not entirely sure what you mean by that, you see. Might just be easier to go ahead and do it, and then explain later.- Malkinann 11:05, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since you all have done a very nice work in this article, here is a quick peer review about this article. Hopefully it will be helpful.</p>
<ul>
<li>The article has 6 lists. Most should become prose, especially the statistics one, as lists are discouraged.</li>
<li><a href="../../../s/a/i/Image%7ESailor_Merkur_01.jpg_471a.html" title="Image:Sailor Merkur 01.jpg">Image:Sailor Merkur 01.jpg</a> is too big, tagged as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFair_use_reduce_4b80.html" title="Template:Fair use reduce">fair use reduce</a>}}. Fair use rationale for the image is somehow weak. <a href="../../../b/s/s/Image%7EBssm2.png_572c.html" title="Image:Bssm2.png">Image:Bssm2.png</a>, Image:Ami live action 3.jpg and <a href="../../../m/e/r/Image%7EMercury-21.jpg_53a3.html" title="Image:Mercury-21.jpg">Image:Mercury-21.jpg</a> have weak rationales. Image:M princessmercury0.gif is too big as well, and wrongly licensed (that is neither a TV screenshot, nor can be released under GFDL as scanning a magazine does not grant you rights over the produced image). <a href="../../../a/m/i/Image%7EAmimanga.jpg_4916.html" title="Image:Amimanga.jpg">Image:Amimanga.jpg</a> has no fair use rationale. Image:MercuryFont.PNG is a special case. The logo itself must be copyrighted by someone, so I am not sure a copy can be created and released for free. I would suggest sending it to <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a>.</li>
<li>Bolding should be used only in the first appearance of the article name in the lead, not everywhere per [[Clean up: the subject of the article should be mentioned in bold at the first natural place per <a href="../../../l/e/a/Wikipedia%7ELead_section_3c3e.html#Bold_title" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">guidelines</a>.</li>
<li>The first paragraph of the <i>Profile</i> section is written in an in-universe perspective.</li>
<li>Due lack of citations, it appears that there is a lot of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>/speculation (<i>an excellent trait in a soldier</i> in example).</li>
<li>The text flow is somewhat halty. Think like a casual user who has never read about this character or the show itself. The first line of the lead says <i>Ami Mizuno (水野亜美, Mizuno Ami) is a fictional character, a Sailor Senshi, one of the central characters in the Sailor Moon metaseries.</i> Would a casual user know what <i>Sailor Senshi</i> means? Maybe metaseries? The second sentence reads <i>She is known as Amy Mizuno in the English adaptation of the manga and second half of the anime; in the first half of the anime, she seems to have been Amy Anderson.</i> Would a casual user know what <i>manga</i> or <i>anime</i> means? I would suggest something like:
<dl>
<dd>Ami Mizuno (水野亜美, Mizuno Ami) is a <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_character.html" title="Fictional character">fictional character</a> from the <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sailor_Moon_f7f9.html" title="Sailor Moon">Sailor Moon</a> series of Japanese comics or <i><a href="../../../m/a/n/Manga.html" title="Manga">manga</a></i> and animated cartoons or <i><a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a></i>, created by <a href="../../../n/a/o/Naoko_Takeuchi_a0c4.html" title="Naoko Takeuchi">Naoko Takeuchi</a> and originally published by <a href="../../../k/o/d/Kodansha.html" title="Kodansha">Kodansha</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>There are several typography comments: don't use contractions like <i>doesn't</i>, don't use single quotes to mark words like 'special,' there should be no spaces between mdashes (—), don't use - to separate between title and content (either use a ndash or a mdash, see <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28dashes%29_e389.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (dashes)">the manual of style</a>), avoid short sentences that could be merged into other ones, like <i>Ami's father, a painter, sends Ami paintings.</i>, <i>This is most likely because divorce in Japan is taboo.</i>, <i>She is not given a new title.</i>, etc. Also, don't abuse semicolons, they sometimes create very long sentences, like <i>Ami looks remarkably like her mother, who aside of her workaholic tendencies is a good person and openly resents not having more time to spend with her daughter; Ami admires Mizuno-sensei very much and is typically obsessed with being a perfect student, wanting to live up to her mother's example.</i>.</li>
<li>Don't use sentences like <i>For information, see the appropriate section under PGSM.</i> Either use a {{<a href="../../../s/e/e/Template%7ESee_also_d10c.html" title="Template:See also">see also</a>}} template, or don't add it, because it breaks the flow and confuses the user.</li>
<li>If you are using abbreviations, like PGSM, you should explain what it means, in example, <i>In Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon (PGSM), the 'Dark Endymion'...</i> (note again the single quotes used for emphasis, italics are preferred.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are some of the comments I have. I suggest sending the article to <a href="../../../p/e/e/Wikipedia%7EPeer_review_91e2.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review">peer review</a> before trying to achieve Good article status.

<dd>I really appreciate the help, however, the part about manga and anime, I pulled this from a feature article on the Anime and Manga Project space and found this: <i>Excel Saga (エクセル・サーガ, Ekuseru Sāga?) is a manga series by Koushi Rikudou,[1] and a TV anime series based on it and directed by Shinichi Watanabe.[2]</i> Manga and anime while it has a crummy definition has also made it into the OED, the Oxford English Dictionary. I believe that the rules of wikipedia are that if something needs to be explained in detailed it must be linked. If a person doesn't know what anime and manga are, they can click on the link, quickly find out and hit back. This article is under manga and anime as a category, thus it's not necessary. If all AMP articles required this, then it should show up in all feature articles, but it doesn't. So I think that line about not know what anime and manga are can safely be crossed out as no other articles on AMP require it. So why does this one have to be "special" suddenly? Either change the rules and require it, or let it slide. Letting it slide would be easier because you'd have to debate with the other people of wikipedia proper. --<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHitsuji_Kinno_8c45.html" title="User:Hitsuji Kinno">Hitsuji Kinno</a> 17:39, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mamoru also wears glasses. I think Takeuchi-sensei has a softness for them since she married a guy with glasses... Ami uses them a bit in the manga. glasses in anime and manga do signify changes in the character as well.

<p>In the interest of not overdoing our use of copyrighted images, should we perhaps reduce the number of images in each bio down to just the essentials? If we want to cover civilian form, Senshi form, anime, manga, attacks, and PGSM, we could just reduce things by one and make better use of our space, like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Senshi form: Anime style, place in infobox (as we're doing)</li>
<li>Civilian form: Manga style, discuss placement (most articles have this)</li>
<li>Attack: Anime style, try to show the power and not just the character (we're doing well, I think)</li>
<li>PGSM: Show the character in civilian form (again, as we're doing)</li>
</ul>
<p>The practical effect of this would be to standardize what form the manga images are portaying, and eliminate the anime-civilian headshots (which strike me as redundant).</p>
<p>Another idea is to be slightly less anal about 100% universal consistency in this way: if they are easier to find, use manga images in the infoboxes for the Outer Senshi, and use anime shots for the civillian images.</p>
<p>Any thoughts? I'm also working up a proposal for slight reorg of the profiles themselves, as well as the attacks sections; I'll post those as soon as I've got time to type them. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 23:48, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Oh, yes, and the planetary symbols. Those aren't really copyrighted, so it's not as much of a problem. I personally like them by the stats. Incidentally, I think those are available as a font symbol--maybe we don't need to use images at all? Also, out of curiosity, what's wrong with the SVG versions being used at, for example, <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_%28planet%29.html" title="Mercury (planet)">Mercury (planet)</a>?

<dd>As for the SVG images, check out my example on the right. They can be resized to any size, right here on WP, just by typing the number of pixels you want it to get to, with <i>zero</i> fuzziness, pixelization, or aliasing.&#160;:) That's why they're using them. Take a look at <a href="../../../v/e/c/Vector_graphics.html" title="Vector graphics">vector graphics</a>--it's pretty awesome stuff. With that in mind, would it be all right to do away with the redundant versions and incorporate the SVG? I wouldn't mind doing it myself.</dd>

<p>Okay, for lack of any protestation, I will be removing the Princess Mercury image in just a moment. I'm also going to find a new manga image to replace the current one, because compared with the others' it's kind of pathetic.</p>
<p>My next plan, assuming no one objects, is to remove the anime head shot from the Profile section and move the civilian manga image from the Statistics section (which now has a planet symbol instead) into its previous location.</p>
<p>I propose that for the Outer Senshi pages, we use a manga Senshi shot for the lead image, and anime civillian shots in the profile, because it's just easier to find matching sets that way.</p>
<p>Any disagreement? Please discuss.&#160;:) --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 20:17, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would really like this to move ahead; the Statistics sections look horrid right now, with the manga and planet images both crammed into them. The calendar headshots being used right now are both redundant and much too large to be fair use. This discussion has been up for some time in the section above. If there are no arguments in favor of retaining them (including a good reason why they're fair use), I'll go ahead and switch them out of Ami, Rei, Makoto, and Minako's articles on <b>Thursday, December 14th</b>. I really do think it will make the articles better and more likely to achieve GA status. The Outer Senshi and Royal Family I'll leave alone for the time being while we work out other details pertaining to those groups. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 00:21, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are we getting rid of the anime civilian image at the bottom? Considering her face does not change from the lead image at the top. Also, I have a suggestion. Since were using the <i>Super Senshi</i> pics as lead images for the Inners, I think it would be neat if the attack pics matched, a la Mars. Of course, this suggestion is for the four guardians (Sailor Moon is a special case, and Chibi Moon only had one <i>real</i> (albeit unreliable) attack in the anime). Just to give the pages some consistency. -<a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESaturnYoshi_465c.html" title="User:SaturnYoshi"><font color="midnightblue" face="comic sans ms"><b>Saturn</b></font></a><a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESaturnYoshi_Esperanza_c7e5.html" title="User:SaturnYoshi/Esperanza"><font color="green" face="comic sans ms"><b>Yoshi</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESaturnYoshi_ae63.html" title="User talk:SaturnYoshi"><font color="maroon" face="comic sans ms">THE VOICES</font></a></sup> 11:34, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Materials Collection lists "image color" and "image gemstone" for Mars, Jupiter, and Venus, but not for Mercury or Moon. We currently have it cited from there incorrectly. Moon does have a birthstone mentioned, but it's pearl and moonstone, not diamond. Meanwhile, the Outer Senshi's gemstones don't seem to be cited at all. Is there another reference for these?

<dd>I'm all for removing it, personally. It has no effect on the characters' Senshi powers, it never comes up in conversation, it's not necessarily a favorite stone, it's usually not their birthstone... It is the same as their Image Color, which we don't mention (with good reason, I think), but even less relevant. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 22:30, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The birthstones may be insignificant throughout the series, but we have to keep in mind that gems and minerals are a key element in Sailor Moon. Think about all the various names (especially those of antagonists) for example.

<dd>Yup, she does; at least 80% of the villains are named after rocks. The main thing here is that the "image stone" for the Senshi both never affected the series <i>and</i> is inconsistently mentioned in official sources, meaning she herself didn't pay much attention to it.

Taking out the birthstone system because of inconsistencies amongst sources is a serious change and should be carefully considered, IMHO. --<a href="../../../z/y/p/User%7EZyppora_202c.html" title="User:Zyppora">Zyppora</a> 10:27, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it was in one of the manga volumes (English version) that an overview was given on each Senshi with their respective gems. They didn't match as birthstones though. But yes, they add little to the series, and as such can be left out. I guess they should only be mentioned in sections where they are of significant value (say, a section on the Another Story game for example). --<a href="../../../z/y/p/User%7EZyppora_202c.html" title="User:Zyppora">Zyppora</a> 11:49, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You mean the gemstones? It's pretty much that you find attributes throughout the game named like 'Sapphire Earrings' or 'Emerald Ring' (not sure if those are the exact attributes, but you get the point). They boost the stats of the character they're equipped to, but if you equip them to the right character (sapphire to Mercury, emerald to Jupiter, etc.) they'll give a much bigger boost. Either that, or you can't equip them to another character than the one they're suited for.

They do have round about significance now that I think about it more. I once looked up gemology. For example "diamond" is supposed to collect the power of all the gems. It just happens that the jewel that the ginzuishou suspiciously looks like is a real diamond... It's a Crown Jewel of England (Forgot the name though). I remember seeing it back when I visited England. In addition each stone has personality traits... but I don't think it's that significant... just wanted to say how it helped formulate the characters. Takeuchi-sensei didn't add things for pointless reasons. Each gemstone has some significance in New Age, and they are suspiciously congruous down to the letter.... even down to the color. Look up colorology too. *shrugs* But that's more of a fan thing. And they were significant to Another Story game. Most of the time you couldn't win without those items. --<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHitsuji_Kinno_8c45.html" title="User:Hitsuji Kinno">Hitsuji Kinno</a> 02:17, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>'By Act 34, when Ami's mother attempts to transfer her to another school because she thinks Ami's friends are bad influences (e.g. she has been missing cram school a lot because of her Senshi duties), Ami rebels, avoiding the admission interview and spending the night at the Senshi hideout with Rei.'</p>
<p>It is true that Ami's mother thinks Ami's friends are a bad influence, but not because she's missing cram school (or not just because of that). The reason her mother went as far as to transfer her is because after fighting an enemy, Ami and Rei are picked up by the police, and their parents are notified of this. This is also what gets Rei into trouble with her father. --<a href="../../../z/y/p/User%7EZyppora_202c.html" title="User:Zyppora">Zyppora</a> 09:50, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>True, that is the primary reason. Then, after talking to the police, Mizuno-san calls the cram school and finds out Ami's been skipping.

Having been caught monster-hunting doesn't have anything to do with that, especially since she skipped cram school out of necessity. So I'll snip that explanation altogether and add some more regarding Ami's feelings about friendship versus studying.

<dd>I disagree that what we were doing suited us best, but that doesn't really matter, because this isn't about "us." It's about the encyclopedia, which serves more than Sailor Moon ingo. I personally feel this article has improved every single day lately <i>because</i> it is coming closer to the GA criteria. We <i>do</i> have to follow word-for-word the WP guideline that says the 'pedia works by consensus, and the 'template' of what makes a good article has formed after lots of development by lots of other people. I believe them. Many of the things that have been removed or dramatically altered from these articles were my work, too. This isn't "our" page.

<p>Can I change the "Shabon Spray" listed in the "Special Powers and Items" to it's correct intended name "Sabão Spray"? Also her "VR Visor" was the name given in the English Adaptation, same goes with "Pocket Computer". In the Japanese version those items are listed as "Mercury Goggle" and "Super Computer". Also, as with the other Senshi, she holds posession of a "Wristwatch Communication Device".

<dd>No, <i>shabon</i> is derived from sabão, meaning soap. A lot of Japanese words come from Portuguese, bizarrely enough. But we shouldn't replace the Japanese spelling with the Portuguese any more than we should replace it with English. There's already a note. Feel free to change the item names to the Japanese ones, though, and give them a reference that includes your source and the English names. I think the communicators are too crufty for each Senshi page, but they will probably get a mention at the Arc page. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasamage_4cdb.html" title="User:Masamage">Masamage</a> 19:29, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Okies. It is definitely sabão, because it is shown written in ROMAN letters as "sabão" (accent and all) on cover 9 of my Media Books for season 1. Along with some other personal stats about the characters written in English. I came across it when I was scanning the covers into my PC, because they are unnoticeable if you weren't looking for them. The katakana characters that represent "sabão" are also used in the Japanese word "Shabondama" (dama is written in kanji) which means "soap bubble", but in Sailor Mercury's case it is just representing the Portuguese word "sabão".. "Soap Spray!"&#160;:P Also, I am still unsure of how to reference (still fairly new to wikipedia) but i'll look through the page already and try and figure it out. <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFighter4luv_5543.html" title="User:Fighter4luv">~ Fighter4luv</a> 02:14, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
