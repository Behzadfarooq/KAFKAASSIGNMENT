<p>I have added a cleanup tag to this article to address some issues that I feel make it less than an ideal wikipedia article.</p>
<p>The writing often seems a bit too campy, and not scholarly/encyclopedic in attitude.</p>
<p>some examples:</p>
<p>"He acted in several films every year, <i>and never seemed to wear out his appeal</i>." "While he was a star, <i>none of that mattered</i>, but lack of selectivity may have had something to do with his later career doldrums." "At the same time, Gandhi's Congress Party government <i>was reeling</i> from accusations of corruption."</p>
<p><br />
the actor's first name is also used too much in subject headings; the whole article is about him, this kind of thing seems a bit much.</p>
<p>referring to the actor as "big b" also seems a bit colloquial, and not encyclopedic.</p>
<p>I am working towards fixing it a bit, but i have no expertise on the subject, i would just like a higher quality article. the tag has been placed so that any readers who happen on the page look at it a bit more critically. --<a href="../../../y/o/a/User%7EYoasif_f3c7.html" title="User:Yoasif">Yoasif</a> 23:02, August 23, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ah, I see. I've had a go-round on this with editor Merovingian. He set to work on the Madhuri Dixit article, trying to make it sound more scholarly. He and I tussled over it a bit, then, after Merovingian had finished toning it down, a few Madhuri fans arrived and gushed it up again. Way more than it had been previously.</dd>

<dd>I don't necessarily disagree that the writing could be drier. It's just that when most writing about Indian movies is somewhat florid, it's hard for any writer to take a dry tone. Especially when dealing with fans (fanatics!) who believe that their idol is something approaching a divine avatar. So tone it down by degrees, until we get to a level we can sustain against fan assaults &lt;g&gt;. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 23:33, 23 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The picture is not from Deewar, as Amitabh was much younger then. See Wikipedia's entry on Deewar for more.

<p>Someone added a couple of sentences saying that Amitabh had had an affair with the actress Rekha. I removed them.

<p>An anon just put a whole lot of material into the "early career" section -- analyzing Amitabh's rivalry with Rajesh Khanna, discussing various early films, etc. It reads to me like a copyvio, a chunk of material from someone else's book or essay.

I reverted to an earlier version that I know is non-copy-vio, and I've left a message for the anon inviting him to take a username and come here to discuss his changes. I could be completely wrong, and that could be his own, original essay.

<p>An anon made a great many changes, none of which, I felt, were for the better. I reverted, but with some sadness, because someone had worked hard.

<dd>Anon, I'm sorry, but I had to revert your work on the Amitabh article. You don't seem to be a native English speaker and many of your edits replaced grammatical prose with mangled English and whimsical capitalization. No new material was added, so far as I could see, other than praise of Amitabh.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I hated to do it, since you had clearly worked hard on the article, but we have to try to keep up a certain standard of quality. However -- there are many many Bollywood movies, actors, producers, etc. who don't have any articles at all. If you're just starting a needed article, it's less important to write standard English and more important to get the facts straight. Other people can clean up the prose. If you're an Amitabh fan, you could make articles for the Amitabh movies that don't already have their own articles. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 02:28, 10 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>The para re Amitabh's recent film activities said that he had appeared in a number hit films, notably ... and then listed films. Other editors just could not leave this list alone, and insisted on adding every film in which he has recently appeared, turning the sentence into a repeat of the filmography. I removed the names of films and just said that he has appeared in hit films.

<p>Bachchan is not a surname. It is the pen name, a usual practice among Hindi poets, taken by Harivansh rai shrivastava- Amitabh's father. Later the family have adopted it as a surname. Made this minor correction.</p>

<p>I've lost track of who reorganized the article, but it doesn't work. Separating Amitabh's biography from his career is just not feasible. The new biography section reads like a random assemblage of snippets, which is what it is. Please, let's go back to the old organization, in which we have early life, career, public life, family life. That's a reasonably chronological presentation.</p>
<p>I can't do it right now. But unless someone convinces me otherwise, I will &lt;g&gt;. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 01:10, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
well, the article already reads too much like a story, which may be a reason that you aren't fond of the new organizational scheme.</p>
<p>however, it is supposed to be an encyclopedic article, and it makes sense to separate it a bit more, especially considering that this isn't a biography, it's an article. separating his life is something that is helpful.</p>
<p>if there are issues with the article feeling like snippets, perhaps there could be some additional writing done to patch up seemingly disparate sentences.</p>
<p>besides which, your argument is a bit odd, especially since his early life and family life are pretty much just his "life". the chronological argument doesnt really work either, since his career and public life intertwine in the timeline, and his family life isnt really a different subject from his "early" life, or life in general. --<a href="../../../y/o/a/User%7EYoasif_f3c7.html" title="User:Yoasif">Yoasif</a> 01:27, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would go along with Zora; I am however sympathetic to where you are coming from Yoasif. I think the 'life, career, public life, family life' thread IS workable (look elsewhere) - we just need to sieve the material to fit. Go ahead Zora - and then we can discuss as she/we go along. But wholesale changes without consultation will draw in the 'Big B' diehards and I don't want to be on duty when they land! Really like your drive though, Yoasif.

<p>i'd rather deal with the diehards than to accept a worse/less logical organizational scheme and slowly make the same changes i would have made. the edits aren't just organizational, a lot of small cleanup was done too, and you'd lose all of that if it was simply reverted.</p>
<p>if either of you could make specific note of what doesn't work, i'm sure we (or I, since both of you seem indisposoded to the idea) could fix it. it comes down to the old way being a story, whereas i'm looking for an encyclopedia article. the old scheme pales in comparison to other "good" wikipedia pages, and the new scheme emulates good articles much more effectively.</p>
<p>so -- i reiterate, please post specific examples of what doesn't work, and what <i>needs</i> work.</p>

<p>Twice now anonIPs have attempted to insert material re Amitabh's recent bout of colitis and hospital stay. I'm not sure that this article is the place for breaking news. The news bulletins I'm reading say that he's doing well. IMHO, his hospital stay would be news only if he didn't recover (avert! avert!). I could be argued out of this position if one of the regular editors thinks I'm wrong and gives a good argument.</p>

<p>Shouldn't his real name be mentioned in the article? As far as I know late mr Harivanshrai Bachchan's real surname was Srivastava. Bachchan was an "artist name" he used when he published his writings. I guess this imlies that Amitabh Bachchan's real surname is also Srivastava, and that Bachchan is the family's artist name...corect me if im wrong --<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeep750_386c.html" title="User:Deep750">deep750</a> 15:18, Aprli 23 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Although "Bachchan," I believe, was Harivansh Rai Bachchan's "pen name," it is now most likely the "surname" of the family. A typical pen name will be written only by the artist, and not adpoted by the members of his family. I'm not sure whether Amitabh's long-estranged brother writes "Ajitabh Srivastav" of "Ajitabh Bachchan" (or something else), but everyone in Amitabh's immediate family (wife, Jaya; daughter, Shweta; and son, Abhishesk) writes "Bachchan" as his or her last name. I'm not sure as to the answer behind this mystery, but this seems simply to be the case. Perhaps Amitabh's last name, at birth, was, indeed, "Srivastav," but, at this point, for all intents and purposes, his "family name" appears to be "Bachchan."</p>
<p>(Commando303)</p>
<p>The case is simmilar with late mr Kishore Kumar, real name Abbhas Ganguly, but he was known as Kishore Kumar, and rest of his family is also known as Kumar instead of Ganguly. I dont know if both Bachchcan's name are registered as Bachchan in official registrars or not. I also beleive that Ajitabh writes Bachchan, atleast what he is reffered to--<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeep750_386c.html" title="User:Deep750">Dhirad</a> 11:38, April 30 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Commando, I've been busy in real life (RL) and didn't see what you were doing until now. I don't like it! You are replacing a tight, readable article with something that reads very much like copyvio. The paragraphs are so long as to be almost unreadable. The prose is just full of personal judgements, which, if they're yours, constitute original research. It's OK to quote judgements by critics, if they can be documented, but just speculating about Amitabh being to Khanna what Brando was to Cary Grant is just ... not encyclopedic. The whole bit re the Walter Reade program reads like copyvio and is just too much for one small event. This is, IMHO, a disaster.</p>
<p>I'm exhausted and cranky now, so I'm not going to edit, but I'd advise you to stop and listen to other people before you go on adding material. You are probably going to find most of what you added edited out. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 08:48, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Zora, if others (not just you) are unhappy with the changes I'm making, I'll have no problem stopping; this isn't my Web site, so it doesn't really matter to me what's written here. I've been updating the page in the hopes of making it more informative, and that's all. As I've indicated in my "descriptions" of my edits, I haven't yet finished, which is largely why it looks like one big mess. I'm going to finish to-night, and the entire entry, I hope, is much more concise, readable, and (as you put it) "encyclopædic." I think it's unfair how Indian actors and actresses have horribly scanty pages (though I can't say that Bachchan's was really "scanty"), whereas Hollywood stars have paragraph after paragraph dedicated to them. I understand that this site is an "encyclopædia," and not a biographical resource, but encyclopædias, when they discuss people, are indeed biographical. Just take a look at Wikipedia's pages on Al Pacino: it talks about the films he did at the start of his career, those that made him a star (it even has a quotation from "Scarface," cited as one of his famous lines), his "comeback films," etc. It also talks about his early, non-movie life. Brando's page is similar, but even longer, and more detailed. Opinions regarding talent are scattered throughout both these actors' Wikipedia articles. There religious backgrounds, too, are mentioned. Sylvestor Stallone is discussed in detail on his page. I think Bachchan's page needs a good deal of revising, and that's what I was trying to do. Let me finish, then calmly look at the new page. See what you think, and let's let a few others do the same. If people feel it works, great. If it stinks, of course, it'll be changed. Thanks.</p>

<p>Right, I don't care. I find Wikipedia's restrictions regarding information rigid and inconsistent: Whereas certain Hollywood actors can have line after adulatory line, of biased, "personal-life" detail, an Indian actor simply cannot have that. Further, I realize that Wikipedia is meant to be "altered" by "everyone," but some of the changes are insane; it just becomes a back-and-forth game after a while. Hell, even a few of your changes are weak and biased. Anyway, it doesn't matter to me very much. I've decided to just create my own damn site, if it's so important to me that what I have to say be said fully and finally. Thanks.</p>

<p>I rewrote so that Shakirfan's fave movie appeared, but in a place where it didn't turn the paragraph as a whole into nonsense. However, I do wonder if the Govinda film was in any way a hit of the stature of Mohabbatein. Does anyone know where we can get box office stats now?</p>
<p>I should perhaps add that I might be prejudiced against Govinda. I made an effort to watch one of his movies and gave up. Of course, a lot of movies that Indians find hilarious I just find off-putting.

<p>I think some people get insanely carried away with reverting, and this might just be from a misunderstanding of how reversions are meant to work. According to Wikipedia, reversions, in general, are to be made to correct <i>vandalism,</i> not to change something because you think it's "not quite right." The goal of an article on Wikipedia is <i>not</i> "stability"; this is a Web site that is founded on plasticity, not concreteness. If you disagree with what someone has done, explain on the discussion page your reasons. Don't start chopping out major parts of an article simply because you "don't like it," or think it's "unnecessary." I realize that Wikipedia suggests that articles be of a certain "maximum length," but, in reality, "big topics" and "big people" almost always (greatly) exceed this suggestion. Amitabh Bachchan — in particular, then — is not one of the people whose page we ought to try to keep "nice and short." ...Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>That "source" for Bachchan's wearing a wig is hardly "reliable"; many of the "facts" stated on it are questionable, and the mere format and language ("Hema malini was about to get married to Jitendra when darmendra went and got her lover back et la Krishna in mahabaratha") indicate that the site is not one to be sited on an on-line encyclopaedia.

<p>I rewrote and tightened up the argument. I removed the long opening statement, but did replace it with a para that emphasized the length of Amitabh's career and the many years of his popularity. I removed a fair number of personal opinions, repeated items, and some trivia items that were part of the whole "cricket scores" mindset, in which actors are compared in terms of awards won.

<p>Pratulka restored his version of the first para as well as the "notable films" in the infobox.</p>
<p>I removed the notable films again, because picking out SOME films as notable is personal opinion. Pratulka could do some research on box office receipts, and add that to the filmography. Then it would be clear which movies were hits and which didn't do well. Pratulka could also write a para on critical views of Amitabh, with quotes from reputable reviewers re his performances in various movies, so that readers could decide which films the critics liked. Anything other than measurable box office receipts or quotes from published reviews is personal opinion. Suppose I like different Amitabh films than Pratulka does? Who gets to pick which are Amitabh's best or "notable" films?</p>
<p>As for the prose in the first para -- Pratulka's prose is convoluted and stuffy. I'm not saying that my prose is always perfect. There are some WP editors who can give my prose the once-over and improve it significantly. I just don't think Pratulka is one of them.</p>

<p>Amitabh Bachchan's seems to be one of the most under-written, scantily-packed articles of a major celebrity on Wikipedia. People like Marlon Brando and Al Pacino have much, <i>much</i> more information on their pages, while Bachchan's is restricted to a few details and a whole big "filmography." I'm not saying this to try to "compete," but to try to put things in perspective. Yes, Wikipedia is not a "fan Web page," and, as such, ought not to be filled with gushing claims, career updates, and petty trivialities. Nevertheless, Amitabh Bachchan is not a small, fly-by-night star. He's arguably one of India's greatest-ever film icons and personalities, and is even <i>currently</i> headline-news material. At the moment, there's not even a section dedicated to telling of his long-reaching status and image in the Indian film industry, let alone much about how his career has unfolded and evolved. Again, I don't mean to advocate pages and pages singing the praises of the "angry young man," but some more substance would <i>not</i> be an unwelcome, "non-encyclopaedic" contribution to this article.</p>
<p>Also, the style of writing on the page is all over the place. I feel this is inevitable, as Wikipedia is a site created and maintained by the efforts of the "many," and when a lot of people play around with one thing, some "unevenness" is bound to occur. Nonetheless, I think things could be put together more coherently, even if it means adopting a less formal tone. Objectivity — a good thing — does not have to imply formality and coldness, and I think the latter two things are exactly what haunt this piece.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<dd>We keep removing the fangush, which leaves the article a bit bare. What we could use are quotes from histories of Indian cinema, reviewers talking about his acting style, etc. But that would require some research beyond film magazines!</dd>

<p>I agree that, perhaps, the article could use a few references more "book" and less "entertainment magazine." It's not that there's not a good deal of "academic" writing concerning Bachchan, it's just that it's obviously not very popular in America, and I think most English-Wikipedia contributors are, indeed, from the United States (of course, I could be wrong about this). Certainly, if someone wants to do the leg-work, scholarly research might be able to strengthen this article. Nonetheless, even tapping into our "common" knowledge of Bachchan, I believe we can churn out a better, fuller, more interesting article than that which we currently have. I've decided to make some minor (I don't care to make major ones, only to have them inevitably wiped out by various users) alterations here and there, and I hope they spruce up this entry at least somewhat. Let's see what happens...</p>

<p>I think it's generally accepted that AB and Rekha did have an affair, but I don't see any need for the article to mention it. Both people are still alive, the sources would all be gossip magazines and "everyone knows," and any affair, if it happened, is not of much relevance to their lives and careers. If an affair ends up in divorce court or a murder charge, then it's newsworthy. Otherwise, I think it's solely the concern of the people involved and their families. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 02:13, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't know about generally "accepted"; "speculated," maybe (it's not as though either part ever came forth and said, "yeah, we did it"). Anyway, I agree that it's not something that really belongs anywhere in the article, especially as an item under "Family." If anything, <i>maybe</i> it could be placed under "Trivia," but even that's debatable.</p>

<dd>This is not a question of anyone's "opinion" of what should and shouldn't be in the article. Amitabh's affair with Rekha was a <b>notable event</b> in that he was prepared to leave his wife and family over it before he had his accident (see May 1990 issue of Stardust for example). This information ought to be re-included because it is most certainly a hallmark of his life, even as his participation in 'Silsila' was an on-screen playout of offscreen events and achieved notoriety for the same. The <b>only</b> thing you need to worry about is if information is poorly sourced. Remember, this page is an encylopaedia entry, not a fanpage. <a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkantik_d4be.html" title="User:Ekantik">Ekantik</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/k/a/User_talk%7EEkantik_16c1.html" title="User talk:Ekantik">talk</a></sup> 06:46, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Stardust magazine is not a reliable source. Film magazines will say *anything* to hook readers. If there's a well-researched bio of Amitabh published by a reputable press, with quotes from people who actually knew Amitabh and Rekha, then that might be OK to cite. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 06:50, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Zora, sometimes I wish you wouldn't rake over points that have been discussed in full elsewhere. Stardust/Cineblitz/Filmfare <b>are</b> reliable sources depending upon the particular content; they are also the <i>only</i> sources we have of what goes on in Bollywood. Interviews can be cited whereas gossip columns cannot. You yourself brought up the point about how Bollywood news is little discussed in newspapers/books. In this particular case, the May 1990 issue of Stardust is an interview with Amitabh and thus it is perfectly reliable to cite. As a matter of fact, this particular interview was <b>the</b> defining interview that took place as soon as Amitabh came out of hospital and told all about his health-scare, including telling-all about Rekha, etc. <a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkantik_d4be.html" title="User:Ekantik">Ekantik</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/k/a/User_talk%7EEkantik_16c1.html" title="User talk:Ekantik">talk</a></sup> 02:19, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>In which case take direct quotes from the interview and cite those, avoiding speculation from the interviewer. The whole point about BLP is to avoid libel and speculation. Similarly very personal events such as an affair should only be included if it has a very valid reason for inclusion, otherwise it is <strong>only</strong> the concern of those involved and not suitable topic for an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDmanning_3a1b.html" title="User:Dmanning">Dmanning</a> 03:08, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, my point exactly, thank you. The incident (affair) was notable because it was rather a big scandal at the time (possibly warranting a new 'Controversies' section), in which Amitabh was prepared to leave his wife and family for Rekha, and did not do so because he was highly impressed/guilty at the love shown by his wife during his illness. The interview is also a fantastic source for quotes about the illness itself, and is connected incontrovertibly with the affair scandal. So yes, there are valid reasons for inclusion and references for them can be cited I agree. <a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkantik_d4be.html" title="User:Ekantik">Ekantik</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/k/a/User_talk%7EEkantik_16c1.html" title="User talk:Ekantik">talk</a></sup> 03:28, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>As far as I know, it has never been verified that Amitabh Bachchan wears a wig, and, except where it's "obvious" that he's using one (e.g., in "Armaan," "Boom"), the idea is mere speculation.</p>
<p>Someone added the following:</p>
<p>"He lost his hair when he was young, so when he started his movie career he wore wig. He has tried not to appear in photos without his wig. If you look at his picture from "Zanjeer" that is his early years wig and then he changed the colour as he got older."</p>
<p>It was edited out by Dmanning with the explanation,</p>
<p>"cant find a source, just a rumour. If you re-include provide a non-blog, non-speculative source"</p>
<p>The claim is not even a "rumor"; I'm a pretty big fan of Amitabh Bachchan, and I've <i>never</i> heard this (though I've something similar about Sean Connery, numerous times). Unless there's good evidence that the guy wears a wig, or has worn one over his career, I ask that people please just stop throwing this in the article every now and then.</p>

<dd>WP has an article on the <a href="../../../b/o/f/Bofors_scandal.html" title="Bofors scandal">Bofors scandal</a>, in which Amitabh is not even named. As near as I can figure out, at the time the scandal emerged, one newspaper (not named -- the Hindu?) accused Amitabh of being involved in the scandal, apparently on the basis that he was a friend of Rajiv Gandhi and was therefore guilty. I found one Amitabh interview in which he claimed that he refuted all the accusations and forced the newspaper (unnamed) to print an apology. But I can't find any details. That is why the older version of the article was so vague.</dd>

<dd>The article as it stands seems to imply that he WAS implicated in the scandal, charged, and later exonerated. Which could be actionable, you must admit.

<p>The myesthenia gravis is more or less known fact. Just type in the illness and "Amitabh Bachchan" on a search engine, and look through the results. The Bofors Scandal is something commonly brought up when discussing Amitabh Bachchan; it is an important aspect of his political career, and thus one of his life. Whether or not the idea, as it is presented in the article, needs to be revised, I feel the scandal should at least be <i>mentioned</i> therein. Whether the article is "perfect" or isn't (for the record, I don't think it ever can be something so subjective as "perfect"), I think it's decently-written, and not in need of the type of contempt you seem to be showing for it. I'm not saying people "shouldn't" try to improve what they feel could stand to be bettered, but, in my opinion, it is currently not a badly-written article.</p>
<p>(Commando303)</p>
<p>The WP article on the Bofors scandal is not even properly written, just a stub, so whether it mentions Bachchan or not is irrelevant. However, I have some concerns about the site linked to: Wouldn't it be better to look for the original FT article rather than rely on a doubtful-looking site? I appreciate that it is the author's own website but,... hmm... <a href="../../../e/k/a/User%7EEkantik_d4be.html" title="User:Ekantik">Ekantik</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/k/a/User_talk%7EEkantik_16c1.html" title="User talk:Ekantik">talk</a></sup> 02:17, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd> : If the myesthenia gravis is a fact, then it should be referenced. As for the style -- if I were to submit that article to the copyeditors on the CEL mailing list, they would tear it to shreds. It's not a matter of disliking a certain style -- there are many prose styles that I do not like but must admit are competent. (<a href="../../../m/e/r/Mervyn_Peake_f55a.html" title="Mervyn Peake">Mervyn Peake</a>, for example.)

<p>This is a <i>Wikipedia</i> article, and, while that does not exempt it from being "well-written," I feel it does make a compelling case to be more lenient in expectations. Articles will be cohesive and flowing when authored by one or two people, and set as a "final" version. With Wikipedia, entries are constantly changed and updated by myriad different users from many, many corners of the world, where English is used in various different, "correct" ways. Further, Bachchan's is an article on a person the major audience of whom is <i>not</i> "natively English." Sure, problems arise, but I do not see this article as, by any means, "shameful" (not a quotation). The illness, I'm quite sure, is "fact," and, at most, that means it should be <i>cited</i> (sorry, but I'm sick of seeing "reference" used as a verb [just a pet peeve]), not erased.</p>
