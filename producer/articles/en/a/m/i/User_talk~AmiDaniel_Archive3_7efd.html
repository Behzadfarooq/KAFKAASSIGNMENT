<dd>Funny I was just writing "I'm sure they'll be plenty more!" and had an edit conflict with another Barnstar (the irony!) You are very welcome, just wanted you to know that your work is not only noticed, but appreciated.

<dd>I get <i>a lot</i> of inflammatory crap on my talk page ... the price we pay for fighting vandalism ... but I find it upsets people even more if you delete their remarks. I also like to think of talk pages as a sort of backlog of the user's activities as well--they show what the user's been involved in, possible conflicts he's had, how he's dealt with problems, etc.--which I don't think should ever be deleted unless it's obvious, obscene garbage or meant to deface the talk page. I do, however, see no problem with retitling remarks to things such as "Nonsense From a Vandal," as titles are key in helping me keep track of everything. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 06:32, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I got a lot of crap on my user/talk pages (obvious enough to deface the pages) probably because I have GLBT userboxes (people out there are really narrow minded) - because I can't think of any other reason for anon IPs to go after me. I just post links to the vandalisms on my user page and let people laugh at the little <a href="../../../l/a/m/Lamer.html" title="Lamer">lamers</a>.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Stop reverting/deleting useful contributions without merging them after</span></h2>
<p>On the <a href="../../../o/r/e/Oren_Patashnik_5906.html" title="Oren Patashnik">Oren Patashnik</a> article, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oren_Patashnik&amp;diff=48353016&amp;oldid=48352982" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oren_Patashnik&amp;diff=48353016&amp;oldid=48352982" rel="nofollow">this diff of your single action</a> is the worst sort of unwikipedian half-assed job.</p>
<p>Obviously, some newbie tried to contribute to the article by providing a recent photo of Patashnik, which is useful and welcome (I hadn't found a good one when creating the article). Obviously, he tried to cut-n-pasted an Image tag from another page (the BSA article) and stuff it with the external URL to the photo he wanted to contribute. Obviously, the result was a wikicode mess, yet clearly not vandalism.</p>
<p>Obviously, if you decide to take on you to revert his contribution (misguided in form, useful in content), then you also have the duty to properly finish his and your job, and integrate his useful contribution in the proper wiki format, i.e. an external link to the photo. Your simply reverting him and doing nothing else is throwing the baby out with the bathwater, deleting and rejecting a useful contribution from a newbie, and is most toroughly unwikipedian.</p>
<p>This could eventually lead one to wonder if you're not performing such half-assed job more for the quantitative benefit of increasing the boasting count on your user page, than for the qualitative benefit of the Wikipedia.</p>

<dd>Now that we have that out of the way: When I saw the edit, I reverted it as a <i>test</i> edit, which indeed it was, and left the user a message {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest_d929.html" title="Template:Test">test</a>}} that explained about the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Wikipedia%7ESandbox_ae3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Sandbox">sandbox</a>, provided a link to the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcome_4140.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcome">welcome page</a> where more help in formatting the image would be available, and encouraged him to contact me for help. What more would you have me do? Your message explained that I should have gone to the link of the image he wanted to add, saved the image to my computer, uploaded the image to Wikipedia, returned to the article, and added back the correctly formatted image. I apologize, but I'm sort of having some very stressful times right now fixing the bugs in my <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_VandalProof_1bdb.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/VandalProof">anti-vandal app</a>, working on my own projects, and dealing with my real life--I can't stop everytime I see a newbie making a mistake, but had the anon contacted me I would have gladly helped him out.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The statistics I have displayed on my userpage are there to provide an example of one of the features of my application for interested users. I keep track of such things, and encourage others to do the same, as they help <i>me</i> judge my ability to identify vandalism, let me see where I commonly make mistakes so I can avoid them in the future, and let others see that I do indeed make mistakes. If I were <b>boasting</b>, my stats would simply say "I've reverted 1007 edits," rather than "15 of those were <b>not</b> vandalism." I really do not appreciate the inference that my contributions are to increase the "quantitative boasting count" of my ego, as <i>every</i> edit I make on Wikipedia is indended to improve the quality of the site. Before you start hating the counter-vandals, stop to consider how completely <b>unusable</b> this site would be if no one were there to double-check possibly destructive edits.</dd>

<dd>Thanks. After the moderator bug happened a couple of days ago, one non-mod was able to modify the welcome page and have his changes realised within VP, and then there was some chat in IRC about how easy it would be to get by my "security." The mod bug resulted from problems in reading the page history (I'll spare you the technical details), and if someone managed to move the page along with its history, it would be very simple for <i>anyone</i> to edit the resulting redirect to include their username and have his changes realized (as well as to disable the tool for everyone else, except for me of course =)). And especially since I'm now adding this "revert all user contributions" feature in the next release, I'm getting a little concerned about abuse. S-protecting's probably not neccessary at all, but I figured it wouldn't hurt anyone; the page move protection, however, could save me and other editors a lot of headaches. If you feel the need to add the template, would it be possible to add it further down the page (in the command's section) or on the talk page? Do you list userpages on <a href="../../../p/p/_/WP%7EPP_1ffd.html" title="WP:PP">WP:PP</a>? I can think of quite a few admins with protected userpages, and it doesn't seem particularly vital to alert others when pages in userspace are protected, but I wouldn't object to your listing it there. As I said before, s-protection isn't really too necessary, so if you'd rather it just be move-protected, feel free to lift the semiprotection. Thanks again for your help! It's much appreciated. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 23:56, 15 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I checked how <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutoWikiBrowser_CheckPage_526f.html" title="Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser/CheckPage">Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser/CheckPage</a> handled protection. Basically the page was protected while it was still in the userspace and after it was moved to the project space, it still never seemed to have any of the protection templates. I don't see a problem with leaving it sprotected with no template on this page, I was just curious if you had an opinion on it. Let me know if you need anything else and I am looking forward to seeing 1.1. --<a href="../../../p/s/2/User%7EPS2pcGAMER_3063.html" title="User:PS2pcGAMER">PS2pcGAMER</a> (<a href="../../../p/s/2/User_talk%7EPS2pcGAMER_9645.html" title="User talk:PS2pcGAMER">talk</a>) 00:11, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Alright, thanks for looking into that, and thanks for your help! I'm putting the finishing touches on 1.1 and might even release it tonight (just in time for Easter!

<dd>By revert all user contributions, do you mean <b>all</b> contributions? or just all contributions to one article? <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 00:08, 16 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I explain it better on the <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_VandalProof_1bdb.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/VandalProof">main page</a>, but essentialy you can load <b>all</b> of a user's contributions within the last 100 edits anywhere on Wikipedia that are <b>on top</b> into a list where it identifies which of his/her edits were made within the last 24hrs and gives you the ability to check/uncheck edits, preview edits, etc. And then, in one click, you can revert <i>all</i> of the user's edits (unless you specify that an edit should not be reverted) to the previous version. I'm sort of afraid that the risks in making this feature available outweigh the benefits (imagine a vandal with that ability), but it's definitely useful in cases of mass vandalism from one user. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 00:17, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>Would all the edits come in at once, or would they be spaced out(such as a second apart)? I don't think it would be good to have dozens of edits all be reverted the same second. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 00:22, 16 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Why not? I could understand if this were something that would be used frequently, but as it's only going to be used in cases of vandalbots and mass vandalism that has not been cleaned up yet, it hopefully will only be used a few times a week (if even that) and will likely only revert &lt;30 edits at a time. It doesn't lag the servers at all, and it's essentially the same as going down the contribs list clicking rollback, rollback, rollback--just faster. When you're reverting all edits, you first retrieve the edits (number of edits on top, version to revert to) and then with one more click, it goes down the list one after another and reverts them to the retrieved version. It is remarkably fast, thus the dangers inherent, but when used responsibly there shouldn't be any problems with server lag, etc. Plus, if Bob reverts all of Prodego's edits, it wouldn't be too difficult for you to load his contribs and revert his reversions of your edits (after he's blocked of course). <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 00:27, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Happy Easter to all of you, and I hope that this version may fix your current problems and perhaps provide you with a few useful new tools. You can download version 1.1 at <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_VandalProof_1bdb.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/VandalProof">User:AmiDaniel/VandalProof</a>. Let me warn you, however, to please be extremely careful when using the new <i>Rollback All Contributions</i> feature, as, aside from the excessive server lag it would cause if everyone began using it at once, it could seriously aggitate several editors to have their contributions reverted. If you would like to experiment with it, though, I'd be more than happy to use my many sockpuppets to create some "vandalism" for you to revert. If you have any problems downloading, installing, or otherwise, please tell me about them at <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_VP_Bugs_64c2.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/VP/Bugs">User:AmiDaniel/VP/Bugs</a> and I will do my best to help you.

<dd>Sure. First of all you have to create the StatusDiv page (you can see mine at <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_StatusDiv_1859.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/StatusDiv">User:AmiDaniel/StatusDiv</a>) in your own userspace. The create a Status page (mine is at <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_Status_6a94.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/Status">User:AmiDaniel/Status</a>), which you then transclude on your userpage/talk page using {{User:YOUR_USERNAME/Status}}. Whenever you want to change your status, goto your status page and change the paramater to Online, Away, Busy, Sleeping, etc. If you'd like, I'd be glad to set this up for you. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 04:02, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aha, I know why. I just checked your monobook and you don't have popups installed. Unfortunately VP is currently still dependent upon popups (though I didn't know until about two days ago ... I thought autoclick and autosummary were built into WP), but later releases will be independent of it. In fact, my local version is <i>almost</i> free of popups, just a couple more hours and it'll be there. For now, you're just going to have to add {{subst:navpop}} to your monobook.js.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">VandleProof application</span></h2>
<p>It would have never occurred to me that removing a {{warn1}} from my talk would be construed as vandalism, but you are correct â it's on the vandalism link, provided in the warning. I took it as a polite warning and left it at that. At that point, what I knew of the talk page was taken from the tutorial listed on the main page. There is no mention of removing warnings being an issue. When I got the warning, I figured I knew what vandalism was and what the warning was for and haven't received a warning since. You would think that someone with subvercive intentions would receive multiple warnings, likely have been banned for a time - none of which pertain to me. My unsigned post of âha ha haâ to an IP:Talk that had committed blatant vandalism was ill considered. It was also done before becoming slightly wikiholic. I have rectified that situation by returning it to my talk page. I take my status seriously and am working to improve wikipedia. That is why a good portion of my edits have been to disambiguate such an exciting topic as <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nasal.html" title="Nasal">nasal</a>. Again, does some vandal indicate by his behavior by performing such rewarding activities?</p>
<p>I have been using popups to revert blatant vandalism. I do this for articles even where I completely disagree with the topic because I'm interested in decent contributions, not juvenile antics, despite what the âha ha haâ portrays (see <a href="../../../c/y/n/Cynthia_McKinney_087e.html" title="Cynthia McKinney">Cynthia McKinney</a> â interestingly enough, you and I reverted the same IP vandal User:71.10.160.198 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cynthia_McKinney&amp;offset=20060407201350&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cynthia_McKinney&amp;offset=20060407201350&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">6 Apr 06</a>. It took some learning and in that case, I think I had a learning-curve misfire and reverted to the wrong version â but I ultimately got it right. Thatâs when I started using Vandal Fighter, but still find that it appears others were having an easier time reverting vandalism; to wit, the summary comments that yours displayed as referenced and <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECan%27t_sleep%2C_clown_will_eat_me_7058.html" title="User:Can't sleep, clown will eat me">CSCWEM</a> (same article, subsequent reverts). Thatâs why Iâm looking for an easier to use or cleaner tool.

<dd>Let me start by saying that my remarks in no way finalized that you would <i>never</i> be allowed to use VP. I should have made that more explicit in my remark, and I apologize. It would be quite extremist and absurd for me to "ban" individuals from using my app simply because they removed a {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest1_2f2b.html" title="Template:Test1">test1</a>}} notice, and that was in no way my intent. I merely wanted to let you know that many contributors, myself included, frown at removing warnings as such actions appear dishonest and unwikipedian. There's currently a <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#Is_removing_warnings_from_your_own_user_talk_page_an_act_of_vandalism.3F" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">debate</a> going on about this very issue, and it's likely that we will soon see a policy change. Despite my earlier comment, I actually don't believe removing warnings to be an act of vandalism, though I do believe it should not be tolerated. And, as an aside, the edit summary was simply a really bad joke on my behalf that I never considered anyone would read (see <a href="../../../s/o/u/Soup_Nazi_b05d.html" title="Soup Nazi">Soup Nazi</a>), and was in no way intended for you to read. Again, I apologize.</dd>

I do now believe that your intentions are good; however, you are still lacking the substantial evidence to prove this (i.e. your relative inactivity within Wikipedia), but I think I will likely make an exception in this case. I was actually in about the same boat as you when I began writing this tool, so I entirely understand where you're coming from. But anyway, I'm on my way to bed right now, but tomorrow evening I will have decided what to do (perhaps after some discussion with my fellow moderators). However, if you are rejected, I do strongly encourage you to resubmit your name in a couple of weeks, once you have more evidence to support your intentions.</dd>

<p>I have a question as well. Apparently the edit counter is having problems because I have edited numerous articles and fought several acts of vandalism over the past few days and there is no change in the number of edits. I asked about the counter changing and was told there were problems. As you can see from contributions I have numerous over the past request since my last request. I am concerned with fighting vandalism on this site but for some reason my edit count stays at 243 as you said before just shy of me making the 250. But this sems to be a problem with the counter.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElohimgenius_7400.html" title="User:Elohimgenius">Gnosis</a> 18:06, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, the toolserver is officially down, and likely for quite some time. However, if the edit count replicated by the toolserver is below the 250 mainspace mark, I then load up flcelloguy's tool (which is independent of the toolserver, though much slower and less user-friendly) to look at the user's count, and in any case, I typically look more at the user's recent contributions to see what kind of activity s/he has been involved in, as that truly matters more that how many edits s/he's wracked up. The official "policy" is 250 <i>mainspace</i> edits, but that was just added after one user applied with 300 edits to his own userspace and only a few in mainspace. If a user is lacking on mainspace but has a considerable ammount of project-/wikipedia-space edits, etc., it likely won't matter that s/he was "below the bar," so to speak. Decisions are ultimately based upon whether or not the user has enough evidence to be able to trust him/her or not with the tool. I certainly don't feel that edit count says much about a user's quality or character, but a certain number of edits are necessary to be able to make an adequate judgement. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 01:26, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's actually written in VB6, believe it or not. It's something that, if I could start all over, I would likely write in C (though my C's a bit rusty lately), but after I started it in VB, it kept growing and growing until it became what it is today. Honestly, VB's not that horrible of a language--I work freelance as a VBA and ActiveX developer, mainly for AutoCAD and other engineering tools, which is why I'm pretty comfortable with the language. The only problem with VB is that it makes it too easy to get sloppy with the code (which often leads to serious headaches later on), and distributing it is an absolute bitch (so many dll's, ocx's, and other nonsense). But if you're interested in how it works, I'd be glad to provide some insight and code snipplets; however, I'm not going to go opensource with it until I can bring it to a stable version (I actually just began writing it about three weeks ago, so it's quite a baby of an application). <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 01:33, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, didn't know your app required user2 to be the way it was. I won't change it back since it isn't that big of a deal to remove it but since the toolserver tool doesn't have much of a notice (only regular sized blinking text) that it is becoming increasingly out of date due to not getting new data I figured that it was misleading to have the toolserver count link up on the template. Since this is a global template I'd also suggest changing wherever possible in your code to point to a user subpage template version and change your subpages as such since that will prevent any future problems just in case the template ever needs to be modded in the future. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 01:38, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'm now scrambling, as I believe many are, to eliminate my dependency upon the toolserver count, and I will no longer need the template in the next release. It sure would have been nice if <i>someone</i> would have let us know that en would no longer replicate data on the toolserver though! A lot of devs making rash decisions without warning anyone beforehand.

<dd>Yes, the notify contributors function was intended to be used to alert contributors that their articles have been nominated for deletion, etc., though I also use in mass posting updates about VandalProof and welcoming users. Thanks for offering your help, and it may well be needed. If anything, programmers of all languages tend to have a keen eye for recognizing common causes of bugs and whatnot, so your help could greatly be needed in helping users with bugs and technical problems they're having. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 03:06, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Interiot's Tool 2 doesn't work for me (it needs FireFox), and from what I understand, it does more or less the same thing as Flcelloguy's tool, meaning it takes a long time to process on many users. How do you mean that it didn't work? It can't count more than 5000 edits, but as long as you set the limit high enough and below 5000 it should return an exact count (though the whole point of the tool was that you can set it much lower to see simply if the user has x amount of edits or not). <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 16:06, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Re: Why did you move this policy?!</span></h2>
<p>I moved the page because the <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia_talk%7ERestrictions_on_Anonymous_Editing_from_Shared_IPs_AOL_Prohibition_76f9.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Restrictions on Anonymous Editing from Shared IPs/AOL Prohibition">talk page</a> had recently seemed to be moved, but the content page had not, leaving to a talk page with a red/uncreated project page. I assumed that the person who moved the page had simply forgotten to move the proposal page along with this; with the many discussions on renaming the proposal and the title not indicative that the page was supposed to be a subpage of the original proposal, I didn't realize that the talk had simply been moved to an archive. I apologize for this error and will rectify it immediately.

<p>Hey Ami... as the user who greeted me to Wikipedia more than a month ago, I thought I should go to you for this... My username (Ardo Melnikov) is that of a fictional character from the Starcraft Book series. Specifically, the book <a href="../../../s/p/e/Starcraft%7E_Speed_of_Darkness_e8e0.html" title="Starcraft: Speed of Darkness">Starcraft: Speed of Darkness</a>. As the character I stole my name from is the main name of the character in the book, if I created that article, would it be construed as a Vanity article, even if I am not the character in question?</p>

<dd>Technically, vanity is not a reason for an article to be deleted (see <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>); however, I'm sure that such a contribution would cause several editors to raise some eyebrows, myself included. The real question in deleting an article is typically whether or not the topic is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> enough to warrant an article, not who wrote it. Often times, however, when the username is closely related to the topic of the article, it is regarded by same as fancruft, which typically leads to it being deleted, yet I would say that if the article is well-written and about a notable-enough topic, your username should not matter. That being said, you might want to consider <a href="../../../c/h/a/Wikipedia%7EChanging_username_3d5c.html" title="Wikipedia:Changing username">changing your username</a>, as it's often a bad idea to name yourself after a notable character/person. <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUsername_0c30.html" title="Wikipedia:Username">Wikipedia:Username</a> states that you should not "use the real name of well-known figure, especially one still living, unless you are that person," and it is typically encouraged that you use your own name or something close to it (i.e. my name is Daniel Cannon, but my pseudonym here is AmiDaniel).

<dd>Ahh!! Sorry... I'm truly not ignoring you, just really overwhelmed at the moment. Actually, VP is not .net (I sort of despise the .net revolution, as I find VS6 to be the best ever released), but I would still be curious to see source code if you don't mind. But on the same topic as the GPL mess, I'd just have to make sure that, before including anything of it into my code, that you will allow me to use it in my app without it being GPL, that your app is not GPL, and that it does not use source code from a GPL app. I really hate all this legal bullshit, and you can see more of the fight over GPL at <a href="../../../a/v/i/User_talk%7EAvillia_20cb.html" title="User talk:Avillia">User talk:Avillia</a> and <a href="../../../b/l/u/User_talk%7EBluemoose_d44d.html" title="User talk:Bluemoose">User talk:Bluemoose</a>.

<dd>I agree that it wouldn't hurt, but it means a lot more work for me. I sort of made it hard on myself to add moderators--they each have to be added by hand, and there is a certain limit on the number that it can handle (likely around 15 or so). I'll add you and Fetofs to the list sometime though. Sorry for not noticing the above comment from you and him--messages left for me when I'm offline occasionally go unanswered or answered by someone other than me because I just don't notice them.

<dd>Perhaps you should program in a list of moderators, like the approved list, but it would check the last version by you?

<p>I quote from the definition of vandalism : "Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Apparent bad-faith edits that do not make their bad-faith nature inarguably explicit are not considered vandalism at Wikipedia. For example, adding an opinion once is not vandalism â it's just not helpful, and should be removed or restated."</p>
<p>My addition was a good-faith effort to improve the entry, and Srikeit overstepped the mark in my opinion calling it vandalism. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../1/9/5/User%7E195.188.152.12.html" title="User:195.188.152.12">195.188.152.12</a> (<a href="../../../1/9/5/User_talk%7E195.188.152.12.html" title="User talk:195.188.152.12">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_195.188.152.12_c8ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/195.188.152.12">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>LMAO! I seem to keep getting into trouble with my edit summaries being misunderstood. Like, when I can't think of an appropriate summary of my edits on a talk page that don't really need explaining I just type in a random song lyric from a song I'm listening to...seems to aggitate some people. It's nice to know I've got someone watching out for my every mistake though! lol <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 02:39, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hey, I'm trying to find all your mistakes in your program, why not fix the programmer too!!!

<dd>Lol, yes, I realize that! It's so hard to illustrate sarcasm when typing, even with the appropriate smilies. Well, I need all the fixing I can get!

<dd>Most definitely, especially if you'd be willing to deal with putting bug alerts, fixes for common problems, etc. on the Welcome Page. We're slowly starting to reach the technical limitations on how many moderators VP can handle, but one or two more should still be okay.

<dd>(Joining the conversation; I hope no one will find this gauche.) If the information at <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela_Shelton_e489.html" title="Angela Shelton">Angela Shelton</a> can be verified (it's largely unsourced), I'd be inclined to remove your {{prod}} from <a href="../../../s/e/a/Searching_for_Angela_Shelton_42fd.html" title="Searching for Angela Shelton">Searching for Angela Shelton</a>, inasmuch as the documentary would likely be notable if indeed Shelton appeared to promote it on <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Oprah_Winfrey_Show_2f44.html" title="The Oprah Winfrey Show">The Oprah Winfrey Show</a></i>; I do think a case could likely be essayed for a simple redirect from the documentary to the Shelton article, since the article covers the documentary in much greater detail, but it is likely preferable that the detailed info instead be moved to the documentary article. In any case, I'll look into it tomorrow when I have a bit more time. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:46, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The information in both the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela_Shelton_e489.html" title="Angela Shelton">Angela Shelton</a> and Searching for Angela articles is taken largely from her official website (bearing in mind copyright laws). However, I did happen to see the 48 Hours special, myself, which resulted in my buying the movie. I just updated the page and included links to both the Searching for Angela Shelton website and a link to purchase the video.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">underoath edit</span></h2>
<p>hey - sorry about not leaving an edit summary, i went to change back my edits soon after anyways...i had read online that the band prefered to have their name formatted in all caps, similar to how the band dredg is always formatted in all lower-case. I then soon after found that it has also been presented in various forms of formatting (underOATH, for example), and therefore would probably be best left as it was, in standard form. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.233.86.112 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.233.86.112.html" title="User talk:24.233.86.112">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.233.86.112_f87b.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.233.86.112">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>No problem. I was actually just testing a feature of my app, and your userpage happened to be the lucky number seven! Your userpage sure does get vandalized a lot, which, in my opinion, is a sign that you're on the right side! :-P <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 07:51, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>They are so funny, especially when you are fighting vandals or finding bugs, (up to 3 more!!!, but I am waiting for the new version, as I suspect that these will be solved, <font size="-3">plus they are really obscure</font>) anyway here is a sample of the latest time you made me laugh!!!</p>

<p>For what it's worth, I wasn't expecting 70 supports. I wasn't even expecting 70 total votes. Right now, I'm hovering around the 70% mark, and odds are probably against me being promoted on this effort, but I've learned a lot of valuable things through vote interactions such as yours. We'll see what happens, but I thank you for taking the time to post a question for me there, and the kind words on my talk page. <a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwatjester_64b9.html" title="User:Swatjester"><font color="red">â</font></a> <a href="../../../s/w/a/User_talk%7ESwatjester_ad13.html" title="User talk:Swatjester"><font face="Euclid Fraktur"><font color="black">SWAT</font><font color="goldenrod">Jester</font></font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Swatjester_088b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Swatjester"><small><sup>Ready</sup></small></a> <a href="../../../r/s/t/RSTA_5dcc.html" title="RSTA"><small>Aim</small></a> <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_United_States_Armed_Forces_74b7.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject United States Armed Forces"><small><sub>Fire!</sub></small></a> 05:55, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I thought I should ask you first. I would like to reorganize your bug page, grouping "fixed"("addressed" <i>i.e. in next version</i>) bugs togather and "unfixed" bugs in another group. Let me know what you think, but this change will make the page more readable. (then as we move to new versions of the program I or you can move old bugs into an archive)</p>

<dd>I didn't think so either.
