<p>Hi Amibidhrohi, and welcome to Wikipedia! You seem very knowledgeable about Islam, and I therefore wondered if you would mind taking a look at <a href="../../../w/i/v/Template%7EWivesMuhammad_d289.html" title="Template:WivesMuhammad">Template:WivesMuhammad</a>. There's a discussion going on at <a href="../../../w/i/v/Template_talk%7EWivesMuhammad_5240.html" title="Template talk:WivesMuhammad">Template talk:WivesMuhammad</a> regarding which of the women were wives and which not, and whether the header on it should be "wives of Muhammad," "women known as wives of Muhammad," or "consorts of Muhammad." It would be very helpful if you could leave your opinion on the talk page if you have time. And welcome again. It's good to have you with us.&#160;;-) Cheers, <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:30, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You're absolutely incompetent. I'll ask you what I asked before: Did you even bother reading WHY I'm editing the CNN page? The two people whom you've sided with are adding allegations to claim CNN has a pro-liberal bias; they're essentially adding what amounts to "original research", their cited sources do not actually make the allegations they've posted on the entry. The POV here is not MINE. I've edited the article to reflect both my claims that CNN failed to cover the pre-war intelligence properly (a controversy acknowleged BY CNN reporters, and those of their claims that are supported by the sources. How about you tell me exactly what my POV slant is? I'm only slanted towards having the article reflect factually accurate information. This is the second time you've banned me, though you've shown nothing to suggest you're even conscious as to what's going on in the page.You could have posted a line or two on the discussion page before taking such offensive action. You could have attempted speaking to me via e-mail or my talk page. You're not a participant in the CNN discussion page and you haven't made any edits to the article recently. You're incompetent.<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibidhrohi_5525.html" title="User:Amibidhrohi">Amibidhrohi</a> 22:26, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>A more detailed response to the 31 hr bans:</b></p>
<p>My justifications for deleting that mess on the CNN page is detailed on the CNN talk page. POV is a secondary concern when the information added constitutes <i><b>original research</b></i> and their sources do not support the text being posted on the entry. I've kept everything that is backed by a reasonably cited source on the page.</p>
<p>Until I began editing the entry, the heading sentence that precedes the allegations (under bullets) read:</p>
<p><i><b>"CNN has come under criticism by conservatives for alleged liberal bias. Critics have claimed that CNN's reporting contains liberal editorializing within news stories, and have jokingly referred to CNN as the "Clinton News Network," the "Communist News Network," or "Clearly Not Neutral". Conservatives point to the following as evidence of the alleged bias:"</b></i></p>
<p>This opening sentence had been reverted to by both Ronmexico and Aaron despite its highly POV meaning. If you can't see the POV in that, well...</p>
<p>The bullet points uder it use various sites of sources, all but one fail to imply that CNN was actually baised.</p>
<p>I removed that opening sentence because of its POV nature and those bulleted points under it that were constructed from the <i><b>original research</b></i> of the WP editors who added them. How is my removing them amounting to POV? When one of the claims from that list were finally backed by a source that actually made the allegation posted on the WP entry, the Lou Dobbs paragraph, I kept it, along with the opening line.</p>
<p>I added one other allegation that amounted to criticism levied by the another side (not necessarily liberal), that being that critics claim the media, including CNN, dealt with the Bush administrative with 'kid gloves' (quoting the article cited) after the 9-11 tragedy, and particularly in dealing with pre-war intelligence. In the paragraph I added, I didn't even make a claim that this amounted to bias of any kind, but rather intimidation of CNN. How is that 'highly POV'?</p>
<p>I'd like to phrase my understanding in a nicer tone, but since accuracy trumps niceness...Ronmexico and Aaron are so delusional under their political ideological allegiance that anything that claims anything other than that CNN is part of some liberal cabal amounts to POV. My very last post before you had me banned included most of their allegations in addition to mine. Not because I felt the information they stand behind is any more credible than before, but merely as a compromise. If having the article being 100% credible isn't an option, 50% credible and 50% rubbish will just have to do. And you STILL blocked me.</p>
<p><i><b>As for Celestianpower, as an NPOV admin, I hope you wouldn't mind telling me whom I'd have to consult over having your administrative powers revoked. You're a poor administrator here, not up to the task of handling disputes on Wikipedia. You didn't participate on the CNN page, you didn't ask me about my edits, you didn't warn me regarding the block. You've shown nothing to demonstrate you were aware of the conflict on the entry, much less that you're a credible authority to be silencing people on the basis of your findings.

<p>Congratulations. Finally a block on actual grounds. No contest. Everyone I've talked to pretty much reassured me that the RfC is a useless exercise, so I stuck to addressing the offender directly. Of course, I knew eventually that'd get me in another block. So no ill will on this. I'll pass on reading the Wikijunk though. Wikipedia is a game. Nothing about the admins qualify them to be in their position other than popular support, whatever the grounds. A few admins I've come across aren't even up to the task of making unbiased reviews of literature and editing properly. The admin you say I'm harassing (in the interest of not making a personal criticism, I won't name him) is an exceptionally bad example, and if you'd review the whole situation including all my commentary of the matter, you'll know. But of course, you probably wont. You're welcome. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibidhrohi_5525.html" title="User:Amibidhrohi">Amibidhrohi</a> 19:07, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That particular comment was from an e-mail I sent him to his gmail account. He chose to copy from his account and post that e-mail on his talk page. I know it seems pretty harsh, but I do get a bit angry when someone puts a sum of 62 hours of blocks on me without giving me the benefit of explaining myself. Not to mention that there is nothing in the Wikipedia rules that justify the second block (he cited POV as his reason though he later stated he felt no obligation to actually read my edits, acknowleged I didn't post more than 3 edits on the same page, and to my knowlege none of them were reverts). Anyhow, I presumed Wikipedia didn't enforce rules on communications made outside of the Wikipedia webspace. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibidhrohi_5525.html" title="User:Amibidhrohi">Amibidhrohi</a> 20:02, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>From what I read here and in other pages, I can tell that obviously an user eager to share his knowledge with other users has gotten in the way of an extremely arrogant admin and one who can't take criticism. The thing about reverting an article can be seen from various points of view. Either you reverted the article in order to POV it or Celestianpower reverted it to delete info given by you which he/she/it didn't like. You wanted your info back on the page but Celesty didn't let you. Maybe in this case it wasn't even who started the edit war but it was him/her/it. I wished that instead of abusing your powers as an admin to start an RfC against an innocent user he/she/it would have tried to THINK first. He/she/it provoked you by first banning you twice then not answering at all when you wanted to know what he/she/it was up to, and then trying to worm around telling you why he/she/it thought his contributiion was POV. Celesty is clearly not as good an admin as he/she/it seems to think. Well, at least your account wasn't deleted.&#160;;) --<a href="../../../8/9/2E/User%7E89.54.243.112.html" title="User:89.54.243.112">89.54.243.112</a> 14:17, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For Christ's sake, buzz off. Why isn't there a WP:Competence? Two thirds of the editors here are either severely biased or mentally disabled (out of deference to <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and WP:Be-A-Pussy I won't call them retarded), and it seems that it's from amongst their rank that admins are selected. I put 7 sources, several notable publications in which Ann Coulter's commentary was directly deemed racist. 7 sources for two Fing sentences! My entry did not directly accuse her of racism but pointed out that many people DO see her comments as racist. Totally within the standards that would be acceptable to any NPOV article. A legit bit of information to include, particularly after the "rag-head" comment. All that is deleted by one of your fellow Ann Coulter devotees. While a massive segment of people consider her to be a blatant racist, the entry does not allow the inclusion of the fact that those opinions exist. I don't suppose you'd bother to add it back in? No...You're rule of thumb is to delete <i>anything</i> that could be understood of lessening the credibility of Herr Coulter. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibidhrohi_5525.html" title="User:Amibidhrohi">Amibidhrohi</a> 03:04, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oooookay. Not exactly sure where <i>that</i> came from. I was just saying you may want to be careful saying things like "<i>Is Wikipedia the place where the geeks who got beaten up in high school come to finally role-play as bullies?</i>". I wasn't saying anything about Coulter, sources, or racism. I'm not sure why you brought that back up. I was refering to things you have said which can lead to bad places (like you being blocked or banned). No one really wants to see that happen, so I was just gently reminding you to remain calm and polite. I'm sorry you feel I was harassing you, I was only trying to help.

<dd>Amibidhrohi, nobody ever objected to you including information about charges of racism against Ann Coulter. What we objected to was you trying to make those the focus of the page. You did everything but change the page name to Ann "Racist" Coulter. There is a place for the things you wanted to include, and everybody was and remains willing to work with you on including them in a responsible manner. -<a href="../../../s/y/b/User%7ESyberghost_ec6f.html" title="User:Syberghost">Syberghost</a> 21:16, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I went back and read our little discussion from last night and have come to the conclusion that you are probably right. However, calling me disingenuous is fairly hurtful. I meant everything I said. I was pretty wrong, but I meant them. I am sorry to see you blocked for 3RR. While I admit you were probably right, you need to realise that blogs are not a "wonder source" since any moron can go out and start a blog. You also need to realise that while you were not explicitly saying "Coulter a racist", you <i>were</i> doing it implicitly. How can someone say racist things if they are not a racist? By labeling the section "Racist comments", you are pushing readers to a certain point of view that isn't very nice. Yes, I have no idea what Coulter is thinking, but neither do you. I think an example of what I'm trying to say is the <a href="../../../g/n/a/GNAA_29cf.html" title="GNAA">GNAA</a>. Is what these people say racist? Or is it just trolling? Or <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa_Lampanelli_e88a.html" title="Lisa Lampanelli">Lisa Lampanelli</a> (or <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denis_Leary_575f.html" title="Denis Leary">Denis Leary</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlos_Mencia_f260.html" title="Carlos Mencia">Carlos Mencia</a>, etc.)... is what she says racist? Or is it just comedy? I think someone can utter naughty words and still not be racist. It is the meaning behind the words that matters. Coulter's goal is to be controversial and funny (would you disagree?). She likes provoking a response from those she disagrees with (trolling). And yes, the thing about hyperbole and sarcasm should be cited. I hope we can come to an amicable solution to this.

<dd>I keep count of my Rs. The article is full of editorial junk. The Qur'an describing Abraham as a Muslim is anti-semitic? Aren't Jews supposed to be the decendants of Judah, who is in turn a decendant of Abraham? The dhimmi treatment of non-Muslims was harsh across the board, more so for pagans than Jews or Christians. As such, while Muslim empires might be guilty of Muslim-supremacy, the allegation that they were specifically anti-semetic is wrong. An RfC or more serious approach may be the only solution to this problem. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibidhrohi_5525.html" title="User:Amibidhrohi">Amibidhrohi</a> 23:12, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I suggest that you make only a few edits at a time. Making too many edits will confuse everyone and worsen the situatuion.

<p>Actually, Amibidhrohi didn't vandalize. To Amibidhrohi: What Timothy Usher (or anyone) puts on his/her page is solely his/her business. It makes no difference to wikipedia what he/she writes on his/her page. According to both the Quran and hadith, it's always better to refrain from idle talk.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 22:15, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Good job Amibidhrohi! Timothy Usher should first learn to respect anon editors and not to make false accusations. I doubt he has ever read <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a>. I am sure he has just made up the following strict rule to play the role of an innocent person: "the strict rule on my user talk page is, don't alter your comments after others have responded to them" He has done his homework well. <a href="../../../7/0/2E/User%7E70.231.233.118.html" title="User:70.231.233.118">70.231.233.118</a> 03:33, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Firstly, I don't consider myself Muslim. Though I was raised Muslim, I don't really believe in the religion, and I have a particular frustration with the Muslim people generally. To be honest, I think Muslims do tend to stand out as the most apathetic and cold hearted people amongst religions and nations. They're pathetic. That's my personal sentiment, so I hope nobody takes offense to it. I would be grateful if you didn't use Qur'an or Hadith to attempt regulating my behavior here. I do see an clear effort here to smear Islam and all things regarding Muslims, and I feel that kind of bigotry needs to be handled. In the spirit of being fair and neutral, not Muslim solidarity as Timothy had put it. It's unfortunate, but I suppose a testament to their uselessness that, that most Muslims don't care enough to address problems such as the rising movement of bigotry against them. I've participatd both in critisizing Islam, particularly the philosophies and actions of Islamist organizations, and defending it when I felt information was being arranged, malevolently, with the intent of pushing the anti-Muslim POV - mostly because the Muslims can't be trusted to speak for themselves. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibidhrohi_5525.html" title="User:Amibidhrohi">Amibidhrohi</a> 22:46, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Most Muslims don't care enough to address problems such as the rising movement of bigotry against them because the few who realize this fail to illuminate others.

<dd>Well, I've taken the trouble to wake a few people up. What response? Nothing. The Jews took note, and have taken every measure to stop me. They're an active bunch of snots. Why do I bother? Because I'm brown skinned and have an arabic-ish sounding name. I'm grouped with this world community of imbeciles whether I like it or not. For islamophobes life is quite easy. Persecuting Muslims is as easy as hunting bison. Why do Noam Chomskys need to speak in their defense? Why do liberal anglos need to speak up for Muslim rights? Why are Muslims reliant on Western media to speak out on their behalf? Muslims used to rule over nations. Now Muslims carry on as if they'd been castrated by the West. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibidhrohi_5525.html" title="User:Amibidhrohi">Ami Bidhrohi</a> 04:13, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think one problem is that I, as a typical Muslim, don't know anything about it (and I am still confused actually). Can you please give me the link for the Noam Chomskys's talk? Thanks. <a href="../../../7/0/2E/User%7E70.231.233.118.html" title="User:70.231.233.118">70.231.233.118</a> 04:26, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's never too late to learn. Noam Chomsky is a political thinker (amongst many things), not a religious one. He does speak often on Palestine though. You could try looking up his books, he's written quite a few. You can also find videos of his out there. Good stuff. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibidhrohi_5525.html" title="User:Amibidhrohi">Ami Bidhrohi</a> 05:33, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey, why don't you write a section about it on the talk page of The Muslim Guild? (In more details of course&#160;;) ) <a href="../../../7/0/2E/User%7E70.231.233.118.html" title="User:70.231.233.118">70.231.233.118</a> 04:30, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>That wouldn't really be worth the trouble. I come here now and then, I'm not a consistent Wikiphile. I don't see why Muslims these days are so docile. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmibidhrohi_5525.html" title="User:Amibidhrohi">Ami Bidhrohi</a> 05:33, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
