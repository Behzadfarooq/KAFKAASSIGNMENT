<p>Now that the computer with VandalProof and the Query program is connected to the net again, I did some poking. <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple.html" title="Apple">Apple</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_dc78.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for creation">Wikipedia:Articles for creation</a> got results like charm.

<dd>Hmmm, I think I may have found the problem. Somehow I input that %2F should be converted to a colon (":") rather than a slash("/"). Is it erroring when you start the query or when you initially load the page? I can't understand wonder why this would make a difference upon <i>loading</i> the page. Let me play around a little bit, and once I think I have it fixed I'll upload a patch.

<dd>(Vomits at the sound of Metallica) You should really try some better music. Though I would note that, as much as I detest Metallica, I really like <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalyptica.html" title="Apocalyptica">Apocalyptica</a>'s covers of Metallica's songs, like "Fade to Black", "For Whom the Bell Tolls", and "One"--you may want to check them out when you get the chance. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 01:21, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I mean the old Metallica, not the new one. If you still vomit, you, sir, are dead to me. No, you aren't, you're free to like what you like <tt>:)</tt>. And besides, I like a lot of artists, including the better ones such as Queen, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppellin, Rush (note: vomiting at any of those may cause me to go get admin powers and block you). Anyway, I'm gonna go hunt down these covers you speak of.

<dd>(edit conflict) Queen's decent, Floyd's a little annoying at times but still good, Zeppelin never did much for me, and Rush is alright. None of them make me vomit quite like Metallica--I probably wouldn't mind them as much if <i>everyone</i> wasn't so damn obsessed with them. But yes, the old Metallica, prior to the black album, was a hellofalot better, though still not great. I'm a much stronger fan of German bands like Rammstein (obviously), <a href="../../../l/e/t/Letzte_Instanz_5986.html" title="Letzte Instanz">Letzte Instanz</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subway_to_Sally_5466.html" title="Subway to Sally">Subway to Sally</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/_/In_Extremo_8156.html" title="In Extremo">In Extremo</a>, etc., and I also like a lot of Ami bands like Manson (only during Twiggy's years with the band though; everything else was/is shit), <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rasputina.html" title="Rasputina">Rasputina</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shadows_Fall_f12d.html" title="Shadows Fall">Shadows Fall</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machine_Head_%28band%29_768b.html" title="Machine Head (band)">Machine Head (band)</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/l/Killswitch_Engage_0eb2.html" title="Killswitch Engage">Killswitch Engage</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Doors_4c4f.html" title="The Doors">The Doors</a>, etc. If you like <i>real</i> metal, not the "metal" that Metallica is known for, you should check out some Swedish melodic death metal bands like <a href="../../../i/n/_/In_Flames_4e68.html" title="In Flames">In Flames</a> (one of the best live shows I've ever seen, I might add). Anyway, I could go on and on and on about music, so don't get me started&#160;:-). Long story short, you have bad taste in music, but at least you're not leaving WP! <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>)</dd>

<dd>Bad taste in music? Well, I never! <tt>:P</tt> Floyd are Gods, I point to Echoes as an example, or Atom Heart Mother, or Wish You Were Here; I like Rammstein, and no offence to them but they add a little hilarity into their music. The Doors, however, are awesomeness in a spoon. Oh, and <i>real</i> metal is <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steppenwolf.html" title="Steppenwolf">Steppenwolf</a>, who defined the sound. They, too, are one of my favorites. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_of_Puppets_db54.html" title="User:Master of Puppets">Master of Puppets</a> <a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_of_Puppets_098b.html" title="User talk:Master of Puppets"><span style="font-variant:Small-caps;color:;"><sup>FREE BIRD!</sup></span></a> 01:43, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Alright, "Wish You Were Here" (and Rasputina's cover) was freakin' incredible, along with "Darkside of the Moon" and the entirety of <i>The Wall</i>. Not offended by the fact the R+ adds humor to their music; that's what I like about it--they take it seriously but they don't have their heads so far up their ass that they can't have fun. Steppenwolf I'm not too familiar with, though I have heard some of their stuff. I'll have to get back to you on that one. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 01:52, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Speaking of which, someone needs to close that RfA. Oh [AmiDaniel], if you need any help with your [soon to be] new admin abilities (I assume not, since you were a sysop on test.wikipedia), let me know, anything, from range blocks to selective deletions, I know how to do it. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 01:40, 30 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Will do. I've been patiently waiting for the 'crats to close it, but I guess I'll just have to wait some more&#160;:-). Now back to the master there, if you want Apocalyptica with drums you should check out their stuff from Reflections, where they brought in the drummer from <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slayer.html" title="Slayer">Slayer</a> (I can't think of his name at the moment). I didn't care to much for the album as I was really amazed by their earlier cello work, but they also ventured quite a bit beyond Metallica, to cover artists like Floyd, with that album. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 01:42, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And actually [Prodego:], I'll probably need some help figuring out how to do range blocks. I know there's something I have to append to my monobook.css, but I forget what. I haven't really played around with those on the test wiki, so I would definitely appreciate some assistance with that. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 01:45, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm liking this cello work, pretty cool.

<dd>We don't in America either. They were somewhat well-known in Germany (and they actually played Ozzfest, though no one here knew them), and I'm absolutely in love with their music. Especially their work from <i>Soundtrack to Your Escape</i> and <i>The Jester Race</i>. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 01:48, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Range blocks do not require you to add anything to your monobook file (it is in the sitewide file). I can explain it to you; do you use g-mail? Also do you know how the Mediawiki namespace works? <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 02:00, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh really? I thought I read somewhere that you had to add something to some file somewhere. I get (to some extent) how to edit within the MediaWiki namespace, though I've only made <a href="http://test.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?offset=&amp;limit=50&amp;target=AmiDaniel&amp;title=Special%3AContributions&amp;namespace=8" class="external text" title="http://test.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?offset=&amp;limit=50&amp;target=AmiDaniel&amp;title=Special%3AContributions&amp;namespace=8" rel="nofollow">one edit</a> myself. I don't have g-mail, but you can send me a message on hotmail. Let me first go read that over again and see if I can figure it out myself before I have take up more of your time with it. Thanks for your help though! <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 02:03, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, woops I just got confused. That line has to be added to LocalSettings.php, but that's nothing I have to deal with, is it? Can I just input 142.177.0.0/16 as the IP address to block and have it block that entire range? <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 02:07, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Yes. (Note though that that would block a huge range of addresses, the max allowed by Wikipedia). You may want to get g-mail, it hides your IP address when you send e-mail, and some people do try to stalk admins in real life. Also, <a href="../../../a/l/l/Special%7EAllmessages_6f04.html" title="Special:Allmessages">Special:Allmessages</a> is indespesible when editing the MediaWiki namespace. However, I have only made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?offset=&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Prodego&amp;title=Special%3AContributions&amp;namespace=8" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?offset=&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Prodego&amp;title=Special%3AContributions&amp;namespace=8" rel="nofollow">thirteen edits</a> to the Mediawiki pages myself. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProdego_6b33.html" title="User:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen"><i>Prodego</i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProdego_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Prodego"><font color="darkgreen">talk</font></a></sup> 02:11, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for your inputs on <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subbhulaksmi.html" title="Subbhulaksmi">Subbhulaksmi</a>.... Maybe people do misspell that way.. I guess we'll retain the pages. Alternatively, is it possible to find the number of hits to the page in the past year or so? That could tell us if it's an important typo. Nevertheless, I don't think it's such a problem to retain it. Regards:<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarthik.raman_590e.html" title="User:Karthik.raman">Karthik.raman</a> 05:07, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is one rather complicated method to figure out the number of hits a page gets, but I can't recall it off-hand at the moment. Generally, the philosophy on redirects is that redirects are cheap and should only be deleted if they are cross-namespace or rather absurd alternate spellings. You can read more about that on <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERfD_9250.html" title="WP:RfD">redirects for deletion</a> page. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 05:10, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have not seen a policy not permitting that, Is there one that i have missed? Feedyourfeet 08:19, 30 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Done. I've also restored the edit history of the article in the mainspace--in the future, please contact me before recreating content. As for your talk page, it is considered very bad form to remove any messages without properly archiving them. Typically pages are only archived at around 32kb+, not every time a message comes in, and it is very frustrating to others to have their messages immediately deleted after being posted. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 08:23, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Problems with installing VandalProof.</span></h2>
<p>Hello! I hope you are fine. I think I have a problem installing this software. Whenever, I try to install this, the message <i>Setup cannot continue because some system files are out of date on your system. Click OK if you like setup to update these system files for you now. You will need to restart Windows before you can run setup again. Click cancel to exit setup without updating system files.</i> However, when I re-start my PC, this proble still persists. And how do I find out if I already have the necessary system files installed? I am using Windows ME and I have IE installed on my computer. However, when I surf the net, I use <i>Crazy Browser</i>. The version of my IE is later than 5.5. I think that I have a Me installer problem. And how do I install the necessary components? If this does not work on my PC, I would find it relatively hard to fight vandalism in Wikipedia. Is there any other way to do this? I am very keen to help out, so I hope that you can give me hints on how to combat vandalism by using this software or is there another way?

<p>What's with your removal of my db-band on this article? It looks like a real band article, true, but if you look closely you may notice that the band has never had a charting release or been signed to a real label, and in short fails any criterion of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. <span style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration:none"><a href="../../../m/g/e/User%7EMgekelly_7b5b.html" title="User:Mgekelly">mg</a></span><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/g/e/User_talk%7EMgekelly_f99d.html" title="User talk:Mgekelly">kelly</a> 15:06, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, it falls short of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, but I think that it's something we should let an AfD discussion decide. A7 is, in my opinion, only for the most clear-cut cases of non-notability, i.e. "Bob was a funny man." I prodded the article as a non-notable band and will keep it watchlisted in case the prod gets removed. I might note that the article has been around since 27 Feb <b>2003</b>, so there's really no hurry to get rid of it. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 20:33, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have a few changes. First, the "Vandalism Stats" needs to be colorized just like the UBXs. Also, Either widel the "link box" or widen that border next to the link box, because there is an empty space. Also, on the "hide/show" box, the "show" is a little hard to see. --<font size="1"><a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeMoney_583b.html" title="User:GeorgeMoney">GeorgeMoney</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeMoney_8d9f.html" title="User talk:GeorgeMoney">T</a>Â·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GeorgeMoney_d771.html" title="Special:Contributions/GeorgeMoney">C</a></sup></font> 00:46, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Vandalism Stats can't be colorized due to the nature of VandalProof. I wish AmiDaniel could make that a template with {{{params}}} for the colors. Also, the show can't be changed. It's a issue with the colors. The show clicky is defined in MediaWiki.css/Monobook.css... I could try and track it down and hand-incorporate it, but it would be very messy. --<a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvillia_e750.html" title="User:Avillia"><font color="#228B22">Avillia</font></a> <a href="../../../a/v/i/User_talk%7EAvillia_20cb.html" title="User talk:Avillia"><sup><font color="#228B22">(Avillia me!)</font></sup></a> 00:50, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Holy bajesus that AfD has gotten out of control. I still think it was wrong of me to close it early as a speedy, and I think it best to let the AfD run its course--but my god! Let me ask around about whether it's appropriate to remove these gigantuous essays from the AfD, just for the sake of clarity. The consensus among experienced editors thus far seems to be delete/userfy and/or let someone else write the article.

<p>Dear AmiDaniel,</p>
<p>As a first time contributor to Wikipedia, on behalf of myself and PCU where I am a recent graduate, we appreciate your help and the editing done by Bobak Ha'Eri, Esq.</p>
<p>Condensing the article and adding headlines made the article much better, and I apologize if any of what I added seemed too promotional or wordy.</p>
<p>As the previous article indicated that it was a stub, I just added what I could out of our school's bulletin.</p>
<p>Our Vice Dean Charles Hicks, Esq. has requested one slight change to just one sentence in the final edit by The Wikipedia editors, and that change is described in the email (copied below) which I sent today to Bobak Ha'Eri at the email address listed on his page.</p>
<p>Here is a copy of that email for you.</p>
<p>Should you have any questions, please feel to contact our Vice Dean Charles Hicks, Esq. at:</p>

<dd>Hm, no I'd say that was the program's error, not yours. I'm guessing this is probably related to similar ampersand bugs it's been having--even when you try to nominate an old version for deletion, it should post the tag on the current version, not create a separate article. Let me look into it a bit; I'm sorry about that.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Apartheid (disambiguation)</span></h2>
<p>1) Why are you editing when you are "away" 2) There is a consensus (see <a href="../../../a/p/a/Talk%7EApartheid_%28disambiguation%29_fc8d.html" title="Talk:Apartheid (disambiguation)">Talk:Apartheid (disambiguation)</a> - that one editor disagrees does not justify reprotection, especially when he's almost out of edits. I suggest you keep it unprotected for another hour or so and then check again. I'm quite confident the "edit war" will end once Moshe has extinguished his three edits. Homey 02:48, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I apologize for having my status set to away--I always forget to change that. What I see when I look at the history is a very recent edit war with you and Calton on one side and Moshe... and Humus Sapiens on the other. While I see majority support for one version on the talk page, I'm not sure I see a clear consensus--especially given that edit warring has just fired up again. As the article was just protected yesterday and the disputes haven't yet ended, I feel it appropriate to leave it protected for at least one or two days, let you all sleep on it a bit, and maybe you'll all be able to cool down. Given what happened immediately after the article was unprotected, I don't think it's a good idea to unprotect it just yet. You're both very close to violating 3RR so simply waiting for him to be blocked won't serve your cause, and I might note that while 3RR is policy, it doesn't mean that you have an automatic three reverts per 24 hours, and the philosophy of "let's wait for him to get blocked and then implement our changes" does not seem particularly productive. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 02:58, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question, if you don't mind</span></h2>
<p>My user talk page was just reverted by someone who I warned for vandalising, possibly as retribution. Is it a bad thing to revert a talk page if the only messages on it are irrelevant now, and have been replied to?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<dd>Sorry about that. I simply reverted the vandal's edit based upon the edit summary, and then when I saw that it blanked your talk page I reverted myself. I personally find it to be very bad form/etiquette to remove messages from talk pages without archiving, but that's your decision--there's no policy or even guideline to support my view&#160;:-). <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 05:08, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I must admit I am somewhat troubled by your actions on this page. You basically placed all of the blame at my feet for "edit warring" against the consensus. Did you even look at the article's talk page? Samuel Blanning, Alex Bakharev, Humus Sapiens, and now 6SJ7 have all expressed agreement with me, also it is clear that the wikipedia disambiguation guidlines state that those articles shouldn't be listed there. I am trying to assume good faith in this instance but I find it hard especially considering you only warned me even though User: Homeontherange had accumulated 3 reverts before I did, and was actually blocked just yesterday for his violation on the same article.- <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_9171.html" title="User:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg</a> | <a href="../../../m/o/s/User_talk%7EMoshe_Constantine_Hassan_Al-Silverburg_14cc.html" title="User talk:Moshe Constantine Hassan Al-Silverburg">Talk</a> 06:30, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Fair use images are only allowed to be used in the one article, not in your userspace. Please remove the image form your userspace. Two, you have not provided a fair use rationale--why you are able to use the image in that article. If you cannot provide one, it will be deleted. If you have questions about how to do this correctly, please ask them at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMedia_copyright_questions_04f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Media copyright questions">Wikipedia:Media copyright questions</a>, as I can't say I'm 100% sure about the whole process. Sorry for the inconvenience, but please refrain from reverting the OrphanBot's edits and removing other deletion notices. Note as well that you have seven days to provide a fair use claim for the image before it will even face deletion, and given the tremendous backlog at <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECOPYVIO_ef21.html" title="WP:COPYVIO">WP:COPYVIO</a>, you may have even longer.

<dd>Please, calm down. There is no reason to get upset over this image. If you have permission to use the image on Wikipedia, or you have reason to believe that the image can be used, then you must provided a <i>detailed</i> fair use rationale under the image's summary. Simply providing the source is not a substantiated claim of fair use. You may want to contact <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarnildo_80ca.html" title="User:Carnildo">User:Carnildo</a> about this as he knows a lot more about image copyright problems than I do, and he seems quite willing to help if you would just calm down and act reasonably. Also try asking at <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMedia_copyright_questions_04f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Media copyright questions">Wikipedia:Media copyright questions</a> as I suggested before. The unfortunate truth is that there likely is no fair use rationale for the image--if you just found it somewhere on the internet, there probably isn't one, in which case the image <i>must</i> be deleted. That's the way copyright law works. I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but please take a deep breath and settle down. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 09:07, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's one option, I was thinking of semi-protection for a few days, but a range block works as well.--<strong><a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigitalme_b457.html" title="User:Digitalme"><span style="color:#000;">digital_m</span></a><a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigitalme_Esperanza_7e2b.html" title="User:Digitalme/Esperanza"><span style="color:green;">e</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../d/i/g/User_talk%7EDigitalme_e893.html" title="User talk:Digitalme"><span style="color:#000;">t</span></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Digitalme_d720.html" title="Special:Contributions/Digitalme"><span style="color:#000;">c</span></a>)</sup></strong> 21:03, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for unprotecting that page. Is it possible to write on the talk page that restoring the same problematic edits as before will result in being blocked? It's useless to have known bad editors when the vandal has to be "warned" three times before anyone doing vandal patrol will do anything about it. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 21:31, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No problem. I'm afraid you're still going to have to do it the same old-fashioned way unless you have reason to believe that they're all coming from the same person. Try adding hidden notes to the page in problem areas and see if that helps at all. I'll keep my eye on the page, but feel free to drop me a note if you start having the same problems, or if you think the article's ready to be completely unprotected. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 21:45, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I want to know How I can overcome these two problems: Abusive use from Wikipedia by Catholics,by example to term free distribution from Bibles by protestants as a PROFANE use from Bible. Or articles as spiritual warfare are edited in order to delete any reference to evangelical theologians. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuillen_4648.html" title="User:Guillen">Guillen</a> (<a href="../../../g/u/i/User_talk%7EGuillen_554a.html" title="User talk:Guillen">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Guillen_f098.html" title="Special:Contributions/Guillen">contribs</a>) 00:42, 1 June 2006 (UTC).</small></p>
