<p>Ive added an article on the Amigas userbase, i hope everyone finds it acceptible - i'm not sure if the last bit sounds neutral enough but i think it makes an important point to potential developers that they can learn something from 'old' hardware and principles - any comments or minor adjustments are welcome, especially if someone thinks it can be put in a better way - but i think this was an important point lacking from the article. --Insignia1983 17:20, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Remember that the style of writing which is good for something like an editorial or essay isn't necessarily good for an encyclopedia. I've tried to improve it - it's not so much that I disagree with what's said, but that we shouldn't be expressing subjective things like hopes and opinions in what we write for Wikipedia. I hope that makes sense. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 23:26, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thankyou for your adjustments Mdwh - i'm new to this, and although i tried to keep it encyclopedic i think i need more practise getting the language right. I can learn a lot from your adjustments so hopefully avoid the same pitfalls in the future. The essence of what i said is there, except now it sounds more professional and fluent! Thanks for your guidance! One point though... i thought Doom used the 'first generation' of very early 3d cards, you know the 2d/3d card combos i think existed? I must admit i wasnt a pc user at the time, but anyway i suppose its an irrelevant point as i was just trying to use an illustration for the point about getting more performance out of the machine. Are illustrations necessary in an article such as this or is it best to leave external sources to describing the details of the broad points made in the article? Thanks, id appreciate any advice you can give!--Insignia1983 00:32, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../d/o/o/Doom.html" title="Doom">Doom</a> used software rendering as far as I know; it didn't use an algorithm comparable to what 3D cards do (i.e., drawing texture mapped polygons), instead it draws the walls in vertical slices (see <a href="../../../d/o/o/Doom_engine.html" title="Doom engine">Doom engine</a>).

<dd>Doom never used hardware acceleration; it ran using the power of the CPU only. It didn't do proper 3D. It broke the screen into vertical lines, like scanline rendering but vertical. Amiga could never accelerate anything other than flat colour fills, stipple effects, lines of single pixel's width, and blitting. There was a game that used a Doom engine-like approach but it never came close to Quake-like 3D. The blitter just couldn't do textures. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardcavell_48b5.html" title="User:Richardcavell">Richardcavell</a> 03:43, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually there were "Quake-like 3D" games - indeed, Quake and Quake 2 themselves were ported - but yes, the Amiga's chipset couldn't be used to accelerate the 3D, which instead had to be done in software or on a 3D card. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 03:52, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No my dear Mdwh and Richardcavell. On Amiga it existed also very performing 3D games Doom-like as <a href="http://www.thelegacy.de/Museum/6403/" class="external text" title="http://www.thelegacy.de/Museum/6403/" rel="nofollow">Breathless</a>, <a href="http://nintendoallstars.w.interia.pl/games/breathless.htm" class="external text" title="http://nintendoallstars.w.interia.pl/games/breathless.htm" rel="nofollow">Other screenshots</a> (it deserves someone to write a Wikipedia article for it). Breathless was a little Amiga pearl. Users could also change resolutions on the fly and play it in tiny windows on unaccelerated Amiga1200, and raise to higher resolutions on accelerated Amigas with or without graphic cards. Textures of pixels could be modified to 1x1, 2x2, 4x4, etc. to gain render speed. These games like Breathless were AGA only, and came too late to be noticed that Amiga "can do it": Alos they were of no interest for a majority of Amiga machines running OCS and ECS chipset. Also Commodore was, by then, a dead company and none supported official 3D step for the Amiga classic machines. 3D advance came along with "new" Amigas such as AmigaONE and Pegasos (I am affirming it by having clearly in mind the consequencies I consider these machines as "new" Amigas and people who instead would not consider these as heirs). Althoug these 3D games existed, but weren't noticed as Amiga was considered dead along with Commodore. Sincerely, --Raffaele Megabyte 15:16, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'd suggest moving the emulated operating systems to their own article; they're a little tangential. Also, some of the stuff that I added could be given an article, but I'm not sure what the article should be called. 'Amiga culture', 'Amiga user base', etc... I'd like to add more, actually, about the relationship of the Amiga user base to the 'hacking' culture. I use the word 'hacking' in the legal, friendly sense of the term. - <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardcavell_48b5.html" title="User:Richardcavell">Richardcavell</a> 06:46, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article keeps on growing out of the 30 kilobyte limit. Maybe we'll have to move the entire hardware section to a new article?

<p>Made some rather large changes to reduce the article's size. I moved the blitter and copper stuff over to the <a href="../../../o/c/s/OCS_48d1.html" title="OCS">OCS</a> page.

<p>Leave it. A HAL VM is different from a full emulation.

<dd>Maybe it's different, but the article simply covers Amiga emulators (which I've now removed at least - dunno if people will try to revert), and "full emulation" of Amiga software (e.g., Amithlon, or the emulation on MorphOS), with the only exception of Amiga Anywhere. So if there is a difference, the article isn't covering this different thing. If you mean it's useful to point out the difference between a VM and emulation, shouldn't that be done in a more general article, as it's not Amiga specific? <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 11:28, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, why don't we make a "Windows Virtual Machine" and a "DOS Virtual machine" article, as well as a "Macintosh virtual machine" one? After all, DOS programs run under MS-DOS (and derivatives, such as IBM DOS, FreeDOS...), but also as virtual machines under <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_NT_876c.html" title="Windows NT">Windows NT</a> and <a href="../../../o/s/2F/OS_2_4b39.html" title="OS/2">OS/2</a>, and as "semi" virtual machines under Win16. Besides, of course, that those systems mentioned can themselves run under emulators such as Bochs, VMWare (emulator? VM?), etc.</dd>
<dd>Win16 programs run under Win16 (of course), and as virtual machines under WinNT, OS/2, Wine (which is a compatibility layer just like the ones, I think, AOS4 and MorphOS have, except with no CPU emulation); I think, though I'm not sure, there are some modifications of Wine to add a CPU emulators, or projects to that intent.</dd>
<dd>Similarly, let's consider Mac OS "Classic" 68k: programs can run, besides on the actual Mac OS, under a software emulator (VM?) like <a href="../../../s/h/a/ShapeShifter_7042.html" title="ShapeShifter">ShapeShifter</a>, which on an Amiga uses no CPU simulator, or with a hardware emulator (as seen on the Amiga again), or under "full blown" emulators; they also run inside Mac OS 8 and 9, using no API emulation but CPU simulation with <a href="../../../p/o/w/PowerPC_1c02.html" title="PowerPC">PowerPC</a> Macs, and under Mac OS X using both CPU emulation and API emulation (while the programs still "look like" they're running natively).</dd>
<dd>So, if you consider all possibilities, you could probably write a hundred or so articles including this and that and some. Perhaps it would be (much) better to just address things inside their own articles? Like, MorphOS "VM" under <a href="../../../m/o/r/MorphOS_0578.html" title="MorphOS">MorphOS</a>, Mac issues under <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mac_OS_6c4f.html" title="Mac OS">Mac OS</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mac_OS_X_b8d4.html" title="Mac OS X">Mac OS X</a> and the like...... <a href="../../../l/j/l/User%7ELjL_5e2c.html" title="User:LjL">LjL</a> 16:45, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My thoughts on Amiga</span></h2>
<p>Can't believe the first comment was someone asking to delete this article "because noone uses Amigas anymore". That's like saying "Get rid of all the spitfires, the Mustangs, Sopwith Camels and scrap Memphis Belle". The Amiga is part of the history of computing, a part that would leave a vast void with nothing to replace it. I still use my Amiga 1200 quite regularly, in fact I'm currently trying to hunt down a Siamese Networking System so I can have the Amiga and PC running on the same monitor, doing different tasks in different screen resolutions, all on the same desktop.</p>
<p>The Amiga invented "REAL MULTITASKING" something the PC still grinds to a halt on. The Amiga invented "MULTIMEDIA" Microsoft just gave it a name and tried to hijack the feature. In some ways I think if it wasn't for the Amiga and the Atari (to a lesser extent) the PC wouldn't have progressed so far so quickly. I can remember people selling their PCs in the thousands to buy Amigas. The Amiga became mainstream in schools and colleges for it's ease of use and speed. The PC market could have learned a lot from the Amiga, but they preferred the excrutiatingly slow disk based O/Ss and bloatware which is one of the main anchors of the PC tecnology.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You don't really need to compare deleting the Amiga article with anything; everybody reasonable knows it should stay. Some people, me included, have the same positive feelings as you have towards Amiga, but almost <i>all</i> people who know what an Amiga is realize that the Amiga article should stay, however they feel towards it. Just don't feed the trolls, and we'll all be happy. <a href="../../../l/j/l/User%7ELjL_5e2c.html" title="User:LjL">LjL</a> 12:47, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A lot of the trivia can be put into the history section or corresponding main articles (e.g. Tidbits about the A1000 can be covered by the A1000 article). The Problem is that it is difficult to squeeze the trivia into the various articles without making them difficult to read (jump back a few revisions and you’ll find the trivia as articles littered with random - often of topic - facts). IMO some of the trivia is interesting and I’m against simply deleting it.--<a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnss123_0498.html" title="User:Anss123">Anss123</a> 09:24, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The amount of trivia on this article is getting ridiculous. Who cares if the Amiga was used as a "personal video recorder" or for piloting ROVs? Really?

<p>I just nuked most of the external links (I'm not the first to do so); before adding links it might be useful to read <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> and <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a>. --<a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGribeco_aecd.html" title="User:Gribeco">Gribeco</a> 18:49, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What to link to</p>
<pre>
   (See new guideline proposal here.)
</pre>
<p>In Wikipedia, it is possible to link to external websites. Such links are referred to as "external links". Many articles have a small section containing a few external links. There are a few things which should be considered when adding an external link.</p>
<pre>
   * Is it accessible?
   * Is it proper (useful, tasteful, etc.)?
   * Is it entered correctly?
   * Is the link, in the context used, likely to have a substantive longevity? For example, it is not useful to link to a homepage that changes often and merely happens to have a relevant picture or article on its front page at the moment. Similarly, be very wary of citing an unstable page as a source.
</pre>
<p>[edit]</p>
<p>What should be linked to</p>
<pre>
  1. Articles about any organization, person, or other entity should link to their official site, if they have one.
  2. Sites that have been used as references in the creation of an article should be linked to in a references section, not in external links. See Wikipedia:Verifiability and Wikipedia:Citing sources.
  3. An article about a book, a musical score, a webcomic, a web site, or some other media, should link to the actual book, musical score, etc. if possible.
  4. On articles with multiple points of view, a link to prominent sites dedicated to each, with a detailed explanation of each link. The number of links dedicated to one point of view should not overwhelm the number dedicated to any other. One should attempt to add comments to these links informing the reader of their point of view. If one point of view dominates informed opinion, that should be represented first. (For more information, see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view – in particular, Wikipedia's guidelines on undue weight.)
  5. Sites that contain neutral and accurate material not already in the article. Ideally this content should be integrated into the Wikipedia article, then the link would remain as a reference, but in some cases this is not possible for copyright reasons or because the site has a level of detail which is inappropriate for the Wikipedia article.
  6. Sites with other meaningful, relevant content that is not suitable for inclusion in an article, such as textbooks or reviews.
</pre>
<p>[edit]</p>
<p>Occasionally acceptable links</p>
<pre>
  1. For albums, movies, books: one or two links to professional reviews which express some sort of general sentiment. For films, Movie Review Query Engine, Hollywood.com, Internet Movie Database, Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic offer especially large collections of reviews.
  2. Web directories: When deemed appropriate by those contributing to an article on Wikipedia, a link to one web directory listing can be added, with preference to open directories (if two are comparable and only one is open). If deemed unnecessary, or if no good directory listing exists, one should not be included.
  3. Fan sites: On articles about topics with many fansites, including a link to one major fansite is appropriate, marking the link as such. In extreme cases, a link to a web directory of fansites can replace this link. (Note: fanlistings are generally not informative and should not ordinarily be included.)
  4. Very large pages should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Worldwide, many use Wikipedia with a low-speed connection. Unusually large pages should be annotated as such.
  5. External sites can possibly violate copyright. Linking to copyrighted works is usually not a problem, as long as you have made a reasonable effort to determine that the page in question is not violating someone else's copyright. If it is, please do not link to the page. Knowingly and intentionally directing others to a site that violates copyright has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the United States (Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry). Also, linking to a page that illegally distributes someone else's work sheds a bad light on us (see Wikipedia:Copyrights and in particular Contributors' rights and obligations).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Past tense</span></h2>
<p>I've just reverted several edits, which put the computer in the past tense. The Amiga concept and operating system are still in development even today and so the phrasing of the article should stay as it is. The revert also included some changes to belittle the significance of features of the computer when it was first released, again not valid edits, especially when referring to multitasking an era where the largest competitors did not have such a feature. ~~ <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeteb16_cdfa.html" title="User:Peteb16">Peteb16</a> 00:41, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Firstly, we should probably mention the <a href="../../../c/d/t/CDTV_eeea.html" title="CDTV">CDTV</a> somewhere - it may have been a failure commercially, but it was still significant (imo), being initially in "console" form, and including a CD-ROM drive.</p>

I presume the distinction is being made between computer and console, in which case, when did they start selling the Amiga CDTV with keyboard, mouse, etc? I know that the original release date was 1990 - the Mac came out in 1992. (Note that the <a href="../../../c/d/t/CDTV_eeea.html" title="CDTV">CDTV</a> article states it as "the first computer to come with a CD-ROM drive as standard", in contradiction to the Mac articles.)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">"Say" in AmigaOS 2.0?</span></h2>
<p>The article says, "In the original 1.x AmigaOS releases, a Say program demo included with AmigaBASIC programming examples. For 2.0, Say became a standard utility program which did not need AmigaBASIC". Is that correct? I thought the narrator was dropped from AmigaOS 2.0. Also, I think Say was a standalone program in Workbench 1.2, but I'm not totally sure of this. Can somebody fact-check this? Wonderstruck 10:58, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I see GatoClass has been modifying the tense of the article from present to past. Up to this point, the article has been written in the present tense (and I've tried to match that in edits). It is arguable what the tense should be - is the Amiga "in the past" and therefore past tense, or do you write the article based on the fact that Amigas still exist and are still being used and some software work done, in which case present tense is appropriate. Comments? GatoClass, you must have an opinion... <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesup_c788.html" title="User:Jesup">jesup</a> 20:22, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
