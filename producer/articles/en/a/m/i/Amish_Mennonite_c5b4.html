	    <p><b>Amish Mennonites</b> are a church or constituency within <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anabaptist.html" title="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a> Christianity that has broken from the <a href="../../../o/l/d/Old_Order_Amish_0f41.html" title="Old Order Amish">Old Order Amish</a>, yet has resisted absoption into a <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mennonite.html" title="Mennonite">Mennonite</a> constituency. In addition, the Old Order Amish were earlier known as Amish Mennonites within the European context before "Old Order" became a more commonly used term. Most Amish Mennonite people today identify themselves as conservative Mennonites in name as the term "Amish Mennonite" is not well understood by general society. A few would identify themselves as Amish for the same reason, just not "Old Order" Amish.</p>

<p>From 1862-1878, annual conferences were held among the Amish. The conferences produced a number of polarized groups, from which came two primary divisions: the Old Order Amish and the Amish Mennonites. The Amish Mennonites formed regional conferences in the late 1880s after the division. During the early 1900s, most of these original Amish Mennonite groups merged with regional Mennontie conferences, most of which later joined the <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_Conference_Mennonite_Church_0ff8.html" title="General Conference Mennonite Church">General Conference Mennonite Church</a> (Lehman 1998).</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Mennonite_Conference_3c79.html" title="Conservative Mennonite Conference">Conservative Mennonite Conference</a> was born several decades after the original Amish Mennonite movement. In 1910, leaders from three unaffiliated Amish Mennonite congregations met in Michigan to discuss the formation of a conference that allowed for congregational autonomy yet would be able to assist individual churches with problems. This conference was to be more conservative than the aforementioned Amish Mennonite conferences. During its almost 100-year history, the church has moved closer to mainstream Mennonite groups. In 1954, a majority vote called for the removal of the “Amish” part of the Conservative Amish Mennonite Conference (CMC) name, which was implemented in the 1957 constitution revision. Proponents suggested that “Amish Mennonite” conferences were obsolete. During the 1960s, concern rose among some about the lax practice on issues such as the women’s head veiling and cut hair, television, and clothing items. Individual churches began to differ greatly in practice. Since the concerns in the 1960s, conference has abandoned a stand on the aforementioned practices (Miller 1985). Today, the conference has 113 churches with about 11,000 members (Map of CMC 2006).</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_Mennonite_Alliance_3513.html" title="Biblical Mennonite Alliance">Biblical Mennonite Alliance</a>, or BMA, resulted from a split with the Conservative Mennonite Conference (CMC). In a 1999 meeting, CMC took a vote that failed to uphold the required practice of the woman’s veiling. This was the final straw in a series of issues that increasingly alienated conservative congregations within the conference. These churches broke from CMC and formed BMA (D.L. Miller 1999). In the 2005 BMA Directory, the membership was calculated to be at 1,669. BMA retains a governmental body similar to CMC and individual congregational practice still varies widely. While BMA has Amish Mennonite origins and roots, most members of BMA would not think of themselves as Amish Mennonite.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/i/Amish_Mennonite_c5b4.html" title="Edit section: Beachy Amish Mennonites">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Beachy Amish Mennonites</span></h2>
<p>The largest and most dominant contemporary Amish Mennonite group is the <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beachy_Amish_bc20.html" title="Beachy Amish">Beachy Amish Mennonite</a> constituency. The Beachys received their name from <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses_M._Beachy_6beb.html" title="Moses M. Beachy">Moses M. Beachy</a>, an Old Order Amish bishop in Somerset County, PA. Beachy refused to administer the streng ordnung (strong ban) against members whose only offense was transfering membership to the nearby Conservative Amish Mennonite congregation. Half the congregation sided with Beachy, and the other half sided with co-ministers Yoder and Yoder. Beachy's congregation affiliated with a similar Amish Mennonite congregation in Lancaster County, today known as the Weavertown Amish Mennonite church. During the 1940s, a number of other factions emerged in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Virginia from Old Order Amish groups. The congregations sought affiliation with the Beachy constituency (Yoder 1987, Beachy 1955).</p>
<p>Today, the Beachys vary widely in practice, as the constituency is a fellowship with congregational autonomy separate of a governing conference. Most have retained conservative, plain practice, but this is becoming increasingly questioned, especially in more mainstream churches in predominantly Old Order Amish areas, though no exclusively confined to these regions. New standard allowances in the more mainstream congregations include the radio and DVD/video watching. Clothing is also less distinct in these congregations, especially among the men; however, women's dress has become less distinguishable with a tighter fit and the wearing of sweaters or jackets, and coverings undergone abbreviation. However, the most conservative of Beachy congregations use German in services, refuse to have their photograph taken, and dress similar to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Order_Amish_bf9e.html" title="New Order Amish">New Order Amish</a>. Between these two range points is a wide variety of practice.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mennonite_Christian_Fellowship_6400.html" title="Mennonite Christian Fellowship">Mennonite Christian Fellowship</a> churches, or just Fellowship churches, originated from several congregations separating from the Old Order Amish in the 1950s and 1960s. The congregations resembled the more conservative end of the Beachy Amish Mennonite constituency at that time. The two groups shared fellowship to the extent that these churches were incorporated into the Beachy affiliation. In 1977, however, some of the ordained men in these churches expressed concern about perceived worldly trends among the Beachys. They met with other ordained Beachy men. Some concerns included members baptized without a true Christian conversion, worldly fads in clothing and lifestyle, and churches conglomerating in communities instead of spreading out. After this meeting, the concerned men decided to withdraw from the Beachys and organize the Mennonite Christian Fellowship. In 1978, these churches started holding their own annual Minister’s Meetings (Miller 2004). In 2006, the Fellowship churches had 1,518 members in 34 congregations (Mennonite Church Directory 2007).</p>

<p>The Kauffman Amish Mennonite constituency, also known as the "Sleeping Preacher" churches, have distinct differences that separate them from the general Amish Mennonite experience and history. This group adheres to the teaching of John Kauffman, an Old Order Amish minister who was known for preaching while sleeping or in a trance. This peculiar practice gained a following, but was rejected by the broader Old Order Amish constituency. He started his own congregation with his followers. Today, there are 16 congregations with 1,509 members, according to the 2006 Anabaptist (Mennonite) Directory. Most congregations are in the Midwest, including Arkansas, Missouri, and Illinois. The churches use German in services and hold to many conservative practices embraced by the Old Order Amish, but allow some modern conveniences, such as electricity and motor vehicles. The Kauffman Amish Mennonite is one of the only contemporary groups that clearly and proudly identifies itself as an "Amish Mennonite" constituency.</p>
