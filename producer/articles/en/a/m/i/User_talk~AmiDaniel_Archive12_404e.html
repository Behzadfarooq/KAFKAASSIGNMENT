<h2><span class="mw-headline">A short Esperanzial update</span></h2>
<p>As you may have gathered, discussions have been raging for about a week on <a href="../../../e/s/p/WT%7EESP_1b68.html" title="WT:ESP">the <i>Esperanza</i> talk page</a> as to the future direction of Esperanza. Some of these are still ongoing and warrant more input (such as the idea to scrap the members list altogether). However, some decisions have been made and the charter has hence been amended. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=59977509&amp;oldid=52572171" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AEsperanza%2FCharter&amp;diff=59977509&amp;oldid=52572171" rel="nofollow">See what happened</a>. Basically, the whole leadership has had a reshuffle, so please review the new, improved charter.</p>
<p>As a result, we are electing 4 people this month. They will replace <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoanneB_e69b.html" title="User:JoanneB">JoanneB</a> and <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">Pschemp</a> and form a new tranche A, serving until December. Elections will begin on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">07-02</a> and last until <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_9.html" title="July 9">07-09</a>. If you wish to run for a Council position, add your name to the list before <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">07-02</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mein Kampf</span></h2>
<p>Hi, Get well soon! Anyways, your relatives might have faced Hitler's wrath...And, may be thats why you are spewing venom....</p>
<p>But remember, you have to talk about history in "unbiased" way. If you twist facts and try to brain wash people, it will not work. May for some time, people will believe in you. But, truth cannot hide.</p>
<p>Why did you not talk about some of the facts that were true as reported in Mein Kampf? Only then, you can rightfully criticise the book. Remeber, this book had a tremendous impact and nobody bothers who you are. So, donot belittle the book on false pretense. Work hard and and give impartial evidences. For eg.- I can say that it was a lie that people didnot read it.</p>
<p>Please be sensible. You have every right to denounce Hitler but then whine about it in private. On public forum, be ready to present facts. Then, every one would accept your views.</p>
<p>Try to criticise jews too...And, then show how terrible Hitler was. People didnot buy in with Hitler just like that. They agreed on some of the points he placed.</p>

I'm not even sure I've ever edited the article on <a href="../../../m/e/i/Mein_Kampf_b165.html" title="Mein Kampf">Mein Kampf</a>, nor have I anywhere professed my opinion on the matter. Yet no matter whom you are attempting to contact, you should refrain from making <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> and otherwise being disruptive. Incivility will acomplish nothing more than forcing others to disregard your opinions, and it may also lead to your being <a href="../../../b/l/o/WP%7EBLOCK_89b0.html" title="WP:BLOCK">blocked</a>.

<dd>It said I was blocked from editing with no explanation as to what I had done. It wasn't on my talk page it just appeared as I logged on and I haven't seen the notice since then. I can only assume it was my deep editing and deletions of the red dead links on the lists of various poets pages I was working on, everything else was minor.

<dd>I think unprotection would be a very bad idea at the moment. I'd like to advice you to pursue <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">dispute resolution</a> or at least try having a civil, mature conversation about the article. I will unprotect once an agreement has been reached by all involved parties. Also, please refrain from referring to good-faith contributors as having "vandalized"--that's highly inappropriate, and such <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> are not well-tolerated by the Wikipedia community.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Antonio Vernon "Tony The Tiger (martial artist)"</span></h2>
<p>Ami,</p>
<p>It seems you are part of the process that has deleted my wiki article. This process has obviously been determined by a bunch of people who don't know martial arts. It seems like the bulk of the complaints are either disbelievers or pilers on who don't have any substantive complaints. I am at this point unsure if I have been deleted because people don't believe all the things on the page or because the people believe the person as described is non-notable. I believe the votes were a case of the former and not the later. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_9324.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger">Tony The Tiger</a> 22:29, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I assume you're speaking of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Antonio_Vernon_9699.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Antonio Vernon">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Antonio Vernon</a> (please provide direct links, as it's sort of a pain to dig up the deleted content of redirects to find out what you're talking about). Anyway, the article was deleted through an overwhelming AfD consensus, and while you're always free to seek a <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a>, I think it quite unlikely that the deletion would be overturned. However, if you'd like me to, I will gladly restore the article and move it into your <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">userspace</a> where it's quite unlikely to be deleted again. Let me know of anyway that I can help you. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 01:03, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am not sure I understand what the user space option is. Please explain <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_9324.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger">Tony The Tiger</a> 12:36, 23 June 2006 (UTC). Please restore to my userspace as well.

<dd>The article has now been <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERFY_518d.html" title="WP:USERFY">userfied</a> to <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_Antonio_Vernon_c5a1.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger/Antonio Vernon">User:TonyTheTiger/Antonio Vernon</a>. No, you cannot create a redirect from Antonio Vernon or any other page in main article namespace, as they will be speedily deleted per <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#R2" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#R2</a>.

<p>Hi. I just draw this map of Nakhichevan region and intended to post it into <a href="../../../n/a/k/Nakhichevan.html" title="Nakhichevan">Nakhichevan</a> article, but I noticed that article is protected and it was you who done this. So, can you post this map into article instead of me? I did not read about what dispute in that article is, but I do not think that this map will be disputed for anybody. You can post map somewhere in "History" or "Geography" section. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="purple"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 15:05, 24 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Why hello AmiDaniel, my name is also Daniel. I don't know if this actually is the appropriate place to do this, but I'm a little annoyed and can't find anywhere better so it'll have to do I suppose..</p>
<p>You just blocked me, and I was in the middle of editing <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hereditary_elliptocytosis.html" title="Hereditary elliptocytosis">Hereditary elliptocytosis</a>. The comment was, if I remember correctly, 'Repeated vandalism despite final warning. User was blocked using VP.'. I'd like to know why I was blocked, and I'd like to know where my final warning was posted (and all the others which I've been accused of accruing) - it certainly wasn't on my own talk page. The only thing I can possibly imagine I've done to incur your considerable wikiwrath is to change American/Canadian spelling to Australian spelling, but I've only done that in the course of improving articles for other reasons in order to maintain consistancy throughout the article (without encouraging/endorsing "incorrect" spelling). I'm not sure that that really counts as vandalism, do you?</p>
<p>Anyway... this all seems wierd to me, and I'd like not to be blocked anymore (or at least be told what I did wrong!).</p>

<dd>Hello Mr. Adams, I apologize that you were unable to edit this morning; however, if you'll have a look at your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Daniel_Adams" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;type=block&amp;page=User:Daniel_Adams" rel="nofollow">block log</a>, you'll see that neither I nor any other administrator has intentionally blocked your account. As Glen stated above, what happened is that you're likely connected through a shared IP address (Glen indicated that you were connected through <a href="../../../2/0/2/User_talk%7E202.6.138.33.html" title="User talk:202.6.138.33">202.6.138.33</a>, which is an Adamnet IP--I have no way verifying this for certain) and someone connected through that IP was vandalizing. By blocking the IP address, it then blocked all users, logged-in or not, from editing through this IP, which resulted in the collateral damage that was your being unable to edit. This is an unfortunate mishap that often occurs when blocking IP addresses, and currently there is no way to prevent such collateral damage from occurring (although a temporary fix is in the works). If this ever occurs again, please add {{unblock}} to your talk page, along with the full text of the block message, who blocked you, and your IP address, and the block will be removed as soon as possible. Also if you can get back to me with your IP address (check my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=AmiDaniel&amp;page=" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=AmiDaniel&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">log</a> or try logging out and signing with ~~~ somewhere if you are unsure what your IP address is), I will attempt to take preventitive measures to keep you from being blocked in the future. Thanks for your understanding, and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need help with anything else. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 21:17, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, I wonder if you could have a quick look at this page for me? A single editor, 74.12.79.132, is making lots of apparently contentious POV edits, and I'm wondering how best to tackle this. When reverted, he/she simply reverts back again, without comment. In recent weeks, other editors seem to have pretty well given up on this page. I'm reluctant to get into an edit war here, which I'm fairly sure would happen if I smply deleted some of the changes that have been made. I don't yet have much experience of dealing with this, and I'd appreciate any advice you can give. Do you think the edits are such obvious POV that they count as vandalism? --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelMaggs_3ae0.html" title="User:MichaelMaggs">MichaelMaggs</a> 14:06, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there: sorry to see that you're experiencing health problems. You just blocked me, although only for a few minutes, apparently under the impression that I was a user called, I think, Polikarpos.

Polikarpos doesn't ring a bell with me, but he may well have been someone I blocked, and so what happened is that this blocked user attempted to edit, causing the IP address he was using to be autoblocked. Then you went to edit from that IP address causing the autoblock to trigger and block your account. I'd guess you're probably connected through a shared IP adress (if you're using AOL, Verizon, Adamnet, etc.) or otherwise using a connection that was used by this blocked user. In any case, neither I nor any other administrator has intentionally blocked your account. Should this happen again in the future, please add {{unblock}} to your talk page along with the full block message you see when attempting to edit, including your IP address, who blocked you, and which blokced user attempted to edit through your IP address.

<dd>lol, well I don't really gain much from market share, and to be honest I haven't used VandalProof, but from what I can see it looks like it [VandalProof?] would gain a lot from using the IRC feed. At the moment this program doesnt even do the same thing as VandalProof, as it doesnt have any of the stuff to rollback, however it will do soon hopefully.

That is: 27-10 to <b>keep</b>. While I know that it’s not a strict vote-counting exercise, the usual rule of thumb is not to delete unless there is a strong consensus expressed to do so – i.e., give the benefit of the doubt toward keeping. Here, process was thwarted.</p>
<p>The administrator closing the AfD acted contrary to the consensus expressed at the AfD by making his/her own judgment that the content was not encyclopedic. The whole issue of alternate placenames is very much encyclopedic and has been the subject on ongoing debate among Wikipedians, for example at: <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28geographic_names%29_a90c.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (geographic names)">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (geographic names)</a> and the various disputes about whether to use “Danzig” or “Gdansk” for that city near the Baltic, etc.. Also, similar articles remain extant in several other Interwiki’s (since the article is deleted, the interwiki links are gone too, otherwise I could cite which), so they appear encyclopedic to people who speak other languages. Please restore the articles. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 18:43, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It looks as though another admin has undone the deletion.

Most admins are quite reasonable and willing to admit when they have made mistakes, so often times simply contacting them is the best approach. 23:40, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Awesome, just one more question. How can I change my status easily? Or do I just go to <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobes00_Status_2566.html" title="User:Tobes00/Status">User:Tobes00/Status</a> and edit the template? --<a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobes00_f3ac.html" title="User:Tobes00">Tobes</a> <a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobes00_5768.html" title="User talk:Tobes00"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 04:31, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The first template just has the second template, and the switch for the second template. You would put the desired status as the switch in the first template. Ergo: you go to /Status and change {{User:Tobes00//Status|sleeping}} to {{User:Tobes00/Status|online}}, and it changes the status on all pages where {{Status}} is. You never put {{StatusDiv}} anywhere but within {{Status}}, and you only need one click for universal fixings. --<a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvillia_e750.html" title="User:Avillia"><font color="#228B22">Avillia</font></a> <a href="../../../a/v/i/User_talk%7EAvillia_20cb.html" title="User talk:Avillia"><sup><font color="#228B22">(Avillia me!)</font></sup></a> 04:59, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Deleted images from Haris Cizmic page</span></h2>
<p>You deleted two images from the page <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haris_Cizmic_0038.html" title="Haris Cizmic">Haris Cizmic</a>. They were most likely uploaded by <a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjedamrazuk_5c10.html" title="User:Djedamrazuk">user:Djedamrazuk</a>. I have reason to believe that this is Mr. Cizmic, and the images are representative of his own work.</p>
<p>I was involved in a rather heated AfD over his page, and the matter was eventually resolved with the page being fixed. I do not believe that this is a sockpuppet of Primetime, although being unfamiliar with that user and the actions that got him banned, I cannot comment on that further.</p>
<p>If possible, please revert the images as licensed as the uploader's own work. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 22:26, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I wasn't the one who blocked <a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjedamrazuk_5c10.html" title="User:Djedamrazuk">User:Djedamrazuk</a>, and I agree that his contribs don't bear a strong connection to <a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">User:Primetime</a>; however, <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">User:Dmcdevit</a> (the admin who blocked the user) ran a CheckUser on him immediately before blocking as a sockpuppet of Primetime, so I'm assuming the claim of sockpuppetry was substantiated by CheckUser evidence (I'm still seeking confirmation from Dmcdevit on this point though). After Dmcdevit blocked the user, he asked me to clear out his 35+ image uploads, which I did. If the user is a sockpuppet of Primetime as Dmcdevit has indicated, then the deletions are justified by <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G5" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#G5</a> and should not be overturned, nor would there be any indication that he is the original author of these images. I'm highly suspect of the licensing on these images uploaded by <a href="../../../l/i/o/User%7ELionette_4ad0.html" title="User:Lionette">User:Lionette</a> as well, as they appear to be copyrighted or screenshots of copyrighted web pages, yet they are tagged as GFDL-self.

They all are, indeed, GFDL-self. They are entirely done by myself &amp; my business partner, photographer Scott Sprague (sspraguephoto.com). Please do not delete them, because they are important part in some articles. However, will add some more summary to clear the whole thing up.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I code at the moment my own anti-vandal-tool in VB6, too; and I have some problems and hope you can answer me these: 1) How do you get the RC feed (and how do you parse it; VBs RegExp library sucks) 2)how do you do control the IE (why on earth does the attribute POST in brwWeb.Navigate() not work?</p>

<dd>Heya HardDisk, sorry for taking so long to respond--I've been out of things recently (your post even got archived before I had a chance to respond!). Anyway, as you're not the only requesting this, I went ahead and uploaded the source I'm using in v1.3 to scrape the RSS feed to <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_VP_RSS_source_78ab.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/VP/RSS source">User:AmiDaniel/VP/RSS source</a>. If you have any questions about how it works, feel free to ask. As for controlling the IE browser--they certainly did not make it easy, and there's really no documentation anywhere. The only way I found to manipulate it was using JavaScript, which it understands for the most part. If you have any specific questions about how to perform certain actions, I'll be glad to answer them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On another note, I know that you're quite active on the German Wikipedia, and that's the first non-English Wiki I was planning on making VP available for. If you have some available time, I could certainly use your help with a few things (it's not going to be urgent though, as I'm postponing interwiki releases until 1.3.1). <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 00:20, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">another thing</span></h2>
<p>One more thing. I am aware that there was a heat over few pages, started by someone close to me, who wanted to kinda help me get those pages listed. I jumped in a bit late, when feathers are already flying everywhere. DarkAudit was cool enough to save the day. I do know that the person who started this thing did some 'sockpuppeting', and he did get blocked. (he's only 22). I never even thought about having a page here, but now, when i did some cleaning (with unselfish help of DarkAudit, Houan and other guys), I would like to preserve those pages if possible. Please note that all the work there does belong to me. There are images that have been published in magazines and online, but it is still my work and I do know for sure that no one is holding a copyright. Let me know if there's another way to licence that kind of work (a magazine covers, published posters...that are NOT copyrighted) - other than</p>
