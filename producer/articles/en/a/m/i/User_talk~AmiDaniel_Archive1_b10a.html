<p>Hi there, it seems we are both translating the same article. I've put up a little more - do you agree with the translation generally? I'm sorry I didn't put up any indication I was working on it, as I knew it might take a while what with my current workload; I think we may have to make a decision as to who translates what to avoid confusion!

<p>I just noticed your nice translation of <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinzig.html" title="Sinzig">Sinzig</a>.

(<a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinzig.html" title="Sinzig">Sinzig</a>, alas, is a bit old already and would only be there for a day and a half, so I won't list it now).

<p>Thanks for your message. It seems to me that not to say the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Versailles_Treaty_7f8e.html" title="Versailles Treaty">Versailles Treaty</a> was unfair is the actual 'vandalism'. That has been accepted by just about every politician and every historian since 1919. If it had not been unfair how do you explain its unpopularity and the rise of Hitler? 213.122.118.148 09:02, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi AmiDaniel. You just treated by edit in the 'DDT (band)' article as vandalism but it is not. According to the book "DDT Empire" ("Империя ДДТ") by Nikolai Kharitonov (Николай Харитонов), the "Vremya" albom was recorded not in Sverdlovsk, but in Moscow, in a studio in the district of Serp i Molot. Also a number of web search requests return the place of recording as Moscow. User:62.118.80.132</p>

<p>Its okay, if you have deleted the article without telling me, then i would have been upset. don't worry, before i only wrote what i could remember from playing the game, and readind the walkthrough (at the top of my mind). I'll put on some more info later.</p>

<p>The section I removed was preachy, POV, had no introduction, and generally felt out of place in the article. It had been posted only hours earlier by another user who said nothing on the talk page. I posted my reasons for removing the section on the discussion page and believe they are valid ones. Had the section been rewritten NPOV, had a significant point, or been placed in the section devoted to critical analysis, I would not have removed it. As I type this, other users have agreed with me and attempted to remove the same section as well. I kindly request my vandalism charge be reconsidered.

<dd>I don't think the mentality is "let's be nice to them and they'll go away," but rather that vandals are usually looking to provoke a reaction and giving them one often encourages them further. A message that let's them know that their vandalism was innapropriate and that it has been spotted and reverted after mere seconds, as will any vandalism they add, seems to be most effecting in detering vandals. I personally feel it acceptable to tolerate one or two cases of vandalism from newbies (as in the case you mentioned), as they are usually just testing, seeing whether <b>anyone</b> really can edit the encyclopedia. Leaving them an insulting and "uncivil" message will then do nothing but discourage them from contributing positively to Wikipedia. If they continue to vandalize, they will then be warned that such behavior will result in their being blocked. I, too, am very annoyed and disgusted by the crap that vandals add to pages, but cussing them out about it makes us no better than they are. You might want to check out <a href="../../../d/o/_/Wikipedia%7EDo_not_insult_the_vandals_9745.html" title="Wikipedia:Do not insult the vandals">Wikipedia:Do not insult the vandals</a>. I don't feel the guideline applies in <b>every</b> situation, but it does tend to be a decent general rule of thumb. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 22:26, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>On another note, when dealing with anonymous users it's <b>very</b> possible that an unintended user may receive your "uncivil comment" and might feel insulted or annoyed by you--might even refer to <b>you</b> as a "vandal." I personally am against anonymous editing, but so long as we still have shared IP users, it's essential to consider that your remarks may be received by the wrong person. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 22:43, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Fine, doesn't bother me in the least. We're talking about situations, for the most part, like schools that have a shared IP address and maybe Internet cafes. So just consider it a form of <b>collective punishment</b>. There's a chance the wrongly-offended person knows the vandal and might get them to stop. Normally, I'm against the idea of collective punishment in the real world (for a particularly egregious example, the treatment of the Palestinians by the Israelis), but in this context, the "virtual" world, I think the bad effects are inconseqential by comparison. So what if a few people get offended? Get over it. --<a href="../../../i/l/i/User%7EILike2BeAnonymous_f872.html" title="User:ILike2BeAnonymous">ILike2BeAnonymous</a> 22:55, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>AOL IPs are actually often shared by <b>thousands</b> of users (which one could easily say is their punishment for using AOL lol jk). It's already bad enough when they come to Wikipedia for the first time and immediately see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:152.163.100.66" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:152.163.100.66" rel="nofollow">this</a>, but it's much worse if their first experience on Wikipedia is having someone call them <b>shithead</b>, <b>pussie</b>, and being told to stop "adding their racist crap." Imagine if you were told that the first time you ever logged on to Wikipedia? I doubt you'd come back. I personally don't feel it appropriate to punish people for the acts of others because they're using the same IP as a vandal, just as I wouldn't send someone in the real world to prison for having the same name as a "terrorist". Therefore, it's always best to just assume good faith and be civil. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 23:09, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just accidentally stumbled upon this edit war, but I have to say the four tags you've placed on this article appear to serve only to undermine the validity of the article in order to make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a>. That can easily be considered vandalism, as can <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, no matter who is right and who is wrong. I urge you to remove at least three of your tags, leaving perhaps "the facutality of this article is disputed," and please have a mature discussion about your dispute rather than simply spitting on the article. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 06:45, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>They constantly keep removing tags. so that now although the article is totally wrong but I'm afraid of 3RR to add it again. I want to add the tag but don't know really what to do. <b><a href="../../../x/e/b/User%7EXebat_f854.html" title="User:Xebat"><font color="#00AA00"><b>X</b></font></a><a href="../../../x/e/b/User%7EXebat_f854.html" title="User:Xebat">ebat</a></b> <a href="../../../x/e/b/User_talk%7EXebat_643a.html" title="User talk:Xebat"><i>Talk</i></a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Xebat&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Xebat&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow"><b>+</b></a> 06:48, 27 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's perfectly legitimate to leave one tag, such as {{totallydisputed}}, on the article if you disagree with aspects of the article--that is until one side of the dispute has gained a clear consensus. The problem here is that posting four redundant tags appeared nothing more than a blatant attack on the article and its editors. Anyone coming to read about Iranian People would see those tags and go running the other direction, convinced that the article had absolutely nothing to offer. In looking over the talk page, no one is really presenting any clear arguments about what they find wrong in the article, just one side saying, "the article sucks," and the other saying, "the article is wonderful!" I in no way want to take sides on this issue, but I feel the issue should be discussed. Therefore, to prevent you from being targeted for 3RR, I will add the 'totallydisputed' tag to the article for you, given that you stop adding ridiculous and degrading tags to the article and that you have a mature discussion and explain what you disagree with--that is, if you want me to. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 07:00, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I really don't want to get involved with the actual content dispute, just so long as the dispute is being discussed thoroughly and fairly. The only advice I'll give you is to try and reach a compromise, rather than refusing everything but your own opinion. Unfortunately, if every other editor disagrees with you entirely, you will not be allowed to include any of your opinions in the article; however, there may be some common ground where both you can express your opinions in the article, and they can express theirs. Once a consensus has been reached, however, it really is common courtesy to concede and stop pushing the issue. Please try to be civil in your arguments. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 07:20, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Even as I appreciate your re-adding the removed PROD tag for the Clocks article, which article, in view of [{WP:BAND]], surely won't survive AfD, I must note that, unlike a speedy or AfD tag, a PROD tag is not to be re-added once it's removed; indeed, the PROD tag is intended for situations where, though speedy is not appropriate, there is no objection to an article's being deleted. The removal of a PROD tag signals that someone objects to the deletion of the article and that the discussion must be taken to AfD (see <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>, which notes, in pertinent part, "If anyone removes [the template] for whatever reason, don't place it back. If the creator (of an article} removes the tag, the deletion...should go to AfD. If the tag is removed without an edit summary, the deletion is controversial and should go to AfD."). In this instance, I'll remove the PROD tag and confirm for myself that the article is about a non-notable subject and will then list the article at AfD.

Wrong though we may think him to be about the notability of the article's subject, it is wholly inappropriate to warn him for undertaking a perfectly legitimate activity, scilicet, the removal of a PROD tag; even as his removing it without an edit summary explaining his intentions is perhaps untoward or in bad form, it is surely in worse form to warn a user who has acted properly under <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:20, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for informing me of my mistake in restoring the article's PROD tags. I had just finished restoring a long series of speedy and AfD tags that were wrongfully deleted by editors, and so I didn't even think twice when restoring this one. I am aware of the policy (I've even deleted several prod tags from articles that I didn't believe met the criteria for deletion), but I just spaced it this time. Hopefully you won't object, but I've just nominated the article for AfD.

<dd>No problem at all; I am well aware of your very competent work to defeat vandals and improve the project, and, in that spirit, I too have made similar oversights. On the AfD, I voted "very weak keep" because I found that music from one of the band's albums is available on MSN Music, which generally confers notability. That said, the group seems altogether nebulous and has fewer than 1000 Google hits, so I may change my mind (I tried improving the article in order that it should demonstrate notability, but I didn't find much toward that end). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:50, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Regarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Steverit&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=44919930" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Steverit&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=44919930" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>:</p>
<p>There is a link to that entry earlier under a different name. No reason to link to it twice, right? Surely someone could figure out that Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band was later abbreviated as Stanford Band.

<dd>I apologize for my indecisiveness in what to do with the page, and I shouldn't have posted a vandalism warning (sorry, hit the wrong button ... tonight's just not my night). However, you replaced a perfectly valid and necessary redirect with an article on a non-notable topic (159 hits). <s>An article on this organization has already been deleted by majority consensus (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_F.U.C.K._aadf.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/F.U.C.K.">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/F.U.C.K.</a>) and as such cannot be recreated without a supermajority to "undelete."</s> If your article had not replaced a necessary redirect, it would have been speedily deleted under <s><a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD</a>/G4 and</s> <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">CSD</a>/A7. As the redirect, however, should not be deleted I simply removed your changes to it. If you would like to campaign to preserve your article, I suggest that you <a href="../../../r/e/g/Wikipedia%7ERegister_6574.html" title="Wikipedia:Register">register</a> for an account and create an article on the topic independent of the current redirect (titled perhaps "Feminists Uncovering Censorship Knowledgeably"); if the article is not deleted, you can then create a disambig page in place of the current <a href="../../../f/2E/u/F.U.C.K._ca5b.html" title="F.U.C.K.">F.U.C.K.</a> article that redirects to both your article and the album. (You might be aware that anonymous users are not allowed to create new pages, which you bypassed by converting an existing article into an article on a totally different topic.) You might also consider contributing information about <a href="../../../f/2E/u/F.U.C.K._ca5b.html" title="F.U.C.K.">F.U.C.K.</a> to the article on <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminism.html" title="Feminism">Feminism</a>, where you'll be less likely to be attacked by notability policies. Believe it or not, I actually support <a href="../../../f/2E/u/F.U.C.K._ca5b.html" title="F.U.C.K.">F.U.C.K.</a>'s cause, and my removal of your article has nothing to do with "masculine repression of women." I appologize for the inconvenience, but we simply have to hold to certain policies to preserve the integrity of Wikipedia.
