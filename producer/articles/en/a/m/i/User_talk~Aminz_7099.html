<p>Last I checked, there seemed to be a consensus that some appropriately-restrained version of the "sincerity" issue can be included in the Muhammad article. If we can keep this brief and non-devotional in character and stick closely to the point, without gratuitous POV quotes ("great religion"), the material will probably stick. There does seem to be broad agreement that Muhammad did believe himself to be receiving messages from the beyond; the question of whether this was true of every revelation can be avoided.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 21:14, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>As <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> is no longer protected, now would be a good time to add the sincerity material. I would suggest, "Contemporary scholars assume Muhammad to have been sincere in his belief that he was receiving divine revelations," followed by your cites to Watt, Lewis, Schimmel and whoever else has said this.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 01:31, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I know you just want WP to be better but the revert you did was to an older version that several people agreed was not neutral. Zora has beg\haved in a very dishonest, fashion as she hates MLM and has done her best to make that an anti-xango site. Just go through the history and you will see what I mean.

<dd>I agree with you aminz.your idea of including the jewish pre-islamic belief doesn't sound like a bad idea at all.the reason why i want to include the gospel of st barnabas is because he is still looked at with respect from christians and he still has followers.i don't see any reason why he shouldn't be included.<a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> clarified my point.please help me with any tips on how to include my entry as well as include yours.thank you Grandia01</dd>

<p>Salam alaykum.</p>
<p>I compare the current version of <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an.html" title="Qur'an">Qur'an</a> article whith the last version I 've edited on November 9. I found that some parts are defected.

<p>On Beit Or 11:50, 12 February, Beit Or said that Watt believes that Muhammad attacked Khaybar to raise prestige amongst his followers, and quoted the following:</p>
<p>"<i>Perhaps it was on the way back from the pilgrimage manqué that the idea occurred to Muhammad of attacking the rich Jewish oasis of Khaybar. The Muslims were disappointed at the apparent fruitlessness of their expedition to al-Hudaybiyah, and it was only natural for an Arab like Muhammad to feel that virtue should not be allowed to go unrewarded. So when he set out for Khaybar some six weeks after his return from Mecca, he allowed only those who had made the Pledge under the Tree to accompany him.</i>"</p>
<p>However, read the next paragraph: "<i>Even if this was one of the points in Muhammad's mind, there were also weighty military reasons for the expedition. The Jews of Khaybar, especially the leaders of the clan an-Nadir exiled from Medina, were still incensed at Muhammad. They made lavish, though no doubt judicious, of thier wealth to induce the neighbouring Arabs to take up arms against the Muslims. This was a straightforawrd reason for attacking Khaybar.</i>"</p>
<p>Note Watt's language. He uses the words "perhaps", and "it was only natural" to describe the first reason. And then, Watt uses "weighty military reasons" to describe the second reason and say that "This was a straightforawrd reason for attacking Khaybar". Clearly Watt favors the second reason over the first.<a href="../../../b/l/e/User%7EBless_sins_31e5.html" title="User:Bless sins">Bless sins</a> 20:49, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>So what? That doesn't make Watt not agree with the one reason, any more than Vaglieri doesn't agree with Watt. In both cases the reasons aren't really contradictory - something you see clearly in one instance, but apparently not here. Even Haykal comes close to stating this, as the Qur'an itself presents the booty of Khaybar as a reward for his loyal followers who got nothing from Hudaybiyah, stating that they should not accept aid from anyone else, lest they have to share the rewards. It's a mere matter of emphasis, a nuance we don't have to capture.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 06:48, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think most scholars agree that Jews were treated or ill-treated like Christians in the classical times. Therefore antisemitism(as it is defined) doesn't have a root in the Qur'an. But the section starts with a section on the Qur'an making the impression that most scholars agree that the Qur'an and example of Muhmmad were antisemitic. That's what I percieve as the problem. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 11:22, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Aminz, in reference to the dhimmi article I believe that the Tolerence section should go, but that much of the information contained in can be retained in the article. I think that keeping things in context can be importaint, but having a seperate section looks like we are appologizing for what was done in the past. It seemed to me that the original section was saying "Yes, islam did this, but look at what others did." The argument is unnecissary in my mind because we have no need or business appologizing for what people did hundreds of years ago and that a simular case could be made for just about any other historical event.</p>
<p>If it is any consolidation, I feel that the information contained in the article is correct. However, I just don't think it fits well in the article.</p>
<p>If one wished to defend the honor if Islam, there are better edits that can be fought over. For instance, I know that in the middle period of the ottoman period, christians would actually bribe officials to take their children to be jannisarries (although I could not cite it.) Also, dhimmi status did not prevent minority religions from competing and even prospering in society. No european nation could say the same. However, if this info is to be added citations must be found.</p>

<dd>Aminz, I wouldn't worry too much about what it included in anti-semitism if I were you: it is only a word. There is a balance between the narrowness/power/usefulness of a "portfolio" concept like this and the extent to which it is diluted and undermined. These days here quite often even Jews are described as "anti-semitic" and the currency is (sadly) steadily being devalued. If all sorts of bits of history are thrown in (a lot more is available) then it turns into a PC concept rather than a really serious matter: a shame but not worth playing King Canute for. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 14:43, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Proof by Wikipedia&#160;:). I guess all words equally are or are not "only a word", and I respect that fact that this word is something that you obviously care about rather more than I do. At the same time, it is obviously possible to understand human history pretty well with or without the interpretative concept of "anti-semitism", as with many interpretative concepts (as for "Acts of God" for example). Whether it is useful in giving some people insight or identity depends on with how much respect the term is treated. These days the term is devaluing every time anyone tries to extract value from it for other ends. Whether it is devaluing from a Swiss Franc from a Zloty depends on for whom but the people who over-use it politically clearly are those for whom its value is very high. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 09:12, 6 March 2007 (UTC) Just to add I have had a look at <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_antisemitism.html" title="History of antisemitism">History of antisemitism</a>: what strikes me as most extraordinary is not so much that the Jewish people have been persecuted from time to time but that alone amongst 6000 year old ethnic-based religions from the middle east (of which there were many) Judaism has survived.

<dd>I think we agree on that. What I still don't know is how remarkable or surprising (or actually how important) antisemitism is in the context of Jewish history. There are lots of groups of people I can think of who sometimes define themselves in terms of oppression and victimisation and sometimes don't: the scots or welsh or Irish for example. Despite the article you suggested I cannot really see whether the Holocaust was a nasty anomaly (in the context of Jews being treated only as badly as other similar groups) or a quitessence of something more pervasive. Realistically people who were born a decade after WW2 now have grandchildren and defining AS in the context of the future seems increasingly important to me than the past. --<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 09:18, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't care about what sort of information Aaliyah wants to publish. Also, it is important to note that she was actively asked to provide more information about her (saying she is just a teacher is not a big deal). Anyways, it is none of my business. All I know is that she doesn't have to do it according to the policies, and if I were her, I wouldn't have done it given the special interest Arrow had to know this (which is suspicous to me).

The main problems with references and footnotes are (1) on an offline version we cannot include links (although we could quote the URLs) (2) children don't really understand them and (2) unlinked lists are very boring. I am not sure about whether to put them in or whether to just refer everyone to the online WP as the source. I will update the articles you mention to a more recent version--<a href="../../../b/o/z/User%7EBozMo_ffc9.html" title="User:BozMo">BozMo</a> <a href="../../../b/o/z/User_talk%7EBozMo_4fce.html" title="User talk:BozMo">talk</a> 20:16, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"when Muhammad encountered contradiction, ridicule and rejection from the Jewish scholars in Medina, he came to adopt a radically more negative view of the people of the Book who had received earlier scriptures." This indicates that the Jews rejected Muhammad because he clearly a fraud, and he got angry at them, and subsequently exterminated them. You only included "he was concerned that they were being stupid." <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 22:04, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>First of all, where did you got the quote:"he was concerned that they were being stupid." Did you just made it up? I don't remember I added such a thing.</dd>
<dd>If you read further, you can article says: "Many Medinans converted to the faith of the Meccan immigrants, but the Jewish tribes did not. Much to Muhammad's disappointment, they <b>ridiculed and rejected his claim to be a prophet</b>. Their opposition "may well have been for political as well as religious reasons". On religious grounds, <b>the Jews were skeptical of the possibility of a non-Jewish prophet, and also had concerns about possible incompatibilities between the Qur'an and their own scriptures.</b>"</dd>
<dd>You can see all three elements: 1. ridiculed 2. rejection of his claim 3. incompatibilities between the Qur'an and their own scriptures</dd>

<p>However is a perfectly valid word to use. However, as I and at least two other editors have noted, you use it too much. It should not be used to connect phrases that not closely related, and it should not be used to produce a run-on sentence. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 07:11, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My point was that the source used that to explain the sentence further. I think it is not proper to stop quoting the source at that point. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 07:18, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Similarly, Lewis quote seems to be word by word. So I think it should be placed between " "s. I am refering to the Lewis's quote "The Qur'an was promulgated in Mecca and Medina in the seventh century, and the background against which Qur'anic legislation must be seen is ancient Arabia. The Arabs practiced a form of slavery, similar to that which existed in other parts of the ancient world. The Qur'an accepts the institution, though it may be noted that the word 'abd (slave) is rarely used, being more commonly replaced by some periphrasis such as ma malakat aymanukum, "that which your right hands own." The Qur'an recognizes the basic inequality between master and slave and the rights of the former over the latter (XVI:71; XXX:28)..."
<dl>
<dd>I don't understand what you're saying. "The Qur'an recognizes..." clearly starts a new idea, the discussion of important verses. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 07:20, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Salam. I want to gather some issues in one section in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html#Islamic_thought_and_literature" title="Islam">Islam#Islamic thought and literature</a> . These are teology, philosophy, Erfan nazari(<a href="../../../s/u/f/Sufi_cosmology.html" title="Sufi cosmology">Sufi cosmology</a>), ethics and litrature. All of these issues make Ulum Islami which want to describe the universe and nature. Now what should we do with some other issues comprising historiography, ethics, natural knowledge or science and socio-political thouth. We can make a separate part instead of Islamic thought and literature and call it Ulum Muslemin. It can't translate Ulum correctly because Science and philosophy are more specific and on the other hand knowledge isn't specific. I use Muslemin instead of Islam because they don't necessarily Islamic. What's your idea? Is it correct to gather all of them in <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> article or should have another article (e.g. Culture and civilization of Muslims) .

<p>I wanted to let you know that i removed your edits to the 300 article. You added a paragraph to the lead that was unnecessary; the Lead, as per the MOS is supposed to be an overview of the article, and forego specifics. As well, the grammar and flow of your resultant edits regarding the criticism section was a bit shaky, and I thought it could be corrected easily, but I kept running into more issues, so I reverted the section prior to the edits. I know that makes me seem like a jerk, and I wanted you to know that I did not do it to be mean or arbitrary.I know you meant well. I have found that, as an article approaches qualification for GA or FA status, that that process is aided greatly when the editors discuss their changes on the article's discussion page <i>before</i> making them. This helps to cut down on bruised feelings and edit wards while fostering a feeling of concensus and teamwork. If I can answer any questions you might have, please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to hearing frm you in the Discussion page when you propose some changes.

<dd>As to our dispute, I think Humus sapiens is not aware of the usage of primary sources in wikipedia.

I posted a comment about this on the talk page to the effect that the quotes attributed to Muhammad and the very early literature of Islam are primary sources. Further, it would be original research to take some quotes from primary sources and draw conclusions from it. In any case, he hasn't joined the discussion. He has done 3 reverts so far in a day and I can show you many other examples of this (no comments on the talk page; 3 reverts in a day). I tried to neutralize the original research <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arabs_and_antisemitism&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=118735323" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arabs_and_antisemitism&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=118735323" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> ...--<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 10:16, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Aminz, I would have no problem to perform any consensual edit while the article is protected for editwarring.

<dd>It seems to me that the various parties are making progress on reaching some compromise version. Can you just join their thread and ask about your proposal? I would prefer to have a clear cut mandate from all the editors letting me know what they agreed on.

<p>Please do not make changes to the article ntil it has achieved a concensus within the Discussion page. this means that other editors get to weigh in on the merits and disadvantages of your proposed change. This is why there are notes in the edit page of each section to discuss the topic first. Discuss, not notify. I realize that might seem a fine distinction, but the article has achieved GA status based on its current state. It is in everyone's best interest to make changes that everyone is going to agree with. I will not immediately revert your edits, but I am guessing someone else will for precisely the reason I have stated above.

<p>You archived the Farrokhe 2 before i could respond to your statement that westereners wouldn't react well to making fun of their religious icons. I wrote the following in response:</p>
<p>I would submit that <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogma_%28film%29.html" title="Dogma (film)">Dogma</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Prophecy_1230.html" title="The Prophecy">The Prophecy</a> and innumerable comedy <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnq7N6X4x84" class="external text" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qnq7N6X4x84" rel="nofollow">skits</a> and comics that make fun of Jesus and Christianity or paint it in quite a dark light, up to and including equating the resurrection with the reanimation of a vampire (no kidding) - all of it with nary a bleat of anguish. the reason why is simple - they are recognized as not being real, and therefore not attacks on current ideas. The Herodotus account makes the persians look bad, and Miller went a step further and made them <i>look</i> bad. the film is widely complimented and acclaimed for its faithful reproduction of the comic. I would further submit that people need to grow a thicker skin:</p>

<dd>Salam, well he called me a troll and then pasted something sarcastic about "being easily offended" all over the place, so that is not right. For this edits, I posted them here on admins page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alex_Bakharev&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=121136600" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alex_Bakharev&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=121136600" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. The problem with people like Bat Ye'or is that they are promoting a conspiracy theory not a criticism, and same with Pat Robertson. I raise such concerns and then they tell me I am easily offended and that my opinion is garbage. Wikipedia is not here to satisfy anti-Muslim fervour in the name of "criticism". I try to avoid these topics because I get very angry when I come across prejudice. Their attitude is very patronising - by their logic, Wikipedia should entertain <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust deniers</a> and anti-Semites as being "critics"!

<p>Hey Aminz, thanks for your message. I don't really think that David is gaming the system because he has demonstrated that he has absolutely no regard whatsoever for the fact the system even exists! As far as his block goes, I agree he should be indefinitely blocked, but I feel it should be done by way of a community ban. I currently regard his month block to be reset each time he creates a new sockpuppet and so I guess if he continues creating sockpuppets, he will be effectively indefinitely blocked. However, I think a community ban proposal would succeeed and I think that is the step we should take. A community ban on the person operating the DavidYork account would be of much more help than a single admin indefinitely blocking his account. If we have a community ban in place, it will be much easier to obtain checkusers on any future sockpuppets since "evasion of community-based bans or blocks" is one of the criteria for a RFCU. Thanks for your work keeping on top of the sockpuppets and for letting me know when you need sock blocks.

<p>Hi FayssalF,</p>
<p>User:DavidYork is gaming the system by creating sockpuppets and violating his block. During his block, he has so far created at least 10 socks(7 users + 3 IPs) blocked one after another by a couple of admins; has also further used these accounts to votestack for the Hitler article to be chosen for the GA article drive.
