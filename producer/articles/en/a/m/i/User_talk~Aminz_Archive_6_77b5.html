<dd>I actually thought of an interesting example of my own, which I definitely cannot put on Wikipedia. As the Qur'an says:<i>..and let them wear their Khimar (coverings or head-covering) over their bosoms, and not display their ornaments..</i>. It is similar to if someone says to me that I should close buttons of my shirt. Does that mean, that I should always wear shirt or it means that I should not show my bare chest to others. Because I can still wear some other dress and still follow this rule. So I think, this verse is just emphasizing on chest covering rather than head covering and it is totally taken wrong by most Muslims. But look at this: <a href="http://understanding-islam.com/related/text.asp?type=question&amp;qid=3482" class="external autonumber" title="http://understanding-islam.com/related/text.asp?type=question&amp;qid=3482" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<dd>The biggest example is sanctity of family system, which definitely comes from restriction of sexual relations to only spouses.

<dd>If you read the article "Good and Evil" which I sent you and you read the Qur'an:"But the fact is that man is well-aware of himself even though he puts up his excuses." (75:14-15) and you read the saying of Jesus:Every man will be judged according to his own scale. These all things bring us to the fact that we all share same values as humans. We know from our nature what is wrong (basic stuff i.e. not to lie, not to steal, not to betray, not to be dishonest etc. and most of all, belief in one Supreme being) Hence west is not going to find something new in this regard. What the religion actually tells us, are only those things in which there are chances that we will make mistakes. For example, religion doesn't tell us how to make cars, but it does tell us that we should dress modestly, because it is possible that we will finish up in a moral dilemma. Similarly, religion does not tell us that we should not eat lions or tigers, but it does tell us that we should not eat pork, whose beastly habits are dominant, but human nature can fall easily. Similarly, the spirituality cannot be best attained unless done with body jestures. This is exactly what Islam teaches us in the form of prayer, and then religion sets limits that how can we show our affection to God, as people have been doing human sacrifices. It is a complex thing, this world is not black and white. Even though I have firm belief in Islam, there are Muslims who are doing horrible things. So things are not black and white on surface, but our decisions are always because of some struggle which we do in ourselves. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 07:41, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe that Jews have a lot of difference among themselves. If you would ask a Ribbinic Jew or Hissinic Jew and then a progressive Jew, you will find a lot of differences. So you cannot generalize your ideas regarding Judaism by just talking with a Jew. Although, we Muslims tend to differ from each other on basic issues a little bit less than what Jews would differ with each other. For example, a progressive Jew (at least my friend) doesn't believe in a physical afterlife, but other Jews would disagree with him. In theory, it is a huge difference of opinion especially if said by a renouned scholar. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 09:14, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>But interesting enough, in many things, we do share a lot of trades. For example, Jews love to play with words, as this Jewish fellow replied to a comment on first commandment that it is the denial of all gods and not injunction of one God that will make us successful. Our scholars sometimes have such stupid discussions, which to me, are just making excuses to have your own belief. But I must say that, it was a good conversation. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 09:36, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have no doubt that all religions did come from the same God, so theoratically speaking, they all have to advocate the same objective; which we don't see. So if all Muslims have the same Qur'an, the probability is very high that it is the same Qur'an from Prophet Muhammad(interestingly, even with some basic differences, Shias and Sunnis have the same Qur'an). But when we talk about issues like usury, people forget that prohibition is because of ethical reasons, and I would strongly disagree that Morals change with time. And I believe before people actually point out that Islam needs a overhauling, they should present problems in Islam, as our understanding of the religion can be faulty but the not the religion which is meant to be in this world till Judgement day. Every thing in religion has a reason, and I learned this way, and I am a strong advocate of this approach. But the important thing in our learning of the religion is that we are not taught Morals but rather religion is taught first (considered to be a substitute for Moral teachings), which I don't agree. A person has to be first human, then a good Muslim. Islam can only be appreciated if you have good Morals, otherwise results are in front of us. As I always say to my friends, you can be a good person without any religion, but religion gives you a good reason to be good, even in complex cases of Moral dilemmas. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 12:08, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Sir a religion give us a chance to be a good human, this was the basic principal of nearly all the religions. I disagree with respect that a person has to be a human first and then good muslim. I think a good muslim is a good human, the problem come to interpetret the meaning that some take differently. The God send his messengers only to improve the human beings, in order to make them better. What kind of changes you think are necessary to improve Islam, if I ask&#160;? <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 23:04, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>The most important reason for the religion is the success in our <a href="../../../a/f/t/Afterlife.html" title="Afterlife">afterlife</a>, which with no doubt, is the most important thing as this life is limited but the next one is forever. It is also evident that those people who accepted Islam in the early days of Islam, were the ones who had strong appreciation for truth, and at least were abstaining from things like telling lies and dishonesty. Preaching morals are described in the religion under the term <a href="../../../e/n/j/Enjoin_what_is_good_and_forbid_what_is_wrong.html" title="Enjoin what is good and forbid what is wrong">'<i>amr bi'l-ma'ruf wa nahi 'ani'l-munkar</i></a>, and the reason behind is that, first a human is asked to have good morals and then he will be a better recepient of the truth, otherwise there is no benefit of putting best books on the back of a donkey. And I will re-iterate, what I just said in my previous message, that Islam doesn't need any change. Our understanding can be faulty but not the religion itself. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 03:53, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Salaam, I have changed this article. You should have a look. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 18:31, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Salaam, Nice to hear from you again. I edited another article, <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women_in_Islam_11b5.html" title="Women in Islam">Women in Islam</a>. I wanted to move <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women_in_Muslim_societies_e1a9.html" title="Women in Muslim societies">Women in Muslim societies</a> to this article, but <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">User:Zora</a> resented, as she said that even though we don't have credible source to link offenses like <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honor_killing.html" title="Honor killing">honor killing</a> with Islam, we still need to present it. So I created a complete article altogether based on jurist opinions. Now I have asked <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">User:Striver</a> to secularize the latter article (remove the Islam banner and replace with contemporary controversies of Islam[he will have to make one new] plus giving socio-political reasoning for the events rather than religious reasoning). If you can also help in this process, that'll be great.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly, you asked about Shia Muslims, I am ready to call "The people of the book" as Muslims, so Shias are definitely Muslims in my dictionary. But remember, salvation in the afterlife is not on your assosiation with any group (even identifying yourself with Islam is not enough), it is based on certain rules. As in Qur'an:<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/005.qmt.html#005.069" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/005.qmt.html#005.069" rel="nofollow">5:69</a> . So these are the positive qualities, which a person should have. The negative things are: a person should not have killed an innocent life, he should not have denied a true messenger after it becomes evident to him, and he should not have decieved others in law of inheritence (that would apply only to Muslims to my understanding), otherwise Qur'an promises eternal damnation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>FYI: while it is true that Shias &amp; Sunnis have the same Qur'an (I'm not arguing this issue at all), I wanted to point out that "Bismillah" is actually counted as an Ayah, at least by Sunnis. There are 114 instances of "Bismillah" in the Qur'an (the same as the number of Surahs); one Surah (At-Towbah) doesn't have it at its beginning like the other 113, while another Surah (An-Naml) has it twice (at its beginning and in the middle). Clearly, the number of times "Bismillah" was revealed is of significance. Salaam.

<p>Hi Aminz, first of all cong. on new Barnstar... I think if this trend continue like that, we may have to recommend you for President&#160;:-) anyway, I read your work on page you send me for view and possible feedback, I must say, that you have done a great job, and its wonderful. What you have suggested as guidlines, I think no one will argue on it. As you know the realibility of some one is always relative, there will be some scholors, who are well known and admired by many, but still there will be some who dont like them. As I was reading the talk pages on Islam related articals, I have noticed that still this is the case, where alots of quotes and information was not accepted by many editors, because in their view the person is disputed. I personally agree with your recommendations of people, as reference on any Islam related articals. I think all these poeple are reliable enough to work with. I am sorry I dont know still Mr. Fred Donner, I think I missed him some how. I am very much carefull when its come to Sharia, there are alots of miss understanding about it and well as you know there are alots of different openions are "versions" so my suggestion that when ever we talk on it, we should ...well how I say be very carefull about. Similarly, I think you will agree with me when its come to the topics like, violence on the name of Islam, or slavery and other topiscs, where a non friendly picture of Islam presented, is important issue. There are alot of miss information on it, and alots of these can be found on wikipedia also. I agree with you on one thing, as you answerd someone, I m sorry i forgot where, that some of these things were not related with Islam, but with the time when these things happend. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) married many times, but at the time it was also a cutome or let say tridition. There are whole alot of things which can be present with that, offcourse if 200 hundered years later, we as humans find a way to slaughter Chikens in more "Decent" way, who knows if you use method we use now, you will called "Butcher" or non civilized.. you know.. I agree, that the matter related with religions are sensetive and difficult to present, but we can only try and hopefully our work may be seen as neutral and positive. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhippi46_12f0.html" title="User:Phippi46">phippi46</a> 16:40, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aminz</p>
<p>I expect you have seen in the decision on HE's arbcomm case that it is has been ruled acceptable to use traditional Muslim terms such as "Salaam, brother". May I take this opportunity to say use this expression to you because 1) as we all know Salaam means peace, and I wish peace to you and to everyone around the world and 2) because I regard you as a brother, since in my experience you treat everyone you meet in Wikipedia as your brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>I liked reading your explanation about your interest in comparative religion.</p>
<p>I would also like to show that use of this expression cannot create a hostile atmosphere for non-Muslims, since I happen not to be a Muslim myself.</p>

<p>thanks for your work on the islam and slavery article Aminz.. the lead was something that really needed a bit of work. i think the state of the article is much better than it was before (i still have some more stuff to add i think). cheers&#160;:) <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 06:53, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>do you think that the "Treatment of the slaves" section should be merged into the first paragraph of "slavery in islamic jurisprudence"? because they both essentially say the same thing and the treatment of slaves is part of the fiqh of slavery. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 08:01, 14 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>sure, no problem. the only reason i say is because i would assume in the books of fiqh that treatment of slaves would be included under the chapter of slavery. i think user truthpedia included some quotes from Lewis on the issue of changes made on the advent of islam (check first para in "slavery in islamic society"), if it doesn't fit there then in the treatment section would be ok too. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 08:26, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank you, Aminz, that is very kind of you! It has cheered me up on what has been a somewhat depressing article.</p>
<p>Regarding the image, it's true that from many perspectives, this is anti-Zionism, not anti-Semitism. The reason I feel it's appropriate for this article is that this is what the new anti-Semitism boils down to (in many ways) i.e. a disagreement about what is anti-Zionism and when it crosses the line into anti-Semitism. The image is an illustration of the confusion. On the one hand, it's about anti-imperialism, anti-capitalism etc. On the other, the Jews are depicted as backing up Satan, there are Nazi symbols mixed with the Star of David, and so on, and these are all classic anti-Semitic <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motif.html" title="Motif">motifs</a>. It's that synthesis or ideological confusion that goes to the heart of the new anti-Semitism debate. In addition, the image has been discussed in the media and on blogs as representing anti-Semitism, so it's not just a bunch of Wikipedia editors who are saying that. But thank you <i>very much</i> for agreeing not to press the issue. I'm still trying to make contact with the artist in the hope that he will agree to release it under a free licence, and if he does, we can use it anywhere we want, so then it could go on the Anti-Zionism page too. I'll let you know if and when I'm able to reach him.</p>
<p>I very much support you on the issue of academic sources, and I'm currently trying to find strong academic sources who argue that there's no such thing as anti-Semitism. We have Brian Klug saying it, who's an excellent source, but beyond that I'm not having much luck. If you come across any, please do let us know.</p>

<dd>As Qur'an says:Indeed those who are opposing Allah and His Messenger are bound to be humiliated. The Almighty has ordained: ‘‘I and My Messengers shall always prevail’’. Indeed Allah is Mighty and Powerful. 58:20-21. This clearly shows that God protects his Messengers. Similarly Moses dared to go to Pharoah, even there were prophets before him, just because he was a Messenger and not only a prophet, and he had the protection of God. And if people do kill ambassadors of God (Messengers), this definitely brings question on authority of God. Furthermore, it is very strange for Islam to accept that someone's suffering can bring salvation. Rather Islam asserts that every thing on the day of judgement will be on merit. So when these scholars say that Jesus died and then raised, it means that God does not allow people to dishonor his Messengers even their dead bodies. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 10:42, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well! It is easy to say that we don't have sympathy for pagans of Arabia but difficult to explain to a normal person. Secondly, <b>dhimmi</b> by any definition was discreminatory and a second class citizenship. It was good if compared to other parts of the world at that time but I am still not comfortable with it myself.

<dd>Bible portrays the correct impression, and I don't have any problem with that. But my concern is that world thinks that we have evolved to a point where we can have a better sense of human rights, but I think Islam championed it 1400 years ago. This is why, heavily taxing someone just because he/she is not from our faith, without any good reason, is not a good practice of human rights. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 06:43, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My observations tell me that there are many Muslims who are doing the most un-ethical things and there are non-Muslims who are living an excellent life that would suit more to a good Muslim. And as we have discussed that salvation is based on certain rules. I also believe that Ummayid and Abbasid regime became so currupt that they couldn't even lead a friday prayer session infront of open public, and they gave this responsibility to scholars, which then used Mosques as propaganda machines (and are still using it). I do believe that Muslims treated non-Muslims better than others, but my concern is that God is just. Those people who saw the society built by Companions of Prophet Muhammad, they couldn't remain unimpressed, as the Qur'an says "you are witness to the world just like Messenger is witness to you". Only those people were rightly subdued but those who came under currupt regimes of afterwards, they don't need to be impressed by their ethics, and they were wrongly subdued. However, when I say ethics or morals, I mean universal morals, which don't change with time and indiscrimination is one of them. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 08:08, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's a common misperception but it's not true, read the policy. It doesn't matter if it's the same stuff. You have seven reverts at least in eight hours.

<dd>Opiner, I still don't think I have made many *reverts*. See, this controversy is a headache and we need to reach a consensus. Reverting back and forth between two versions isn't helpful. I have provided reasons for my edits in the edit summaries. If it convinces you, keep them. Otherwise rewrite it.

<dd>uhmm... One can put these details but these are not conclusive or imperative. I am very much satisfied with the fact that Muslims negotiated with them and they were punished by their own laws. And similarly, I do believe that those who are involved in Terrorism should be punished by the same laws which the Qur'an has mentioned for such horrendous acts of "disorder in land", which include torturous death, cruxifiction, chopping of limbs from oppossite sides, and exile. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 06:04, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Aminz. I have (reluctantly) redeleted that page, as the user indicated that he was not returning and that he wanted the page deleted again. However, since you posted on it and the user replied, and I deleted the page four minutes later, I just want to let you know (in case you missed it) what his reply to your reply was. I quote: <i>":Not your fault, I should never have hit edit."</i></p>

<p>i took a look at it just now... that is really fascinating! note the seal too&#160;:) also, if you check out the topkapi pic in the article and try to look at some of the text on the actual parchment you can make out some of the similarities i think. i assume that if the book is copyrighted then the pic here would be too, though i am not sure because he takes the pic from a 1904 book or magazine it seems. if it's old enough it may actually be out of copyright. i will try to check. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 01:31, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>yes, that the muqawqis letter is thought to be a forgery by Buhl, Ohrnberg, Noldeke and perhaps others. other, generally Muslim sources tend to declare it sound. i have put the caption information as "Puported letter.." because although its authenticity may be disputed, it is certainly notable to show within the context of the discussion. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 13:41, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Once I read in Qur'an, in which Qur'an alleged Christians for two things. One was that they followed their desires and second was that they forgot prayer. This prayer is essentially the same prayer which we pray. As there are hadith with say that people had already been praying five times a day before even prophet Muhammad were prophesized. Jews even today pray three times a day. The point which Quran wanted to raise that these people forgot the meaning of prayer. They followed their desires and made a complete doctorine out of it. Even in Surah Fatiha (the first chapter of Quran) the Quran call them as the people who went astray. Quran never uses the word astray for Jews, rather Quran says that they are the ones who earned God's anger (in first chapter). Quran also talks about those things which Jews still believe that God is residing some place higher and he doesn't interfere in wordly matters. Qur'an has replied to such beliefs in following verse:"The Jews say: "Allah's hand is tied up." Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for the (blasphemy) they utter. Nay, both His hands are widely outstretched:"<a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/005.qmt.html#005.064" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/005.qmt.html#005.064" rel="nofollow">5:64</a> After reading a couple of things, and pondering on different social concepts and our religious concepts, I have realized that there is a large chunk of knowledge that is mixed with Islamic knowledge and it actually came from Christianity. We embraced alot of concepts of these nations. Even Al-Tabari talks about such stories, which are no more than Jewish folk tales. We created a complete doctorine of <a href="../../../m/u/27/Mu%27tazili.html" title="Mu'tazili">Mu'tazilis</a> after being inspired by Greek philosophy (which I think is the mother of Christianity). According to Esposito, our women were pushed back into the society because of the customs adapted from Christian world, which Quran doesn't preach. Now Muslims are trying to protect that part of the religion which neither Quran advocates nor the life of the prophet but a religion which has been evolved and mostly confused with culture. I would like to embrace the original Islam (or Original Christianity or Original Judaism) in which Prophet Muhammad use to take pledges from women, women use to participate in dialogue on every Friday prayer sermon. A society which is based on democracy that a person can hold a prophet from his neck and prophet would say to his companions that this person has a right over me as I have to give back his money. I think we have already confused ourselves alot in taking values from others. Maybe my tone is a little bit strict, but this is how I feel.

<dd>I am even suspicious that maybe Jesus' second coming was actually inspired from Christian traditions. I also think that <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunni.html" title="Sunni">Sunni</a> <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shia.html" title="Shia">Shia</a> conflict was really bad.

<dd>Thanks for a lengthy answer. The relevant verse is <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/019.qmt.html#019.059" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/019.qmt.html#019.059" rel="nofollow">19:59</a>. This verse alludes to Christians (although you can take it for someone else but this is the most appropriate meaning to me as it is talking about a nation even after Israelites). Secondly, when I said that the same prayer, I mean the prayer with the same objective and basic structure. As Quran explicitly talks about Abraham and other prophets prostrating and bowing, which is no more than a prayer, and Jewish traditions prove that it was a recursive daily practice. We utter <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Fatiha_0a63.html" title="Al-Fatiha">Al-Fatiha</a> in our prayers, Christians used <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lords_prayer.html" title="Lords prayer">Lords prayer</a>, Jews used Davids prayer as in <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Psalms&amp;verse=86:1&amp;src=31" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Psalms&amp;verse=86:1&amp;src=31" rel="nofollow">Psalms 86:1</a>-17 and in <a href="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Exodus&amp;verse=34:6&amp;src=31" class="external text" title="http://php.ug.cs.usyd.edu.au/~jnot4610/bibref.php?book=%20Exodus&amp;verse=34:6&amp;src=31" rel="nofollow">Exodus 34:6</a>-7.

<dd>I don't deny that there are good teachings from other religions or philosophies. A person should accept anything that is good and leave what is bad. There are no two opinions that bible can be beneficiary. Even the flaws of Jews and Christians, which Quran discusses, has to be understood in the light of bible, otherwise we will try to understand things out of context. I myself, like many sayings of Jesus from bible, and I marvell at his wisdom. The point which I really wanted to raise in my previous message was that when we embrace others beliefs, we should first weigh them. Otherwise, we may confuse, because of the similarities, that this thing is what our religion teaches or we borrowed it. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 09:17, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Salaam bruv, hope you're well. 1) Very interesting correspondence with Truthspreader about Jesus, a pleasure to read. Scholars think Mark was the first of the gospels to be written (traditionally it was Matthew). I recently (re)read it trying to brush from my mind all preconceptions received from my education in a nominally Christian country. What struck me was the way Jesus taught like a Buddhist master, the love of paradox, the way the poor disciples misunderstood everything until Jesus turned their beliefs upside down. If you google for "Tao + Logos" you will see what comes up. Few sources nearly good enough for WP but very fertile ground for future scholars. I wonder how much there is still to uncover about the links between different religions. 2) Talking about what's good enough for WP, wondering if you would have time to look at <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forced_conversion.html" title="Forced conversion">forced conversion</a>. It is up for AfD and I really don't know how to vote.

<dd>Running out of time yet again and writing this in a hurry. You might as well dip into the Tao Te Ching itself rather than reading interpretations of it. It's not long and you can get different translations on-line. Balance is a part of what it's about. The Qur'an verses that mentioned "balance" seemed to relate to fair dealing in economic and political relationships, which is interesting. A great thing about Islam is the important role it gives to conduct in social and public affairs - never introverted, unlike some tendencies in Christianity. I think of the Tao as "the way of the world". If you work along with the Tao then things will go well for you. It is like "working with the grain", if you know that expression. Another thing you might want to do if you're browsing in your university library is to look at "Science and Civilisation in China" by Joseph Needham (several volumes). It describes the achievements of traditional Chinese science, which was Taoist in inspiration. I'm sure you'll find interesting connections with Islamic science. Needham was an Anglican Christian. And I'm glad you've met some Christians you can learn from. Perhaps they could introduce you to Jewish people who are interested in inter-faith dialogue. Please don't stereotype from your experiences on WP (I know you don't want to). All the Jews I know well are peace activists. <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 22:24, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Aminz - and thanks for your message. Unfortunately, I'm afraid I'm not going to be much use to you. I'm not "knowledgeable" and got involved here by chance, after responding to a request to translate the 'Arab Slave Trade' article from <a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Traite_musulmane&amp;oldid=6766171" class="external text" title="http://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Traite_musulmane&amp;oldid=6766171" rel="nofollow">French</a> into English.

<p>Hello Aminz, Thank you for your work on the Muhammad's page. Since the article is about Muhammad I thought we should give real examples from Muhammad's life that are proofs of his reforms as far as women's rights are concerned. Thats why I chose 3 good hadiths that show that. You may some issues with the Hadiths but thats how most muslims know what they know about Muhammad. I admire Espisito, but I think quoting Muhammad's is more worthy here and it would give the reader a better idea on Muhammad's reforms while keeping the article fair and balanced. Let me know what you think. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarwan123_f7b9.html" title="User:Marwan123">Marwan123</a> 20:33, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aminz, you accuse me of being a sockpuppet on the AfD debate for the Quran and Science. Because I <b>only</b> have 60 (actually 64) edits and they are mostly part of AfD discussion. Please note that these 64 edits have been within a time frame of only about 2 weeks. Quite frankly if someone has time to have a significant higher level of activity on wikipedia, I think that they are a little too in love with the internet instead of actually going out and living life. With all due respect also, I think that your English is a little hard to follow sometimes and certain points in your accusation are confusing. In two weeks time how many posts or edits <b>should</b> I have made in order to satisfy you? I am new to editing wikipedia, although I have been a user for a long time. Sockpuppet was a new term to me, but as I now understand it (correct me if I misunderstand, since this is something you are accusing me of) it is someone who utilizes multiple accounts for the purpose of voting more than once, or otherwise utilizes multiple accounts in order to break WP policy. This accusation is unfounded and is an insult to my honesty. I voted only once according to my conscience to <b>delete</b> based on valid points. After the article made some progress I had an honest change of heart and changed my sole vote to <b>keep</b> as you can see in the archived debate. That most of my editing is in regards to AfD's is due to the fact that 1) I am a deletionist- I believe WP is best served by editing and deleting material that does not conform to WP policies regarding encyclopedic verifiability and NPOV; 2)if I participate in one AfD debate it becomes easy to go down to the next AfD debate in the current AfD discussions page that sparks my interest. Many people spend the bulk of their time doing similar things. I have run into the same users multiple times because they are most likely doing the same thing. You can be assured that I am not the same people as these users since I usually run into the same users with an opposing vote to my own. Please also note that I do occasionally edit pages such as the page for <a href="../../../n/i/h/Nihang.html" title="Nihang">nihang</a> if an article is within my personal interests and stands in major disrepair or poor spelling and grammar, or vandalism. Otherwise I stick to my vision of improving wikipedia by assessing whether a page is valuable or not worthwhile to the general user of encyclopedic material. I offer my respects to you, and ask for your respect and please assume good faith! <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_hornet_0ed2.html" title="User:Green hornet">Green hornet</a> 03:44, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No need to apologize. I wouldn't say that my edits were or are sophisticated. Wikipedia is actually pretty easy to get used to. I had experience with writing some code in the past, as well as basic web design and flash, by comparison WP is really simple. Plus I played with the sandbox and read some wikipedia stuff on editing and deletion first to make sure I was doing it right...and I made a couple mistakes anyway. Hope you are well. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_hornet_0ed2.html" title="User:Green hornet">Green hornet</a> 02:59, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Principally speaking, I couldn't find anything different from Sunni Dua, except it talks about progeny of the prophet, which I think should be followers of the prophet (this is my personal guess). Secondly, I am of the opinion that a person should be interactive with his God, just like people have recorded different Duas from the prophet even in the prayer, which shows that except a few restricted things like reading <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Fatiha_0a63.html" title="Al-Fatiha">Al-Fatiha</a> and some part of the Qur'an, the prophet used to say different Duas at different occasions. I keep these Duas (ones you mentioned are also good) as role model and then describe my feelings in my own words (sometimes).</p>
<p>I think that Sunni Shia conflict should be left behind, as people call themselves <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salafi.html" title="Salafi">Salafis</a> (who were two three generations after <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaba.html" title="Sahaba">Sahaba</a>), why don't we call ourselves <b>Sahabis</b> to show that we follow the prophet and his companions, so that those events which occured afterhim doesn't affect our religion. But then I think, these events (even though some of them are political) determines our sources of the religion, especially hadith, which eventually determine our faith in different things and also shape rituals to some extent as well. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 06:05, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Eid Mubarak, Aminz. I believe that <a href="../../../b/i/r/Biryani.html" title="Biryani">biryani</a> would be a suitable dish to celebrate the occasion, and since I know how to cook it, I would like to offer you this large plateful (photo should go in here). I hope I'm right in thinking that it is an originally Persian dish that was brought into northern Indian cooking as part of the Muglai tradition (the recipe I follow is a British-Indian one). Anyway, however you're celebrating, celebrate well! <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 22:57, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Aminz! Thanks for your message, and my apologies for not getting back to you sooner (give me a few moments and I'll find a good excuse, but for now it's because "I didn't get around to it sooner". My bad&#160;:o| ).</p>
<p>Yeah, he is def Mahound, <i>not</i> Mahmoud. This is clear to me because I remember a conversation about emails he wasn't getting etc, where we talked about how his name didn't have the spelling most people expected (nor the pronounciation... as he kindly pointed out to me!).</p>
<p>Mahmoud, of course, is a common name in the UK, so my mistake there wasn't <i>entirely</i> ignorance! I hope...&#160;:o/</p>
<p>As to where he comes from, it was Keighley or Oxenhope or around that area.</p>

Or am I missing the point? <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETom_harrison_ffb8.html" title="User:Tom harrison">Tom Harrison</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/o/m/User_talk%7ETom_harrison_de49.html" title="User talk:Tom harrison">Talk</a></sup> 23:46, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The word you are thinking of is "indigenous." Indigenous means "native", but in context meant those sects deemed heretical to Byzantine Orthodoxy.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 06:20, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wasn't removing sourced material. I was restoring them. It would be a long story if I want to start from the beginning. That section got my attention while ago and tried to improve it, but was encountered with silly arguments sometimes at the level of arguments like: The title of Lewis book: "The Jews of Islam" says it is about the Jews so it can not contain anything about Christianity. I stayed away from the article for awhile, but then came back recently.</p>
<p>Anyways, I don't think it worth it either for me to explain everything from the beginning or for an outsider to follow all those discussions. It is much better to spend our time doing something more useful. I drop my request for unblock. Thanks anyway for your response though, Future Perfect at Sunrise. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 22:23, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I prefer to get away from wikipedia now. I was wondering if Jesus had come today what his message to Christians was; we know what his message to Jewish rabbis was. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 11:58, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aminz, my friend, Jesus' message was the same to everyone: love each other. And if you think that's difficult, he also said that if someone attacks you, turn the other cheek. If that's what he said in a country under a brutally repressive foreign occupation, that's what he would say today. (At least that's what his main message is in the New Testament but I know there are also lots of Islamic writings about Jesus, that portray him as a gentle and kind person.) Hope you are doing fine. Don't let Wikipedia stuff get you down. <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 12:49, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Judith, I wish you knew what pain did these editors gave me. You are quite knowledgable about Dhimmi. Dhimmis were guaranteed their personal safety and security of property. As Lewis says "persecution in the form of violent and active repression was rare and atypical".(Lewis (1984) p. 8.) Yes, there were social and legal disabilities, but not violence. I don't know where did they got the idea that there were waves of violent Muslim persecution of Christians. Even after long discussion (imagine I was faced with arguments like since the title of Lewis's book is "Jews of Islam", it is not about Christianity) One of them reported me for 3rr revert because they wanted to write Muslims were <i>sometimes</i> violently persecuted Christians, while I was saying <i>rarely</i> is more accurate as Lewis says. I was blocked for 24 hours for nothing. Then isn't it hypocrisy to recite Jesus's words for me? The words are beautiful only when they are uttered in action. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 13:02, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
