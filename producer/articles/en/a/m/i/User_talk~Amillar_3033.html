<p>Hey Amillar. Welcome to Wikipedia! (no! sorry! just kidding!) How'd you get the picture from 1911 encyclopedia? Do they exist on the web? <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur3030_8009.html" title="User:Arthur3030">Arthur</a> 21:16 Mar 18, 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>Heh! Thanks&#160;:-) No, I haven't found them on the web. I own a few beat-up volumes of the EB11 and scanned the aqueduct pictures myself. Black-and-white images are being processed through <a href="../../../d/i/s/Distributed_Proofreaders_78db.html" title="Distributed Proofreaders">Distributed Proofreaders</a> right now (and I'm working on that project) but unfortunately the photos are very poor in the scans we are working from. The line-drawn pictures are decent, and hopefully we'll find a way between DP and archive.org to make the entire image set available, but it isn't there yet. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmillar_a6b9.html" title="User:Amillar">Alan</a></p>

<dd>Thanks. I'm experimenting with some scripts to snarf the pages and cross-reference with the article page and other listings (list of inventors, list of Mexicans, etc.). We'll see how it comes out&#160;:-) <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmillar_a6b9.html" title="User:Amillar">Amillar</a> 16:12 25 May 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good work on all those biographical listings! However, are you sure it's a good idea to be creating all these new pages using the subpage naming scheme? We're trying to get rid of subpages&#160;:) If you're only experimenting, then nevermind... but perhaps we should work on un-subpaging them before creating new ones. -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 14:21 6 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>
<p>This whole "subpage" issue is an interesting one. Since the new Wikipedia software doesn't implement subpages, pages with a slash in the name are just more pages. So by definition, I haven't created any new subpages-- only new pages consistent with an older naming scheme&#160;:-) If you'd like to rename them to something without a slash, I'm certainly fine with that and I'll go along with whatever people would rather call them. Until there is a consensus on a new name, I'm just keeping them consistent with each other. -- <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmillar_a6b9.html" title="User:Amillar">Amillar</a> 16:15 6 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aren't they? Subpages have automatically-generated links at the top back to their "parent" article. <a href="../../../d/o/_/Wikipedia%7EDo_not_use_subpages_54cd.html" title="Wikipedia:Do not use subpages">Wikipedia:Do not use subpages</a> recommends moving them to a better name whenever possible. -- <a href="../../../w/a/p/User%7EWapcaplet_7f49.html" title="User:Wapcaplet">Wapcaplet</a> 21:39 6 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

However, <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmillar_Contributions_aa4e.html" title="User:Amillar/Contributions">user:Amillar/Contributions</a> <i>does</i> have a link back to <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmillar_a6b9.html" title="User:Amillar">User:Amillar</a>. I guess we are both wrong&#160;:-)&#160;:-) One of the procedure pages says they are implemented for Talk: and User: namespaces. I learn something new every day.

<p>Hello Amillar, first good work for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people.html" title="List of people">list of people</a>. It is a labor-intensive task so it is really great you are spending time. I just want to ask you if you can mark your contributions for list of people as minor since I don't think there would be any controversy about your editing because it seems to me you just break up pages. -- <a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakuyaMurata_085a.html" title="User:TakuyaMurata">Taku</a> 05:27 12 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your feedback. Based on your comment that it seems to you that I'm only breaking up pages, I'm wondering if you have not seen what has been happening with the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people.html" title="List of people">list of people</a> pages in the last two weeks. I'm not just breaking up pages, or just making minor changes. I've added new list entries, or updated dates or comments on existing entries, for a few thousand people. Feel free to look at my <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Amillar" class="external text" title="http://www.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Amillar" rel="nofollow">list of contributions</a>. I wouldn't necessarily call it controversial, but there have been a number of things to discuss about it at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_people_c639.html" title="Talk:List of people">Talk:list of people</a> (not to mention this very user talk page), so I don't think I should downplay the changes. If I only change one or two things on a page, I usually do mark it as minor. -- <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmillar_a6b9.html" title="User:Amillar">Amillar</a> 05:47 12 Jun 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Alan, I'm sorry for interfering with your work. I, too, was first under the impression you were doing just a simple page split-up, so I decided to help to make it go faster. I didn't realise you were also adding things; sorry if I caused confusion or inconvenience. -- <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimwi_eb8f.html" title="User:Timwi">Timwi</a> 23:01 12 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please, by all means, do not consider this as "my work" or that you are interfering. This is definitely a collaborative effort!. In particular, I make some mass updates and I don't always catch duplicate names or other mistakes, so I defintely need your and everyone else's proofreading skills.

<p>Please note, at List of people associated with World War II, the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H.W._Bush_6cdf.html" title="George H.W. Bush">George H.W. Bush</a> page (no space between initials) is just a redirect to the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_H._W._Bush_6dcc.html" title="George H. W. Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> page (space between initials), so it's really quite useless to use a [[George H.W. Bush|George H. W. Bush]] piped link, since it shows up with the space that way, but links with the redirect. If your intent was for it to display without the space, that would be done as [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush]] instead, but I don't consider keeping the space out to be a good enough reason to bother with a piped link anyway. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnOwens_79a2.html" title="User:JohnOwens">John Owens</a> 20:51 17 Jun 2003 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for catching that. As I've mentioned in a few places, I'm using some script programming to try to get some consistency between the various <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people.html" title="List of people">list of people</a> pages, including sorting through the numerous variations in people's names. Obviously I got that one wrong. I appreciate the extra eyes in catching these things.

<p>Alan, Thanks again for your work in the biography name lists. As I've added entries, I have had one idea about headings, and thought I'd ask you opinion (because I'm undecided}. The page heading would be clener if we removed the unused links (e.g. there won't be any names in 'Rd'). OTOH, if we remove them all, and then need to add one (suppose that an 'Rc' name shows up), we'd need to go back and add that entry to all the 'R' subpages. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../l/o/u/User%7ELouI_01b3.html" title="User:LouI">Lou I</a> 19:43 17 Jul 2003 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that it looks better. My basic reaction, however, is that I don't want to do the work either now to remove them or later to re-add them&#160;:-) Wikipedia being what it is, though, I would encourage you to feel free to clean them up however you think looks best. When I do more page splits, I'll still create them like they are now (all letter combinations), but I won't object to anyone else cleaning them up. &lt;Rant&gt; Actually, I object to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_by_name.html" title="List of people by name">list of people by name</a> pages existing as wiki pages at all. They should be something like Special: pages automatically generated from metadata in people articles.&lt;/Rant&gt; But, hey, I also object to war, pollution, and entropy for that matter, and just objecting doesn't fix it. So we can make do with what we have to work with for now. -- <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmillar_a6b9.html" title="User:Amillar">Amillar</a> 22:09 18 Jul 2003 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, Alan; thanks for all those entries (before i arrived at WP) on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_by_name.html" title="List of people by name">List of people by name</a>. And you know that no good deed goes unpunished:</p>
<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=List_of_people_by_name:_Bar&amp;diff=1005388&amp;oldid=1004816" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=List_of_people_by_name:_Bar&amp;diff=1005388&amp;oldid=1004816" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] you introduced</p>
<dl>
<dd>*<a href="../../../a/c/a/Acacius_of_Constantinople_fb97.html" title="Acacius of Constantinople">Baquet, Achille</a>, patriarch of Constantinople</dd>
</dl>
<p>Later, someone (i'll figure out who if this doesn't pan out) introduced</p>
<dl>
<dd>*Baquet, Achille, musician</dd>
</dl>
<p>They <i>could</i> both be right, but i suspect there's some kind of garble involved in the first one, which perhaps should simply be discarded.</p>
<p>It might be that Baquet was misfiled, by first name, at the time of the garble creating opportunity for them to interact, and later got moved from the As to the Bs. (I haven't checked <a href="../../../a/c/_/List_of_people_by_name%7E_Ac_195a.html" title="List of people by name: Ac">List of people by name: Ac</a>, since they probably were built and manipulated before being added to WP.)</p>
<p>(Curiously, but i assume irrelevantly, they got separated by a misplaced heading in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=List_of_people_by_name:_Bar&amp;diff=1380645&amp;oldid=1380476" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=List_of_people_by_name:_Bar&amp;diff=1380645&amp;oldid=1380476" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, which has probably delayed suspicion about this.)</p>
<p>I'd welcome any insight you could offer.<br />

<dd>Thanks for catching that. The entry on the "B" page is just plain wrong. The name "Baquet, Achille" should only be associated with the musician and should not point to the patriarch. Please feel free to fix it and anything else you come across. The way it happened is that "Achille" was next to "Acacius" in a list and they got mangled. I was actually using some automated scripting to gather and update the data, and obviously I didn't proofread close enough. I gave up after a while because I decided that manually maintaining it all is silly when the software could do it for us. I'm waiting for the new categorization stuff to settle; when it does then I'm sure the List of People pages will be unnecessary and will go away completely. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmillar_a6b9.html" title="User:Amillar">Amillar</a> 17:32, 28 Jun 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>First off, apologies for any breaches of protocol regarding my article on Sleep Apnoea; this was my first (albeit brief!) contribution, and I should have read the guidelines more carefully.</p>
<p>That said, my article on SA was original work (not "a cut-and-paste from a medical text"), lifted directly from my dissertation on the subject, as were the strange pink images. Rather than disregard it completely in favour of the older text, as you did in reverting to a previous article, perhaps you could marry the two into a better article?</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to reading it.</p>
<p>Kind Regards, Gary Bass MD</p>

<dd>Thanks for your note. My apologies for making a rash assumption about your work; it is well written and Wikipedia will definitely benefit from it. I'm not going to volunteer to do the integration of the whole thing, but we can structure it so the Wikipedia collaborative effort can work on it. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmillar_a6b9.html" title="User:Amillar">Amillar</a> 23:58, 2 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>NP. I've made a go at integrating the articles, correcting some minor errors in both, so there is a structure there for future updates from other Wiki encyclopaedists.</p>
