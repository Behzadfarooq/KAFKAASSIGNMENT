<p>VandalProof now uses a tabbed browser interface (pictured right), similar to that of Opera, IE7 or Firefox, which should make navigation a bit easier. To open a link in a new window, simply hold down the Ctrl key and click the link. To close a tab, double-click on it.</p>

<p>VP can now retrieve recent changes from the RSS feed, which offers a lot of new features. For one, it now uses <a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupin_68a5.html" title="User:Lupin">Lupin</a>'s badword list to identify catchwords, such as obscenities, and report them in the recent changes list under "Filter" to make spotting vandalism easier. It will also now report the number of characters added or removed in the list, and it will display any particularly large removals in boldface. You can then scroll through the edits, using up and down arrows or clicking, and they will load instantly in the main browser window as you can see to the right. While it isn't as attractive to look at as diffs, they load with almost no delay so you can review 50 edits in less than a minute. If you would rather view the diff in the old, more attractive format, you can either click on the item in the list with the Shift key pressed or you can click "Last diff" in the main browser window.</p>
<p>Also in the interest of making things faster, I've now implemented precached rollbacks, whereby it retrieves the oldid of the last version by the previous user to which you can revert and then prepares to revert long before you click the Rollback button. This way, when you click Rollback, the reversion is almost instantaneous. It will also disable the rollback if someone else, such as <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawkerbot2_313a.html" title="User:Tawkerbot2">User:Tawkerbot2</a>, has edited the page following the change you are reviewing, which helps to prevent edit and warning conflicts. It's all still a bit shakey, but coming along quite nicely.</p>
<p>VP now also has the functionality to filter recent changes for edits coming from an IP range.</p>

<p>After griping about VP's bad log-in for so long, I finally did something about it! In v1.3, when you load up VP you will see this screen. It will now automatically identify under which account you are logged in on Wikipedia and what rights you have there, and if you are not logged in correctly (due to odd IE cookies, etc.) you can then click "Chg," enter your password, and click "Log-in to WP" to log you in on VP's internal browser and bypass any cookie problems. Note that you do not have to provide your password if you choose not to, and most users will not have any problems if they are correctly logged in on IE; this feature was provided merely to make things easier--the passwords are not stored or sent anywhere, not even on your own computer. Once you have verified that you are correctly logged in, you can click "Verify Authorization" which then checks if the username is on the approved user list and will then load up the typical VP form. Thanks to <a href="../../../y/u/r/User%7EYurik_8d9d.html" title="User:Yurik">Yurik</a>'s fabulous Wiki API I've been able to make this process lightning fast!</p>

<p>Following the recent AOL DoS attacks and the ceiling cat vandal, I and others agreed that the ability to pull up all on-top contributions from an IP range would be a very useful tool, so I decided to give it a shot. My first idea was to load up the contribs of every single IP address in a given range and add them to a list--then I decided I didn't feel like waiting an hour for the results, and I also didn't want to be the one responsible for bringing down Wikimedia's servers. So I came up with a much better approach that involves eliminating those IPs with no edits on top and then retrieving contribs from the remaining IPS, the results of which method proved quite successful.</p>
<p>As you can see at the right, this tool is now a quasi merge of the former "Rollback All" tool and another tool to retrieve the contribs from an IP range. When you load the dialog, you can input a username, an IP address, or a series of usernames and IP addresses (each divided by "&amp;&amp;") and click "Retrieve Contribs." This will then populate the list with all on-top contributions from the given IPs and usernames sorted by date from most recent to oldest. Double-clicking on an item will load the diff in a new browser window, and clicking "Rollback" at the bottom will then use bot rollback (admins only) to revert all checkmarked contribs from the given users or IP addresses, which goes quite quickly--much quicker than the former Rollback All tool could.</p>
<p>To load the contribs from an IP range, click on "Load IP Range." This will open an input box requesting the range to use, which you should enter in the following format: "STARTADDRESS::LAST". For example, "172.0.0.0::255" would equate to all IP addresses between 172.0.0.0 and 172.0.0.255. Note that all ranges must be smaller than 256 IP addresses. Once you enter the range and hit OK, the edit box at the top of the form will be filled in with a series of IP addresses ("172.0.0.0&amp;&amp;172.0.0.1 ... &amp;&amp;172.0.0.255"). Now you must be thinking that retrieving the contribs from 256 IP addresses must take a long time; however, as I hinted above, my method of elimination has resulted in a <i>very</i> quick query. If you look at the image to the right, you'll see that retrieving all of the on-top contribs from the AOL IP range 207.200.116.0/24 (or 207.200.116.0::255 in VP notation), quite likely the most active of all IP ranges Wikipedia, took only 52.10726 seconds; however, since I've uploaded that screenshot, I found a couple of foul-ups I made and have been able to reduce this query time even further. When I just ran this exact same query at 06:46, 28 June 2006 (UTC), it took only 37.38973 seconds.</p>

<p>Yes, that's right, ON WHEELS!!! VandalProof now has the ability to clean up page-move vandalism in just a couple of clicks. It's really quite simple to use — not too much to explain. You type in the username (or there will also be a menu item to load this when looking at a user's talk page, etc.) and click "Retrieve Log." This will return all the page-moves by a user and generate a list of actions to complete to undo the page-moves (as you can see to the right). Should you feel that any of the provided actions need not be performed for whatever reason, you can uncheck the item. When you click start it will go through the list, moving pages back to their original location and deleting the resulting redirect.</p>
<p>I actually just got to use this tool for real the other day, as you may be able to find in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=move&amp;user=AmiDaniel" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=move&amp;user=AmiDaniel" rel="nofollow">my log</a>, reverting the page-move vandalism by Villy van der Veelen.

<p>In the rare instances when two users attempt to revert and warn for the same edit, we often see cases of warning stacking. In v1.3, VP will be able to detect any other VandalProof warnings for the same edit and prompt you if the user has already been warned for the edit. I'm also working with Joshbuddy and Tawker to prevent stacking on top of Tawkerbot2's warnings.</p>

<p>Most of the anti vandal tools/methods I've seen don't have any capabilities for keeping an eye on things that are listed in the user 'log' rather than 'contributions'. This makes sense because page moves get listed in both places and deletion, protect/unprotect, and most other 'log' actions are available to admins only. However, image uploads are available to everyone and can be used to vandalize by overwriting an existing image with a new one. We now protect images displayed on the main page due to this problem, but it is always possible for someone to forget to protect an image or a vandal to hit an image on the 'article of the day' or other high traffic page. If this tool could (or already does) detect cases where an existing image file has been 'updated' I think that would go a long way towards stopping such attacks. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBDunkerson</a> 13:41, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Definitely a great suggestion--I wish I had thought of that earlier. Unfortunately, in order to release it this weekend, I'm not going to be able to incorporate that feature into the current version. I will definitely try to work it into 1.1 though. I'll have to honestly admit that the User Contribs function of VP is a long way from reaching its full potential--right now it simply loads the contribs in a list and clicking on an item produces the most recent revision to the article, which really isn't that particularly useful. In the future I'm hoping to add some functionality such as a one-click rollback of all user contribs, and thanks to your suggestion, the ability to view user logs as well. Just wondering, are IP users able to upload images? That seems awfully dangerous--since the previous versions are archived it's not too difficult to restore an image that gets written over, but it really wouldn't be that difficult for a user to piggyback some indiscrete yet harmful virus onto an image (if it hasn't already been done before). As much as I love the idea of a totally free encyclopedia, I sometimes worry that Wikipedia's openness leaves it quite vulnerable to a possibly catastrophic attack by a determined supervandal. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 21:35, 5 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't really want to comment much on this right now, but your suggestion is very closely related to my original "master plan" with this program. VP1 is a very small stepping stone along the path to my ultimate app that will guarantee that <i>every</i> edit is reviewed and all vandalism is deleted within minutes. But that's still quite a way in the future, so I really don't want to go into details about it now. For now I'm just concerned with getting VP1 up to par. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 04:50, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

However, I would advise you to be careful with detecting the vandals' past warning histories, as some people use non-standard warning templates (such as <a href="../../../i/l/y/User%7EIlyanep_Tools_deca.html" title="User:Ilyanep/Tools">Mine</a>.

<dd>I hope you don't mind my moving this down to suggestions, but I don't think it really qualifies as a "bug." As of yet, the app only detects the common "test" templates and "block" templates by identifying key words on the user's talk page (such as "Thanks for experimenting"); as such, it would not recognize some of your templates as warnings. I really can't take into account <i>every</i> possible combination of words to mean "test1" and didn't want to dedicate too much time to cataloging every custom template, but as most users stick with the test templates, it generally provides an accurate overview of the user's vandalism history. Typically, it's mostly important to know whether the user is a repeat vandal or not, for which not every possible template must be counted. As for using your own templates, I've recently made it possible (though not particularly user-friendly) to customize the eight buttons that appear above the browser. I'll explain more about how to do this after I release the app. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 03:39, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The buttons are actually customizable (though doing so is not particularly user friendly). Once I get some time, I'll expand the help file and explain this better, but essentially, you can open the file "CustomButtons.txt" from the app's directory and find the button you want to change. With the rollbacks, the first line will say "&lt;ROLLBACK #&gt;", the next will be the button caption (i.e. "Rollback {{test1}}"), the next will then be the message you want the button to post. Be sure the message does not exceed one line, as that will corrupt the file. Also be aware that it will add "A link to the edit I have reverted can be found here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pagename&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=Oldid" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pagename&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=Oldid" rel="nofollow">link</a>.

(edit conflict, lets see if we agree!) I've (roughly) highlighted the area I'm talking about. Screenshot is same size as my resolution (1280X800). Not a big deal, and I'm not sure how easy it is to change this sort of thing, but if it is possible to squash the things at the top just that little bit, so all that horizontal space can be used it'd be great.

<p><b>ALSO:</b> Maybe a small button that says "PageInClip" or something shorter. What ever would this do? Well, it would surf to the URL that is in the clipboard at the momment.

<dd>That's sort of been my thinking with a lot of things in this app. A lot of the vandalism is incospicuous; the majority of reverts I do are on small stubs and are usually small changes (like changing 33% to 133% usw.), and that's the vandalism that <i>really</i> does harm. The really obvious vandalism, such as page blanking, is often picked up by bots (see <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawkerbot2_313a.html" title="User:Tawkerbot2">User:Tawkerbot2</a>, about the best antivandal bot I've seen). Currently my app just receives the standard feed, rather than the rss or the atom, as those feeds take <i>much</i> longer to load, and as with many things, I traded speed for functionality. Later versions may use IRC feeds and bots (much like <a href="../../../c/d/v/WP%7ECDVF_3ebb.html" title="WP:CDVF">WP:CDVF</a>), in which case doing this would not be difficult, but that's still quite a way in the future.

<dd>1.0.1 is really just the composite of the simple bug fixes I've indicated on VP's welcome page. Nothing functional about the program will actually be changed, just a few minor bugs and mistakes I've made. The only major change of yet has been to the start-up routine, which in this version produces a fatal error for many users; otherwise almost all of the bugs that have yet been reported, I believe, are the result of a faulty instalation... changing the deployment method doesn't affect the actual file itself. Right now on my machine, the last full compile I did was the one I uploaded, and once I compile it with my current changes, it will then be the first revision to 1.0. Therefore, I think 1.0.1 is an appropriate version number.

<li>Under the <i>Propose Deletion</i> --&gt; <i>Speedy Deletion</i> drop downs would a {{db-nonsense)} option be able to be added at all? Also...</li>
<li>Also, the {{test5-n}) button should really be replaced as 99% of users can't actually block.</li>
<li>A newpages section (like the recent changes) would be awesome for catching speedy deletes</li>
<li>Is it possible to have a back browser button added? This means once warned we can get back to the newpages, recent changes or watchlist more easily (I am right clicking and using the back option on the menu but it is cumbersome</li>

<dd>The article whitelist/blacklist will take a little bit of work to implement, but I'll try to add it in 1.1. As to the importable/exportable user lists, the functionality to do so already exists in VandalProof. If you open up "WhiteList.txt" and "BlackList.txt" in the same directory as you have VandalProof.exe installed, you'll see the list exactly as it appears within the application. You can edit these lists externally with notepad or any other text editor, so sharing lists is actually quite easy. What I really need to create is some depository where any user can add the users on his/her list and where any user could then simply copy and paste the list into his/her own. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 07:35, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>With VandalProof's ever expanding features and the increasing number of users I think that it is imparative that it is easy to contact any of the moderators (especially for when AmiDaniel is not online) in the event that a user is abusing the tool. It doesn't really matter if the user is intentionally abusing the tool or is having trouble using it, but they could be stopped before the damage gets out of control. The problem is that if someone notices an issue where the software is being abused, they may post it on AmiDaniel's talk page and if AmiDaniel isn't online, but another moderator is, they easily may not be aware of it. Basically, the page that I am suggesting would be an emergency page that listed the contact information for the moderators and people could list any abuse. Also, administrators could add this page to their watchlists and if they see a problem user listed, they could block the user until the user is able to fix the software problem (or in the case that is being intentionally abused, they could be stopped). I guess it would work similar to <a href="../../../a/i/v/WP%7EAIV_b7f6.html" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> which basically acts as a 911 system to get into contact with administrators when a user is on a vandlism spree. Obviously I hope this wouldn't be needed very often, but I think something like this would be useful. If it is a bad idea, feel free to say so, or if it can be improved, speak up. I just don't want the community to start looking down upon this software if there becomes an issue with either troublesome users or users having trouble using the software. --<a href="../../../p/s/2/User%7EPS2pcGAMER_3063.html" title="User:PS2pcGAMER">PS2pcGAMER</a> (<a href="../../../p/s/2/User_talk%7EPS2pcGAMER_9645.html" title="User talk:PS2pcGAMER">talk</a>) 07:49, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Woo-hoo! A good suggestion that's incredibly easy to implement (you could even do it yourself!). In cases of abuse with this tool, I'd hope that admins would quickly step in and block the user for at least a short period (even if their abuse is accidental), which will then leave time for mods to remove the users from the list, add the appropriate TEMPREM commands, and contact the user to resolve the issue. That has always been my biggest fear with this tool (and especially with the Rollback All feature)--that either users with poor understanding of Wikipedia / VandalProof or intentionally disruptive users would use the tool in a way that it was not intended. That's why I set up my CheckUser list, to preemptively stop inexperienced users and vandals from abusing the tool, and why I've made sure that all edits will indicate in the edit summary that <i>this</i> tool was used to make those edits (and partially why source code is currently not available). I actually think this tool has even more ability to be destructive than, for instance, <a href="../../../a/w/b/WP%7EAWB_c695.html" title="WP:AWB">WP:AWB</a>, but I hope that it will only be used to do good. Nonetheless, we always have to anticipate that one bad egg who takes a good thing and ruins it for everyone, so I'd say we should definitely implement some kind of "Moderators' Noticeboard".

<dd>This question kind of goes with that suggestion. I haven't gotten around to creating a test account and experimenting with this by myself, so I figured I'd ask you. Does the application check for permission before each edit (or X number of edits)? If this isn't the case, hypothetically, a user could open up VP and make bad edits (intentional or not) and if the moderator takes away the acccess, the user would still be able to use the program until the user closes and reopens the application. --<a href="../../../p/s/2/User%7EPS2pcGAMER_3063.html" title="User:PS2pcGAMER">PS2pcGAMER</a> (<a href="../../../p/s/2/User_talk%7EPS2pcGAMER_9645.html" title="User talk:PS2pcGAMER">talk</a>) 08:09, 16 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I don't want to give tips and tricks to the vandals, but yes, it only checks the list when the user navigates to the start page (at first load or through the file menu); thus, the most effective way in stopping individuals who abuse the tool is an administrative block.</dd>

<dd>On a similar note as well, I was wondering if we could maybe start a discussion about the criteria for accepting/rejecting users? Currently, it states that users with fewer than 250 edits will not be accepted, which I think I'm going to change to 250 <b>mainspace</b> edits, but, to again use AWB as a milestone, should we maybe up it to 500 or otherwise tighten it? I sort of unilaterally set the standard, but I feel it might be a bit loose.

<dd>I have mixed feelings. I haven't really thought these ideas through and I probably should go to sleep, but... One idea if the rules are less stringent is that users should be willing to be temporary banned if there is an issue with their usage of VP until they are able to get into contact with. Basically, treat users like bots. If a bot seems to go crazy, admins are allowed to ban them until the issue can be investigated. However, some may object to this harsher policy, so maybe the rules should be more stringent so that only more established users are able to use VP (so there'd be less of a likelyhood that the tool would be abused). I am kind of leaning towards suggesting that the rules should be a little more strict, but I am not really sure either way. --<a href="../../../p/s/2/User%7EPS2pcGAMER_3063.html" title="User:PS2pcGAMER">PS2pcGAMER</a> (<a href="../../../p/s/2/User_talk%7EPS2pcGAMER_9645.html" title="User talk:PS2pcGAMER">talk</a>) 09:02, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Sorry to bug you with another issue. This is a low priority request, but would consider modifying the program to be able to adjust the widths of the display window? Right now I have an extremely wide "my watchlist", "recent changes", etc section that uses quite a bit of white space. Part of the problem is that I am running at a low resolution, but the other part is that I have a lot of tabs at the top of the page (both user added and admin tabs) that creates some horizontal scrolling. As I said, not a big deal, but I think it would be a nice ability to have. --<a href="../../../p/s/2/User%7EPS2pcGAMER_3063.html" title="User:PS2pcGAMER">PS2pcGAMER</a> (<a href="../../../p/s/2/User_talk%7EPS2pcGAMER_9645.html" title="User talk:PS2pcGAMER">talk</a>) 09:07, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Adjustable widths have always been in the back of my mind, but that's going to have to wait for a much, much later release. Just getting the controls to preserve their geometric ratio to the form when resized took two sleepless nights, and I've been terrified to change anything about the interface since (though adding the "Rollback All" button wasn't particularly difficult).

<dd>Dial up! =0 I don't know how I could live. Actually, I've been looking for quite some time for a way to load a diff but hide the entire preview section (as I rarely ever need to look at that, and it often slows everything down quite considerably). I keep thinking there must be an ampersand operator to do this, but I can't find one.

<dd>The buttons at the type are customizable.

Navigation controls such as a back button are on my to-do list, and I will likely add some functionality for monitoring new users. I was actually thinking about proposing a WelcomeBot (which would monitor new users) as I see sooo many users who were never properly welcomed, but I'm not sure if some people would have reservations about an automated welcome as opposed to more personal, manual welcome. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>)</dd>

<p>Just a thought, but I have ran across several vandals that have been warned by tawkerbot, and I subsequently revert and warn with test1. As tawkerbot is "on" all of the time and reverts who knows how many edits, perhaps your program should recognize tawkerbot's warning as well. This would help "us" in recognizing whether a vandal has had "first contact" with any members of wikipedia.</p>
<p>distinct parts of tawkerbot's warning are...<small>below</small></p>

<dd>The problem there is that it would lag the program. I'm looking into using Wiki API to query histories as opposed to screnscraping--if i find it to be sufficiently faster then I might consider this. However, using my current method it would just be much too slow and would likely annoy everyone to have to wait for it to retrieve the edit, retrieve the page history, scrape it down, and then load the diff again. I'll continue to experiment with the Wiki API and see how that goes, though--it may be a possible solution. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 01:46, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Okay, blacklists are grabbed from a text file, so how about the black list for everyone is shared centrally, and when a user is added to the local blacklist, it goes on the universal one. And the universal goes onto the local one. Same for whitelists.</p>
<p>Also, you could have a watchlist anyone can edit of highly vandalised pages. This is also importated and reflected in the RC view.</p>

<p>I just thought, wouldn't it be cool if the software could detect what warnings (the {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest_d929.html" title="Template:Test">test</a>}} series and the like) a vandal has recived, and then issues the next one, without having the user check first? Of course, a user would have to investigate before blocking someone (not to mention be an admin).</p>
<p>And are the recent changes updated in real time? How cool would it be to have RSS-based live collaboration with other editors weeding out vandalism?</p>
<p>Also, could you make it so any user with "wheel" or "communism" in their name was automatically blacklisted?</p>

<p>Could you make this work with Firefox and/or Opera? I feel that IE gives me too much trouble and I don't like how it renders some pages. My guess is if you're working on this tool for Mac and/or Linux you're probably incorporating a different browser anyway, but it was just a thought.

<dd>I much prefer the Opera browser as well (I don't have really any experience with FF at all), but the problem is that I don't have, or am not familiar with, any OLE handles to Opera/FF, and even if they existed, that would mean more or less a complete rewrite. I also figured it easier to just stick with IE as almost everyone at least has it installed. Thanks for the suggestion, but I don't think we're going to see this happen.

<dd>Actually, belive it or not, VP already has filtering mechanisms like Lupin's tool, using the same wordlist and everything; however, it's disabled because it just takes too long.

<dl>
<dd>Yep, it's become quite clear that something has to be done--just about everyone has had similar problems with "Report to AIV." In place of a separate confirmation message, do you think it would be enough if the "Brief reason for listing" prompt displayed the username (where you can still hit cancel)? That wouldn't be at all difficult to incorporate, and I think it may help to cut down on this problem a bit. I apologize for the high learning curve. It honestly wasn't my intention to make everything so complicated, and I'd like to work to make it more understandable; it's just difficult for me to anticipate problems that others will run into, as I'm just way too familiar with how it works. Anywho, keep up the good counter-vandalism work, and I hope v1.2 will make things a little easier to use. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 04:49, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Alright, I just put in a couple of safety mechanisms. First of all, if the user is an administrator or on your whitelist it will prompt you before you can report him/her.

<p>Hi, I see that this program uses the IE ActiveX control, I wonder if you are aware that it is very easy to use the Mozilla ActiveX control instead?

<dd>Yes, I'd like to put in some back/forward buttons as well, but I was really dumb when I designed the interface framework for VP.

<p>Along this same line of thought, it would be nice if a check was made right before the revert, to see if someone beat you to it. Then, if someone had, it would alert you and stop the process.

<p>I'm pretty sure I've seen this discussed elsewhere... would it be possible to get a version of the program that uses admin rollback as well as issuing warnings? I've liked the tool so far, but it seems somewhat redundant if I have one click rollback. A couple of other suggestions: button to block for n hours and add a {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest5-n_b8de.html" title="Template:Test5-n">test5-n</a>}} warning with n hours as the parameter. A series of block buttons for set amounts of time? There wouldn't necessarily need to be a seperate program for admins, since if non admins would click the buttons, MediaWiki would just tell them they couldn't do it, right? Anyway, I like the program! --<a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDeskana_5f27.html" title="User:Deskana">Lord Deskana</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDeskana_208e.html" title="User talk:Deskana">Dark Lord of the Sith</a></sup> 21:14, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'll likely implement admin rollback eventually, though with the next version I'm using precached non-admin rollbacks which work pretty much exactly as fast as admin rollback.

<p>Not difficult to do at all. I kept all of VP's file access linear, so that any user knowing what he's doing can easily modify it. You can simply copy the Wikimark-up code of your /VandalismLog to your "VandalismLog.txt" leaving out any extra header information that VP adds in automatically. Then you can open up "MyCount.txt", where the first number is the number of edits you've reverted, and the second number is the number of mistakes you've made. You might also want to copy your /VandalismMistakes to your "VandalismMistakes.txt" as well. As long as you update it after logging off and copy it when you log in on a new machine, it shouldn't be a problem at all. If you'd like me to add in a little feature to do this automatically, I probably could quite easily. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 09:05, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>As an aside, I have to say I'm something of a signature nazi and don't at all approve of excessive sig cutomization. (So you know, your sig, with timestamp, is a ridiculous 382 characters long--the message of your post occupied two lines and your sig three--excessive, if you ask me.) However, you can customize this in VP already if you'd like. Open up your "CustomButtons.txt" and append to the end of each template message "~~~##NOSIG". The "##NOSIG" will tell VP not to append your sig to the message. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 02:43, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The edit counter was really developed as a quick, easy way for myself and others involved in approving users to get a raw edit count (i.e., to see if the user has 250 in main). The current limit is 5000 as that's the maximum contribs that Wikipedia will allow to load at one time; to retrieve "accurate" counts greater than 5000 I would need to read timestamps and calculate offsets (and it would take a lot longer), which sort of defeats the purpose of a <i>raw</i> edit counter. For a more accurate count try Flcelloguy's tool or Interiot's tool 2 (if someone with more patience would like to fill in the links on those, it would be much appreciated).

<dd>It will only add user talk pages to your watchlist if you have it set in your Wiki preferences to add pages you edit/watch to your watchlist. I could naturally force it to unwatch any usertalk pages you edit; however there are a lot of user talk pages I prefer to keep on my watchlist, as I'm sure others do as well, so that's not really an option. Not much I can do about it, sorry, but you could always just turn that setting off in your preferences and then watchlist manually whatever you want to. It does automatically watchlist any article you tag for speedy deletion / prod to your watchlist, but not any article you revert, as I personally don't want all of those clogging up my watchlist. Anyway, I'm busy busy busy on the next version, and I'll hopefully have it ready sometime in the not too distant future. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 01:01, 15 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, in pywikipedia you can specifically state if you want the page to be added to your watchlist or not when saving it, no matter your preference ... I think?, so it should be possible in VP also, but maybe the .NET framework you use does not have that feature yet.

<dd>Yes, there's a check box under the edit summary textbox, "Watch this page", the preferences just set whether that should be checked by default or not, you can still change it.

<dd>Yes, VandalProof does have the ability to set it, as I explained above. However, there are really only two possible options--yes or no. VandalProof cannot make the distinction between pages you chose to watchlist and pages that are watchlisted due to your Wikipedia settings--it's not a mind reader. With user talk pages, VP will err on the side of the user's settings; thus, if the talk page is already by default watchlisted it will not de-watchlist it; likewise it will not watchlist it if the page is by default not watchlisted. If you do not want pages you create/edit to be added to your watchlist by default, then open up Wikipedia, go to "my preferences" / "editing," and uncheck "Add pages I create to my watchlist" and "Add pages I edit to my watchlist." That's really about all I can do for you.

<dd>I'm working on it. The new log-in method will check for sysop rights, and if there, you get a nifty "+sysop" and can use VP's sysop tools.

<p>I've got another suggestion. As you probably know, some authorized users (including myself) are having trouble with the authentication due to browser/cookie issues. An idea to solve this problem is to allow users to verify themselves by entering their username and password into VandalProof. This implementation can also potentially prevent unauthorized users from using VandalProof on an authorized user's computer. The only problem is that some users may not feel comfortable about entering their password into third-party programs. --<a href="../../../i/x/f/User%7EIxfd64_14d3.html" title="User:Ixfd64">Ixfd64</a> 22:41, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I dont know if this has been raised but...sometimes when I warn a user on a cetain topic a different person warns the user at the same time...so is there a way to check to see if the current articles the vandals or someone reverting it when you click one of the warning buttons?

<p>One additional problem - strikes me again and again. Is VP warning a user where I didnot revert as someone else was faster. Often I leave the warning as the other reverter does not leave one but I think that VP should check that it actually edited the article before leaving a warning - lovely program though - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripitus_dfdd.html" title="User:Peripitus">Peripitus</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeripitus_05d5.html" title="User talk:Peripitus">(Talk)</a> 12:01, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was looking for the same thing that <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienceman123_5c75.html" title="User:Scienceman123">Scienceman123</a> was, and I think I know the problem. When you have a ==Header== followed by other text on the same line, the header ceases to work. As the custom buttons only allow you one line for the warning, it's currently impossible to add a header with the warning. The suolution? Instead using a new line to detect the start of the next button parameter, use some symbol, like a * or ^. That way, headers can be added and VP will add a much nicer looking display to vandalpages. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Olsen_0313.html" title="User:Daniel Olsen">Daniel Olsen</a> 21:39, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm well aware both of the problem and the solution.

<p>Hi: do you have anyway of adding a feature to VP whereby it would flag up (in a different colour, say) edits made to articles in certain categories? We have had a bit of trouble tonight with edits made to <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christine_Jennings_6b7a.html" title="Christine Jennings">Christine Jennings</a>, who is running for US Congress later this year. I've done a bit of detective work and it seems to me that Jennings and the woman she is running against, <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jan_Schneider_5135.html" title="Jan Schneider">Jan Schneider</a>, have both had people make edits to the articles which serve their own interests. I've discussed this with <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">User:Jkelly</a>, and he is of the opinion - and I agree with him - that this sort of thing is only going to get worse as we approach the election in November. I've created a category, Category:2006 US Congressional Election Candidates, and would love it if VP could flag up all edits to articles from this category. Any chance you could do that? Perhaps the best way would be to give users of VP the option to watch whatever category they wanted, then they could choose whether certain edits were flagged or not. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Kemp_db60.html" title="User:James Kemp">Jim</a> (<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames_Kemp_4cf0.html" title="User talk:James Kemp">Talk</a>) 00:24, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>First off thanks a lot for making such a great vandal-fighting tool! It works great and it makes RC Patrol a lot easier.</p>
<p>With that said, I have one or two suggestions...</p>
<p>1) Give an option to not display edits to user/talk pages. I'm finding that these are less commonly vandalized than the mainspace articles. 2) Give an option to bold featured articles that are edited. I'm finding that edits to these made by anonymous users are quite often vandalism, or reduce the quality of the article and require attention.</p>
<p>That's it for now! My apologies if these have already been suggested. —<a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELantoka_28a7.html" title="User:Lantoka">Lantoka</a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../l/a/n/User_talk%7ELantoka_f8aa.html" title="User talk:Lantoka">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lantoka_9349.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lantoka">contrib</a>)</small></sup> 08:51, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You can hide edits to user and talk pages by opening up <i>RC Preferences</i> and clicking on the NS button next to each RCItem you wish to modify. From there you can select which namespaces you want to show up in the RC list.

<p>What about making the program calculate some kind of a Score for every edit telling users how probable it is that the edit is vandalism? This combined with the planned feature of network cooperation (so every edit gets checked only once or twice) would make it a lot easier. You could for example make a (automated?) list of "known good contributors" or give positive scores to users (the more a user edits without vandalism, the bigger the score) and give edits by this users a lower spam probability. You could also allow everyone to use VP for voicing his opinion, the opinions of users with a high positive score being given more weight (just add up the scores of all users that say "this is vandalism" - if the sum is over the value of x, revert) and other nice things. Would be really a lot of coding though, that would require a whole trusted dev team. --195.145.172.242 13:04, 3 December 2006 (UTC) (I do not have an account in the en wiki, just de)</p>

<p>Although I'm a WP:VP user and not an admin, its frustrating to have to take an admins time up to do blocks in repeat ongoing vandal attacks.

<p>I suggest that when you are RC patrolling, the revert buttons should be: <i>Rollback {{test}}</i>, <i>Rollback {{vandal}}</i>, <i>Rollback {{delete}}</i>, <i>Rollback {{spam}}</i>, 2 more various options, and <i>Rollback (custom)</i>. Each of the four rollback buttons would open a small popup window which would ask the warning level (1, 2, 3, 4, or 4im), and then would post the appropriate warning using the new system <i>{{subst:uw-warningtype#|Pagename}}</i>. Administrators would use one of the extra two buttons for <i>Rollback {{block}}</i>. This would allow over 20 warning templates to be accessed quickly and easily without use of the custom warning button, while still leaving one or two buttons open for customization. <a href="../../../p/y/r/User%7EPyrospirit_f67a.html" title="User:Pyrospirit"><font color="green">Pyrospirit</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/y/r/User_talk%7EPyrospirit_78ef.html" title="User talk:Pyrospirit"><font color="red">Flames</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pyrospirit_30cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pyrospirit"><font color="orange">Fire</font></a></sup> 00:56, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, "as few steps as possible" is the idea behind this. It means you'll almost never have to type in your own custom warning, which I have to do whenever I want to post uw-test (any level), uw-spam (any level), uw-delete (levels 3, 4, or 4im), or uw-vandalism4im. I would much prefer two clicks for all 18 vandalism warnings rather than one click for 6 warnings but three clicks plus some typing for the remaining 12. Even if you don't do this, could you at least add the remaining 12 new vandalism warnings to the list of custom warnings so that I don't have to type them in each time? <a href="../../../p/y/r/User%7EPyrospirit_f67a.html" title="User:Pyrospirit"><font color="green">Pyrospirit</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../p/y/r/User_talk%7EPyrospirit_78ef.html" title="User talk:Pyrospirit"><font color="red">Flames</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pyrospirit_30cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pyrospirit"><font color="orange">Fire</font></a></sup> 15:30, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've answered this before, but I'll answer it again. Mozilla's ActiveX control at present has a highly underdevolped DOM wrapper. Without a fully implemented DOM wrapper, it cannot be used for, well, anything except very, very primitive web browsing. It also has massive bugs in the software, causing massive memory leaks and making it almost completely unusable. It is also a highly complex and large component, requiring all users to not only have Firefox installed, but also to register a mass of dll's and ocx's (which has the risk of corrupting registries and interfering with IE components). I too would like to see VP and WikiMonitor and all other such softwares make use of the Gecko engine, which I find to be far superior to IE's, but the options Mozilla has provided to do this are simply not stable nor fully-compatible to actually use. In short, as Mike said, don't hold your breath. It likely will <i>never</i> happen. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 22:10, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In that case, could you provide a menu option that disables all user scripts in VP when checked? That would prevent all the constant error messages from my monobook Javascript, which is designed for Firefox.
