<p>Thanks for blocking. These unaccountable anons often get my blood boiling.</p>
<p>Question: is one allowed to revert a 3RR violation, if this itself would otherwise be its own violation? I've never done it, but it's always kind of upset me that that the violators get their way on content for this reason. I'm starting to feel rather the sucker for following the rules.Timothy Usher 09:31, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Same here. Sockpuppets and dynamic IPs in general are about the most frustrating things on Wikipedia, especially when you approach them all in good faith and discover after hours of debate that oh! it's the same user. Best to let someone else revert; you likely won't get blocked, but if it's your fourth revert, the policy supports blocking. Is his edit currently on top? I'll gladly revert it for you. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 09:36, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You didn't block <b>all</b> of Saudi Arabia if it makes you feel better&#160;;-). You can't block from 172-179, see you are actually listing how many bits to disregard from the end of the IP in binary, so it is a bit complicated.

<p>I agree that he shouldn't be blocked from editing his own RfC, but is there anyway to tell him or have him told to stop changing signatures in the RfC. I fear that if I go to AN/I, I won't get a great response, as Tony frequents there often, and it will just spark the same debate that the RfC is having. But the changing the signatures on the RfC talk, and especially the endorsements is out of line. Maybe you, as an admin could warn him not to do that. I realize anyone can place a warning, but it would be less ignored coming from another administator.

<dd>I'd like to help in any way that I can, but I don't think my warning him would be necessary--nor would he likely notice (both he and I are on the opposite side of every issue and have had a few quarrels). I might note as well that quite a few others, including many admins, have asked him to stop doing that in the past with no avail, and so I'm sure my little warning wouldn't change a thing either. Is it really that big of a deal? I mean, yes, it's really obnoxious when he does that, and he always has, but I'm not sure it's worth the stress to try to convince him to change his ways. When I see him changing sigs, I just shake my head and return to editing as if nothing had happened (then again, he's never changed my relatively short sig that I'm aware of, and it may be different to be on the receiving end). I worry that blocking him and/or seeking the support of others to chastise him is equally as disruptive a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> and should likely be avoided as well. In any case, I'm sure this will be taken into consideration on the RfC and/or any request for arbitration, and I will be glad to help you out in any way that I can--I just don't feel that my taking any action here would really be all that helpful. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 07:05, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No worries. I'm not familiar or involved with the article and have myself never even come close to taking part in an edit war, but should I, by some odd chance, get involved, I will be sure to go snag some other uninvolved and impartial admin to intervene. I'm quite a night owl, so I'll be sure to watch it quite closely for at least the next 4-5 hours.

<dd>It seems to me that User:Inigmatus is making unique edits to the article which are then being reverted by User:RandomP</dd>
</dl>
<p>Can you point to even a single edit where I did that, where Inigmatus's "unique edit" did not constitute reverting RandomP (i.e. me)?</p>
<p>I really am unsure how to proceed on this article. NESARA, and the NESARA institute, are clearly highly dubious, at best. Any edit I make to include information that makes NESARA look bad (which, unfortunately, is what it does - it's a "snake oil" plan for the economy) is reverted by Inigmatus, and you instruct me</p>

<p>Can you substantiate your claims or give me further orders, other than to leave the article in its current state (which includes such bits as the "privately-run Federal Reserve", clearly counterfactual)?</p>
<p>I was reverted four times within a couple of hours, and by my reading of the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, I am now unable to, for example, remove the "privately-run" statement until I'm safely out of the 24-hour period.</p>

<dd>Wow, I made a <i>really</i> bad call here. My sincerest apologies. Somehow I mixed up the two usernames in my head--don't even ask me how--and thought that the reverts were being done by you rather than the other way around. Based upon that, I thought you to be in violation of 3RR, rather than he, and that you had simply conceived 3RR to mean that if a user adds four edits that are reverted, the reverter should be blocked. I guess this is why editing on no sleep (as I am now) is a bad idea! In looking them over again, all four were relatively clear-cut reverts to earlier versions, and thus <a href="../../../i/n/i/User%7EInigmatus_2f19.html" title="User:Inigmatus">User:Inigmatus</a> was indeed in violation of 3RR. It's a bit too late to do anything about it now as it's already been more than a day since the violation, but I'd like to do whatever I can to rectify the situation. I'll keep the article watchlisted and do, within the confines of policy, what I can to prevent an edit war there, either through protecting or blocking for 3RR in the future. In any case, 3RR is simply the policy, not something that states everyone should use their free three reverts per day; try to do what you can to prevent an edit war: talk to him, use the talk page, anything. Blocking and protection are just temporary measures; to resolve the matter, you both have to reach a compromise somewhere. Again, I am really, really sorry about this--I usually have good judgment with these things, but not this time. Thanks for pointing out my mistake to me, and I'll try to avoid such royal screw-ups in the future. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 12:27, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the advice (and the apology - we all make mistakes, it's really appreciated when someone is honest about it (something that I tend to have problems with myself))! It's certainly not a problem. I've suggested to Inigmatus that we adhere to the 1RR for now, which I think would help calm things down.</dd>
<dd>Note that by my clock, it has not been 24 hours (but please don't do anything about it - let's see whether the 1RR proposal works), so by my stubborn literal reading of the 3RR, I'm barred from reverting anything for another couple of hours - not a big deal, but I would like to have something to point to just in case this happens again.</dd>

<p>Hey AmiDaniel, could I ask a favor of you. I would like to bring up a user that I am conserned about. His actions are questionable, and I don't know how to go about it. He has been blocked from Wikipedia 3 or 4 times for vandalisme, and an innability to follow consensus. He has also removed comments made by other users on his talk page aswell as other pages. He accuses others of being Sockpuppets if they don't see it his way, aswell as trying his best to discredit other editors with his actions. He has also vandalized articles with nonsense.</p>
<p>All I ask his for someone to look at this case that has not seen it before, seeing as everyone else keeps giving him a chance, and I myself see no improvment in his behaviour or ability to follow both <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicy_66bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Policy">policy</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/v/Wikipedia%7ECivil_a564.html" title="Wikipedia:Civil">civil</a>.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Just thought I'd let you know, it was my idiot 12-year-old cousin and his idiot friend who were busy vandalizing pages this morning (morning for me anyway) while I was out (off today). I'm going to have to ask someone who knows about computers if there's a way to password protect the system, since the little shits can't be trusted. It's not the first time. However, I should add that everyone with Sympatico internet shares the same IP addresses. I'm not sure why, but everytime I log on I have a different IP. That was at least a part of my creating this account, although I am constantly getting in trouble for vandalism from the 60s, 70s, and occasionally 80s in IP addresses, so I doubt I'll edit much anymore.</p>

Thank you so much for your attention to this. It is much appreciated. Namaste, Edie</p>
<p>Here is the letter that I sent. I believe that although we may not see eye to eye on spiritual beliefs, that you will be fair and understand the need to edit the page in question.</p>
<p>Take care, Edie Britt</p>
<p>"Dear AmiDaniel,</p>
<p>I would like to know why I have been prevented from editing "Edie Britt". I am not "WildSusa", but I do have a firewall and additionally, I use AOL as a secondary browser.</p>
<p>I am Edie Britt. The fictional character came along quite a bit after I did. I am a minister, and a spiritual advisor. Having people believe that this character claims title to the description following my name is harmful to me, and to my work which is of a spiritual nature. The character on the tv series is a woman of low moral.</p>
<p>The following is what I added to the description for "Edie Britt". {Edie Britt is an intuitive spiritual counselor &amp; psychic medium who has worked internationally since 1979. She resides in Michigan}</p>
<p>I have been respectful in my editing. I have not tried to advertise, but rather just to make public the idea that I am a real person, who has been helping others since 1979. I am internationally known, and in fact my web site is EdieBritt.com. I have had it since before the onset of the Television series "Desperate Housewives"</p>
<p>Thank you for re-considering, I appreciate the time and the effort. I realize that the way Wiki is set up that it is open to vandalization, but you can be assured that will never be my goal. I appreciate the information given, and especially like that it is a community for all to use. Being the mom of a teen, I also appreciate that she can use it to find information for school.</p>

<p>Hi. I was recently approved to use the vandalproof software and I was wondering how to use it. Do you revert changes the same way as you did without the software?

Gahhh ... thanks Prodego! Sometimes I start at the top and sometimes I start at the bottom, but somehow I always miss one or two . Oh, first of all, I still owe you another program (the diacritics/redirects tool). I actaully have it more or less already written; I'll upload that tomorrow hopefully. Anyway, the most standard way to use VP is to load recent changes (using the update button), then go through and click on each one you want to view. If the edit is vandalism, then you can click one of the seven Rollback buttons to revert and/or post a warning. For example, if you click "Rollback {{tes1-n}}" it will revert the edit and then post the {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest1_2f2b.html" title="Template:Test1">test1</a>}} template on the user's talk page. I have a feeling that once you have some time to play around with it a bit, you'll get the hang of it, but please let me know if I need to further clarify anything, or if you have any other questions. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 02:56, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The Anaheim Hills, Anaheim, California Page</span></h2>
<p>According to <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_1cd9.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming_conventions</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Generally, <a href="../../../p/a/g/Help%7EPage_name_9b0f.html" title="Help:Page name">article naming</a> should give priority to what the majority of English speakers would most easily recognize, with a reasonable minimum of ambiguity, while at the same time making linking to those articles easy and second nature.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Since NOBODY outside of Wikipedia uses the term <b>Anaheim Hills, Anaheim, California</b> to refer to the community of <b>Anaheim Hills</b>, naming an article about it with this term is in direct violation of the primary Wikipedia naming convention. An alleged standard naming "convention" dreamed up by mildly autistic and/or O-C Wikipedia administrators for their own irrational need for perceived order is null and void because using that reason violates the naming convention too, which also is also stated as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Another way to summarize the overall principle of Wikipedia's naming conventions:
<dl>
<dd>Names of Wikipedia articles should be optimized for <i>readers</i> over <i>editors</i>; and for a <i>general audience</i> over <i>specialists</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The much simpler and more recognizable term of <b>Anaheim Hills</b> alone is what should be the article name here, regardless of what a handful of editors happen to vote for in a strawpoll. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a> 02:44, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>...then gain consensus for your idea. Moving the article so frequently that it has to be protected, and then forking the article though a copy-and-paste move (which destroys the page history and causes a lot of stress for others) so frequently that the redirect has to be protected is <b>not</b> the way to go about invoking this change. If you're asking me to move the article for you, then forget it. Regardless of who is right and who is wrong, your actions are highly counterproductive. Take a day off; come back when your head is clear. If you continue to act in such fashion, the vacation will be enforced. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 02:49, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, but you are clearly breaking the rules, and why should it be protected on the Anaheim Hills, Anaheim, California page anyway? I wrote that article from top to bottom, shouldnt the way I want it, and the way it should be Anaheim Hills, California be the way it is? Why should it be locked on Anaheim Hills, Anaheim, California. If you have locked it on Anaheim Hills, California, you would have been in this same mess, with other editors that wanted it changed so they copied and pasted it to Anaheim Hills, Anaheim, California, (which you failed to notice that they have been doing it all day). I am just asking you to use your brain. There are about 1% of all pages in California that are community pages that follow this convention, and why should they (your "chosen" editors) get the ultimate power to decide it is locked on Anaheim Hills, Anaheim, California. If you look at any other entry on the world wide web about Anaheim Hills, it doesnt state Anaheim Hills, Anaheim, California. You have no justification for blocking the movement of this page (expecially since I wrote 99.999999999% of this article). You have no Wikipedia rule that states that the code is community, city, state. In fact, my method is more commonly used, and is more appealing (and not to mention doesnt sound totally retarded). You really need to start looking at the whole picture before you just go locking pages from editing, because you are not following the Wikipedia rules when you do that, and you have no justification.

<dd>Yeah, I've been using that with all of the other AOL blocks I've had to do (awesome tool by the way!), but it's still a nightmare to have to do that every time a new sock pops up. I'm gonna keep my eye on the user, and if she returns to doing what she was then I'll block again.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ministry</span></h2>
<p>I am trying to add a genre in the Metal band Ministry. Ministry is a war metal and industrial metal band, but every time I edit the page, it is reverted to industrial metal. This is getting annoying.</p>
<p>I would appreciate some help here. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedWasp_8eb9.html" title="User:RedWasp">RedWasp</a> (<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedWasp_17b7.html" title="User talk:RedWasp">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RedWasp_bca0.html" title="Special:Contributions/RedWasp">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>It seems that there is some disagreement about that, thus why your edits have been reverted. I'd suggest that you post a message on <a href="../../../m/i/n/Talk%7EMinistry_%28band%29_cc61.html" title="Talk:Ministry (band)">the talk page</a> and explain why you feel they fall under both genres. I'm not too familiar with the history of the article, but I'm guessing that their genre is of heavy dispute, as it is for many articles on bands. If you can cite sources that support your view that will also help to pursuade others to agree with your classification of the band. If you need help making this post or contacting others involved in the editing the article, I'll be glad to help you with that. Just remeber that Wikipedia is a colloborative project, and it's often times difficult to agree on certain things. The best way to go about it is to discuss changes before implementing when concerns have been raised.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anaheim Hills, California Comprimise</span></h2>
<p>In order to promote peace and reconciliation, I propose that we move the article back to "Anaheim Hills, California". Though the practice of naming articles according to the scheme of "neighborhood, city, state" is very common and practical, it is not a policy. On occasion, some editors have objected strenuously to having their neighborhood article named in that way. While consistency is important in an encyclopedia, the exigencies of collaborative editing are such that sometimes it's virtualy necessary for common practice to give way to individual preference.</p>
<p>This case is slightly different than some because many recent edits sought to portray the district incorrectly as an independent place. Those edits sensitized other editors to claims of independence. However I think we've moved past that stage and there is no longer any question that Anaheim Hills is a part of Anaheim. The article now properly reflects that fact in the text.</p>
<p>If moving the article back to just "Anaheim Hills, California" will bring peace to the article, and if editors can agree to remove contentious boxes, and unverifiable data, then I think it is worth making an exception to normal practice. This is all too minor to fight about. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill_Beback_8185.html" title="User:Will Beback">Will Beback</a> 09:50, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This was a message regarding our consensus to change the name to Anaheim Hills, California. But, if it were to be changed again, ti would also need to be protected from being changed back by angry editors, at least for 48 hours. Please consider our comprimise that we have come up with --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">Ericsaindon2</a> 00:12, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I will unprotect the article when protection is no longer necessary; I will not condone moving it <i>while</i> it's protected unless there is <i>overwhelming</i> consensus to do so. Otherwise, I think it best to leave the article where it is currently and move-protected. I noticed the poll you started on the talk page today; it demonstrates to me that there is not consensus yet, nor has adequate time been given to determine consensus. Please just relax for a bit, discuss your reasons, and give it some time. There's no need currently for rash action, and I'm not going to go against the protection policy just because you believe the title to be better.

<dd>Okay, thanks for handling that, and thanks for letting me know. I noticed the violation from <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricsaindon2_e596.html" title="User:Ericsaindon2">User:Ericsaindon2</a> and was going to look at it a bit more closely after dinner (which I just finished), as I assumed he likely wasn't the only one who had broken 3RR. He had been involved in some very disruptive move warring over the article earlier, but as it's now move-protected (and another article where he was attempting to create a fork full-protected) I didn't see a need to block for the disruption earlier. Hopefully with them both out of commision for a while some peace can be found and the issues resolved. Thanks again. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 01:51, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Kraja</span></h2>
<p>On the Kraja page that you have protected, I request that you edit the page and take off the List of cities in Serbia and Montenegro category at the bottom, since this category does not exist due to that country's breakup. <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHelmandsare_b822.html" title="User:Helmandsare">Helmandsare</a> 02:11 June 4 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd>Per the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProtection_policy_d869.html" title="Wikipedia:Protection policy">protection policy</a>, making significant changes to articles protected to end disputes should be avoided until the disputes have settled; however, as this does not seem to be a factor in the dispute, I would be willing to make the change if you can start a discussion about it on the talk page. If the other contributors to the article agree that the removal of the list is noncontroversial then I will do so gladly. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 01:58, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
