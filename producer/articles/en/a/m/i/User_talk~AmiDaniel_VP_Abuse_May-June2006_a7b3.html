I don't really see any evidence that he has been abusing the tool or has otherwise demonstrated himself to be untrustworthy.

<p>Someone edited <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Park%2C_Minnesota_6497.html" title="St. Louis Park, Minnesota">St. Louis Park, Minnesota</a>, simply reverting an immediately prior edit and menitioning that VandalProof was used. The edit that got reverted was a list of schools in St. Louis Park. It wasn't really the best edit, but it is relevant and the information in it was accurate.

<dd>I agree the edits are of rather great concern. I find that this user generally does very good work--I even supported him in his RfA; however, I do think that he is having quite a few problems using the tool. On his <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Zpb52_89ea.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Zpb52">recent RfA</a>, he stated that he was "using a bugged version of VandalProof," though he also added, "I'll take [ User:Freakofnature's] advice to slow down on VandalProof." I certainly don't think he's trying intentionally to be disruptive, but if he continues to have similar problems, it may be necessary to ask him to stop using the tool, which would be quite unfortunate. I'm going to ask him to comment on these diffs, as his responses on his RfA don't seem to really address the issue (if there are bugs I need to sort out, I would like to know that. Likewise, if this is human error, there may be something I can do to make things more clear), and I'm also going to ask that he leave a note whenever he has similar problems in the future. Again, I'd like to state that I believe his actions are in clearly good-faith, and I feel the above edits were just accidental, accidents that I would like to avoid in the future. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 19:17, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The bugged version was when it was not reverting the edits when I would click the Rollback buttons, and it was also not leaving anything on edit summaries when warning the users. I don't know how most of those edits listed above happened, except that perhaps I was going too quickly and not paying attention to which username was listed as the "current revision" name. I have slowed down, I am being more careful, and I intend to curtail stuff like this happening. Sorry again. Please do not keep me from using VandalProof. I like the program, but it has a high learning curve, and some of my errant edits were from not knowing the program well enough, and some of them were just simple carelessness. --<a href="../../../z/p/b/User%7EZpb52_d9a3.html" title="User:Zpb52">Zpb52</a> 19:43, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

What exactly is your problem, is something missing in the help pages or disscussion as to your "buggy" version of VandalProof. Please help us out here. Thanks. I highly advise that you be more careful with this software... Remember it is not a race to revert, an extra second does not hurt.

<dd>Ok, as long as problems are gone, then that is all that matters. Is there anything missing from instructions ect. that could help other users? It would be nice to be able to reduce the 'learning curve' as much as possible. Any help you can give in this area would be appreciated.

<dd>Yes, I agree if that is the only problem, well I guess you will have to remove my privaliges too:-(, It took me about 12 postings onto AIV to figure out what was going wrong, and why I was causing the problems. Lucky for me, I was able to revert my changes before anyone noticed.

<p>Dear Sir:</p>
<p>Your VandalProof application is being used in an edit war on the article "Golden Dawn tradition".</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Golden_Dawn_tradition&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Golden_Dawn_tradition&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Golden_Dawn_tradition&amp;action=history</a></p>
<p>Strangely, the user name "YankSox" declared the use of VandalProof, but all the edits being produced by it appear to be coming from a anonymous user.</p>
<p>At one point (about six months ago) the matter was submitted to the Mediation Cabal for ajudication, but shortly after that the edit abuse ended. It has recently started up again, and I have requested Mediation again.</p>
<p>Please see:</p>

<p>Please advise me as to how this matter can be settled.</p>

I would certainly call these content dispute reversions, and not vandalism reversions; however, I would like to add that it appears YankSox was attempting to revert to the last revision by JMax555 but did not understand how to do that correctly. He has never been blocked. Furthermore, his other edits made using VandalProof appear legitimate--I only wish he would revert <i>all</i> edits by the on-top contributor, rather than simply the last edit. I'm going to ask him and others to comment on the matter before making a decision one way or the other. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 22:00, 27 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am sorry for the mistake that occured, I was indeed trying to JMax555's edits. I thought I had gained solid judgement of the program, however, I just made a complete mistake. I am sorry for this and will be willing to accept any repercussions. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 00:41, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thank you for your response, Yanksox. I agree that these were just simple mistakes and thus do not intend to remove your usage permission. If it were to become a pattern of behavior, which I think you've indicated it will not, then I would see a reason to take action, but not under the current circumstances. Just try to be a bit more careful in the future. Other than a few mistakes, the rest of your contributions have been very valuable, and I appreciate all of the work you do in reverting vandalism and in other aspects of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 01:45, 29 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
