<p>Thank you very much for the link. I read the article. Interestingly, I have the exact opinion of that person. But when I present Islam in front of anyone, I never put it as a religion but as an extension of human nature. For example, being humble to a supreme being and to consider other equal, being merciful and be kind to others and being honest is in our nature, the religious rituals stregnthens our nature in this regard. Even all rituals of religion have the same goal, and that is the realization of our nature and respecting it. And if goal seems to be different, I think we should question that practice. For example trimming nails, shaving armpit and pubic hair is evident from nature as every person is born with it, but it causes problems i.e. bad smell, health problems plus it doesn't suit to human's highest standards of aesthetics. In my basic study of Sharia (not to speak of fiqh), I couldn't find anything, which would go against nature but strengthens it to the highest degree. Thanks again for the article.

<dd>Well! my reply was connected to the article in the sense that changing religion is a huge concept, and eventually it changes your social life, as said in the article. I was just suggesting that people should be told that it is not the denomination (Islam, Christianity, Judaism) that is important, it is the concept. And the concept is to respect the nature, which the religion tells us.</dd>

<dd>You asked me about Geckos, interesting enough, I read about it a few days ago, and I think the following link has very good information about it.<a href="http://www.understanding-islam.com/related/text.asp?type=question&amp;qid=3471" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.understanding-islam.com/related/text.asp?type=question&amp;qid=3471" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> But even if the prophet asked for it, the reason would be very similar to killing a snake or scorpion, as it can kill or hurt you. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 09:56, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh sorry for not realizing. I think his concern was right to some extent.

<p>I would definitely support your proposal. But we should also tell that he had a very good taste about things as well. For example, he used to like the horse of best kind etc. Personally, I don't find these two qualities contradictory. As the first one tells us that we shouldn't use extravagantly and show off. The second one tells us that we should have a taste of things in life and not just a dry person with no emotions. <a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthspreader_b93d.html" title="User:Truthspreader"><b><small><font color="#0D9D2D">TruthSpreader</font></small></b></a><sup><a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthspreader_d915.html" title="User talk:Truthspreader"><font color="#0C9AAD">Talk</font></a></sup> 11:19, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aminz, thanks for the response. I actually haven't seen the film myself. I've been gleaning information about it off of the internet and formulating the article that way. It's exciting to me to see Saudi Arabia enter into film making.&#160;:-) Take it easy. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span class="pBody" style="border: 0; color: gray; padding: 0; font-size: 100%;">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 23:22, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A quote which attempts to paint the picture that Jews claimed something they did not, especially considering the author of the quote does not explicitely state they made such claims, should <i>not</i> be included as it is not accurate and just clouds the article.

<p>Aminz, there is often tag team reverting waring with quick reporting if you take the bait.

<p>Hi Tariqabjotu,</p>
<p>There is a dispute over reliability of sources mentioned here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Muhammad#My_Sources" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Muhammad#My_Sources" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.

Would you please let me know what changes should be applied to this section<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad&amp;diff=87220418&amp;oldid=87208188#Animals" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muhammad&amp;diff=87220418&amp;oldid=87208188#Animals" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> so that you agree with its addition (to *reformer* section here or to some other article). Thanks very much. I would like to chat with editors individually and when a consensus is achieved, request them to comment on the talk page that they agree with the section. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 22:58, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>First, I think the inclusion of the full titles of sources (e.g. <i>William Montgomery Watt, Professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies at the Unviversity [sic] of Edinburgh</i>) in the text is unnecessary. If the credentials of the source needs to be mentioned (and due to the edit war and overall volatile nature of the <a href="../../../m/u/h/Muhammad.html" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> article, they should), they can be placed in the footnotes. Additionally, I question the neutrality of the first paragraph at all because, although I'm sure these things were truly said by these sources, it appears to be a bit lopsided. I see a couple paragraphs essentially praising Muhammad for his treatment of animals (and even a statement that appears to denounce Christianity for it's anthropocentric views), but no contrary opinion. If I weren't too knowledgeable the subject (and, to be honest, I'm not), I'd want to know more about that contrary opinion, especially due to the last paragraph —</dd>

<dd><i>However, in Muslim culture hyena, bat, gecko, snake, and other reptiles as well as insects are considered to be ugly, dangerous, vicious, but also powerful and often ambivalent. While scorpion is considered as an ebodiment of demons and evil spirits.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>— which seems to get short-changed, drowned out by the positive analysis of Muhammad and Islam. I'm not sure what you mean when you say <i>(to *reformer* section here or to some other article)</i>, but I must say that reading the current <i>Reforms</i> section, to me, is quite painful as it appears that you all tried too hard to make everything verifiable. The lengthy quotes and long titles of scholarly distinction really are unnecessary (or at least not in the body).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Your source from the professor at UC-Berkeley is okay (but not very good), unless there is contradictory evidence (in which case it would not be good at all). The professor appears to be an expert in engineering, a field far from Islamic and Near Eastern history, and so I would prefer a better source. But again, I don't see it as a significant issue. The second and third sources seem fine, and I really don't know much about the fourth source to say it's great (although the fact that it was published by an established publisher makes me optimistic). -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 00:46, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm going to answer this all hypothetically. I havn't looked much further at the acutal dispute; if there are any specific problems, then there are places to report those. See my response at <a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobdurbar_7903.html" title="User talk:Robdurbar">User talk:Robdurbar</a> for some of the more specific issues raised there.</p>
<p>So, in a hypothetical situation, it has been raised before that a group of users could 'game' the three revert rule and that this is a flaw in it (see <a href="../../../t/h/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EThree-revert_rule_d7c8.html#Are_cartels_allowed.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Three-revert rule">Wikipedia talk:Three-revert rule#Are cartels allowed?</a>). However, it has also been observed that such behaviour is very rare and that more often than not, when users complain of such 'cartels' or 'gaming of the system', it is usually the single user who is being unreasonable. That, of course, does not mean that such problems do not occur. To quote <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">User:Mangojuice</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>let's imagine that, say, someone is trying to rewrite World War II to indicate that there was no Holocaust. They repeatedly edit to a prefered version of theirs, and everyone else editing the page reverts them. No discussion is possible between the two groups: the lone user is wrong, and the others are right. On the other hand, imagine a situation where some barely notable company has 5 editors trying to keep their company's article POV to promote the company, and only one honest WP editor knows about it. When the honest editor tries to fix the POV they get reverted by the cartel repeatedly. The difference between the two situations is based on who's right... but that first situation is much more important, critical, and common. So, no prohibition on "cartels." In the second situation, the honest editor does have options: they can report the situation at WP:ANI or nominate the article for deletion, or simply put up a request in a wikiproject for backup.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>This clearly allows people to request that other users get involved. My response would be that a single user who thinks he is right and thinks that others would agree with him, can always post on a relevant WikiProject (for example, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Prophets_of_Islam_51be.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Prophets of Islam">Wikipedia:WikiProject Prophets of Islam</a> or <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Islam_251c.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Islam">Wikipedia:WikiProject Islam</a>) or make a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequest_for_Comment_14d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Request for Comment">Wikipedia:Request for Comment</a>. Of course, the new contributors he speaks to may disagree with him; or the may support him.</p>
<p>On the other hand, note that <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppet_9d8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppet">Wikipedia:Sock puppet</a> states <i>It is considered highly inappropriate or unacceptable to advertise Wikipedia articles that are being debated in order to attract users with known views and bias, in order to strengthen one side of a debate.</i> Clearly, there is a line which cannot be crossed here. It is OK - indeed, it is encouraged - to ask for comments or inputs on problem pages; but it would be wrong to go to certain users who it is known share a point of view and ask them to intervene. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 14:09, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't really know what to say. I have a bunch of problems with the article that I will try to list here. Firstly, "Sociological reforms" doesn't make so much sense, since, women, economic, and literary forms would all be "sociological" It is what sociologists say, but, bad section title.</p>
<p>There are too many quotes without commentary. It is close to violating fair use and... well, it ruins flow, etc. The problem here is that encyclopedias have always been written by experts. I would say we editors have problems in that regards. So, when an expert does a quote it's supposed to be reliably non-anecdotal. For us it's harder to trust that. Also, we need to make sure they are representative of a person's work. Patricia Crones work was being used to call Muslims bloodthirsty when she was talking about a theory of state building saying that violence brought tribes together. So, we have had problems with that before.</p>
<p>There shouldn't be "notes" and "references" if the notes contain some references and the references is only some of the references. It's mixing two systems. For instance it makes note 10: Schimmel (1992) p. 67 meaningless since it's not in the references. One system needs to be chosen. All references listed in "references" and notes referring to them or all sources listed under notes. I think the split system is better because it allows for different page numbers of the same texts much more easily.</p>
<p>I think I may have a problem with the whole premise of the article. I'm not full sure... but, I will voice my concerns. Why isn't this a part of <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Islam_572a.html" title="History of Islam">history of Islam</a>? Maybe History of Islam (610-661)? I am also not sure what constitutes a reform? It seems that any belief developed throughout Islamic history is retroactively considered a reform. Take slavery, for instance. The article says:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The pressure from the European opponents of slavery on the Ottoman empire to abolish slavery was not because of the situation of slaves in Muslim lands (as it was no worse than, and even in some cases better than, that of the free poor) but because the processes of acquisition and transportation of slaves to Muslim lands often imposed appalling hardships although "once the slaves were settled in Islamic culture they had genuine opportunities to realize their potential. Many of them became merchants in Mecca, Jedda, and elsewhere."</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's not that that statement is completely wrong. But, Which European opponents are being discussed, there were many many different European ideologies... and what time is this? In the 1500s European opposition would be completely different than in the early 1900s. More importantly, what is the Muslim view on slavery? It has varied over time. So, which of the reforms were done in 610-661? Do the reforms have to be enacted during that time period or are they only ideational reforms? If they are ideational reforms only then you have to show that Islam has been interepreted in vastly different ways over time. In fact, any "Islamic view" will be a reform during that time period. By limiting your time period you are also invalidating lots of those sources since they are generalizing about Islamic history. They also aren't making explicit whether the changes are in what Islam prescribes or how it was practiced. We can't assume that people adhere to the predominant view of the Islam of their time. You really need to clear up the methodology for this. We also have the problem that 610-661 in Arabia is relatively a black box. We don't have many direct sources that we can really verify from the times. There is a growing wave of revisionist scholars who don't even know when the Qur'an was compiled or where Muhammad really lived (Wansbrough questioned if there was a prophet and Crone questions modern day Mecca as the location). So, how can we judge what reforms took place then? This article takes modern interpretations of Islam and puts them as reforms made in 610-661.</p>
<p>So, let's take literary reforms. If it wasn't codified when Muslims say it was then it wasn't a reform of the time. But, that's something we can get over easily. However, it states "not only did the Qur'an create an entirely new linguistic corpus" Is this a reform? Well, not really... it was a work which helped to influence later Arabic writing and thus the language.</p>
<p>This article seems to muddle many things together without saying what is being considered reform. If Islam starts widely accepting female imams will that fit into this article? The point is, Muhammad's normative message is widely up for debate. So, without a lot more information from the time period I don't think we can decide what is reform from that era. Of course, most Muslims go back and claim that their views are really the views from prophetic times but that's just groping for legitimacy.</p>
<p>Animals: my answer to this kind of goes along with everything else. We can't know what the interpretation of Muslims towards animals was from 610-661. We are reading hadith compiled after that date which you can take to be true or not and then interpretations of those hadith from even later than the hadith themselves. So, what from that can we say is reforms in that time period.</p>
<p>So, what should be done? Well, clear up definitions. If this article means just reforms that were initiated by prophetic message and then events during the post-Muhammad era then it should all be placed in articles about Islamic laws and the realities of Islamic lands over time. If, however you want to keep era reforms then... I think you will have a hard time with the period of 610-661 since it is not well known. We also cannot do "Reforms under Islam 1950-2006" because there are not many primary sources addressing the changes (that I know of). It would just be "Fazlur Rahman in <i>Major Themes</i> of the Qur'an argued for a more categorical way of looking at the Qur'an to better understand its message while Scholar X argued that taqlid must be adhered to by following earlier scholars. A group labeled Muslim feminists led by Aminah Wadud argued that females could be imams in mixed gender plans".</p>
<p>Now we could, plausibly do "Reforms under Islam (1500-1700) by stating the predominant themes at the beginnings of that time period and what changes were at the end and then what social factors, and religious rulings had changed over the times. Still, this would be incredibly difficult because we would be trying to limit the changes to how Islam changed things even though economic and demographic changes would have a huge effect.</p>
<p>Your research is not bad... it could be used in other articles... but, I don't know where this article is going or what it is supposed to be. It needs to be defined much better. So... yeah, I should probably rewrite this to be more clear... but, let's see what you think, first. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 16:17, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've looked up how <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Hourani_321a.html" title="Albert Hourani">Albert Hourani</a> treats the issues that you deal with in the article. He is regarded as at least just as important a historian as Lewis, perhaps a better one. His first chapter is "A New Power in an Old World", and there is a section "Muhammad and the Appearance of Islam". Some of this is worth quoting:</p>
<p>"There is room for scholarly discussion about the way in which these beliefs developed. The Arabic sources which narrate the life of Muhammad and the formation of a community around him are later in date ... Sources written in other languages fully attest to the conquest of an empire by the Arabs, but what they say about the mission of Muhammad is different from what the Muslim tradition says, and still needs to be studied and discussed. On the other hand, there seems little reason to doubt that the Qur'an is substantially a document of seventh-century Arabia, although it may have taken some time to assume its definitive literary form. ... It seems best therefore to follow the traditional account of the origins of Islam, although with caution. "</p>
<p>Hourani then goes on to tell of the life of the Prophet, the revelation, the relationship with the Jews of Madina and the Flight. His next chapter is "The Formation of an Empire" which explains the political geography of the formation of the caliphate. His Chapter 3 is "The Formation of a Society" and that is where he describes the differences between Islamic society (as it had developed by the tenth century or so) and the empires that preceded it. He does not describe any reforms having been made in the first Islamic century.</p>
<p>So in general I think there is something to be said for Gren's argument - that we cannot tie down the reforms of Islam to the seventh century. The "before" and "after" of the coming of Islam is important and yes it should be described in the encyclopedia, but the reforms inevitably took a long time to settle down, and the position was different in countries with long complex histories and cultural traditions. After all, we are talking about Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Iran - countries with some of the longest civilisations on earth. I'm sorry if this is a bit negative but I would be pleased to help in any way with this article or other ones that you want to contribute to.

<p>The article Criticism of the Quran is about the inhumanity of and contradictory statements in the Quran. Yes, Muslims feel reassured knowing that their religion is not the only one with violence in its past and violent holy books, but that doesn't necessarily mean that quoting the Old Testament (or quoting a doddery Watt quoting the Old Testament) is always appropriate in any discussion of the problems in the Quran. Something you might not know about Christianity and Judaism is that they don't believe the Bible is the literal word of God, just that it is "divinely inspired." Of course it is impossible for Muslims to think this as Muhammad said that he was just "reciting" the literal words of God. It is in large part this feature of Islam that has ensured that Islamic ethics have not and probably never will progress beyond those of a seventh century Arabian warlord. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 22:45, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You seem to be unfamiliar with Christianity and Judaism. There are Christians and Jews who practically view the Bible as Muslims view the Qur'an. And yes, Islam is a practical religon. I admire Jesus for his high standards, but they were highly impractical. And you might want to study the history. In overall, interestingly enough, Muslims have been much more tolerant than Christians. Most Christians of the history have been Christians by name, so have been Muslims. But Muslims by name were more tolerant that Christians by name. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 00:48, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am very familiar with both, though I subscribe to neither. There are a minority of Christians and a minority of Jews who take something like the Muslim line. I don't believe that Muslims have been more tolerant than Christians overall. You should examine the history of the Muslim invasions of India. However, I don't believe that the actions taken by political groups subscribing to a religion necessarily reflect the essense of a religion itself. If we're looking at history, it is much more instructive to look at Muhammad. We have to see that Muhammad was an immoral man by current standards; I think most reasonable people would agree with that. The question is, does that mean he wasn't holy? The real question is, would God hold his final prophet to such a low standard? Jesus and most of the other prophets of Israel were actually holy men. They did not seek to gain political power or capture slaves in war. In fact, Jesus, the Buddha, Guru Nanak, and other holy men gained large amounts of followers based solely on their holiness; people were attracted to them because they sensed the good in them. Muhammad lived for many years in Mecca and attracted few followers. It was only after he was expelled that his religion took on a more "practical" tone, and Muhammad stopped being a peaceful preacher of a new faith. It's in the Medinan surahs that you start to see Muhammad the politician, and it's here that we see the verses about capturing concubines and such. As regards Jesus being impractical, it depends on what your values are. Jesus said not to get bothered by minor insults (turn the other cheek, etc). In doing so he changed the Old Testament teaching. 600 years later Muhammad took a great step backward when he set the eye-for-an-eye mentality into stone. Islam from the Medinan period on was a very practical tool for Muhammad the political leaader, but it is unfortunate that these verses, many of which are basically a warlord encouraging his troops, are still looked upon as God's word today. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 02:35, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Aminz</p>
<p>As you know reliable sources have to be quoted accurately and it seems that Opiner doesn't understand that. One of the things I thought about the article as it stands is that there is a lot of "according to Professor X of the University of Y, Islam achieved Z". How about changing those statements to just "Islam achieved Z. &lt;ref&gt; Professor X, ''Book about Islam'', University of Y Press, 2006 &lt;/ref&gt; ". In my view it would sound more encyclopedic. Whether Professor X is a good source can be discussed on the talk page. I'll look at Opiner's changes.</p>

<dd>I've commented to Opiner that I don't paticularly agree with his reasoning on that one. I think you are fine to revert a change once (see the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarmonious_editing_club_c3f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Harmonious editing club">Wikipedia:Harmonious editing club</a>; it is really only edit warring if you start reverting reverts, or if you revert every change that people make. Have you tried making a post at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Islam_251c.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Islam">Wikipedia:WikiProject Islam</a>, to attract a few outside views? Alternatively, you could perhaps find a sociologist, theologist or historian who quotes the art theorist's work, to justify your use of it.</dd>

<dd>Even if it were the case that his books are published by right wing publishers (which seems to be largely false), that does not mean that he is not a good source. The scholars that get PhDs from the incenstuous ivory tower elite institutions, like the ones you listen to, are largely not credible (except possibly Ibn Warraq; I'm not sure if he finished his PhD with Watt or not). How can you expect a scholar who does not view Islam with rose colored glasses like they do to get a PhD at all?

<dd>To weigh in on this one here: we cannot make sources gold-dust just because they have bueen published by someone with higher education qualifications. On the other hand though, that sort of conspiracy theory is just completely unworkable. If we were to follow that line of thinking, we would be unable to use most sources.

It is interesting that Arrow claims Aminz's sources are left wing; and Aminz you have claimed that this other writer is right-wing. This worries me as it suggests that there might not be much of a compromise; so at the moment I suggest you return to the article's talk page and keep discussing.

<p>I'm not sure if you're so worshipful of authorities because you want what they say to be true, or if you're just naturally in awe of people in positions of power. The issue with Spencer is that he doesn't have a PhD or tenure. Where could he get a PhD? You have Ernst, and you have Spencer. Both are scholars. One is in the establishment, one is not.

<dd>just like Spencer to absolve himself of any responsibility for failing to get educated about islam before talking of it. regardless of whatever kind of excuses he may invent (or you for him), the fact remains that he has not a single qualification related to islamic studies. this, as well as his typically unscholarly, sensationalist work about islam, means that the ways in which he can be used on wikipedia are rather limited. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 17:40, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Aminz and Arrow740. This is too much. Remember wikipedia policies re to verifiabilty, notable sources and so on. Saying Muslims are anti-semites (re pigs and dogs) or Jewish are racists (chosen people) is OR. It is so damn obvious that there are people out there who are Muslims anti-semites or Jews recists. So what?! IMHO, as i always love to be clear and not looking to be mean or offend anyone but if you both understand this than you are into the game of wikipedia. If not than you are a pain in the ass just abusing your knowledge.</p>
<p>If Arrow740 thinks Muhammad was anti-semite than it is his POV and no problem w/ that. On the other hand, if Aminz argues that it is not the case than it is his POV and no problem w/ that. BUT DON'T MAKE A FUSS OUT OF IT. Your problem guys is that you got a temperament and that's not a good thing to edit this encyclopaedia. You got to leave that temperament in your closet and walk the way out w/o it. -- <i><a href="../../../f/a/y/User%7EFayssalF_b498.html" title="User:FayssalF"><font size="2px" face="Verdana"><font color="DarkSlateBlue">Szvest</font></font></a></i> → <small><a href="../../../f/a/y/User_talk%7EFayssalF_f604.html" title="User talk:FayssalF"><font style="background: orange"><sup><i>Wiki Me Up ®</i></sup></font></a></small> 11:25, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>good work on providing some well sourced contributions of late. i was just flicking through Forward's book a moment ago (need to return it soon) and i recalled that his short sira work actually devotes quite a bit to Muhammad and controversial aspects- including modern critiques, and deals with it in a somewhat insightful manner. i think you'd find it a great read: perhaps you could check it out sometime.

<p>As regards anti-Semitism, instead of listening to biased people, why don't you examine the evidence yourself? Saying that you'll only believe something if someone else says it is an abdication of your responsibility to make your own decisions.

<p>No indeed, I'm British - I realise my username is a bit misleading, but it's what some of my friends in Delhi call me (my name is Alexander, of which "Sikandar" is the Urdu version, the "ji" is a Hindi honorific, used ironically in my case). I actually wrote most of the section on Said's academic critics, and I don't much like his work for all the reasons currently set out on the page. However I can't abide the politicisation of this dispute: many scholars have taken issue with Said's claims about "Orientalism" on academic grounds, but it should not be used as an opportunity for political mud-slinging - one should simply point out the inconsistencies and inaccuracies in his approach. Unfortunately plenty of people want to hijack this to make crude anti-Islamic and anti-Palestinian points, and that I object to strongly. Thus far I have found myself holding the ring in Hindu/Muslim disputes on Indian history pages and Turkish/Iranian disputes on Central Asian pages. I'm not sure I have the energy to get sucked into Jewish/Muslim disputes as well. It seems some people only come to Wikipedia in order to fight. <a href="../../../s/i/k/User%7ESikandarji_ae16.html" title="User:Sikandarji">Sikandarji</a> 00:30, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not agree with your summary idea. One problem with this is that I do not think it would be possible to provide short neutral summaries of the issues. The Crone piece is not neutral; the Quran advocates certain treatment of pagans, and a different treatment of Muslims, so her piece (if you summarized it correctly) is not only biased, but false as well. Another problem is that, again, the focus of the article is the criticism itself, and general discussions of particular issues belong in other article. Perhaps we could link to the <a href="../../../q/u/r/Quran.html" title="Quran">Quran</a> article. It just doesn't make sense to start sections with material that doesn't really belong. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 10:41, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm not sure I'm involved. I mean, I'll comment if I'm around but I didn't get into any of the edit wars... I'm not sure if I even edited. I'm also somewhat busy... or, at least not coming to Wikipedia as much when online so I may not be around so much. It used to be unheard of to see edits from a week ago in my "last 50 contributions". Since I have never been a part of mediation I don't know if I can 'weigh in' if not involved. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 21:50, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aminz,</p>
<p>The article used to say that Muslims have a caste system entirely based on Fatwas. I later attempted to correct this, and Hkelkar attempted to compromise and say that some castes were based on the influence of Hinduism in India, and some were based on fatwas. As I've shown on the talk page, the fatwas have no role in establishing any castes, but only proving a limited "religious" legitimacy for a specific period of time. <a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhaiSaab_b765.html" title="User:BhaiSaab">BhaiSaab</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/h/a/User_talk%7EBhaiSaab_a911.html" title="User talk:BhaiSaab">talk</a></sup> 01:15, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm not the be-all, end-all source on reliability and suitability of sources. Regardless, I don't appreciate what appears to be you badgering me until I wholeheartedly agree with you. Like I said and implied earlier, I don't think being a popular writer is grounds to be sourced in an article if the subject is not his or her expertise. It is reasonable, though, to present different viewpoints. Some of those viewpoints may be more critical of Islam than others – that's just a fact of life. Lastly, why do you say <i>Admin User:Gren</i>? Being an admin is not supposed to give one's opinion more weight in these circumstances. -- <b><a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETariqabjotu_f37f.html" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 02:44, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aminz, you wrote, "Muslims never fiercely slaughtered others as Christian crusaders did." That is totally incorrect.

<p>I have not studied Islam in India or in general relation of Islam with polytheists. But did they do a <i>wholesale</i> masacre of city's citizen and then had their corpse dug up, mutilated and their heads collected? Maybe you can provide some sources? That would be great.</p>
<p>Indians were polytheists and Muslims might have done to them what Christians did to everybody except themselves(well actually sometimes themselves as well).

<dd>I fixed the link; try it now. Read the whole page, if you have time: the primary intent is to be to shore up the legitimacy of Abu Bakr's succession and to discredit the Shi'a. If this source is to be accepted as reliable, then the premise of Shi'a Islam is false.</dd>
<dd>Another hadith which should be considered dubious is the order to expel Jews and Christians from the Arabian penninsula. Were it so, we might ask, first, why is Muhammad contradicting the Qur'an, which does not prescribe expulsion, why is Muhammad breaking his deal with the Jews of Khaybar and, most obviously, why didn't Abu Bakr follow these instructions? For these reasons (at least), it is widely believed to have been forged in the time of Umar.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 02:44, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>We can verify that Mubarakpuri says that at the same time that we can verify he's not applying the critical analysis expected even in Islamic scholarship, which weighs the different traditions and only accept the most reliable hadith which don't contradict the Qur'an and the better attested aspects of the sunnah. Am I wrong? For example, at least one might mention the claims of the Shi'a and give a reason to refute them.

<dd>i can see no narration on that page which is regarded as forged, or even weak. traditional Muslim scholarship is agreed upon the fact that the material contained within certain hadith works has been rigorously authenticated, if not by the compilers themselves, then by the scholars after them. a lot of these narrations are in fact <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutawatir.html" title="Mutawatir">mass-transmitted</a>, discounting possibilities of forgery. one notable example which comes to mind is <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Hajar_1a76.html" title="Ibn Hajar">Ibn Hajar</a> and his <a href="../../../f/a/t/Fath_al-Bari_5391.html" title="Fath al-Bari">Fath al-Bari</a> (among other similar works), wherein he comments upon and analyses the chain of narration as well as the text itself. within Islamic scholarship is also the science of <i>mukhtalif al-hadith</i> which is the analysis of narrations which apparently contradict, even if both are considered authentic. the same also goes for when you have mutawatir narrations apparently conflicting with the Qur'an . i would suspect that Mubarakpuri says very little about Shias because the work is a biography of Muhammad, not a heresiographical piece. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 19:35, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'm sure you are aware that not everyone equates Shi'a Islam with heresy. Of course one shouldn't expect a direct discussion of subsequent political events, but they are addressed indirectly when Muhammad is shown virtually annointing Abu Bakr as his successor.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 22:07, 13 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The first reason that Prophet Muhammad took a negative attitude towards the People of the Book (being shocked according to Encyclopedia of religion) was to see that the community of "one God" have been divided into warring sects because of a few theological differences. I think the problem is with those who slaughter others for the pretext of heresy <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/002.qmt.html#002.084" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/002.qmt.html#002.084" rel="nofollow">2:84</a>. Both Shias and Sunnis believe that&#160;:"We believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed unto Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and that which Moses and Jesus received, and that which the prophets received from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have surrendered", so why should anybody be in schism? <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/002.qmt.html#002.136" class="external text" title="http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/002.qmt.html#002.136" rel="nofollow">2:136-137</a>. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 02:34, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Such boilerplate is moving, but could not have addressed the question of whether Muhammad should have been succeeded by Abu Bakr or Ali. Instead, both parties were reduced to putting words into the prophet's mouth posthumously to justify their positions, as there were otherwise no earthly basis for the legitimacy of the regime, nor any established mechanism to determine succession. Conflict was therefore entirely inevitable.<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProabivouac_6a4d.html" title="User:Proabivouac">Proabivouac</a> 02:56, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Aminz, please stop tagging articles or sections. If you think they're POV, change them or suggest changes on talk, but tagging them is disfiguring and should be done sparingly, as a last resort. This was mentioned during your RfC, so please do pay attention to it as a serious, and I hope constructive, criticism. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 00:12, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
