	    <p>Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is a prenatal test that is used to detect birth defects, genetic diseases, and other problems. During the test, a small sample of cells (called chorionic villi) is taken from the placenta where it attaches to the wall of the uterus. Chorionic villi are tiny parts of the placenta that are formed from the fertilized egg, so they have the same genes as the baby. If you have certain risk factors for having a baby with a birth defect or genetic disease, you may be offered CVS to detect the problem early in pregnancy. What Diseases or Disorders Can CVS Identify? CVS can help identify chromosomal problems such as Down syndrome or other genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs disease and sickle cell anemia. CVS is considered to be 98% accurate in the diagnosis of chromosomal defects, such as Down syndrome. Since the procedure also identifies the sex of the fetus, it can also help identify disorders that are linked to one sex (such as certain types of muscular dystrophy which occur most often in males). CVS does not detect open neural tube defects such as spina bifida. If you have CVS, you may want to also consider having a blood AFP test later in pregnancy to screen for those problems. What Are the Benefits of CVS? CVS can be done early in pregnancy (earlier than amniocentesis ), and results are usually obtained within 10 days. Getting this kind of information early allows a woman to make choices in the beginning stage of her pregnancy. If a woman chooses to terminate the pregnancy after receiving abnormal test results, the pregnancy termination will be safer than if she waits for amniocentesis results. What Are the Risks of CVS? CVS may carry a slightly higher risk of miscarriage than amniocentesis, since the procedure is done in early pregnancy. Infection may also occur. Rare cases of defects in baby's fingers or toes have been reported, especially when CVS was done before 9 weeks. Who Should Be Tested? According to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, a doctor organization, testing should be offered to: • Pregnant women who will be 35 or older on their due date (the risk of having a baby with a chromosomal problem such as Down syndrome increases with the age of the woman). • Couples who already have had a child with a birth defect or have a family history of certain birth defects. • Pregnant women with other abnormal genetic test results. Your health care provider can advise you on whether this test is right for you. In the end, only you and your partner can decide whether or not you should have this test. How Is the Test Performed? Before undergoing a CVS, appropriate genetic counseling, including a detailed discussion regarding the risks and benefits of the procedure, are recommended. At the time of initial consultation and counseling, an ultrasound exam will be performed to confirm gestational age (the development stage of the embryo) and the location of the placenta. This is done so that CVS can be performed at the appropriate gestational age (which is usually 10 to 12 weeks from the woman's last menstrual period). There are two ways to collect chorionic villi from the placenta: through the vagina or through the abdomen. To collect cells through the vagina, a speculum is inserted (in the same way as a Pap test). Then a very thin, plastic tube is inserted up the vagina and into the cervix. With ultrasound, the tube is guided up to the placenta, where a small sample is removed. To collect cells through the abdomen, a slender needle is inserted through the woman's abdomen to the placenta, much like in amniocentesis. The sample of chorionic villi is then sent to a lab where the cells are grown in a special fluid and tested a few days later. Culture results will be available within 7-10 days. Your doctor will directly notify you of the results. Will It Hurt? It might, but it's over relatively quickly. The test takes no longer than a half hour from start to finish, and the extraction itself runs only a few minutes. What Happens After the Test? You'll need to take it easy immediately after a CVS test, so arrange for someone to drive you home. For the rest of the day, you'll need to rest. Generally women are advised to abstain from strenuous physical activity, sex, and exercise for three days following the procedure. You may have some cramping and bleeding, which is normal, but do tell your doctor or midwife. If you notice fluid leaking from your vagina, call your health care provider immediately. How Long Does it Take to Get the Results? It can take up to 14 days before you get the test results, although some labs can provide you with preliminary findings the next day (at an extra cost.)</p>
