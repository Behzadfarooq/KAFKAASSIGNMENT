<p>Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the <a href="../../../g/e/n/Geneva_Conventions_eb47.html" title="Geneva Conventions">Geneva Conventions</a> to captives from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_war_on_terror.html" title="The war on terror">the war on terror</a>. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Competent_tribunal.html" title="Competent tribunal">competent tribunals</a> to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prisoner_of_war.html" title="Prisoner of war">prisoner of war</a> status.</p>
<p>Subsequently the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Defense_0d6c.html" title="Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> instituted the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Combatant_Status_Review_Tribunal_41dd.html" title="Combatant Status Review Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunals</a>. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were <i>lawful combatants</i> -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an <a href="../../../e/n/e/Enemy_combatant.html" title="Enemy combatant">enemy combatant</a>.</p>
<p>Ullah chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.<sup id="_ref-CsrtUllah_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-CsrtUllah" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>The allegations against the detainees were read out, and recorded, in most of the transcripts. They weren't recorded in Amin Ullah's transcript.</p>

<p>Amin Ullah told his Tribunal that he had served as a soldier for an Afghan leader he called President Dahoud. <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammed_Daoud_Khan_31f8.html" title="Mohammed Daoud Khan">Mohammed Daoud Khan</a> was the only President of the First Afghan Republic, from 1973-1978.</p>
<p>Amin Ullah told his Tribunal that the Taliban killed his brother, when they came to conscript him into their forces, threw him into jail, when he refused. He said his family found his body forty days after the Taliban conscripted him. Amin Ullah said that sometime later the Taliban came to conscript him, put him in jail, when he refused, and that while in prison he decided to comply. He was assigned to lead a squad of ten men. But he broke the rules, and would return to his family at night. The Taliban caught him, and punished him with imprisonment again.</p>
<p>He was leading his squad of ten when he heard on the radio of the American invasion. So he lead his squad of ten to desert, and return to <a href="../../../k/o/n/Konduz.html" title="Konduz">Konduz</a>, the area where they were all from, which had not yet been liberated from the Taliban. Amin Ullah fought against the Taliban in the liberation of Konduz, <a href="../../../m/a/z/Mazar.html" title="Mazar">Mazar</a> <sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>]</sup> and Khanabad <sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>]</sup>. After the capture of Khanabad the <a href="../../../a/f/g/Afghan_Northern_Alliance_c51d.html" title="Afghan Northern Alliance">Northern Alliance</a> demobilized him. He returned to his home, and when the last elements of the Taliban had been mopped up, four or five months later, he turned in his weapon, and those of the ten men he lead to a Sergeant Abdul Basir of the new Karzai government.</p>
<p>Afghan forces arrested him a year later. Amin Ullah said all the allegations against him were untrue.</p>
<p>Amin Ullah said that he like the new government, and he has welcomed the American help. He liked that his children were able to go to school.</p>

<li>Amin Ullah clarified that the first time he was imprisoned by the Taliban he was a soldier for <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burhanuddin_Rabbani_d13c.html" title="Burhanuddin Rabbani">Rabani</a>, who was the official President of the rump of Afghanistan during the civil war that followed the ouster of the Communists, prior to the takeover of the Taliban.</li>
