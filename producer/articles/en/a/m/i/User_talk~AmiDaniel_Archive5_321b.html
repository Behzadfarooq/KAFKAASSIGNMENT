<h3><span class="mw-headline">Proposed Solution</span></h3>
<p>My apologies for taking so long to respond--I was offline. I've conversed with a few others about the situation, and most tend to feel that not much can be done. Our goal on Wikipedia is to write an encyclopedia, not to provide a free adserver, and it's truly not the concern of Wikimedia or any of Wikipedia's contributors to preserve the PR of individual who abused it as such. In any case, I feel I may have found a reasonable compromise that is well within the limits of WP's policies and that may help to reduce the prevalency with which search engines direct others to this page, rather than your own website. However, to enact this I will need your cooperation and agreement.</p>
<p>First of all, I find it acceptable to remove the title of the article and your name from the warnings, though I will not endorse removing the warnings altogether. The messages from you here I will archive to a subpage and blank, so that I will have the messages available yet they will not appear when Google indexes the site. Secondly, you will have to <a href="../../../c/h/a/Wikipedia%7EChanging_username_3d5c.html" title="Wikipedia:Changing username">change your username</a> either to a dummy name (meaning that you have chosen to excercise your <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Right_to_vanish" class="extiw" title="m:Right_to_vanish">m:Right to vanish</a>) or to something else, and the involved bureaucrat should then move your user and talk pages to that target. I'll monitor the page closely, but I would appreciate if you would drop a note here once your username has been changed. References on the Village Pump will eventually be archived, though they may still appear when the search engines index the site--absolutely nothing we can do there. The &lt;name removed&gt; article will also have to be preserved as a protected {{<a href="../../../d/e/l/Template%7EDeleted_page_1090.html" title="Template:Deleted page">deleted page</a>}} as it's simply been recreated too many times to allow it to be unprotected. After all of this has been done, there will still be references to your name on Wikipedia, but the bulk of them--and most especially the references that have concerned you (i.e. vandalism warnings)--will, within a matter of weeks, no longer appear when you search for your site.</p>
<p>Please understand that this is <i>a lot</i> of bending-over-backwards to boost the PR of someone who blatanly attempted to use Wikipedia as an adserver (in fact, most seem to have hinted that I should simply ignore your requests). If, after all of this has been completed, you continue to edit in the same manner, I strongly doubt that anyone will be concerned with what a search engine brought up when you searched for your name. As I said before, it's really not our concern, but I'm going to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> here and try to help you as best as I can. If this seems reasonable to you, and you agree to the change of username, etc., then please indicate that either here or on your talk page, and I will go through and begin stripping talk pages of references to your name (within the confines of policy and only from talk pages of users who do not object to this). Thanks. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 05:25, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, I'm aware of that. I just noticed that at the header when I was removing my Wikibreak notice and thought it might confuse other editors, or make them think that I have a strong aversion to Commonwealth English (i.e. that I have no patience for brits). I wouldn't mind it on the template (perhaps add &lt;noinclude&gt; around it), but I think it just gives a wrong impression when the comment appears on the VP pages. It's not a big deal at all; I just decided to remove it.

<p>Thank you for taking care of the article headings and deleting user and talk page.</p>
<p>In reference to your message below, I do feel it is absolutely necessary to remove any web site address from your talk page. Including the Silkwood site since that has also shown up on google now. www.silkwoodproject.com Under AmiDaniel talk.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, I was not aware that these private messages to you would show up on google.</p>

<p>Perhaps that's too much detail for a barnstar; feel free to refactor or move to your user page as necessary. I can't imagine that most Wikipedians would have been as patient with a new user whose contributions were generally (probably avolitionally) disruptive; even as I wouldn't have been incivil, I certainly wouldn't have spent the time on the matter you did and likely would have eschewed helping the user altogether, especially in view of his incessant, intemperate, and sometimes incomprehensible missives. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 17:42, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>on <b>noability</b> well let's see it's the only attempt at a national population policy. It touchs on topics still very much in the news. It proposed solutions that might solve some of the problems we still have today because we didn't address them back then.

<p>So what you are saying is that it has to be from a published library reference work before it can be included here?</p>

<dd>(edit conflict) Oh, yes, that's the problem I already found. It has to do with timestaps--they worked just fine in April, but once it was May it was no longer able to format the date correctly.

He seems to show up under the name "Dominic_Marinucci123", but since his actions mimic the previous vandal, I think they're the same. Please help, I'm sick of having to constantly check each article to see if he's made a mess of them. Also, I think he may be using a proxy, because there's a ton of IPs with the same vandalizing behavior.</p>

<p>I was starting an article on the Yawalapiti tribe, which I saw on a television show on the Travel Channel. I'd tried to find more information by searching Wikipedia and there was no mention of the tribe so I was adding an article. I added a couple links related to the topic to the article until I had a chance to get back to it. It's been only a couple days since I did so and when I go back to work on it the article had been deleted. That makes it rather hard to do any research on a topic if you delete it on sight.</p>

<dd>I apologize that the article was deleted, but at the time it only consisted of links and provided no context. In the future, you might want to consider working on these articles in your own userspace where no one but you will touch them. For instance, you could create the article at User:Mogmios/Yawalapiti, and once you feel the article is of decent quality and provides enough content, you can then move it to Yawalapiti. You may also contact any of the admins listed at Category:User undeletion to have the article restored and <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserfy_6da1.html" title="Wikipedia:Userfy">userfied</a> so you can continue working on it. Please understand that speedy deletion of articles in the mainspace is necessary, and it's already been decided that articles consisting only of links elsewhere (<a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A3" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#A3</a>) should be removed on-sight. Again, I'm sorry that your article got deleted, and I hope that you will continue to contribute to it and other articles on Wikipedia. Thanks for contacting me about this, and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need assistance. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 19:42, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there, I'm a relatively respected contributor here with an edit count &gt; 2100, and I run Werdnabot, that does archival and double-redirect tasks. I'm currently working on 'Pedia Patrol, another AntiVandalism tool, and have come across a couple of issues in detecting warnings on user talk pages.

<p>Hey Werdna, I'm very well aware of your Werdnabot, and, though I haven't had much interaction with you personally, I'd definitely be willing to let you have my code (you too, Eagle). I'm only concerned that you might not have any experience with VB. Despite the statistic that it's the most popular langauge out there, I'm finding that no one is really all that familiar with it. Granted, the code for VandalProof could hardly be called typical VB code--it's sort of a mixture of strange activeX and API handles, JavaScript, and HTML mixed in with a little VB terminology--and the vast majority of the programming I do in the "real" world is CAD VBA (which is similar, yet nonetheless a language unto its own), which has vastly influenced my style writing this. I also hope you don't mind reading through some <b>really, really, really</b> sloppy code, with variables like "Bob" and "Ted." If you have a version of VB handy, I can just package the VBP and send it off to you; otherwise I'll just have to send it to you in an ascii format. Lemme wrap up v1.2 this weekend and then, if you're still interested, I'll gladly send you a copy. Thanks for your interest, and all your great work on Wikipedia! (I'm sorry you're RfA failed; I think you'd make a great admin, although I'm not sure if I voted on your RfA--it was during my Wikibreak). <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 02:50, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>One day I'll remember to add all the talk-pages I post to onto my watchlist.. Anyway, I actually started out in VB.. and am working currently mostly in c#/++. My code is tending towards .NET Regular Expressions, which I just can't get enough of. As for "'Pedia Patrol", it's sluggish to say the least, but I'd like to have a look at how you check for warnings on a contributor's user talk, manage edit conflicts, etc. You're welcome to my code, too. I'd rather an ASCII copy of just the source code, as I moved on from VB6 about a year ago, and no longer have it on my computer (Although I suppose I could import it into .NET.) Thanks for your kind words on my RfA - unfortunately a single act of stupidity overshadowed the entire process. I'm leaving it until late June to early July to accept renominations - I figure that way I'll avoid any further controversy over the matter - particularly if I crank out this antivandal tool. Fingers crossed it'll be a landslide&#160;;). Anyway, as I said, you're welcome to my code anytime you need it - the best place to ask me would be on IRC (my nick is <tt>Werdna</tt>).

<dd>I've responded to your request for spamming on my User talk page. In a nutshell, Rob Church (one of the main members of the bot approval group) does mind if you use my bot with a bot flag, but doesn't mind if you use AWB without one.

<dd>Ahh, sorry. As I only saw the one contribution from the user, I simply assumed that you had listed the wrong user. Anyway, getting a 3RR or vandalism block on him now would probably be rather difficult, though I do agree that his actions were highly inappropriate (though, as I'm not an admin, I have no way of looking at his deleted edits), and I will try to keep an eye on him. In the future, it will probably help to clarify these matters if you post appropriate warnings on the user's talk page, both because it serves to alert the user that his actions are wrong (often times newbs simply wonder where their edits went and never realize that someone else has been reverting their changes) and as it will let others know exactly what the problem with the user is.

<dd>Hi Brad. My apologies for not notifying you that I had proposed the article for deletion, and thank you for contacting me. The issue with the article is that it makes no clear assertion of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>--in other words, it fails to state why the topic is of enough importance to warrant an article on Wikipedia. There's been a lot of discussion about the inclusion of articles on amateur radio clubs, and the consensus tends generally to favor deletion of such articles. If, however, you could provide statistics on how many members the club has, cite any large local or national publications that have referenced the radio club or done a piece on it, or if you could otherwise show how the club has had an impact on the society around it, the questions of the article's notability could be cleared up. If you believe that the group does meet the inclusion criteria of<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and you intend to modify the article to clarify these points, then by all means remove the {{<a href="../../../p/r/o/Template%7EProd_9713.html" title="Template:Prod">prod</a>}} tag from the article. If I, or anyone else, still believes that the article's topic does not merit inclusion, I will then list the article on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAfD_60e1.html" title="WP:AfD">WP:AfD</a> to gain community consensus either for or against the article's deletion. If you would like any help with this or anything else, please feel free to ask.

<dd>In looking over the article again, it appears to be a blatant copyright infringement upon <a href="http://www.supportsoft.com/international/" class="external text" title="http://www.supportsoft.com/international/" rel="nofollow">supportsoft.com</a>. Wikipedia encourages original authorship, and, as such, even if fair use is granted for the article's text, it is preferable if you would write the article in your own words. In its current form, the article also reads more like an advertisement than an encyclopedia article, which is strongly discouraged. The company is clearly notable, and so I would like to ask you to rewrite the article from <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> and using your own words; then, it may merit inclusion. I'd also like to ask you to read <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>.

I would not want to do thaaat... that cruel:) But can we come up with a version update or something? Just the one update, I'm sure it is something simple, like waiting until document(web browser) completed, rather than displaying immediatly, as soon as page finishes matching your name.

<p>You've just spammed about 100 talk pages. Could you just update one page and ask users of your script to put it on their watchlists? Or perhaps write a function into your script that checks for the latest edit to your release page and notifies the user of an update. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 03:06, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While a feature, à la that in AWB (where such feature is, of course, compulsory, inasmuch as only the most recent version works), that informs users upon their starting the program that an update is available, I absolutely cannot understand why, efficacy concerns aside, one would object to AmiDaniel's posting messages to the talk pages of each VP user; I certainly can't abide the suggestion that such posting constitutes spamming, a word that, while tautologically appropriate, nevertheless connotes malignancy in action. He's writing to people who have signed up for VandalProof, whereupon they consented to receive such messages as might be relevant to the program, to let these people know that an update to a vandal-fighting tool is available. That's pretty much the definition of a salutary, encyclopedic purpose; I can't imagine why one would object and or ascribe <i>spam</i> (the same term we'd use were one soliciting votes for an AfD or RfA on talk pages) to Daniel's messages. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 03:22, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My apologies. There have been no concerns raised when I've done this in the past (though that may because I usually release later in the evening, when you may have been asleep); however, as my userlist had grown much larger this time, I requested that Werdnabot do it for me this time. Rob Church objected and requested instead that I use AWB and post the messages from an unflagged account. I really do have things in the real world that just came up to take care of at the moment, and as such I'm going to be unresponsive for a little bit; however, I will not continue posting messages. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 03:20, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>After a lenghty, but much-needed Wikibreak, I'm happy to announce that version 1.2 of VandalProof is now <i>available for download!</i> Beyond fixing some of the most obnoxious bugs, like the persistent crash on start-up that many have experienced, version 1.2 also offers a wide variety of new features, including a stub-sorter, a global user whitelist and blacklist, navigational controls, and greater customization. You can find a full list of the new features <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Suggestions_Being_Considered" title="WP:VandalProof">here</a>. While I believe this release to be a significant improvement over the last, it's nonetheless nowhere near the end of the line for VandalProof. Thanks to <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a>, I now have an account on <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://test.wikipedia.org" class="external text" title="http://test.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">test.wikipedia.org</a></span> with SysOp rights and have already been hard at work incorporating administrative tools into VandalProof, which I plan to make available in the near future. An example of one such SysOp tool that I'm working on incorporating is my <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_SHM_0af5.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/SHM">simple history merge</a> tool, which simplifies the process of performing history merges from one article into another. Anyway, if you haven't already, I'd encourage you to <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html#Download" title="WP:VandalProof">download and install version 1.2</a> and take it out for a test-drive. As always, your <a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_VP_suggestions_a7f1.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel/VP/suggestions">suggestions</a> for improvement are always appreciated, and I hope that you will find this new version useful.

Mainly, I was doing it because the userbox/template wars are a very touchy issue, and you don't want to get on the bad side of some of the people involved &lt;tt&gt;&gt;_&lt;&lt;/tt&gt;. I talked to the user that put the comment there, though. Anyway, cheers!

I sort of find the userbox a little offensive/attackish, and I don't know why he posted that here. I don't even know who the guy is, and I actually tend to be more of a deletionist than an inclusionist, so I can't completely understand. I think I've only ever stood up for one userbox my entire time here, and other than that I could really care less if they all get deleted or none of them do--I have a hard time understanding people who have been on a crusade either for or against userboxes for the last couple months; it seems like an awfully boring occupation.

<dd>75% support on an RfA is a pretty tough call, especially given that the "rule" is 75-80% to promote.

<p>I just got around to testing out the tool and it worked fine. One small detail though, on the target page, I had two deleted edits which caused the tool not to restore the page after the page move (step 4). I was hoping that it would be able to still restore the page, including all of the edits. Does this go under your "NOTE: This tool currently can only handle SIMPLE history merges. Anything requiring selective undeletion or article-history splicing must still be done by hand." clause? When I tried merging two pages without any deleted edits it worked exactly as advertised. I am sure this tool will help quite a few admins (and me, if I ever start doing history merges). --<a href="../../../p/s/2/User%7EPS2pcGAMER_3063.html" title="User:PS2pcGAMER">PS2pcGAMER</a> (<a href="../../../p/s/2/User_talk%7EPS2pcGAMER_9645.html" title="User talk:PS2pcGAMER">talk</a>) 04:38, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm ... I'm not sure why having two deleted edits would disable it from restoring the page. Perhaps I need to purge the cache after deleting? Let me run a couple more trials on the test.wiki and see if I can get to the bottom of it, as this should not fall under the simple merge clause (unless you wanted those two edits to remain deleted after the merge).

<dd>I have to say I really don't appreciate your posting this blatantly offensive and intentionally confrontational userbox on my talk page. While I wish that some administrators would place more emphasis on process, I still believe that they are doing what they think is best for the encyclopedia, and I would not resort to attacking them or referring to them as "overzealous Wikipedia cops"--I'd hope that you would do the same. I'd really prefer to stay out of the userbox debates altogether as I find them to be quite absurd and an incredible waste of time--I honestly wouldn't care if the whole lot got deleted or if every userbox was allowed to stay. If you take issue with the way that some articles and templates are deleted, then attacking every deletionist (a category into which I could arguably fall myself) is not the way to go about changing it. Please don't jump to conclusions about people and post similar attack boxes on their talk pages; it's not going to get you anywhere. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 23:27, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure of the entire history behind these articles--I just closed the AfD on <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Fraser_b3c9.html" title="Jim Fraser">Jim Fraser</a>; however, Jim Senor Fraser seems to be quite unnotable, and the article is wholely unsourced. I've listed that one on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jim_Senor_Fraser_2272.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jim Senor Fraser">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jim Senor Fraser</a>; however, the other one I think we should just leave be--its notability is quite marginal, but having survived an AfD, it seems unnecessary to bring it back. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 04:28, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As for <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Fraser_b3c9.html" title="Jim Fraser">Jim Fraser</a>, so long as it can be kept in its current version, I think bringing it to AfD is completely unnecessary. If the edit warring gets extravagant we can look into getting <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnJacobs_620d.html" title="User:JohnJacobs">User:JohnJacobs</a> blocked for 3RR for 24hrs, or we can request protection of the article. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 04:32, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I see you're in on the Senor Fraser fray as well. BTW, great work on 1.2. I've been using it all day and it's awesome. I asked Dlohcierekim if he had AIM so we could coordinate this one, cause I think there's going to be two or three users besides JohnJacobs working on this one. I can explain your question above. JohnJacobs overwrote the original text at <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Fraser_b3c9.html" title="Jim Fraser">Jim Fraser</a>, so that's why it got nominated for AFD. After the AFD failed and it was reverted to the real article, he pulled the information that was there to it's new home at Jim Senor Fraser, which I tagged NPOV and gave him a chance to make it better. <a href="../../../k/c/9/User%7EKc9cqj_c586.html" title="User:Kc9cqj">KC9CQJ</a> 04:41, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, okay, that's what I thought happened. I thought Dlo implied that his article was reposted content, in which case it could easily just be speedied under G4. I think an AfD on his other article is probably the best way to go about this, so long as JJ doesn't continue his wheel-warring and edit-warring. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 04:44, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I get the pattern. How about this for a solution: Mods can add an argument to the global list that forces the removal of certain users from all local lists. If you have Jimbo on your local list, and a mod has added the No Jimbo argument, when you load Import/Export it prompts you "Jimbo has been automatically removed from your blacklist" and then takes him off.

<ul>
<li>A global list is maintained by the moderators of VandalProof. Very specific, very relavant. Categorize vandals based on time since last warning?</li>
<li>Seperate blacklists, maintained by each user, managed in the same fashion as the vandalism log (IE User:Avillia/VPBlacklist).</li>

<p>The character has become notable as a result of his satirical representation of the pimp image in pop culture.

If you can improve the article and make it read more like an encyclopedia article, then please remove the prod tag once you're done or request that some else do this for you.

<dd>In order for a topic to merit inclusion in the main article namespace it must live up to certain standards of notability, or else it will be deleted. The best guideline for deciding whether or not a <i>person</i> is notable enough to warrant an article is <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>. Please read over the guideline carefully before creating an article about a person, as failure to abide by the guideline will likely result in the article being quickly removed. Also, as a side note, I would appreciate if you could please sign your posts with four tildes, like so: ~~~~. That will produce your username and the date and time, which makes discussions much easier to follow.

<p>can i post redirects, can i post new articles and redirect them to other articles like for example if a person goes by two names, like if the article is like puff daddy, can i post a new article named "diddy" and put a redirect link, redirecting it to the "puff daddy" article? -(thats just like an example, so then people can type in "<i>puff daddy</i>" or "<i>diddy</i>" and still go to the same article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that's quite simple. Simply create the <a href="../../../d/i/d/Diddy.html" title="Diddy">Diddy</a> article (as an example here only, I realize that Diddy has already been created) with the following text:</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
 #REDIRECT[[Puff Daddy]]

<p>It's best to avoid creating double redirects, however, pages that redirect to redirects, as that can be quite frustrating.

<p>right but in this case, the certain artist goes by a different name now, so people would most likely type in <i>"diddy"</i> instead of the other old one. like if somebody changes their name or alias, and people wont know where theyre listed in? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheproducer85_9034.html" title="User:Theproducer85">Theproducer85</a> 09:37, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yeah, that's what redirects do. They enable a user to type in Diddy and be taken to the article they were actually looking for.

<dd>Consider it done; I strongly doubt there's any legitimate reason to warn Tawkerbot2. Keep in mind that VP's not a bot, so any warnings TB2 receives are (assuming good faith) accidental postings by users, and I can only program the app, not the users :-). I'm also thinking that, if TB2 is receiving warnings, then I bet many of his edits are being reverted--I think I may code in something to prompt you when you try to revert a change by a whitelisted user; perhaps that will help cut down the learning curve a bit. Also, does TB2 break everytime he receives a post on his talk page? I'm guessing not, as that would make it pretty easy for someone to put him out of commission, but if it does, then I really am sorry for each of the warnings he got in error. And on yet another sidenote, when's TB2 going to get his magical flag? As impressed as I am seeing him work, I think he's had a long enough review period and demonstrated himself to be 99.99% accurate, and I'd kinda like to be able to hide his edits from RC. Anyway, sorry about the inconvenience, and I hope this works out. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 19:30, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I believe Tawkerbot2 is not going to get a bot flag, since that would hide its edits from the recent changes page.

<dd>Oh, really? I thought he was just having a review period, and then he'd get one. Well I, for one, don't have much interest reviewing TB2's edits, as I've never once found him making an error, but if the bot approval group said he's not getting one, then I guess that's that.

<p>I have Vandalproof installed and working, but Whodunit gives an error "can't find article" when I try <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_Today_638c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for creation/Today">Wikipedia:Articles for creation/Today</a> and occasionally with other pages, do I need to put it in the same directory as VandalProof, was it connection problem (My IE browser showed a page, then said it couldn't and shifted to an error page several times last night) or is there some bug I don't know about.

<dd>Wow! I didn't know anyone was actually using that. Anyway, it doesn't need to be in the same directory as VP--the two aren't really at all related beyond being built on the same platform and using similar components. Are you having problems with JavaScript error messages using either? And, just to go out on a limb, there are a lot of tools, such as Lupin's popups, that have problems with IE, giving errors such as "cannot read data," etc. If that's the case for you, you may just have to try it again after you get those errors, or you could try blanking your monobook. I put up with the errors just because I love popups so much, but I do wish Lupin could find a way to fix it. Anyway, I hope this helps. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 09:15, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Whodunit is quite useful for tracking down who posted a non-signed submission to <a href="../../../a/f/c/WP%7EAFC_0d2b.html" title="WP:AFC">WP:AFC</a>. :) I don't get any errors in the Internet Explorer when using popups. It's only Whodunit that is not getting along. I use quite a lot of my monobook, so wiping it is not an option, if it's a script error, perhaps I need to put a copy of the VP script error patch in the same directory as Whodunit? - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:23, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm dumb... Whodunit? It sounds, from here, like something that figures out who edited comments.

<dd>Alright! Now that looks more like an encyclopedia article! I removed your signature from the bottom of the article as none of these article's really <i>belong</i> to anyone since <i>anyone</i> can edit them, and I sorted it as broadcasting stub (It's debatable whether or not the article truly is a stub, but having it sorted as such will likely bring others to expand the article even further). I no longer have any intention of bringing the article to AfD as I think you've done a good job cleaning it up. Sorry about how frustrating it is to have someone immediately slaping delete tags on your articles, but it's about the only way to take care of maintanance issues on Wikipedia (you wouldn't believe how much true rubbish gets <a href="../../../l/o/g/Special%7ELog_Delete_f502.html" title="Special:Log/Delete">deleted</a> every day). The best way to avoid similar situations in the future would be to start working on articles in your sandbox and then move them into mainspace when the time is right. Again, I'm always here if you need help with anything, so feel free to ask. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 09:29, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thank you. You are right. An article should be started in the sandbox. The truth is that I don't know what I am doing. I guess I'll get the hang of it as I go.</dd>
