<dd>Timothy, I have made no personal attacks or disruption, God knows. I had objections to InShaneee's block of Zereshk. I mainly claimed that the block was too long and furthermore the steps required for an admin to pass until a user gets block is not taken by InShaneee. I was outspoken in what I believe was justice. This block is only meant to quite me. But Cyde had to justify it somehow, so he accused me of Harrassment <b>and</b> personal attacks <b>and</b> disruption.

<p>That would be a good article should there be an article comparing Baptists with other Christian groups, which is what <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_and_Islam_41cb.html" title="Shi'a and Islam">Shi'a and Islam</a> is doing. Can you think of a better title for a page comparing a subset of a religion with a superset of a religion? Trick is, it can't have "Misconceptions" in the title.

<p>Hey Aminz. I was wondering whether/how you think we should welcome new contributors to the article? (You reverted text. I googled for Maimonides and conversion and Islam and it is all terribly controversial and complex and I don't have any academic refs yet.) <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 12:24, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Hello, Im Levito. Im not sure as to which academic sources i could find due to the nature of the fallacy itself. I'll explain. The entire story of Maimonides converting to Islam was first spread by one of his enemies, who was a physician in morrocco i think. This physician wasnt very skilled and Maimonides exposed him as such which pretty much ended his career. This man invented the slander in question against Maimonides, however no one at the time took him seriously. The next link in the chain is the historian Graetz. I guarantee you that the historian that was referenced on the dhimmi page was only quoting Graetz's "History of the Jews". Graetz is the one who reintroduced this slander and because of his "respectability" within academic circles has led many other scholars to perpetuate this falsehood unwittingly. Graetz is the only other source for this slander, and it stems from his own mentor's virulent hatred of both Judah the Prince and Maimonides, who in his view were responsible for cementing judaism into clear cut laws and philosophies as opposed to allowing individual autonomy and liberty within observance and belief. As the forerunners of the "reform" movement these men had many personal reasons to attack the character and qualities of numerous individuals who would represent the traditional jewish way of thought which is that judaism is a divine religion and not one made by men. The hatred that the "maskilim" or members of the jewish enlightenment, and later the reformers, had for traditional judaism is well known and documented in their numerous attempts in germany to stamp traditional judaism out, even manipulating the secular german government whenever possible into aiding them. Ill be honest that i think it will be difficult to find hard core sources to support me, but on the other hand no one will find any source for the other side that isnt Graetz, or isnt referencing Graetz exclusively.</p>
<p>It would make me happy if you let my changes stand, but if we need more proof then ill see what i can do but i cant promise it will be soon.</p>
<p>Thank you for letting me know that you changed it, and for being so cordial about the whole thing, im a bit new to this and im happy i didnt cause any offense with my edit. Talk to you later.</p>
<p>oh and the Maimonides article you referred me to is pretty good except for the modern thing at the end. um i'm not getting involved there cause its just too much hassle and a general waste of time to try and talk sense into people that have a vested interest in believing something contrary to the truth.</p>

That the Qur'an does not demand the earthly penalty for apostasy and that only the Shafi'is interpret Sura 2:214 as requiring to execute the apostates is a <i>fact</i>, not opinion; attributing this fact to Heffening makes no sense. It's disruptive to try and bring every single article that you edit must be reduced to the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Islam_00d9.html" title="Criticism of Islam">Criticism of Islam</a> standard: <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Islam_00d9.html" title="Criticism of Islam">Criticism of Islam</a> is a collection of opinions by definition. I'm not going to level against you your favorite charges of selective quotation and misrepresentation (you've chosen to write that the Qur'an does not demand punishment for apostasy, but failed to write about the hadith, which do demand death penalty); I'm just noting your editing pattern.

<dd>First of all, thanks for letting me know about that one scholar whom I couldn't read(the fonts were completely messed up). Secondly, I said, "Heffening states X" not that "Heffening believes X". A scholar can state a fact. The reader will accept it as a fact if there are no other quotes made there. Now, as to your claim of "my selective quotation and misrepresentation", please have a look at the original article written by Heffening. I honestly summerized one whole long paragraph within its context. Heffening doesn't mention that Hadith there and that was why I didn't mention that Hadith in my summary. Also, I will be more than happy to learn about my editing failures and correct myself if I feel there is something wrong. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 21:02, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, it's pointless to attribute a fact to someone; only opinions may be attributed. Otherwise, the whole Wikipedia would read like "A says X" and would be everyone's laughing stock. Secondly, Heffening <i>does</i> write about the hadith, right in the paragraph after the Qur'an. Sorry, at this point, it's hard to believe that you've said it good faith given the fact that you attempted to post the whole article from the <i>Encyclopaedia of Islam</i> on the article's talk page.

<dd>And my question is that how do you know if something is "a fact" or "only opinions"? Especially could you please explain how "Muhammad moved to attack Khaybar in order to raise his prestige among his followers, as well as to capture booty to sustain subsequent conquests." is a fact and not an opinion.</dd>
<dd>Secondly, I attempted to post the whole article from the <i>Encyclopaedia of Islam</i> on the article's talk page so that editors who have time may use it as a source for the article. Had I wanted to misrepresent the source, I wouldn't have posted the whole article on the talk page.</dd>
<dd>Thirdly, please note that I was editing the intro. I didn't mention any of the Qur'anic verse (to show they don't prescribe it) as well. Rather I just mentioned that they don't prescribe death penalty. I also added that Hadiths don't have the elements of the hereafter punishment and instead we have death punishment. The article already said that all five schools prescribe death penalty. There was a gap explaining why there are some who don't believe so and this gap was filled with the paragraph I added.</dd>
<dd>Fourthly, you are welcome to summarize the first and second paragraph again (by for example adding a couple of Qur'anic verses and also the Hadiths or however you feel is better). --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 21:43, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A fact is something people agree on; an opinion is something people do not agree on. No one seriously disputes what only the Shafiis deduce from the Qur'an a death penalty for aposatsy; no one seriously disputes that Muhammad's followers were diappointed at the Hudaybiyya fiasco and Muhammad needed a victory to regain authority; thus, these are facts.

It is common sense to me that once one scholar says "the Shafiis deduce from the Qur'an a death penalty for apostasy" it is a fact; however whether "only" they have such an opinion can be true or not (based on the knowledge of the author, the time he is living, etc. ) so, I go for saying "X says only Shafiis deduce from Qur'an such things..."</dd>
<dd>And it is a common sense that "some of the Muhammad's followers were disappointed at the Hudaybiyya", but whether "Muhammad needed a victory to regain authority" is a fact or not needs proof. Muir, I think, says that Muhammad gave promise to some of the Bedouins for a victory and he conquered Khaybar to have his prediction fulfilled. I am "sure" Muslim scholars dispute that Muhammad attacked Khaybar precisely for 1. in order to raise his prestige among his followers 2. to capture booty to sustain subsequent conquests. Such kinds of simplifications of events are the very nature of theories proposed by scholars and they well know that they are dealing with theories in the first place and not with facts. Facts are with God alone&#160;:P --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 22:23, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi, you seem like a resonable person so I think that both of us should stop our discussion on InShaneee's page at least for the time being before it becomes too heated.

<p>Levito, if you read this, get yourself a user page and then people can leave messages directly for you there. The page on Graetz confirms (but without references) that he was not a very reliable historian. And I see from Amazon that there are some biographies of Maimonides, but they are not universally acclaimed either. Amazing given that he was such an important figure in the middle ages, for Jews, Christians and Muslims in particular and learning and posterity in general.</p>
<p>Aminz, I reckon the Dhimmi article needs a to-do list. Starting with bringing in a greater range of academic sources. Restructuring. Etc. What do you think?<a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsmejudith_5347.html" title="User:Itsmejudith">Itsmejudith</a> 13:12, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's not just Muslims who see Timothy Usher for what he is..Netscott's levied the same accusation against him after seeing him defend FNB's image of a pig with "Allah" written on it. People have noted the hatred in his rhetoric and his edits. Faisal, BhaiSaab, Netscott, and several others. I've noticed his sweet words in discussion with you, but aside from that, he's never been civil with a Muslim here. His editing on Islam-related topics demonstrate a single driven POV. I don't want to say much, least I get into trouble.

<p>Hypothetical question not directly referring to a particular user...Ask yourself: "What would a bigot do?" Try to influence the views of readers by selectively collecting the most damning pieces of facts? Edit war and argue to exclude any less POV-biased sources or views? Engage the targets of his bigotry, preferably with the assistance of fellow bigots, to vocally and openly demean them personally and ridicule their religion? What would a bigot do? And what have they done and what have they been doing?

<p>Here is my suggestion: InShaneee honestly <i>and on his own choice</i> asks another admin to look closely into his block of Zereshk and hears my arguments. If that admin ended up with the decision that InShaneee was completely right, I am willing to get blocked for a week or even longer. How is that?

<p>Cyde wrote on his talk page: <i>Aminz and Zereshk have been on a harrassing and annoying campaign against InShanee for awhile now because InShanee dared to step into some silly cultural conflict and Zereshk basically responded with, "You have no right to tell us anything about this, it's not your cultur, you won't understand." This has been going on for quite some time with disruptive threads on ANI and veiled insults all over the wiki. And now that Aminz is being blocked I just see him repeatedly Wikilawyering. All of this harrassment and campaigning against admins needs to stop; he can't weasel his way out of it.</i></p>
<p>My discussion with InShaneee didn't have "any" cultural conflict. My main claim was that InShaneee's block of Zereshk was too long and furthermore the steps required for an admin to pass until a user gets block is not taken by InShaneee. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:InShaneee#Zereshk.27s_block" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:InShaneee#Zereshk.27s_block" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>) Also, InShaneee's block was not in the direction of solving the spamming problem (I, on the other hand, created <a href="../../../i/r/a/Wikipedia%7EIran%2Cshiite_and_middle_east_related_articles_noticeboard_Incidents_b705.html" title="Wikipedia:Iran,shiite and middle east related articles noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Iran,shiite and middle east related articles noticeboard/Incidents</a> as supposedly a solution to spamming problem). I believe unless we address the motivations, the problems will not be solved at the surface with long blocking.</p>
<p>See, I even myself considered some of Zereshk's comments as uncivil and you can find this on both Zereshk's or InShaneee's talk page (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zereshk&amp;diff=65677827&amp;oldid=65677102" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zereshk&amp;diff=65677827&amp;oldid=65677102" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>). I even "reasoned" that Zereshk was spamming when he was denying it.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:InShaneee&amp;diff=64972183&amp;oldid=64972058" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:InShaneee&amp;diff=64972183&amp;oldid=64972058" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.

I supported Jersey Devil who reported Zereshk for his spamming in his Adminship RfA. Cyde, I am telling the truth. I never made any personal attacks, or disruption. Harassment, well, if you consider criticizing one's behavior as harassing, I did criticize but I always remained civil. I don't really know the policies on Harassing but I've never intended to do one. I don't think arguing against one's behavior is defined as "campaigning". InShaneee is a human like all of us. I don't believe anybody (including myself) to be fault-less; but also on the other hand, one's fault in one case doesn't mean that he is so in main. I never intended such generalization and sometimes made it clear (if implicitly). --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 19:46, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Noticed your new defence commentary on Timothy Usher. I find your protecting him inexplicable. He incidentally happens to be particularly interested in that bit of the Aisha article that speaks on her being 6 at marriage. He incidentally supports FNB's freedom of speech rights when FNB posts a picture on his user page, of a pig with "Allah" superimposed on it in Arabic. He happens to edit Musaylimah to point out that he's a false prophet, just like Muhammad. Other than you, every other communication he's had with a Muslim had been in a form of an attack, either directly or through references to denegrating Islam and Muhammad. I can't make any interpretations of your behavior without violating some bloated or twisted form of some WP policy for another, so I won't. I would think it a terrible idea that a barnstar or two and some flattering words would be all it took to make a person acquience to hate speech. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 15:56, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>H.E., please let me go through your evidences. I haven't read your comments to this detail but I will and I'm always open to change my mind 100%. Also, FYI, I have told Zereshk about this ArbCom. I've asked him to inform all other related editors here. Surely Zereshk doesn't have a good view towards Timothy Usher, and I did it intentionally and in fairness since you were thinking I am not a good sample here. I didn't want to be responsible for it, so I informed Zereshk. Everyone should speak up. Your point that the way Timothy talks about Muhammad is sometimes offensive to Muslims is a valid point, it was the same to me, and we had discussions over it through email. He claims that he does so not only for Muhammad but also for Jesus and other people. He told me some jokes... I didn't find it to be his specific attitude towards Muhammad. You may think I am doing a mistake. Maybe. I am not free from it. But my responsibility is to decide based on whatever I have seen. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 16:13, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>BTW, re the Aisha age, I am more inclined to accept she was married at 6 but stayed in her parents' home till she had reached puberty (at 9 or maybe 10 according to Ibn Hisham). Aisha reached pubetry early and this is stressed by all her accounts (Spellberg points out). So, there is absolutely nothing wrong with her marriage at age 6. And this not only my own view, but the view of the dominant majority of Muslims. Now indictment of Muhammad based on this just shows rank of ignorance (to my mind of course) and I don't think Timothy has done so. If he has, I can argue with him and convince him but I don't think he has done so in the first place. I need to check your other evidences... --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 16:28, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even I will say that anyone marrying a 6 yr old is a pedophile. Anyone having sex with a 9 or 10 year old is also pedophilia. Timothy knows that, and it's with that knowlege he edits the article to emphasize that aspect of Aisha's life. The majority of Muslims aren't even aware of the Hadith that makes that claim, much less the long dispute over the authenticity of that claim and the opposing views on that. Timothy Usher made it quite clear he believes Muhammad is a murderer. "Muhammad himself violated a woman named Safiyah after torturing her husband and beheading him" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Battle_of_Khaybar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47027545" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Battle_of_Khaybar&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47027545" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> "Muhammad would be considered a war criminal - executing POW's, ransoming others, poisoning wells with dead bodies, etc." Does it take an ounce of intelligence to see what tilt his arguements aim to support? In "Criticism of Islam" you justified the existence of the article by saying "I am a Muslim and support the existence of this article for I believe it is constructive." An article that is larger than WP policy would suggest as a normal size, documenting and analyzing every single claim against Muhammad that can be vocalized. Fixing the POV in that article becomes a difficult task when a person who calls himself a Muslim uses the "I am Muslim and I endorse this article" line, despite criticism of the article's POV by Muslims and non-Muslims alike. You've brought the same hurdle to Arbcomm now, defending someone whom most objective readers see as indefensible because of the obvious bias in his works. And sorry, but I don't buy it that you are unaware of Usher's edit history, you're as well-acquainted with him as I am...just as I don't buy your ignorance plea when <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> was stating as a matter of fact, that the Muslim marriage amounted to slavery. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 17:59, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Starting from the end; Man, Why don't you buy my "ignorance plea when <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhimmi.html" title="Dhimmi">Dhimmi</a> was stating as a matter of fact". If you have a look at my edits to Dhimmi article, you'll realize that I have been working on the article from the top sections (because they are read first) and the Shia ritual purity section (which I was more familar with and was picked up first). Just check it. I am going to make a claim and I'm sure you'll not accept it from me: See this edit of mine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dhimmi&amp;diff=65631890&amp;oldid=65629809" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dhimmi&amp;diff=65631890&amp;oldid=65629809" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. There was a dispute between Pecher and Itsmejudith on the section of "Places of worship" &amp; other passages. Now, do believe me if I claim I haven't read this very section closely? I have read the first paragraph closely and have an idea of what's going on there, but just an idea.</dd>
<dd>Now, I should say I remember once Faisal and Timothy were discussing marriage somewhere and sometime. Faisal believed husband should be Muslim since the children go for the religion of husband. This, I remember.

<dd>You've been editing this article for a month. You're telling me you've been editing it for a month but you never read it? The same content has been disputed in the talk page time and time again with Muslims taking strong opposition to the inclusion of the notion that Muslim marriages are relations between slave-owner and slave. Faisal was arguing precisely over the content I later argued about. You do all this in-depth research, it doesn't make sense to me that you'd be oblivious to the content of the articles you work on. From your earlier request for info on Timothy Usher's support of the pig image, it's apparent you intend to claim you don't know of Usher's antics either. Read through the evidence I posted on the Arbcomm page, on Timothy Usher. Read through the pages you've been editing for so long. I won't pretend to give you the benefit of the doubt. And please do not use "I am a Muslim" to express your endorsement of things you haven't even read, things written by hate mongers to defame Islam and insult Muslims, just because they were written by your friends. <a href="../../../h/i/s/User%7EHis_excellency_ec70.html" title="User:His excellency">His Excellency...</a> 20:09, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I see you're now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tom_harrison&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66046843" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tom_harrison&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=66046843" rel="nofollow">spamming</a> to drum up support for a retaliatory policy change. Number one, it's already been suggested and shot down a dozen times, and number two, don't spam. You really, really know better, so consider this your only warning. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 22:35, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Spamming? Diffs please... My english is not good. Could you also please explain "consider this your only warning" means this is only a warning or this is the only warning I've given, or this is the last warning. Thanks. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 22:38, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Above is one diff, and you copy/pasted that exact same message about your proposal to another page, as well. "Only warning" here means that this is your first and last warning about this. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 23:00, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>InShaneee, I am trying to find a group of people interested to work on the project of 'working on policies'? Please let me know what is wrong with that? There is no RfA, RfD, etc etc here. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 23:02, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Spamming is spamming, which I hope you'll pick up on sooner rather than later. You should just stop looking for loopholes now; there aren't any. And yes, there is a place to discuss policy, it's called <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)</a>. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 23:04, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can I <b>request</b> that you kindly unwatch my userpage? If not, that's okay. This is just a personal request. Feel free to ignore it. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 23:12, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've never had it watched. I have been keeping an eye on it recently, though, since you've been doing little aside from crusading across the wiki in a fairly disruptive manner. --<a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInShaneee_1a4d.html" title="User:InShaneee">InShaneee</a> 23:14, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>InShaneee, thanks. I don't honestly get my disruptive manner. But anyways, I just would like to work on the policies now. I promise not to post anything on either your or Cyde's userpage and unwatch both. Thanks in advance. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 23:18, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
