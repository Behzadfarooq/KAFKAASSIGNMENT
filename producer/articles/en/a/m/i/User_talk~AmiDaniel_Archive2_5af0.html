<p>Wow, that was fast! How did you manage to welcome me so speedily - by monitoring recent changes? I'd estimate your message popped up within a minute of creating this account. Anyways, I'm not entirely new to this but gave up my old account months ago. Had planned on giving up editing, but got sucked in again. Seems like I'm back for now. Thank you for the welcome. --<a href="../../../i/p/_/User%7EIP_80.166.158.89_d23c.html" title="User:IP 80.166.158.89">IP 80.166.158.89</a> 03:22, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Anonymous Users</span></h2>
<p>My sentiments are the same, though a fair bit cooler: I fail to see your objection to anonymous editing. Surely a self-proclaimed Democratic Socialist such as yourself can appreciate the tenets of libertarianism that esteem a degree of anonymity. Not all anonymous IPs are vandals, let alone n00bs, and might, for whatever reason, simply want to edit anonymously. I too have an account, but due to the fact that Wikipedia seems to inhibit its login cookies for lasting more than an hour or remaining after temporarily leaving the site, I've decided to give up on logging in. Beyond that, anonymous IPs tend to stay the same for longer than you'd think, they essentially are, in and of themselves, screen names. But thanks for the considerations anyway. 66.229.227.145 23:59, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thus the message that I often contradict myself. Truthfully, my objection is not to anonymous editing but rather to anonymous editing from shared IP accounts. It is extremely difficult to contact Shared IP users and next to impossible to block them for abuse (in cases such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:64.12.116.71" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:64.12.116.71" rel="nofollow">this</a>). I think that if we could find a way to require all users connected through Shared IPs to register we would cut down on vandalism by more than half, and if all users were required to register, I bet we could eliminate 90% of all vandalism. The <i>vast</i> majority of vandalism is from IP accounts, and while I believe that allowing IP users to edit does bring in a lot of legitimate editors, it seems as though the problems it causes far outweigh the benefits. But that's just my opinion, and most users have a different mindset. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 00:33, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I see your point, and for the most part, I agree. I guess one thing that irks me is that whenever I edit from an IP address I find that people are stumbling over themselves to welcome me to Wikipedia and to induce me into making an(other) account. Also, as I noted before, I have my reasons for not using an account. Then again, I have to acknowledge the fact that Wikipedia isn't like the rest of the web or any democracy: it's a collaborative effort in sculpting an encyclopedia, and this requires a level of accountability not found in day-to-day situations. It's a careful balance, and I'm sorry for being so short with you before. 66.229.227.145 01:43, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>i was recently accused of 'vandalising' the venetian snares discography which is incorrect. if you maybe did your homework before making assumptions you might actually find out that the album WAS originally titled "The Stupid Chocolate Wheelchair Album" (LOOK IT UP) and then this website might not be such an effing JOKE. <small>âThis <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.226.54.173 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.226.54.173.html" title="User talk:24.226.54.173">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.226.54.173_2774.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.226.54.173">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>"Originally (and, as far as Funk was concerned, currently) called 'The Stupid Chocolate Wheelchair Album', but Mike Paradinas decided the title would be pointlessly provocative, so removed the 'Stupid'" (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chocolate_Wheelchair_Album_d5c6.html" title="The Chocolate Wheelchair Album">The Chocolate Wheelchair Album</a>). Frankly, this probably was just a content dispute, but your insolence toward me and Wikipedia makes me hesitant in removing my warning.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">False Accusation</span></h2>
<p>Hello, i got some message from you accusing me of vandalising some Anglican Grammar School page. this is a lie as i have only EVER updated the lemonheads page as far as i know. don't accuse strangers of flase crimes or risk becoming a victim yourself. regards, Ross <small>âThis <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 220.236.168.28 (<a href="../../../2/2/0/User_talk%7E220.236.168.28.html" title="User talk:220.236.168.28">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_220.236.168.28_9f90.html" title="Special:Contributions/220.236.168.28">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<dd>Unfortunately, it is not a "LIE" that someone from this account vandalized both the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglican_Church_Grammar_School_77bc.html" title="Anglican Church Grammar School">Anglican Church Grammar School</a> and the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brisbane_Boys%27_College_6476.html" title="Brisbane Boys' College">Brisbane Boys' College</a> articles. It may not have been you, for as you are editing from an anonymous account, it is entirely possible that one of hundreds of users operating on this shared IP made those edits. I ran a Whois query on this IP and uncovered that it is indeed a shared IP registered to the ISP Optus Internet in Chatswood, Sydney (as you'll see in the message I placed at this talk page's header). The only edits ever made by this IP, however, were to the two articles mentioned above and the message you posted on my talk page--no one from this IP has ever edited the <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemonheads.html" title="Lemonheads">Lemonheads</a> article (see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_220.236.168.28_9f90.html" title="Special:Contributions/220.236.168.28">contribs</a>). I apologize for the inconvenience of receiving these warning messages; however, you can very easily avoid such frustrations by <a href="../../../r/e/g/Wikipedia%7ERegister_6574.html" title="Wikipedia:Register">registering for an account</a>.

<dd>well, i don't live in Chatswood, and i don't care how you found me. all i care is that i don't take kindly to false accusations. if you make it your business to go after people, then make sure you do it right. according to the page on the lemonheads which i updated, my IP address is: 58.104.225.84. these technological matters are of little concern to me. if my ip has changed or whatever, i don't care. and as far as 'restistering' is concerned, i shall do as i please, which is nothing at all. <small>âThis <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 220.236.168.28 (<a href="../../../2/2/0/User_talk%7E220.236.168.28.html" title="User talk:220.236.168.28">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_220.236.168.28_9f90.html" title="Special:Contributions/220.236.168.28">contribs</a>) .</small></dd>

<dd>It's coming along pretty well. Right now, I'm mainly just working on minor interface details, trying to make it a little easier for users other than myself to understand what everything does. I also just added a short routine that substitutes any test templates on userpages edited by VandalProof ... the one "problem" I'm having with that routine is that it "substitutes" commented templates (&lt;!--{{test4}}--&gt; becomes &lt;!--{{subst:test4)--&gt;) which I think I'm just going to leave because I don't think it's necessarily a problem (or is it?). I'm also starting a simple help file on it and improving the welcome page.

<dd>I have to say that's something I haven't really taken into account as I don't have much experience with Macs. I'm not entirely sure how Macs handle Windows executables, but the app is based on the VB6 platform and is dependent upon the standard Windows infastructure (ADVAPI31.DLL, GDI32.DLL, KERNEL32.DLL, RPCRT4.DLL, USER31.DLL), standard VB6 framework (MSVBVM60.DLL, MSVCRT.DLL), and OLE automation (OLE32.DLL, OLEAUT32.DLL). All of these files are fairly standard windows libraries (especially in XP), and I'm not sure how these dependencies would be handled by Macs. I'm also not sure how it handles OCX dependencies and how the app would interact with the mac rendention of explorer and java. I'll look into it a bit more and get back to you, but right now I don't have much info on the topic.

<dd>Sort of a combination of both. There are a variety of tags that I can add to the page to, for instance, disable the app or alert users of upgrades. You'll also notice that a few of the names on the list appear with Html char formatting, such as Can%27t_sleep%2C_clown_will_eat_me, which is partially the reason for having the two separate lists. I want one for people to see and one for the app to see ... copy and paste isn't that difficult. When the page loads in VP, it is stripped of all references to the source page such as edit, edit section, permanent link, discussion, watch, what links here, etc., etc, and since I use the section edits when editing the list, I removed the NOEDITSECTION from the page. You can feel free to laugh at my system, but it actually works suprisingly well. Anyone using the app has no clue how where everything's being stored, which was more or less the goal. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 23:09, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not really too concerned with people finding it though. Like I said on the talk page, it loads only the last version that <i>I</i> modified on startup.

Unless the vandalism becomes to excessive to handle, I doubt I'll seek page protection or otherwise change it. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 23:49, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, okay, I get what you were saying now. I might eventually release source code but only to <i>trusted</i> users, where it really wouldn't be much of an issue to allow them to see my routines, so long as they understand not to change them (or I could simply remove them). But we'll cross that herdle when we get there. I thought there may have been some issue licensing it under GPL and only allowing use to "select" individuals.

And 2) I have no subject-matter involvement with the said article other than stub-sorting and/or tagging. Hence, it would be fruitless (and at times annoying) to get a message, rather the message should go to the original author. That said, it's a nice tool and good initiative which I would like to contribute with as well. Cheers! --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiljoshi_730b.html" title="User:Miljoshi"><font style="color:#5A3696">ÎÎ¹Ä¿</font></a>Ë<a href="../../../m/i/l/User_talk%7EMiljoshi_e74b.html" title="User talk:Miljoshi"><font style="color:#008000">talk</font></a> 08:38, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just to let you know that I have removed your message from <a href="../../../c/e/z/User_talk%7ECezve_452c.html" title="User talk:Cezve">User talk:Cezve</a> because it would have totally confused him. He's new to wikipedia, and I don't think his English is that greatâand the article was not actually tagged for speedy delete! Moreover, I've removed the prod tag from <a href="../../../%C3%BC/r/%C3%BC/%C3%9Cr%C3%BCn.html" title="ÃrÃ¼n">ÃrÃ¼n</a> while I was cleaning it up because I feel that a national magazine is notable enough, even if the article itself is no more than a stub.

<dd>Woa, sorry about that. I just fixed a bug and was so eager to test it that I got a little ahead of myself. Not really testing, but nonetheless a careless move on my behalf. I apologize! <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 08:50, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Well, now... Both of the above points are contradictig eachother. You may want to reformat the message-text for a newcomer perhaps? Am afraid none of the stub-sorting group or otherwise unrelated users would like to recieve the messages. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMiljoshi_730b.html" title="User:Miljoshi"><font style="color:#5A3696">ÎÎ¹Ä¿</font></a>Ë<a href="../../../m/i/l/User_talk%7EMiljoshi_e74b.html" title="User talk:Miljoshi"><font style="color:#008000">talk</font></a> 08:56, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Immediately after this happened, I changed it so that, by default, only editors with more than one edit (and the article's creator) will be informed, as it clearly is quite unnecessary for stub-sorters and spellcheckers to be informed about articles with which they are not particularly involved. The CSD message is, I admit, a horrible one right now -- I think I'm just going to remake one from {{<a href="../../../a/d/w/Template%7EAdw_521e.html" title="Template:Adw">Adw</a>}} that's relatively neutral, less jam-packed with unneccessary info, more subtle, and less overwhelming for newcomers. The current one is, more or less, the same as {{<a href="../../../n/n/-/Template%7ENn-warn_1f21.html" title="Template:Nn-warn">Nn-warn</a>}}, which I've never liked, and I also never liked {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENothanks-vanity_feee.html" title="Template:Nothanks-vanity">Nothanks-vanity</a>}}. I still feel it helpful to inform invested users when their articles are proded, CSD'd, or AfD'd (as I still remember when my first article was proded without anyone telling me about it). But I'll get this all sorted out... I promise =). <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 09:03, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi amidaniel. You expressed reservations regarding me using your new revert tool. In the past I have done bold and sometimes pov edits. Some of these have been called vandalism (incorrectly IMHO). Example: I saw someone had a vandal counter template on their page; so I incremented their counter by one! (This was done as a joke). Anyway, if you require more Firefox 1.5 testers, I use this browser on all of Win98, Win2K and WinXP.

<p>Hi AmiDaniel. I am very interested in this tool and and I hope that it ends up being a really beneficial tool for the community. I wish I could have done more as far in dealing with the featured article, but my hands were tied. Hopefully that URL will be blacklisted and it won't be an issue.

<dd>Really? I've tried it on four separate computers and haven't add any problems yet. I am a little uneasy hosting the project on a secure server as I'm sure that will likely cause problems for some people, but I had a horible time trying to get it hosted at SourceForge and Gna. Thanks for the heads up though, and I'll look into it a bit more. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 09:59, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I just tried downloading it again to see if I could replicate the problem you had, and now it seems to be having problems simply downloading.

<dd>On my other computer, I got the same situation. IE worked fine, FF just had no extension. I don't have any extensions for Firefox on this other computer, so that wouldn't be interfering. Anyway, I'll check again later in the day and maybe it will work correctly then. For now, I'll try out the program and let you know if I run into any problems.

<p>Hey there AmiDaniel, thanks for completing your awesome tool. I just downloaded it now, and after I run it, I'll give you a proper thanks. *Update* I ran the tool, after downloading the .cab, as the standalone exe said I needed a dll, I tried the Setup.exe file, but got this error: <i>Invalid command-line parameters. Unable to continue.</i> After clicking ok, I got a red X dialogue saying, <i>Setup was not completed successfully</i>. Clicking OK again brought me to <i>Run-time error '5': Invalid procedure call or argument</i>. I ran and launched the .exe perfectly, but for some reason it hung on the logging in screen (coincidentally, just as it does for me in AWB--could be something with my sytem, I'll send details if you want). Trying other options, I reached a dialogue under File | Set edit limit, and clicking "cancel". If I cluck OK, nothing happens, but clicking cancel gives me <i>Run-time error '13': Type mismatch</i>. I'm sorry to be throwing all this stuff at you at once, but I'm not really sure what's going on. Feel free to contact me by e-mail or WP.

<dd>Aha, smart one that I am, I created a tool for moderators to use and then forgot to include the arguments to retrieve the current moderators! Right now the "moderate list" tool only retrieves the last version that <b>I</b> edited, when it obviously should retrieve the last version by any moderator. For now, you're just going to have to add them manually or wait for me to add them. You don't have to worry about doing them in alphabetical order, just add new users to the bottom of the current users list on the welcome page with the user2 template. I'll periodically run the mod list on mine to bring everything back into the right format. Sorry about that!! I'm having an incredibly stressful week (I just now managed to get my internet back up, I've got a paper to write, and I have a program that I have to finish for my *real* job) but I will try to get a minor release ready for this weekend where I'll hopefully be able to fix the mod tools bugs, the cancel bugs, and the jscript bugs. Again, I'm sorry about all these problems, and I hopefully I'll get them all fixed soon! <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 03:03, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi. No, I'm not using any type of bot. I've never used one and I'm not really very familiar with them. I edit the hard way. I have Firefox which permits me to open up oodles of "tabs" at the same time. That way, I can make similar edits to many pages at the same time and then go back and save them all. This way, routine edits like I am currently doing can be done in an "assembly line" fashion which allows me to get alot done in a pretty short period of time.

<p>Hi AmiDaniel,</p>
<p>If you check my contributions history, you should notice I have kept things as cool as possible, even on the light of harrassment by two wikipedians whose name you should find no trouble to find out.

I will not bother you with content discussions as these are certainly too complicated to explain in a line or two and I know you are a busy person, simply note that every single of my edits is referenced and well documented.

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>Thanks very much for your understanding. I downloaded the software and installed it OK. I had a few problems with the TABCTL32 issue but copied and pasted the CAB files into System32 and it is running now. However I still have the problem with the authorisation database you mentioned. Also I am getting Windows XP warnings about having replaced system files with unsigned versions? (I supposed this is because I copied everything instead just TABCTL32.OCX) Thanks, <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsterion_ed2e.html" title="User:Asterion">Asterion</a> 12:40, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm hopefully going to have a working install for 1.0.1 (which I think might actually be 1.1.0) ready for download either tomorrow of or Sunday. That should fix your problems with unsigned system files. You are on the authorized list; are you sure that you are signed in as Asterion in Wikipedia within VP's browser? Try clicking on "Sign In / Create an account" and logging in as Asterion. VP uses the IE rendering enginge, so you'll need to be logged in in IE for it to work. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 18:33, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Not sure what is wrong. I set the username and then signed in but I still get the following warning:

<p>Hi Daniel, I am happy to tell you I managed to get the program working OK now (using 1.10). The bad (read good) part is that I am struggling to find many cases of vandalism! --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsterion_ed2e.html" title="User:Asterion">Asterion</a> 16:05, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I noticed you edited the VandalProof talk page recently so I thought I would ask if you could go ahead and approve me ASAP. I don't mean to be pushy, but I am really excited about putting this awesome new program to use. <a href="../../../d/u/s/User%7EDustimagic_4b89.html" title="User:Dustimagic"><font color="black"><b>Â¡Dustimagic!</b></font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../d/u/s/User_talk%7EDustimagic_9938.html" title="User talk:Dustimagic"><font color="orange"><b>T</b></font></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dustimagic_4315.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dustimagic"><font color="red"><b>C</b></font></a>)</sup> 22:39, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was browsing, not logged into my account when I noticed you left a message for: 68.126.5.210 in regards to <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Belzer_d343.html" title="Richard Belzer">Richard Belzer</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that this is a dynamic IP address for SBC/AT&amp;T DSL. I recently restarted my computer, so that may be the reason why I was assigned the IP.</p>
<p>While I appreciate your efforts, I can assure you I have not committed any vandalism on Wikipedia (please note my user page for the series of articles I have worked on).</p>
<p>Again, I appreciate your efforts, but please keep in mind that some IP addresses are pool IP addresses for specific ISPs, and as such, authentic users may receive your messages, when the person who commited such acts might not be the holder for that specific IP.</p>

<dd>I made a few changes to the wording and order, but I more or less kept your original design (you can feel free to change it again if you want). Thank you so much for your hard work! I'm already starting to feel the need to beginning splitting VP's talk page ... it's already about 100k, and so a navigation bar is definitely needed. Would you object to my (eventually) moving this either to my userspace or to Wikipediaspace?
