<p>Moreover, this wonderful healing and skin care product is also used for speeding up healing of the umbilical cord and after circumcision. If we look back, almost all the historical references we have from the pre-19 century Africa talked about Shea butter. As early as Cleopatra’s Egypt, there is mention of convoys bearing jars of this valuable Shea butter for cosmetic uses.<sup id="_ref-perle_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-perle" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p>The dermatologist Irmin Durand 2004 argues that the relationship of Africa with Shea butter is intimate <sup id="_ref-secret_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-secret" title="">[5]</a></sup> in nature and that “the secret of African beauty lies in it natural skin produced”. In the west, Shea butter is becoming a miraculous, flexible product that promises soft, moisturized skin, effective sun protection, skin aging treatment and healthy scalp. After three month study of Shea butter, the secretary of the women’s club at Suffolk University Dakar Campus reported that 86% of Senegalese family uses karite for skin protection, to strengthen hair and for massaging. Shea butter is becoming a highly demanded skin care product in Senegal.</p>
<p>Moreover some researches have been done by students from different schools including <a href="http://www.suffolk.edu/dakar/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.suffolk.edu/dakar/index.html" rel="nofollow">Suffolk university Dakar Campus</a> .The study consisted of 10 students from Suffolk university, 15 from <a href="http://www.ism.sn/ISM" class="external text" title="http://www.ism.sn/ISM" rel="nofollow">(Institut Superieur de Management)</a> and 10 from <a href="http://www.iam.sn/IAM" class="external text" title="http://www.iam.sn/IAM" rel="nofollow">(School of Management)</a> both male and female. Most of these students that were placed on survey have been using Shea butter on their skin and hair, whilst others used product like <a href="http://www.clearessence.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.clearessence.com/" rel="nofollow"><i>Clear Essence</i></a> lotion and some other used Skin Success lotion. These students were grouped in three groups according to their schools and the product they are going to used and as well as divided them into two sections and studied them by sex as given in the result data below. The three groups which comprises of both sexes, and two sections which discriminated both sex were required to use the products for a period of one month to see the benefit and essential effect on their skin and hair. Questionnaires were given to these students at the end of the one month and questions were answered swiftly for 30 minutes or more. The three groups were examined carefully. Each student expressed their opinion about the product they used and talked about why they liked the product, while few say what they dislike. The questionnaire shown a very important uses of Shea butter and benefit one can gain. As I questioned a girl who was among those that started using the product few months ago, she said to me “I needed help with my acne and dry hair, a friend told me about Shea butter and bought it. The first few weeks of using it was impressive and has helped me with my decision. After using this product for the month you asked us to used, I saw dramatic changes in my skin and hair. The blemishes on my face are disappearing, thanks to Shea moisturizer my skin has a natural health glow to it and my hair love for perm and does not break anymore”. A high percentage of students, recommended the use Shea butter for healthy, glowing and supple skin. Whereas,a minoriy opposes it because they don’t like the smell, and most of these students said it makes them feel uncomfortable, so they prefer the use of the other product. It was a debated issue though, because those that used other products said they would prefer Shea butter which is natural, whilst few people disagree. And when I observed carefully the two distinguish sexes (that uses Shea butter), I found out that the essential effects it has on the female is the same for the male students and also the difference in the benefit that was obtained was not a huge gap. The reason why women benefit mostly from the Shea butter is because female skin is not the same as male. Girls have a more sensitive, soft, soothing and supple skin unlike boys.<sup id="_ref-perle_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-perle" title="">[3]</a></sup> So the effect is more likely to be seen in female than male.</p>

<p>Shea butter has a high concentration of non saponifiable fatty acids which promote cellular growth and helping to restore damage skin. Only high quality unrefined Shea butter can offer the healing benefit mentioned above. Once Shea butter loses its natural integrity through high heat refinements, many of these wonderful benefits are loss.</p>

<p>Hi Amina Diaw, please do not simply replace content with your writing, but add to existing information. I have some concerns about the information you have added to <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shea.html" title="Shea">shea</a>, namely that it deals entirely about the butter of the shea fruit, and not the shea plant, which is the subject of the article and it appears to use as sources the commercial releases of cosmetic companies. The writing that you submitted thus has the sound of an advertisement or advocacy, which is not the encyclopedic tone that Wikipedia strives for. I have reverted your contribution to <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shea.html" title="Shea">shea</a> and placed your text at <a href="../../../s/h/e/Talk%7EShea_79db.html" title="Talk:Shea">talk:Shea</a>, though I see you have also added it to your talk page above. Please address any concerns you may have to that page. I will leave the standard welcome below:</p>
<p><br />
