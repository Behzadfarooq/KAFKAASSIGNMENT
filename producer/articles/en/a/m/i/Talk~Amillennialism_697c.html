<p>Can anyone give references for the claim made by the anonymous contributor 198.103.167.20 that Amillennialism is "the <b>official</b> position of the Roman Catholic Church". I have added a link to a page that gives some support to this but suggests that the Roman Catholic Church, whilst it adopts a position which is basically amillennial, has not made an official statement on postmillennialism or amillennialism, only against premillennialism (millenarianism).--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterR_b418.html" title="User:PeterR">PeterR</a> 5 July 2005 22:15 (UTC)</p>

I think part of the confusion here is that Amilleniaism and Postmillenalism are both descendents of the same view. -- If I knew how to sig I would.</p>
<p>Wouldn't most other mainstream Christian groups be amillennialist? Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, Reformed, and so forth?

<p>If you think your question has been asked before, then please review the list of frequently asked questions (FAQ) as arranged below. I think that since Amillennialism was taught by St. Augustine of Hippo, The Roman Catholic Church is Amillenialist as well.<b>--<a href="../../../a/g/a/User%7EAgapornis_c7e3.html" title="User:Agapornis">Agapornis</a> 15:53, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>There is a difference between "taught by St. Augustine of Hippo" and being defined doctrine of the Catholic Church. Certainly Amillenialism is the majority opinion of Catholics, but it hasn't been defined, so the Church itself is not Amillenialist. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldfritha_cc31.html" title="User:Goldfritha">Goldfritha</a> 18:18, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Lutheran Confessions are explicitly amillenialist, but I would doubt the Reformed should be considered Amillenialist because the bulk of the debate over pre-,post-millenialism has taken place among them.--FidesetRatio 16:50, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Right. The Reformed variously hold to amill, postmill, and historic premill, and all are allowed by, e.g., the Westminster Confession. A few dispensationalesque Calvinists like John MacArthur hold to other varieties of premill, but they are certainly the exception. --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Fl</a><a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_Esperanza_f062.html" title="User:Flex/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">x</a> (<a href="../../../f/l/e/User_talk%7EFlex_ff35.html" title="User talk:Flex">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions%7EFlex_7487.html" title="Special:Contributions:Flex">contribs</a>) 15:44, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It seems that the identification of Amillennialism with Idealism is inaccurate. Whereas Idealists would interpret all of the prophesies in the Apocalypse of St. John as being symbolic--a great mythological and instructive drama, not meant to be taken literally--Amillennialists believe in the actual litteral reality of the prophesies (i.e., there <i>will</i> be an actual person known as the "Beast"/Antichrist), but disagree with Millennialists about how those prophesies will be fulfilled in history (the Kingdom of Heaven is among us now; not a future, temporary, earthly kingdom).<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMishaPan_4767.html" title="User:MishaPan">MishaPan</a> 13:26, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I can really only speak from the point of view of traditional Eastern Orthodox theology, which is very definitely <i>not</i> preterist. The best source in English that I can find right now is <i>Orthodox Dogmatic Theology</i> by Protopresbyter Michael Pomazansky (Tr. Hieromonk Seraphim Rose, Saint Herman of Alaska Brotherhood, Platina, CA, 1984). This book is used as a textbook in at least one major Orthodox Seminary in America (Holy Trinity Seminary, Jordanville, NY). Chapter 10 is devoted to Christian Eschatology. Father Michael states concerning the antichrist: "[I]n a particular sense, "Antichrist" signifies a definite person--the adversary of Christ who is to appear before the end of the world." (p.336). He then goes on to quote II Thes. 2:3-11 as pertaining to the qualities and actions of this particular individual who is to come. While acknowledging that some early Christian teachers (Papias of Hieropolis, St. Justin Martyr, Irenaeus) did espouse millennialist ideas (chiliasm), the consensus of the Holy Fathers is that there will be no temporary Kingdom of Christ (St. Dionysios of Alexandria, St. Basil the Great, St. Gregory the Theologian, St. Epiphanios, and St. Jerome--none of whom can be classified as preterists, or even partial preterists). Father Michael says, "If it was at one time possible to express chiliastic ideas as private opinions, this was only until the Ecumenical Church expressed its judgment about this. But when the Second Ecumenical Council (381), in condemning all the errors of Apollinarius, condemned also his teaching of the thousand-year reign of Christ and introduced into the very Symbol of the Faith [i.e., the Nicene Creed] the words concerning Christ: <i>And His Kingdom will have no end</i>--it became no longer permissible at all for an Orthodox Christian to hold these opinions." (p. 344. Emphasis in the original). St. Augustine, also, in <i>The City of God</i>, XX, 7-9, combats chiliastic teachings.<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMishaPan_4767.html" title="User:MishaPan">MishaPan</a> 06:09, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>While the more conservative amillennialists major on spiritualizing prophecy, and trying to take other scriptures literally, they end up destroying the faith of countless multitudes of people. Amillennialism is the breeding ground for modernism, just like the swamps are the breeding ground for frogs. When you teach preachers how to spiritualize and explain away the prophecies of God’s Word, don’t be surprised when they spiritualize the virgin birth, the resurrection of Christ, and other fundamental truths of the Word of God. Amillennialism and postmillennialism should take a bow, because they are largely responsible for the horrible wave of modernism now flooding the world.</dd>

<dd>If you can’t take the thousand year reign of Christ here on this earth literally, then what part of Revelation 20 can we take literally? Is Christ literal, or is He like the thousand years? Is the devil literal, or is he also just like the thousand years? No wonder that some do not believe in the judgment and in hell, they are just following and further developing the rules of interpretation laid down by amillennialists and postmillennialist.</dd>

<p>Well, I'll grant that's certainly an example of a literalist accusing amillennialists of overspiritualizing. At the other end of the spectrum is literalist Gary DeMar's book End Times Fiction, which claims the <i>pre</i>millennialists are the ones who are overspiritualizing the Bible. I guess what I'm objecting to is the blanket statement, "Those who take a strictly literalistic view accuse amillennialists of over-spiritualizing parts of the Bible," which I don't think is true of all literalists. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAardvark92_9939.html" title="User:Aardvark92">Aardvark92</a> 06:38, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I haven't read that book, but I do know that DeMar is a postmiller, not an amiller (not that the two are as different as pre and post). Am I right in guessing that DeMar says premill literalists don't really take the text literally because Jesus was supposed to return before the end of the present generation (which they deny), because a literal reading of revelation would be about locusts and men on horses (not helicopters or oil or china), and/or because a truly literal reading takes into account the genre of the text in question? In any case, it seems to me that "Those who take a strictly literalistic view" here is really intended as a synonym for premillers who often claim that they are the only ones reading things literally. --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Fl<font color="green">e</font>x</a> (<a href="../../../f/l/e/User_talk%7EFlex_ff35.html" title="User talk:Flex">talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions%7EFlex_7487.html" title="Special:Contributions:Flex">contribs</a>) 14:05, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If literalist in this article means premill, then perhaps the article should say premill. (BTW: Your guesses are correct about DeMar's claims. He says all those things.) <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAardvark92_9939.html" title="User:Aardvark92">Aardvark92</a> 17:42, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
