<dd>Why even bother re-creating the article? If it is obviously an advertisement, and will just end up at AfD again, shouldn't <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> be considered? --<a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHetar_0d92.html" title="User:Hetar">Hetar</a> 06:05, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm ... I tend to disagree. <a href="http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&amp;q=%22Mirador+Instant+Messenger%22&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.de/search?hl=de&amp;q=%22Mirador+Instant+Messenger%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">23.100</a> hits on Google means it has at least some notability; I feel the writing wasn't particularly encyclopedic, but it has a lot of room to improve. I certainly don't think that <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> would come into the question, but let's give the article some time and see where it's at in a week or so.

<dd>Hey, I apologize about the Egdge hippies → <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straight_edge.html" title="Straight edge">Straight edge</a> merger. I was just on my way to bed when I came across that article, and my first instinct was to speedy it but instead, for some odd reason, decided to propose a merger. Afterward, I looked into the topic a bit more, and it only returns something like 30 hits on Google, so I do definitely think it falls under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>.

<dd>It has nothing to do with whether the group insults anyone; it has to do with the fact that the movement is non-notable. A search returns 30 hits on Google, none of which are reliable sources and many of which have nothing to do with the movement itself. If you can find a reputable source to support the notability of the movement, it would likely sway many to your side. Frankly, I believe the article should have been <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedily deleted</a>, but in the interest of not insulting its creator (you) I did not tag it as such, which I've now recognized as a mistake. My tagging of these 3 accounts as <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppets_c28f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppets">sock puppets</a> was not meant as an insult but rather as an attempt to prevent potential "ballot stuffing." You've created these accounts in an attempt to convice others that more individuals support the article's inclusion than actually do. Based upon the user creation log and the users' contributions, there is little doubt in my mind that these accounts are indeed sockpuppets, but if they are not sockpuppets then please substantiate your claim by requesting a <a href="../../../c/h/e/Help%7ECheckUser_fc8a.html" title="Help:CheckUser">CheckUser</a>. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 04:23, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Anyway, glad you got it sorted out--The next version of VP will have global whitelists/blacklists, which I think will be an excellent boost to the tool's functionality. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 06:55, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think we should remove the section "Mama's Boy" from the Elvis Presley page. There is no credible source to suggest that Presley had sex with his mother. No reputable biographer as ever made that statement and the user (Onefortyone) who is pushing the change has a history of citing to questionable sources, purposefully misinterpreting secondary sources, and overtly pushing his own agenda on the Presley page. I think we need significant evidence before we accuse someone, in an encyclopedia no less, of incest.</p>

<dd>You are wrong, Lochdale. The section should not be removed, as it is well-sourced. There are quotes from a book by reputed Elvis biographer <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Guralnick_32ab.html" title="Peter Guralnick">Peter Guralnick</a> and many other books on Elvis. The claims by the singer's stepmother that Elvis had sex with his mother, are discussed by reputed Elvis expert <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greil_Marcus_b07d.html" title="Greil Marcus">Greil Marcus</a> in his book, <i>Double Trouble: Bill Clinton and Elvis Presley in a Land of No Alternativse</i> (2000), p.3 and 6. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a> 22:33, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Actually it isn't well sourced. You have twisted sources in an effort to push your own agenda. For example, of the 2,000 plus books written about Presley, you managed to find two that even come close to supporting your position. You have what can only be described as an obsession with Presley's sex life. The quotes from Guralnik that Elvis was close with his mother do not say, suggest or even imply that Elvis was having an incestual relationship with her. To say that they do is an out and out fabrication. Moreover, Elvis' stepmother makes these claims in an unpublished manuscript that is so out of left field that noone will actually publish it. Lastly, Marcus does not claim that Presley had an incestous relationship with his mother. You either misrepresent sources or provide less than credible sources. The section should be removed. <a href="../../../l/o/c/Lochdale.html" title="Lochdale">Lochdale</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>This may be your personal opinion. Marcus clearly cites sources which deal with the claim. You cannot deny that I have quoted from several independent sources (books and articles on Elvis). Significantly, there was also the claim by <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETed_Wilkes_458b.html" title="User:Ted Wilkes">User:Ted Wilkes</a>, who has now been blocked for one year, that my contributions are fabrications. The personal agenda of Lochdale, who seems to be an Elvis fan, is to remove critical content from the article page. See his contributions: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50489437" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50489437" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44223673" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44223673" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43938836" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43938836" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=33743573&amp;oldid=33738798" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=33743573&amp;oldid=33738798" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=33849122&amp;oldid=33814553" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&amp;diff=33849122&amp;oldid=33814553" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>, etc. But this is not the way it works here. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOnefortyone_0698.html" title="User:Onefortyone">Onefortyone</a> 22:59, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the offer, Tawker (and thanks for your support, Chodorkovskiy and Srikeit!), and I would most graciously accept the nomination in a couple of weeks; however, I'm just now going into some very stressful times with school (thus my WikiBreak above). I certainly feel that I could use SysOp tools for a lot of good (helping to stop vandalism, assisting new users with complicated page moves, speedily deleting pages, etc.)--if anything I could incorporate SysOp features into my app. I've actually studied the tools quite extensively in an attempt to find a way to incorporate them, but in the end found them too difficult to implement without being able to use them myself. I am a little concerned, however, that I don't quite live up to the RfA standards--it seems that most users like to see 6 months experience (whereas I've really only been around since Feb) and most oppose RfA's when the user has not helped to bring an article to featured status (which I have not). In any case, I'm quite humbled that you, the owner of the world renowned (or at least Wikirenowned) Tawkerbot and Tawkerbot2, as well as an excellent admin, would nominate me for adminship. Thanks! I will definitely accept once I'm done with my exams. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 05:29, 28 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was also going to drop you a message about nominating you for adminship. I was just waiting until the end of May when you'd be back from your Wikibreak. In my experience, editcountis is definitely there. Your numbers look fine to me, but I think having 300+ project edits would go pretty far in pleasing some. At your rate, you'll probably have that many if you wait until you get back from your Wikibreak anyway. You also certainly don't need FA experience to become an admin. However, people also look to your article contributions but your work on <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sinzig.html" title="Sinzig">Sinzig</a> and <a href="../../../g/%C3%B6/t/G%C3%B6tter_Auf_Abruf_3af1.html" title="Götter Auf Abruf">Götter Auf Abruf</a> looks good to me. As mentioned previously, the other issue is time. Just ask Tawker about how people like to see time. That will probably be the only thing to get you any opposes, although I am very confident your RfA would pass. Personally, I'd love for VP to be able to integrate admin rollback and possibly a blocking mechanism. --<a href="../../../p/s/2/User%7EPS2pcGAMER_3063.html" title="User:PS2pcGAMER">PS2pcGAMER</a> (<a href="../../../p/s/2/User_talk%7EPS2pcGAMER_9645.html" title="User talk:PS2pcGAMER">talk</a>) 10:21, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I'm sure that you've seen a few examples of what the user Daveinaustin has been doing as of late, and I'd like to have a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_dbd4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">RfC</a> concerning this. Do you think you could help me out here? I'm a bit clueless as to how I should go about it.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<dd>Yes, I've seen what he's doing to the Ann Coulter article--adding POV statements and removing legitimate assertions. In looking at the page's history, he has indeed reverted three times (thus violating <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>) but as he is now inactive a block would be quite unnecessary at this time. It seems as though he's just begun this today, so I feel an <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">WP:RfC</a> would be a bit of an overkill. If he continues with this again later, you should add {{<a href="../../../3/r/r/Template%7E3RR_aefa.html" title="Template:3RR">3RR</a>}} to his talk page and if he refuses to stop then report him to an administrator (though 3RR blocks are usually short--maybe 24-48 hours). Then you may want to consider mediation or opening an RfC, but for now I'd say to just try and open up a line of communication with him and explain what's wrong with his edits. He's a very new user with a very strong opinion who hasn't quite grasped that this is an encyclopedia article rather than a persuasive essay, so make that clear to him. I'm starting my Wikibreak tomorrow, so I likely won't be able to help you if you need to take the matter further; however, I'd suggest if you continue to have problems that you contact an <a href="../../../a/d/m/WP%7EADMIN_f0df.html" title="WP:ADMIN">administrator</a> (I'd suggest <a href="../../../p/s/2/User%7EPS2pcGAMER_3063.html" title="User:PS2pcGAMER">User:PS2pcGAMER</a> as he seems very level-headed and good at dealing with newbies). I'll still be available for a couple of hours though, so I'll be able to help you out as much as I can tonight. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 06:27, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree with your removing 206.207.158.202 from the list because it has not vandalized for awhile, but you were dead wrong in calling it a content dispute, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hillary_Rodham_Clinton&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50701496" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hillary_Rodham_Clinton&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=50701496" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> and you might also want to see the rest of his contribs. <small><a href="../../../p/e/g/User%7EPegasus1138_bb01.html" title="User:Pegasus1138">Pegasus1138</a></small><sup><a href="../../../p/e/g/User_talk%7EPegasus1138_96b0.html" title="User talk:Pegasus1138">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pegasus1138_f4b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pegasus1138">Contribs</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Pegasus1138_eec2.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Pegasus1138">Email</a></sup> ---- 06:46, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, I just went to look at his contribs after you posted this and saw that he has posted the same nonsense on Hillary's article yet again (after a one hour pause ... must be passing period or something). I totally agree that such edits are vandalism, and have relisted him on AIV. I merely remarked that many of his reverted edits were content disputes as some of them appeared arguably in good faith (though closer examination of his contributions to Nader and Clinton shows that he really was just adding nonsense). The lesbian thing is outright blatant vandalism, and his constant reinsertion of it should warrant a block.

<dd>No problem, at least the vandals have a sense of humor, otherwise it would be boring...

<dd>Nope, not particularly original, though it is refreshing to see politicaly-minded vandalism as opposed to the typical "FALLOUT BOY SUCKS!" (can't get more unoriginal than that, although I have to agree).

<dd>No, not stupid at all--you were totally in the right. I just recently saw a similar situation with an AWB user, thus why I decided to look into it a bit more. You're certainly not expected to research every possible account that a user could have on every possible Wikipedia, and if a user ever complains that he has a very active account on another Wiki and you would rather I look into it, please drop me a note. I really wish that all of these accounts could become more centralized so that when a user creates an account on en, it also works on Wiktionary, de, ru, etc.--it would make life a hellofalot easier. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 22:14, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the reply&#160;:) I actually did look into his edits and even translated maybe a dozen or so and he is a good editor no doubt. I simply asked if he could do a bit more here first as he was only showing I think maybe 30 mainspace edits here (no antivan stuff) and I just wanted to be sure he had a polite manner about him in english. I would and do look at other wikis when brought to my attention but as i said just wanted to check we had no translation issues. After explaining all that to him it became obvious by his replies that this wasn't an issue in any case, so all's well that end's well&#160;:) Do you have your email enabled from wiki BTW? If not you may wanna flick it to me so you can get studying!&#160;:) you know we can hold the fort down here! lol - <i><b><a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStollery_2e3f.html" title="User:Stollery">Gl</a><font color="green">e</font><a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStollery_2e3f.html" title="User:Stollery">n</a></b></i> <i><small><sup><a href="../../../s/t/o/User_talk%7EStollery_0895.html" title="User talk:Stollery">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Stollery_ef7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Stollery">C</a></sub> <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStollery_2e3f.html" title="User:Stollery">(Stollery)</a></small></i> 23:51, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you made a good call here (+1500 edits in all namespaces means he's quite active), and edit count certainly shouldn't be the definitive standard in approving/not approving (keep in mind that it only takes two seconds to remove a user from the list if s/he abuses the tool!). I entirely trust your judgment and will leave it up to you and the other mods to decide who to accept or reject--just because I wrote the tool, I have no more say in who may or may not use it than you or any other mod (or user for that matter), and I'd hope that you'd challenge me when I make a bad call (which I'm entirely capable of!). Anyway, I completely trust your judgment, and there's no need to seek my permission to accept a user who does not entirely meet the guideline.

<dd>And, to help you in your quest for a true Wikibreak, I've added you to my VP blacklist (you're only the second non-IP editor there; having warned myself experimentally when first I got the program, I was added, and I've kept myself there, if only because oftentimes one personality will vandalize and the next will have to revert), so if I see a lot of contributions from you, I'll have to come here and castigate you. Then again, I've found that dropping out of school (in part) in order to devote one's time exclusively to Wikipedia isn't all that bad, notwithstanding, of course, that some employers, for whatever reason, seem to prefer actual college degrees to Wikipedia edit counts on a resumé. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:37, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Seems like you're really struggling to stick to your Wikibreak. My advice: pull the plug. That's the ultimate solution. All the other software blocks &amp; script blocks have workarounds. That's what I do when I really have to study. Just pull the plug, hide the extension cord, put blinders on &amp; study. It works wonderfully coz by the time you try to make the connections again you're too ashamed to go through with it!! <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_India.svg_d5a5.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/4/41/Flag_of_India.svg/20px-Flag_of_India.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_India.svg_d5a5.html" /></a><b><a href="../../../s/r/i/User%7ESrikeit_d1d6.html" title="User:Srikeit">Srik</a><font color="green">e</font><a href="../../../s/r/i/User%7ESrikeit_d1d6.html" title="User:Srikeit">it</a></b><sup><b><span style="color:#800080">(</span></b><a href="../../../s/r/i/User_talk%7ESrikeit_6c22.html" title="User talk:Srikeit"><span style="color:#18186b;cursor:help;">talk</span></a> ¦ <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Srikeit_067e.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Srikeit"><span style="color:#18186b;cursor:help;">✉</span></a><b><span style="color:#800080">)</span></b></sup> <i>04:25, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<dd>Woops, thanks for pointing that out. (This is why I shouldn't edit on Wikibreak!) It looks like it may have been an edit conflict or something--but for some reason it didn't prompt me and saved my edit in place of his, maybe a bug? Either that or I was editing an old version and didn't notice it--all I did was change 57 to 58. I'm certainly glad to hear that MoP's up to 60 supports now though!

<dd>Wow, I think I've sorted out what happened. I was messing around with my IE settings last night to block me from using WP, and somehow I set my cookies very strangely. I had noticed that my watchlist hadn't changed in hours, whereas it's usually drastically different every five seconds--then I noticed that when I edited a page it was exactly the same as when I last edited it. I tried a hard refresh when looking at my watchlist, and viola! it changed. Apparently it was loading the pages out of memory rather than retrieving them from the actual site--I've now dumped all of my cookies and all of my tifs, and I'll see if I've managed to cure the problem. There's no way I can do a hard refresh every single time I load a page lol.

<p>I see you are having a hard time... my suggestion is this... comprimise:-)</p>
<p>1) Leave new users, forums, abuse, and updating the welcome page to the "moderators".</p>
<dl>
<dd>I can respond to any question that is posted on those locations... so should any other moderator:-).</dd>
</dl>
<p>2) respond to difficult bugs that require knowledge of the source code. (like the new user list blanking) ect. respond to other bugs... but if they are really easy leave them to me and other programmers. (I am competent in this area, as I just finished a C++ "pure" arbitrary number class, <i>allows calculations with numbers as large as availible memery</i>:-)---.</p>

<dd>I'm taking a break from my Wikibreak. I just had such a pain-in-the-ass day. From 8am to 12pm, I had an English Lit exam; then, from 12-4pm, I had a German Language Exam (with no break in between for lunch!). Yesterday was 4hrs of Calc, and monday was 4hrs of English Language--now I've got one paper to wrap up for tommorow, and another project also due tomorrow--so I'm pulling an all-nighter :-).

<dd>To provide a more clear answer, Wikipedia maintains a set of <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPolicy_4cef.html" title="WP:Policy">policies and guidelines</a> that strive to acheive <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">unbiased</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, and <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMoS_1f61.html" title="WP:MoS">well-written</a> articles. The credibility of Wikipedia's articles has been the subject of much debate for exactly the same reason you provided, and it was something that made me quite uncomfortable when I first starting using Wikipedia. Essentialy, Wikipedia is able to maintain the verifiability of its articles through the sheer number of editors, the vast majority of whom are devoted to producing factually accurate and helpful articles. Many users, such as myself, spend a great deal of time identifying and reverting vandalism, as well as developing tools to aid in that task. According to a (Harvard, I believe) study on vandalism some time ago, vandalism is on average reverted within five minutes of its insertion (you can find the link somewhere on <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStatistics_2040.html" title="Wikipedia:Statistics">Wikipedia:Statistics</a>), and I believe this statistic has likely improved with the advent of tools like <a href="../../../c/d/v/WP%7ECDVF_3ebb.html" title="WP:CDVF">Vandal Fighter</a>, <a href="../../../p/o/p/WP%7EPOPUP_72b4.html" title="WP:POPUP">popups</a>, and (not meaning to gloat about my own tools) <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalProof_b972.html" title="WP:VandalProof">VandalProof</a>. There are also factions of Wikipedians committed to fact checking, though the majority of source verification is done by the numerous contributors to each article. The inability to cite a source for a fact typically results in the fact being removed, as Wikipedia does not tolerate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. The easiest way to understand how this seemingly incredulous idea of "the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit" actually manages to work is to get involved and start editing! Soon you'll come to understand how promptly inaccurate material is removed from Wikipedia (and it will likely frustrate you quite a bit when you have your first dispute over factuality). I won't deny that many articles out there aren't particularly credible, but the vast majority of articles (and especially the <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">featured articles</a>) are quite astonishingly accurate--and you can help by removing any inaccuracies you find. Thanks for your question, and I hoped this helped some. Feel free to contact me if you have any more questions, and I'll be more than glad to help. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 05:24, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hi</span></h2>
<p>Aren't you on a Wikibreak? Anyway, I was wondering something about VandalProof. I spend almost all my time nowadays reverting vandalism (especially on the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Day_5412.html" title="Green Day">Green Day</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> articles). I applied for using your VP once before, and I was denied approval because I did not have 250 edits. Now I have 249. But I read closely at what the admin sent me in my "denial" notice and it says in these exact words "... must have at least 250 <i>article</i> edits...". Now does that mean 250 edits in the article namespace or 250 edits anywhere? I was just wondering because I really want to use vandalproof. Really it looks like a great tool. Right now, I go and revert vandalism, then by the time I do that and go leave the user a warning message on his talk page, a few other people did more vandalism, which I once again must revert, warn the vandals, and so on. Cheers! <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipeedio_5ef0.html" title="User:Wikipeedio">Wikipeedio</a> 23:39, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>250 article edits is the guideline. However, if a user has shown that s/he can be trusted, the rules are a little flexible. I am a little concerned about some of your early edits, namely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Hillary_Rodham_Clinton&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47454958" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Hillary_Rodham_Clinton&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=47454958" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alan_Shepard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43206146" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alan_Shepard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=43206146" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Your recent push in fighting vandalism is commendable, but I personally feel that you could use a little more time to become familiar with Wikipedia policies and the like. AmiDaniel of course has the final say, but that is my two cents. In case you don't know about this tool, you can use <a href="../../../t/o/o/Wikipedia%7ETools_Navigation_popups_4b08.html" title="Wikipedia:Tools/Navigation popups">popups</a> to revert pages more easily. I also noticed that sometimes you'll revert vandalism but not warn the user. From an administrator's perspective, we can't block a user unless the user has been warned previously, so if you could try and do that a little more it would be appreciated. Happy editing! --<a href="../../../p/s/2/User%7EPS2pcGAMER_3063.html" title="User:PS2pcGAMER">PS2pcGAMER</a> (<a href="../../../p/s/2/User_talk%7EPS2pcGAMER_9645.html" title="User talk:PS2pcGAMER">talk</a>) 00:02, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's no problem at all! I was worried about that being a little confusing--for future reference, it will report whatever user appears in the red/yellow/green bar at the top. I'm guessing you were probably looking at a diff on the IPs talk page where I added a warning, and then clicked report. The AIV function is a little buggy in that it will re-report users if they are already listed, but in my newest version it also checks for that. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">Talk</a>) 00:12, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>Lol, I am working on the lightning bolt now... I am going to have to look over the green check marks... remember, If they are fixed, I am going archive them.

<dd>We definitely need a technical FAQ ... or a help file for that matter lmao. I'll glance through the archives once you're done, so don't worry about archiving something important.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Userfication</span></h2>
<p>One thing I noticed is that when VandalProof loads the users for approval, if the user messed up the formatting, the program goofs. Here is a possible solution using regexes, (Machine generated VB code, best I can do:-)</p>
<pre>
Public Dim Userfication as Regex = New Regex( _
    "({{user2.*?}})", _
     RegexOptions.IgnoreCase _
     Or RegexOptions.CultureInvariant _
     Or RegexOptions.IgnorePatternWhitespace _
     Or RegexOptions.Compiled _
     )
</pre>
<p><br />
This looks for {{user2|&lt;the user's name&gt;}} if it is in the user2 template the code will pick it up.

<p>Hi Ami,</p>
<p>Would it be possible to remove my messages on your page. This page came up on the google search engine near my personal website. Did not realise this was a blogg. Can you please help with some other stuff that has cropped up online.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<dd>I generally observe very strict no censorship rules on my talk page, as it serves not only as a way for others to contact me, but also as a log of my previous actions. If, for instance, the process surounding the deletion of John LeKay ever came into question, these messages would come in useful. If you feel it necessary, however, I will remove any mention of your site's web address from my talk page, but I'd prefer to keep the rest of the messages intact. You should be aware that <i>all</i> of your contributions to Wikipedia will remain on the site in some form, such as in an article's history, unless the history is deleted from the article--this is necessary to fulfill <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> requirements. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 00:30, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks Ami for instructing me, I am new to the Wiki ways and practices.

<dd>No problem at all; the intricacies of Wikipedia's processes can be quite confusing, and there's no reason to feel embarrassed for not understanding (I often find myself baffled by some of the procedures as well). I'm going to abstain from voicing my opinion in the deletion review for ethical reasons; however, I tend to agree with the others in endorsing the AfD closure. It seems to be very borderline whether or not it meets <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, but it appears to bear with it a certain autobiographical POV that I'd rather avoid. Though I'm not much of a deletionist, I'm a fairly strong believer in <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>, and I really do not like the idea of Wikipedia being used to perpetuate advertisements. As it was tagged for over a month with advert, prodded, and AfDed with no real change in form, it seems to me that the article is unlikely to ever evolve into an actual article, at least not at this time. The suggestions of a copyvio also rub me the wrong way about it; even if fair use on the text is granted from RAD, that would then further affirm my belief that the article was meant as a promotion. Nonetheless, $100m-1b definitely suggests notability, so my endorsement of the AfD closure is rather week, though I still do not feel the article should be recreated. Anyway, those are just my thoughts. Please don't let this one article get you down--just the fact that you're already involved in a deletion review suggests that you could easily become one of Wikipedia's better editors, and I certainly hope you'll continue to contribute despite this. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 06:28, 10 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Are you a control freak? Do I need to get a permission from you to create an accout on wikipedia? What about your username? What if I say your user name is highly highly inappropriate? If an article with title "tru jesus church" can be very appropriate, how come a user name "true jesus" is highly inappropriate? BTW, I don't give a shit to threat of blocking my user name. I knew 1000 ways to get around it. I have only edited a crap article "true jesus church". User Jose77 and a couple others were keep begging for the article translation. They bug me and my friends too. What do you I should do such article? Translate it saying "True jesus church" is the only true church and others are crap? Should I say that if you go to true jesus church, you can fly in the air. There is no necessity of car, bus, plane or anything.. Is that what you think? Does such article deserve any place in wikipedia. Did you do anything to stop it? I am not even warning you. Lets see if you keep, or delete my comment.</p>

<p>Your AN/I note raises, IMHO, some interesting questions apropos of this user. I certainly don't think his user name to be particularly disruptive (I am generally of the view that all user names should be permitted, inasmuch as I cannot imagine that valuable contributors would ever allow their imputing impropriety to a user name to disrupt the collaborative editing process, if only because I would necessarily infer intellectual infirmity from one's inability to cope with a user name he/she finds offensive, but I know that my beliefs don't command community support), even as a different user name might lend itself to better community interaction. I think the user certainly has been altogether trollish in his/her contributions, and I think a short block is likely in order. Because the user is relatively new, he/she may change his/her ways (as you well note on the user's talk page) and become a good editor; the fact of the user's user name and the singularity of his/her contributions, though, suggest an intent to troll/disrupt and lead one to fear that good faith is not present. You might be able to find support for an "exhausting the community's patience" indef block, but I think perhaps a 24-hr block might be in order, after which perhaps an RfC would be in order should disruption continue (I suppose one only needs to go that route, though, if the community doesn't think an indef block to be appropriate; here, since the user has shown no intention or capability to contribute productively, the community might quickly find its patience exhausted). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 21:58, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I totally agree with that decision. My issue with the username is honestly not so much that it may offend someone, but rather that it shows his trollish nature (especially since the articles he has been trolling have had similar names). I think a short block is quite necessary right now, if anything just to make it known that all of these warnings have not been jokes. I usually tend to oppose indefinite blocks on the grounds that I feel everyone is capable of change, and I would only support an indef username block (not necessarily an indefinite <i>ban</i>) if he continued with the same degree (or greater) of trolling after the block expires.

Currently the program is not recognizing my user name as a moderator. As such the program does not always recognize some of the changes I make to the VP official welcom page. (you know what I am talking about). This problem has been documented on <a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_VP_Bugs_a09a.html#Moderator_update_is_not_working" title="User talk:AmiDaniel/VP/Bugs">User talk:AmiDaniel/VP/Bugs#Moderator update is not working</a>. I request a "Null" edit to that page, The reason is a user I added is having problems logging in.</p>
<dl>
<dd>To do a "Null" edit, just make a minute change to the page and save. Then it will accept all previous changes made to it. (which are my additions) Thanks<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> <a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a> 20:45, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>P.S. this message is going out to all moderators on at this time of day.</dd>

<p>No longer needed, I posted this becuase I figured you would be on, agianst your wikibreak:-(<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> <a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a> 22:25, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Thank you, just as I suspected</span></h2>
<p>fisrt off... back to the usual. (you getting an edit conflict:-)</p>
<p>Second, thank you for confirming that, I suspected that you did that on purpose:-) No matter what, you have connect to the internet with an open browser, and you would rather your program work on connecting to the internet and checking the approved list, rather than generating some fancy graphic:-). I have done this also for similar reasons on programs of my own:-).</p>
<dl>
<dd>Just curious, but am I really that good to you that you will watch my user page?? I am baffled.<a href="../../../e/a/g/User%7EEagle_101_bfb5.html" title="User:Eagle 101">Eagle</a> <a href="../../../e/a/g/User_talk%7EEagle_101_4fc4.html" title="User talk:Eagle 101">talk</a> 23:50, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Though I watch yours, it is one out of 6 distinct userpages I watch:-)</dd>
