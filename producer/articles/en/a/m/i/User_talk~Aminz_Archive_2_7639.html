<p>Hi, Aminz,</p>
<p>I'll take another look at Apostasy in Islam tonight and see if there isn't some way to keep your text while solving Jibran and Pecher's objections. Since it's not contested (is it?) that it's good data, and it's squarely on-topic, the only question should be where and how it should it appear in the article.Timothy Usher 20:29, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>Speaking only for myself: it strikes to me that one of Pecher's goals (besides contributing easrnestly and with accuracy which you both share) is to prevent unpleasant truths from being swept under the rug by editors who are either motivated by piety, an unwillingness to look truth in the face or the goal of hiding possibly negative information from others. There are certainly editors who proceed in this way. In this respect, he's doing WP (and the world) a great service. However, I think him somewhat too quick to assume that this is where other editors are coming from, and I'd agree with you that he can be over-zealous in this regard. Re dealings between the two of you, it seems you feel his underlying motive to be attacking your religion and background, and react accordingly. When you do, he sees you as one who would sweep things under the rug, and a revert war has begun.</dd>

<p>I think the Qur'anic verse uses nabiyyin rather than anbiya. Am I right? What is the difference? --Aminz 08:37, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>actually, you're right about the Quran. And that's why there's so much on the web about what it means: it's not really clear, meaning the 'seal of the prophet', not prophets, which would be anbiya. But this latter is the term that scores of Muslims have used with me (when talking in Arabic): I'd never heard the one with nabi(yyin). But it certainly is out there. I guess that when speaking Arabic people use a term which is clearer, even if it's not a direct quote. When speaking another language, using an unclear Arabic term is less of a problem. --<a href="../../../d/r/m/User%7EDrmaik_74d1.html" title="User:Drmaik">Drmaik</a> 21:00, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>But Qur'an uses "nabiyyin" in other places to mean the "prophets" (va en akhaza allah misagha al-nabiyyin...) nabiyyin is not singular. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 21:08, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Could you give me the reference there. I'm guessing you're representing something like 'wa in akhadha allah mithaqa al-nabiyyin", which would mean something like 'and if God took the covenant of the prophet', but I can't find the reference. --<a href="../../../d/r/m/User%7EDrmaik_74d1.html" title="User:Drmaik">Drmaik</a> 06:02, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It appears in for example 3:81; 3:80. The translation reads:</dd>
<dd>"Behold! Allah took the covenant of the prophets, saying: "I give you a Book and Wisdom; then comes to you an apostle, confirming what is with you; do ye believe in him and render him help." Allah said: "Do ye agree, and take this my Covenant as binding on you?" They said: "We agree." He said: "Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses." --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminz_b269.html" title="User:Aminz">Aminz</a> 06:12, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks. The problem comes from writing Arabic in Roman: I checked the verse in Arabic, and sure enough, you're right, I'm wrong. It should have a long vowel (two ya's at the end, followed by nun), which hasn't been represented. Arabs call him khatam al-anbiya (I've been able to double check that today), but there seem to be 2 plurals for nabi: at least I've learnt something, and thank you for pointing out my error politely. --<a href="../../../d/r/m/User%7EDrmaik_74d1.html" title="User:Drmaik">Drmaik</a> 23:02, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello Amin,</p>
<p>About your request: I can understand why you want concrete citation from a publication, but unfortunately most of what I have written has been obtained directly from scholars' duroos(I study under traditional scholars besides being a comp.science major), and as such I cannot provide exact instances for which links may be provided. I do not believe citation is particularly valuable in the part I added due to the rather mainstream acceptance of this ideology in dealing with "criticism" from non-muslims concerning the religion of Islam itself.</p>
<p>Good work on the page.</p>

<p>My interest in <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> is, I was alerted to this page when a "new" anon user warned Tom harrison about 3RR - suspicious - and when I looked at the history, there is one user with a whole bunch of sockpuppets performing around nine reverts/day. My issue here is more with the sockpuppetry than with the content.</p>
<p>Although now it's looking like talk page flooding, wouldn't you say? I've not seen anyone do this vs. Islam (a list of casualties?), and if we did, we could safely conclude it off-topic (unless the article were entitled "Atrocities of Islam" or the like?)</p>
<p>Islam is much more relevant to current events, and to Middle Eastern politics, another of my interests, and again very relevant to the world.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I agree with Arsath/Mystic's points above. It just goes to show that we are doomed if we give up our own God-given moral judgement in favor of someone else's moral failure, simply because the latter was written down a long time ago. It must be seen as a conversation. I do *not* follow atheists in dismissing the whole endeavor as a sham. Rather, it is like scholarship, to be seriously and skeptically engaged, with due but not undue respect for precedent. Fundamentalists say, change nothing (even when they're changing things). Atheists say, throw out all this good work. Neither is a reasonable approach to knowledge. Timothy Usher 09:50, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

The anti-text submarine is hard at work - take a look. It's not all one-way. There's a lot of irrelevant preaching in this article.Timothy Usher 10:43, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry I've not responded - for some reason I'm simply exhausted, even at this relatively early hour. By anti-text submarine, a phrase I coined just the other day, I only meant I am roaming the WP oceans looking for superfluous text to sink.Timothy Usher 07:40, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>1) <a href="../../../q/u/r/Template%7EQuran-usc_913b.html" title="Template:Quran-usc">Template:Quran-usc</a> has been altered in two respects:</p>
<dl>
<dd>a) it’s no longer required to input three digits - this is automated thanks to <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturner</a>.</dd>
<dd>b) the template no longer includes “Qur’an” in the bluelighted display. Editor may choose to write it or not (or “Sura”, or “verse”, etc.) according to context.</dd>
<dd>c) thus the “-num” variants are redundant and should not be used.</dd>
</dl>
<p>2) The “range display” problem is still not solved - more information coming soon.</p>
<p>3) <a href="../../../b/u/k/Template%7EBukhari-usc_b6f2.html" title="Template:Bukhari-usc">Template:Bukhari-usc</a> is operative, with three variables (volume, book, hadith), and automated tridigitation as per Quran-usc.</p>
<p>4) Template:Quran-usc-num, Template:Quran-usc-numrange and Template:Buhari are defunct and should be deleted.Timothy Usher 07:38, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Hey, thank <a href="../../../j/o/t/User%7EJoturner_23fb.html" title="User:Joturner">joturner</a>, too! He solved the annoying zero problem. It's now okay to freely use the basic Qur'an and Bukhari templates. These won't change. Hold off, though, where we have ranges.</p>
<p>Muwatta coming soon...Timothy Usher 08:20, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Tom made the original Qur'an template, as you know. I created the four options. Joturner said we didn't need four, we talked it over and mutually decided to toss the two with "Qur'an" in the display. Joturner solved the zero problem with <a href="../../../t/h/r/Template%7EThree_digit_0268.html" title="Template:Three digit">Template:three digit</a> and I added his solution to the templates. I went around to all the articles in which it appeared (excepting talk pages) and changed it manually, to make sure zeros weren't there and that Qur'an was written where appropriate. Arsath made a Buhari template. I made a Bukhari-usc template that pointed us to the right verse, and incorporating joturners zero fix. I think Arsath has a new version of Buhari now, with the full language, "Sahih Bukhari volume X, book Y, verse Z", whereas my Bukhari-usc template displays just X:Y:Z. That's the whole story.Timothy Usher 08:44, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the barnstar. My contribution was just to copy the Bible-verse template. Timothy Usher worked a lot on it, Joturner added some clever stuff, others fixed and extended, and progress continues. It's gratifying to see the wiki system working so well.

Your cite is an improvement. Look at what's being said here; his nickname is hardly the main point. If one had to sum it up in a few words, it's, "Muhammad helped repair the Kaaba," as per Zora.Timothy Usher 10:05, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Was he also called “the chosen one” and “the messenger” as a youth? Similarly with the book. No number of links of this sort can prove that he was called that before he began preaching, and Lord knows the Meccans weren’t calling him that once he’d begun. All it does is show what we already knew, that Muslims call him this now.</p>
<p>All the “Revelation” says is, “Among his people he had already earned the name Al-Amin, The Trustworthy.” I didn’t say I’d never *heard* this, only that I’d never heard it *substantiated*, and I still haven’t.</p>

<p>I am not on 3RR, and would not allow myself to be given Anonymous editor's record of transparently unfair decisions in this regard (re Netscott). Please provide the diffs though, in case I'm mistaken.</p>
<p>Can't believe you gave him a barnstar - for what, freezing McKhan's anti-Habashi screed? For freezing MOU's sock-puppet version of Islamism? Every administrative action I've seen on his part has been wrongly decided, all cutting in the same direction, and he has barely any presence on the talk pages, and edits from above, reverting changes he doesn't like without explanation. That's what I've seen so far, at least.Timothy Usher 04:49, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Seriously? First Netscott violated the 3rr, I didn't, and I was not the one that blocked him so I don't see what I have to do with it. Same thing with Al Abash. Aminz asked for the page to be frozen because of the reverting. I am not allowed to pick which version I like before freezing it. Same with the Islamism page, it's not my duty to figure out who the sockpuppet is or which version I like. So please learn about the what exactly editing on wikipedia is before accusing editors that have edited a lot more than you. Aminz must have been in a very good mood to give you one, you obviously need to learn a lot more. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 23:32, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That was normal for me to do that (in fact I actually would prefer to do that to all of the articles you've edited on since) based upon the bad faith you demonstrated after the Allah/God question was seemingly settled. I honestly think that the name <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a> should be included more frequently as opposed to <i>less</i> so that people can become more accustomed to what that name truly represents rather than have the false prejudices that <i>hiding</i> that name tends to further. To me reducing instances of the use of <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a> would tend to denote <i>shame</i> and embarassment about it which imho is <b>very</b> wrong. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 09:15, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually it would make an excellent demonstration of good faith on your part if you were to self-revert your own edits to before you touched any article relative to the Allah/God changes. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 09:17, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Once your bad faith was evident (which don't forget you've apologized for) I then proceeded to just revert your edits outright. Afterwards, I did not break any compromise but I merely reverted in good faith to versions I believed to be correct. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott">Netscott</a> 09:22, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you truly believed in the accord we supposedly reached on <a href="../../../d/e/p/Depictions_of_Muhammad_33b0.html" title="Depictions of Muhammad">Depictions of Muhammad</a> then you would have continued editing in that fashion on subsequent articles. But since <b>you did not believe</b> in that accord you went back to your normal appearingly bad faith editing. You actually demonstrated your bad faith twice. Once by returning to the straight Allah-&gt;God editing you were doing prior to our conflict and twice by saying that you didn't want to make such edits on <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremygbyrne_1e51.html" title="User:Jeremygbyrne">User:Jeremygbyrne</a>'s talk page and you were only doing so <i>temporarily</i>.

<dd>I hadn't realised you were the one who started the changes; I thought Netscott had kicked it off on his own. Hmm... It is a somewhat provocative move, although I respect your reasoning. Perhaps if you waited until there was a legitimate reason to change an article, it might go over better. (I personally prefer to use "[[Allah|God]]", which provides the inquisitive reader with specific information without making the claim that there's a difference.) Otherwise, this is something likely to end in mediation, I imagine. — <a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJeremygbyrne_1e51.html" title="User:Jeremygbyrne">JEREMY</a> 08:43, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree that [[Allah|God]] is a deceptive edit, deliberately or not. This kind of thing is all too frequent on Islam-related pages.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The underlying problem is the <a href="../../../f/o/r/WP%7EFORK_4e79.html" title="WP:FORK">POV forked</a> articles, which force us to decide between the forks. It's a problem everywhere it comes up. The solution is to change such edits to [[God]], under which there is a section for and a link to the Islamic concept of God. It is very wrongheaded to assert that Muslim readers ought be able to navigate through shared Abrahamic concepts without ever confronting non-Muslim POVs, as is increasingly the case thanks to the growing number of Arabic-titled forks.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is one case where <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a> is warranted, and this is: "The Arabic term for God is <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a>", and permutations thereof. [[Allah|God]] is never warranted, except as an awkward and unintended artifact of the POV forks. Timothy Usher 08:53, 29 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Further, merging the articles at least where links are concerned will direct Muslim editors to the English-titled pages, where they will hopefully removed unnoted POV.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The intros to Abrahamic articles ought be utterly neutral re all major Abrahamic religions. From there, we should proceed from Jewish to Christian to Islamic views, as per chronological order. Where daughter articles are needed, so they are, but links must be to the main article except where the argument for doing otherwise is very compelling.</dd>

<dd>Thanks. However, where this is a direct quote from a translator, we cannot change it without compromising the integrity of citation. I'm sure you can appreciate this.

<p>Aminz, you put a "Totally disputed" tag on it, but you didn't put anything on the talk page about why you had done so. What is WRONG with the folklore section? Surely you know that not all scholars accept all stories about Muhammad, and that many stories shade off into pure folklore, that may be believed by villagers, not scholars.</p>
<p>Any religion has its folklore. There's lots and lots of Christian folklore. I'm not all that conversant with Buddhist folklore, since I belong to a group that's new to the US, no folkloric traditions yet, and most of us tend to have BAs or higher.

<p>Now that I'm concentrating on this article, I see that the intro doesn't sufficiently account for Muslim POV. Beyond keeping non-Muslim editors away from the Halal articles, the gratuitous forks direct Muslim editors away from the main "Judeo-Christian" (as it seems there are not many disputes here) articles. This should change. Both articles need more traffic.Timothy Usher 09:42, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Re veneration of Arabic words, it's no different than the idea that <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a> was God's (and history's) original language: transparent ethnic chauvenism, which thanks to a history of conquest, others (e.g. Persians) have internalized.

<p>Thanks, Aminz. I must reserve comment for now, lest I say something I'll regret. But thank you, for giving it real thought, and for having the balls to stick up for me when I'm under attack.Timothy Usher 05:03, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks. It's very important, and it's obvious that many editors simply won't trust any judgement of a non-Muslim.</p>
<p>In the meantime, might you take a look at <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a>, "my" version (heaven knows there is much which still needs improvement) in the diffs, and AE's version, and tell me which you think better? If you think mine an improvement, please revert to it. It's your right to do so, if you agree.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it is futile to make any more improvements to articles, as AE is following me around and reverting all my changes wholesale.</p>
<p>According to his recent posts, it is <i>my problem</i> if Qur'anic quotes are unlinked, pointing to the wrong verse or otherwise inaccurate. It is <i>my problem</i> whether the sentences make sense, whether narratives are coherent, whether paragraphs consist of dozens of unrelated clauses joined at random, etc.</p>
<p>Shame about the readers, shame about Qur'an and Hadith, shame about the articles, shame about wikipedia. All my problem.</p>
<p>And it's <i>my responsibility</i> to make these changes again and again while he edit wars from above, while he has no responsibility to read the article, or to look up terms such as "etymology" in the dictionary before deciding what material belongs in a section with this title.</p>

<p>AE and I are both on two; sad that it's even gone this far. I, at least, am always available on talk. I see no reason why his reverts should be considered any more sacred than mine. He suggests that because he's an admin, I have to relent in the face of his careless (not bothering to distinguish between uncontroversial and disputed improvements) reverts.</p>
<p>I've held back on restoring the redirects, as per his threats. However, I've yet to see any substantiation of the rule he says prevents translating Arabic-language article titles into English. I'll give him a bit to inform me before I start restoring the English-language title.Timothy Usher 09:47, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I said it is blockable to move pages around arbitrarily, as is blanking articles and redirecting them without agreement. I never said I would block you either, assuming that is going pretty far. Many editors have done it before. Stop assuming bad faith and take it as a friendly warning. And please get rid of your belief that no one edited the articles before you and that all your edits are making it better. Saying that your changes should be kept because they are the best thing that ever happened to wikipedia is pov. That's ignorant of all the editors that have been editing this for years and have worked on it longer than you. And I'm warning you again that arbitrary actions are not to work on Wikipedia. Otherwise everyone could go an redirect to whatever they wanted, move pages, etc. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 02:04, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Though I've asked several times, you've offered me no evidence that your warnings are based on policy. And, as explained on <a href="../../../j/e/s/Talk%7EJesus_in_Islam_e6b4.html" title="Talk:Jesus in Islam">Talk:Jesus in Islam</a>, it is an abuse of the English language to declare my redirect "arbitrary."Timothy Usher 04:34, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you are denying that they were arbitrary then you have to learn what the word means. You changed the article with over 20 to 30 edits including a page move and all the name changes when you were involved and knew about the disagreement on the talk page. If you made 20 to 30 changes all of a sudden, move a page, and completely ignore discussion on the talk page where people disagree with you, would that not be arbitrary? This is not allowed in wikipedia and I was politely warning you. You were lucky that I warned you before you did it anymore. And you did the same thing on Jibril and even called it rule-breaking. You knew you were breaking the rules. If I do that same thing and move pages around then you wouldn't call it arbitrary? --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 04:38, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>“And you did the same thing on Jibril and even called it rule-breaking.” -Please check the history. The only editors on the talk page - the second and third respectively - were Aminz and I.</li>
<li>“You were lucky that I warned you before you did it anymore.” - That was very generous of you. It would be still more generous if you could direct me to the policy to which you refer.</li>

<dd>Can't believe how many excuses you are making up for clearly arbitrary actions. Here's rule-breaking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jibril&amp;diff=50867042&amp;oldid=50866841" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jibril&amp;diff=50867042&amp;oldid=50866841" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. And Timothy this really is your only warning. Editors are blocked for moving pages arbitrarily and blanking pages every day. I am sure if I ignored discussion and did the same thing, you'll see how arbitrary the actions are. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 05:14, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As wikipedia provides instructions for redirects (which I followed), as as several of these pages have been thusly redirected in the past, redirection is clearly not prohibited. Perhaps there's some other policy you might be thinking of?</dd>

<dd>As the history shows very clearly - and as I'm sure you knew - the "rule" referred to in this diff was the redirect protocols, which don't allow redirects to sections, only to articles. I included the section syntax in case section redirects were ever enabled (as they ought to be). Anything else you'd like to discuss?Timothy Usher 05:17, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That's a pretty silly excuse Timothy, but I'll assume good faith. However your actions on Isa don't need any discussion. Moving a page, changing all the names, and editing it several times despite discussion is clearly arbitrary and will never result in any of your edits being taken any more seriously -not that they are currently- and I don't know why you're denying it. Should I do the same thing? Would that not be arbitrary? --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonymous_editor_003d.html" title="User:Anonymous editor"><font color="green"><b>a.n.o.n.y.m</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonymous_editor_95c5.html" title="User talk:Anonymous editor"><i>t</i></a></sup> 05:24, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
