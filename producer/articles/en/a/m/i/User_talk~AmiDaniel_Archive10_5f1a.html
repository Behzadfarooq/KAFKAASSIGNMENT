Things have been much better since you blocked one participant of a revert war about a week ago but it's creeping back up again. This time it's Dilip and Samuel that are close if not over.

<dd>No problem, and I agree entirely.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Blocking of 82.36.241.165</span></h2>
<p>Hi. You might like to have a closer look at the edits being done by 82.36.241.165. This user has been blocked several times already by several admins, but is still carrying on with a campaign of vandalizing edits. The earlier blcok have had little effect. Do you think it's time for a longer ban now? --MichaelMaggs 04:56, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, the IP address is a shared IP registered to Telewest Broadband, and it's quite likely that there are multiple users connect through the IP. Thus there are twenty or so vandals causing all this mess, but possibly hundreds of legitimate editors whom we don't want to disable from editing. In any case, the person I blocked tonight quite likely is not the same person who got blocked the last time. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 11:02, 11 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Mail Order Bride</span></h2>
<p>Michaellovesnyc 15:09, 12 June 2006 (UTC) michaellovesnyc - Why is it that anti Mail Order Bride propaganda is allowed such as 3 incidents of abuse (out of 50,000+ murders during the same period) while 1. Demographics from the CIA factbook is allowed to be deleted 2. Murder statistics of Russian women cited from Pravda.ru is allowed to be deleted 3. The response from a person accused of a crime is allowed to be deleted - a direct response 4. The origin of the word which is cited is allowed to be deleted.</p>
<p>How can these entries with substantial cites be allowed to be deleted but the antecdotal stories of abuse are allowed to remain? The point of view is biased and unfair. I ask the moderators to review my article versus this version and tell me how my article is not fair. There was never any consensus to delete demographics; I do not think a 2 to 2 vote with one split is a consensus.</p>

<p>Here is what my article had that they deleted. I think it is a better article that is well cited without POV or antectodatal stories. Please let me know what you honestly think in all fairness versus the current article which I feel is heavy handed POV and antectdotal. Thank you.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">EasyPizza dispute</span></h2>
<p>If you feel that doing so would be appropriate, could you contribute to the EasyPizza dispute? Any opinion on the matter is fine. I'd send the whole debate to a User Conduct RfC, but it requires two editors to try to resolve the dispute and so far it appears Politakis and I are the only two people debating this. Perhaps another person's input can make the formal process unnecessary. Even if not, thanks for your time spent on this. <a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowercase_608d.html" title="User:Lowercase"><span style="color:#09f">lowercase</span></a> 21:19, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would gladly participate in the dispute and any user conduct RfC you decided to file. I remember there being a few other users who got involved too, whom I can find by glancing through my archives.

<dd>Let me go about getting a sysop account on that wiki, and I'll see if I can get VP tweaked to work on it. Note however, that I don't have many sysop tools right now, just blocking. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 22:22, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, now it will be moved to a 24/7 location hosted by xyrael. You should make it so you can run vandalproof on many different wikis. Different language wikis would be different, because they use different templates, and it would be a hassle to translate, but other english wikis should be easy. It should be so at the click of a button, you can either use VP on WP or the commons instead of having to tweak it every time somebody wants to run it on another wiki. Or you can import the RC's from both and use VP on both at the same time (but that might be harder).

<dd>Yes, it most certainly will =D. I've actually had blocking working on test.wikipedia for quite some time, and today I decided to try it out on en.

<dd>Yeah, I could probably implement something along those lines--not really all that difficult actually. Oh, and just so you know, since I'm going interwiki with this next release, I'm now reworking the whole approval process. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_VandalProof_7963.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel/VandalProof">User talk:AmiDaniel/VandalProof</a> will likely soon be replaced by <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_VP_Approval_27a2.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/VP/Approval">User:AmiDaniel/VP/Approval</a>, the userlist will now be hosted at <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_VP_L_72cc.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/VP/L">User:AmiDaniel/VP/L</a>, and the mod list at <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_VP_Mods_f490.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/VP/Mods">User:AmiDaniel/VP/Mods</a>.

<dd>Well ... yes, I agree.

<dd>I think ultimately it is up to you, I can't see any reason for it not be there, especially if it would be interwiki. On an unrelated note; would it be <b>possible</b> for someone who is a sysop, but not you, to edit <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_VP_Mods_f490.html" title="User:AmiDaniel/VP/Mods">User:AmiDaniel/VP/Mods</a>, and have it affect the program?

<dd>Currently, yes, any sysop can edit it and have their changes actualized--it would be quite easy for me to change this, in fact absolutely painless; however, I think I'm going to leave it that way. Especially when VP goes live on other projects, I likely won't be around all the time, and it may be necessary for a sysop to step in and change the mods list. Also, if for some unforseeable reason, I'm no longer able edit Wikipedia or continue the project further, I think it would be quite beneficial if any sysop would be able to adjust mod lists in my absence should that ever be necessary. If we're willing to trust sysops with the block button, I think I should be able to trust them with deciding who can / cannot modify VP's user list :). <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 00:53, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're going to have to wait like everyone else, and it's also not just like I push a couple of buttons and voila! it works on every wiki. You're going to have to give me some time, and your request is relatively low priority, no offense. Also, the admin tools aren't really that amazing, currently only blocking and warning a user in one click. As for using Where's Wiki, I'm afraid much rather do my bot testing on the dev Wiki, since it runs off the NFS copy it is almost identical to en (other than the occasional system message here and there), whereas Where's is quite different, though none the less fun to play on :). <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 02:29, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hey Eagle! Glad to see you're back--kinda disappeared for a while. Anyway, thanks for your offer. I was under the impression that C was quite a multiplatform language--what on earth do those Apple people program in?!? Anyway, I'm going to look into this RealBASIC thing and see how difficult a "translation" would be. I really wish I had begun this entire project in C, but it was one of these things that began as righting a simple little RC patrol script, and then grew and grew and grew until it was too late to begin it in C. I dunno, we'll see. I think I'm going to focus my energy currently on getting 1.3 out and getting it operational on other wikis right now; the mac experience will have to wait. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 03:43, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks. Judging from the responce from DRV I should have just come straight to you.  :-) But after having done some resarch I'm not sure that I even want it.

<dd>Well, I would recommend that, if you'd like to attempt recreating the article, you begin it somewhere in your userspace (either building it from scratch or working off the deleted content of the article), and once you feel it has matured into a full and unique article, I'd recommend you return to DRV and present your new version in your userspace and see if the community supports moving your version into mainspace. If you recreate it at its original location, no matter how unique it is, I can't guarantee that it wouldn't be deleted under G4.

<dd>Woohoo! Thanks for the congrats ... I honestly never thought this project would reach a quarter of the size it has. It just keeps growing and growing and growing -- hopefully even larger once I get the interwiki projects thrown together. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 08:08, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not infallible either, but somewhow I was not able to contribute to the debate on deletion of the Ajit Someswar article, perhaps because I haven't been around the wiki world for long enough. Someone in that debate gratuitously referred to me as a rank beginner, which I found amusing given more than forty years experience in msjor media, college teaching and authorship. The point I was trying to make is that we massively over-represent westerners (and I'm one) - some 14,000 'American bios' for example, versus about 4,000 for India and China combined. I'm concerned about both cultural and racial bias in these steadily accumulating decisions, call them the wiki weltanschaung if you like. Maybe this particular subject needs to get his book finished before he's allowed into the portals, but there are other substantial contributions he has made to the Indo-Canadian community, very few of whom are represented in Wikipedia, and some of whom are quite distinguished. I'd like to suggest a reversal of the deletion: what the hell is a 'vanity page' if the entire enterprise isn't about vanity? (will you refer these comments wherever you think appropriate?)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry that you didn't get a chance to contribute to the AfD discussion; however, if you would like to reopen the debate again, you may gladly seek a <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a>. If you need any help with this, I will be more than glad to assist you. I assure that that the individual who refered to you as a "rank beginner" was not refering to your professional career, but to your experience on Wikipedia, and as for the article being a vanity page, you may want to read over <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>, which details the commonly accepted idea on Wikipedia that articles should not be authored by the individuals which they discuss. Furthermore, should you choose not pursue a deletion review or should that fail, I will gladly <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSERFY_518d.html" title="WP:USERFY">userfy</a> the article to your userspace if you would like, where you can gladly continue to work on the article and perhaps pursuade others to allow the page a place in the main article namespace. Again, I apologize for the inconvenience and for your not having a chance to participate in the discussion, and please let me know if there's anything I can do for you. <a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmiDaniel_52f1.html" title="User:AmiDaniel">AmiDaniel</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmiDaniel_e20b.html" title="User talk:AmiDaniel">talk</a>) 03:52, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think I have. It's just your userpage gets vandalized so many times, I can't find a diff. This was only the second time my page was vandalized, and the first time was by my brother, so that one doesn't really count. So basically, my userpage only got vandalized once. I guess vandals don't like me. --<font size="1"><a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeMoney_583b.html" title="User:GeorgeMoney">GeorgeMoney</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeMoney_8d9f.html" title="User talk:GeorgeMoney">T</a>·<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GeorgeMoney_d771.html" title="Special:Contributions/GeorgeMoney">C</a></sup></font> 06:08, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
