Before the Middle Ages(i.e. approximately before the <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edict_of_Milan_565a.html" title="Edict of Milan">Edict of Milan</a> in 313), the Christians, in contrast to the Jews, were often persecuted by the Roman state. <sup id="_ref-Kessler_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kessler" title="">[1]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup> <sup id="_ref-Contemporary_Civilization_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Contemporary_Civilization" title="">[3]</a></sup> While Jews were recognized as the members of a legal association(if not enjoying the status of members of a national community), Christians on the other hand were often persecuted. At least before 249, the legal ground for this persecution may be "buried deep within Roman bureaucratic operations." It seems that the persecuters were doing so without knowing the precise reason for doing that. <sup id="_ref-Kessler_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Kessler" title="">[1]</a></sup> "Despite persecution, however Christianity spread with rapidity throughout the Mediterrahean,"<sup id="_ref-Contemporary_Civilization_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Contemporary_Civilization" title="">[3]</a></sup> but "not until A.D. 300 was Christianity effectively represented throughout Roman Empire" <sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Under the Muslim rule, Christians were allowed to "practice their religion, subject to certain conditions, and to enjoy a measure of communal autonomy" and guaranteed their personal safety and security of property, in return for paying tribute to Muslims and acknowledging Muslim supremacy.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[5]</a></sup> Christians rarely faced martydom or exile, or forced compulsion to change their religion, and with certain exceptions they were free in their choice of residence and profession. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[6]</a></sup> Various restrictions and legal disabilities were placed on Dhimmis, such as prohibitions against bearing arms or giving testimony in courts in cases involving Muslims.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[7]</a></sup> Most of these disabilities had a social and symbolic rather than a tangible and practical character.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Taxation and social and legal disabilities were the concerns of Christians under the Muslim rule:</p>
<p>A <a href="../../../p/e/r/Per_capita.html" title="Per capita">per capita</a> <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax.html" title="Tax">tax</a>, known as <a href="../../../j/i/z/Jizya.html" title="Jizya">jizya</a>, was imposed on adult Christian males who were neither old nor sick nor monks <sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[9]</a></sup> Although, the change from Byzantine and Persian rule to Arab rule lowered taxes and created greater religious freedom, and was welcomed by some Jews and Christians, nevertheless the taxation was a concern for non-Muslims who were paying a higher tax than the <i>zakat</i> tax paid by Muslims. It was also an important factor persuading many Christians to convert to Islam, though during the first century after the Arab conquest of Syria and Palestine conversion to Islam was not encourage "partly because the taxation constituted an important source of state revenue".<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[10]</a></sup> Scholars differ as to the exact burden imposed by the <i>jizya</i> tax. Documentary evidence, including that found in eleventh-century <a href="../../../c/a/i/Cairo_Geniza_1fdd.html" title="Cairo Geniza">Cairo Geniza</a> documents, suggest that the burden, at least for the poorer classes, was heavy. As the taxation amount was fixed in gold, it became less burdensome over the centuries. <sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>The legal disabilities for example included invalidity of their testimonies in courts in cases involving Muslims under the <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanafi.html" title="Hanafi">Hanafi</a> jurists (Christians were operating their own courts following their own legal systems in cases that did not involve other religious groups, or capital offences or threats to public order). Oaths sworn by dhimmis in the Muslim courts were sometimes the same as the oaths taken by Muslims, sometimes tailored to the dhimmisâ€™ beliefs. <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>The social disabilities included discriminations such as requirement of distinctive clothing, ban on riding horses or camels(they were only allowed to ride donkeys). The requirement of distinctive clothing (see <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_badge.html" title="Yellow badge">yellow badge</a>), had its origin in early medieval Baghdad and was the most degrading of the regulations, although its enforcement was highly erratic. <sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>The position of Christians under the Muslim rule was that of inferior status however in most respects their position was "was very much easier than that of non-Christians or even of heretical Christians in medieval Europe"<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Christians have frequently suffered from persecution. During the first three centuries of its existence, Christianity was regarded with suspicion and persecuted in the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>, mainly unofficially, but also sometimes officially. Adherence to Christianity was declared illegal, and, especially in the <a href="../../../3/r/d/3rd_century.html" title="3rd century">3rd century</a>, the government demanded that their subjects (the Jews only excepted) sacrifice to the Emperor as a divinity â€” a practice that Christianity (along with Judaism) rejected. <sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[15]</a></sup>State persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire is taken to have ended with the <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edict_of_Milan_565a.html" title="Edict of Milan">Edict of Milan</a><sup id="_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#_note-13" title="">[16]</a></sup>, but it persisted or even intensified in other places, such as <a href="../../../s/a/s/Sassanids.html" title="Sassanids">Sassanid Persia</a><sup id="_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#_note-14" title="">[17]</a></sup>, and later under <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a><sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[18]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>There was some persecution of Christians after the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolution_970a.html" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> during the attempted <a href="../../../d/e/c/Dechristianisation_of_France_during_the_French_Revolution_ee64.html" title="Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution">Dechristianisation of France</a>.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[19]</a></sup> State restrictions on Christian practices today are generally associated with those authoritarian governments which either support a majority religion other than Christianity (as in <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> states<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[20]</a></sup>), or tolerate only churches under government supervision, sometimes while officially promoting state <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheism.html" title="Atheism">atheism</a> (as in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korea_2774.html" title="North Korea">North Korea</a>). For example, the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">People's Republic of China</a> allows only government-regulated churches and has regularly suppressed <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_churches.html" title="House churches">house churches</a> or underground Catholics. The public practice of Christianity is outlawed in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Status_of_religious_freedom_in_Saudi_Arabia_452a.html" title="Status of religious freedom in Saudi Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>. On a smaller scale, Greek and Russian governmental restrictions on non-Orthodox religious activity occur today.</p>
<p>Complaints of <a href="../../../d/i/s/Discrimination.html" title="Discrimination">discrimination</a> have also been made by Christians in various other contexts. In some parts of the world, there is persecution of Christians by dominant religious groups or political groups. Many Christians are threatened, discriminated, jailed, or even killed for their faith. Christians are persecuted today in many areas of the world including <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_East_c1c7.html" title="Middle East">Middle East</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korea_2774.html" title="North Korea">North Korea</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China_82bf.html" title="People's Republic of China">China</a>, the <a href="../../../s/u/d/Sudan.html" title="Sudan">Sudan</a>, and <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosovo.html" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>. <a href="http://www.gfa.org/gfa/latestnews" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gfa.org/gfa/latestnews" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://news.amnesty.org/index/ENGAFR640172005" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.amnesty.org/index/ENGAFR640172005" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://www.persecution.org/newsite/index.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.persecution.org/newsite/index.php" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="http://www.christianmonitor.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.christianmonitor.org/" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> <a href="http://www.aim.org/media_monitor/4610_0_2_0_C/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aim.org/media_monitor/4610_0_2_0_C/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></p>

<p>Christians have also been perpetrators of persecution, which has been directed against members of other religions and also against other Christians. Christian mobs, sometimes with government support, have destroyed <a href="../../../p/a/g/Paganism.html" title="Paganism">pagan</a> temples and oppressed adherents of paganism (such as the philosopher <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hypatia_of_Alexandria_c824.html" title="Hypatia of Alexandria">Hypatia of Alexandria</a>, who was murdered by a Christian mob). Jewish communities have periodically suffered violence at Christian hands. Christian governments have suppressed or persecuted dissenting Christian denominations, and denominational strife has sometimes escalated into <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_wars.html" title="Religious wars">religious wars</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/q/Inquisition.html" title="Inquisition">inquisitions</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch_hunts.html" title="Witch hunts">Witch hunts</a>, carried out by secular authorities or popular mobs, were a frequent phenomenon in parts of early modern Europe and, to a lesser degree, North America. The degree to which these acts were supported by formal Christian doctrine and scripture is a topic of much debate.</p>
