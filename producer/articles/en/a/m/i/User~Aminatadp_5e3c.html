<p>Cheikh Anta Diop was an Egyptologue, the man who argued that Egypt was a Negro race and along with other multitude of intellectual interests which are highly regarded by the people of Senegal. Cheikh Anta Diop was born in the town of Diourbel, in Senegal, on the West coast of Africa in 1923 and then moved to die quietly in sleep in Dakar, Senegal on February 7, 1986. To give attention to his famous personality, the government decided to name the University of Medicine by calling him now Cheikh Anta Diop.</p>
<p>Diversity is privileged at Cheikh Anta Diop University, and there is a large representation of ethnicities represented by Senegal, Burkina-Faso, Ivory Coast, French, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, USA, Mauritania, Mali, Rwanda, Cameroon, Belgian, and England ….</p>

<p>Since there are many nationalities there, it became like a mix between the nations. Can you study at Cheikh Anta Diop if you are foreigners? Yes, as Mr. the rechercher West African Center told us, beside the ordinary courses that could also be available at other Universities, Cheikh Anta Diop is the best place for the foreigners to study. The University has a strong emphasis on local (African) studies, with an open range of courses available in African literature, history, politics, philosophy, and sociology. There is a division of the University that offers courses for foreign students; most of the students in these courses are from other African and European countries. Many of these courses focus on Senegalese or African topics, and they are a good way of learning more about the region and allow you to know very well the country and the politic. The educational system follows the French pattern, with final exams (oral and/or written) given at the end of the year All courses at the university are taught in French (except those in language departments).</p>

<p>Note that courses at the IFE (and, of course, the special topics courses and Wolof courses) generally continue to meet even when the University is closed. The Institute of Francais pour Etudiants Etrangers (IFE) is a part of the UCAD University system that specializes in the teaching of French language and the literature and culture of French-speaking (Francophone) countries. Courses at IFE are available based on your command of the French language. You will be tested to determine your French level and based on your individual level, will attend classes of your choice.

The essential vocabulary, grammar and structure of Wolof will be presented and the emphasis will be on communication. Topics in Contemporary Senegalese History, Culture and Society: Professors from the University Cheikh Anta Diop (UCAD) will teach this course, which will focus on the recent history of West Africa and Senegal, in particular and the changes that have occurred in West African societies in response to globalization, development, and political and economic challenges.

Senegalese instructors will teach all courses in French. Due to the possibility of course interruptions, it is recommended that students take no more than one UCAD course. The transcripts will be issued directly from University Cheikh Anta Diop (UCAD). Therefore, participants must ensure that their home institution will accept credits from UCAD in order to receive transfer credit upon completion of the program. Students will be required to enroll in a minimum of twelve (12) semester credits consisting of four core courses, plus one optional UCAD course. Students may also participate in initiatives carried out by Senegalese students such as reforestation projects and medical initiatives. By working with Senegalese students in organizing and carrying out these projects, participants will gain hands-on experience with problems, and potential solutions, in Africa. These projects, as well as volunteer work or internships, may fulfill an optional service-learning element of the program. Students with advanced French skills and some knowledge of Wolof may conduct independent research projects substitute for course work. Arrangements for such activities will be done on a case-by-case basis.<sup id="_ref-WELL_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-WELL" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>Program students live either in the university comfortable single and double rooms, or five-bedroom house and or adjacent apartment located near the University (approximately a 20 minute walk, or five to ten minutes by car rapide). The house is also located within walking distance of the Baobab Center, where program participants receive instruction in Wolof and cross-cultural orientation. Students are responsible for their own meals, and may cook for themselves, or choose to eat in one of the numerous restaurants in the city of Dakar, or also hire a local Senegalese to cook certain meals for them (a common practice in Dakar). Program students may request a "Friendship Family," in which each student is coordinated with a local family that will invite her/his at home for a meal or another family activity on a regular basis. This interaction with a Senegalese family offers students with important details of the Senegalese life and culture, while enabling them to maintain a more independent living arrangement. For the foreigners another option is to live on-campus, an option for the boys, and for the females at Claudel city where Senegalese students live, not too far from school; it is located at 5 min of walk and look like any other student dormitory with three meals per day.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminatadp_5e3c.html" title="Edit section: Schedule">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Schedule</span></h2>
<p>It is very important that full year program participants plan to arrive in Dakar by mid-October for orientation and their first Wolof lessons; UCAD classes ordinarily begin early in November, and run until the end of May or June; Short breaks are scheduled in December and in the spring (usually early April). The spring program runs from early January to May or June. Program Coordinator in Dakar is Prof. Ousmane Sène, who teaches in the Department of English at the University and has extensive experience with the US educational system. Mr. Sène arranges for students to be welcomed and picked up at the airport upon their arrival, organizes an orientation program, advises students about their course selections, facilitates the registration process, and arranges housing. In addition, the Assistant to the Program Coordinator (usually a graduate student at the University) coordinates orientation and other activities, and assists students in taking advantage of the many cultural opportunities that Dakar has to offer. The orientation program varies slightly from year to year, but generally includes an introduction to the city of Dakar and the university, including visits to cultural and historic sites; a brief trip outside of Dakar; and a cross-cultural seminar.<sup id="_ref-Program_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-Program" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAminatadp_5e3c.html" title="Edit section: Strike">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Strike</span></h2>
<p>As other universities, it is not uncommon in many African countries for students to go on strike from time to time to protest against government or University policies as it happened earlier. UCAD experiences student strikes occasionally and it generally does not last more than one or two weeks; so far, the only one of the rare longer strike occurred during the 1993 presidential election. Short-term strikes may be somewhat disruptive, but do not generally affect the work of the academic year, and they allow for an excellent opportunity to learn about Senegalese politics. Should a longer strike occur, Cheikh Anta Diop University will attempt to arrange tutorial work so that students may continue with their studies while the University is closed.</p>
