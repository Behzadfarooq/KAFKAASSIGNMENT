<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rewriting the Hardware section</span></h2>
<p>This article is geting big again. Thinking about reducing the article's size I read through the Hardware section and found that IMO it is too techincal and unfocused. Take this sentence for instance:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Original Amiga chipset, or OCS, is more advanced than other architectures of its time: it has dedicated chips for real-time video effects, allowing users to work with genlocks to overlay graphics atop live video.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Then it goes on to talk about RAM, Cost, then bitplanes, and so on. This all under the headline <i>chipset</i>.</p>
<p>Furthermore the article is peppered with frivolous information like:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>the Amiga also has a niche market among biologists analyzing video recordings</i></li>
<li><i>The Amiga was one of the first computers for which one could buy cheap accessories for sound sampling and video digitization.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>While interesting, this information detract from the main article (which in this case is about Amiga hardware) and should be placed elsewhere (e.g. under trivia.)</p>
<p>I suggest summing the chipset article up with a short paragraph, eg.</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>There are three generations of chipsets used in the various Amiga models. The first is OCS, followed by ECS and finally AGA. What all these chipsets have in common is that they handle raster graphics, digital audio and communication with between various peripherals (e.g. CPU, memory and floppy disks) in the Amiga.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Then discuss the chipsets' abilities deeper in their own articles. Stuff about Genlock should be put under '<i>Genlock</i>, while the bitplane stuff should have its own article with illustrative graphics and everything (if it doesn't already, let's see <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bitplane.html" title="Bitplane">Bitplane</a>, ahh there is an article, not very good thou.).</p>
<p>Anyone else feel the same way? Have a better idea? Strongly opposed?--<a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnss123_0498.html" title="User:Anss123">Anss123</a> 20:50, 28 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Follow up:</b> I've started the rewrite. This is the "meat" of the old article: <i>The Original Amiga chipset, or OCS, is more advanced than other architectures of its time: it has dedicated chips for real-time video effects, allowing users to work with genlocks to overlay graphics atop live video. The Amiga's overscan feature allows it to draw images past the visible borders of a television screen, allowing seamless fly-ins and scrolling from off-frame.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The machine is expandable and supports what was considered a large amount of memory at that time. The original machine shipped with 256K and offered an initial expansion to 512K. That first 512K of memory is Chip RAM, which means it's shared between the custom chipset and the CPU, with the chipset having priority. Additional RAM, up to 8 more megabytes, can be attached via the side expansion bus, and was visible only to the CPU. A mere 8 megabytes may seem laughably small to a modern reader, but at the time, that much RAM would have cost around $300 US. Memory efficiency was (and is) one of the strong points of the Amiga OS.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Amiga has no text mode, offering only bitmapped graphics. It uses 'planar' graphics, meaning that display memory buffers are arranged in bitplanes. A 1-bitplane image provided 2 colors (usually black and white): this would be the equivalent of the early Macintosh display. Each additional bitplane doubles the number of available colors. Low-resolution modes support up to 5 planes (and, thus, 32 colors), while high-resolution modes support 4 (16 colors). Each color can be chosen from the system palette of 4,096. This planar arrangement is a bit tricky to manipulate with the CPU, because any given pixel on the screen can be represented by up to 5 disparate bytes in memory. The blitter handled most of this automatically.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>To get around some of the color limitations, the Amiga also offers a unique HAM (Hold And Modify) graphics mode. In this low-resolution mode, a pixel can be any of the 16 basic colors, exactly like regular low-res screens. In addition, a given pixel can H)old the value from the previous pixel, and M)odify either the red, green, or blue value, which expanded the number of colors displayed to 4096. Once software was developed that could encode images this way, a striking set of amazingly realistic still pictures began circulating. This mode is hard to program, and in the early days was mostly used only for slideshows and video overlays.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The video chipset is configurable, supporting programmable resolutions and the ability to double the vertical resolution of the screen by switching to interlaced mode. This is intended for use with televisions, as their signals are also interlaced. This allowed the Amiga to be the first useful personal computer for video applications.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Programmable resolutions makes it possible for the Amiga to shift quickly between NTSC and PAL resolutions; the exact same hardware was sold in both areas. By specifying large overscan values, it can go past the borders of nearly all televisions. This allows it to 'fly-in' objects from off-frame, and was absolutely crucial to its success in the video market.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Due to flicker, many are unwilling to use the higher-resolution display offered by interlace. This led to a small market for flicker fixers. Early "fixers" were just a piece of smoked glass velcroed onto the monitor; decreasing the contrast reduced the apparent flicker. Later, there were hardware deinterlacers, and eventually Commodore shipped versions of the Amiga that could produce the higher resolutions natively.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The CPU needs access to Chip RAM only during the even cycles. The odd cycles were used exclusively by the chipset. The blitter, though, had a flag that, if enabled, would allow it to access Chip RAM during the even cycles, blocking the CPU. Sometimes, enabling it made a lot of sense since the blitter could do its job a whole lot faster than the CPU could emulate it, enabling the Amiga to do some kind of jobs in realtime that it could not do otherwise, or just to do them in a shorter amount of time. The copper holds an even higher priority accessing Chip RAM, because of its realtime nature. When the chipset blocks access to Chip RAM to the CPU, the CPU can still access the so-called Fast RAM, which chipset cannot access.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The Amiga's architecture, however, has a drawback in high-resolution modes. With the chipset sharing memory bandwidth with the CPU, overall system performance decreased with increasing resolutions and color depth. At 16 colors, for instance, it slows CPU access enough to cut the machine's speed roughly in half. Because of this, high-resolution 16-color screens were mostly avoided until later in the Amiga's evolution, when RAM (FASTMEM) expansion became routine.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Later Amiga models include improved versions of the chipset: The Enhanced Chip Set (ECS) and the Advanced Graphics Architecture (AGA).</i></dd>

<p>I think it ought to be mentioned that a lot of the Amiga's in use today are upgraded a great deal with various enhancement hardware available; disk-controllers, memory boards, CPU turbos, Ethernet cards and new graphics adapters. This way the original hardware is being build on, resulting in performance increase of many magnitudes.</p>

<p>The AmigaOne series of computers were produced under license from the current holders of the Amiga Intellectual Property, and were sold bundled with AmigaOS 4.0, which is a continuation of the same operating system that shipped with Commodore Amigas. This is enough to justify their presence in the table of commercially released Amiga computers. --<a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumpbucket_afd6.html" title="User:Lumpbucket">Lumpbucket</a> 15:30, 08 Dec 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Pegasos</span></h2>
<p>Someone added the Pegasos to the table of marketed Amiga models. While I can see the reasoning behind it, the fact of the matter is that the Pegasos with MorphOS was NEVER marketed as an Amiga, and never had the Amiga name officially applied to it, therefore it shouldn't be in a table of "Marketed Amiga models". I have added a reference to it in the trivia section, since the computer was created by Amiga enthusiasts and MorphOS is able to run Amiga applications under emulation.</p>

<p>The most recent edit changed the text "Amiga Community Portal" on the link to AmigaWorld.net to "Amiga, Inc. corporate fan site". I'm reverting it (doesn't seem like NPOV from here...) but thought that I'd better justify it here - could be a divisive issue as some people seem to have a grudge against that site, and I've never edited Wikipedia before so it could all go terribly wrong!</p>
<p>I see it's happened again. The Wikipedia is meant as a place to store information with as neutral a point a view as possible - is this? Amiga.org and ANN.lu are similar sites but don't have the same insulting tone to their description. I've taken the descision to remove the description for AW.net completely, as its apparent that there are two completely seperate (and unreconcilable) views. Apologies if I've overstepped the mark, but perhaps the user who edited it could at least justify their reasoning?</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Hardware Section vs. Trivia</span></h2>
<p>Is it really important to mention, that Amiga could emulate the mouse by use of the keyboard&#160;? Other systems do this as well, however, there the OS needs to be loaded (Windows i.e.). The Amiga had its OS partially in the ROM, so this might equal. However, I am not a hardware tech and not aware of how this has beeen implemented. If we keep it, I would suggest adding a Hardware section (such as the OS section) in which we go indepth on hardware-features, like the possibilitiy for several "screens" with different resolutions, etc. Also the copros could be mentioned here. I am not good a hardware insights to the Amiga so I will leave this to others. For now, I move the Keyboard-Mouse functionality to the keyboard section, since I do not see it significant enough for an own Trivia entry. Thanks.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I originally wrote the entry in question, and I agree with it being moved to the Keyboard section. 06:01, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Speaking of the trivia section, can anyone confirm the other "three-fingered salute", i.e. Ctrl-Alt-Alt? I have been an enthusiastic Amiga user for over a decade and this was the first time I've ever heard of it. Maybe I should dig out my A4000 and try it. 11:17, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The Ctrl-Alt-Alt reboot only applies to OS4, and probably only when running on the AmigaOne. Because kickstart is located on disk with OS4, Ctrl-Amiga-Amiga reboots like it does on the classic Amiga (basically, it jumps to the start of kickstart and boots), but Ctrl-Alt-Alt reboots back to the BIOS and loads the kickstart off the disk again before booting. - Lumpbucket
<dl>
<dd>That explains it, then, seeing as I have never had OS4, only earlier OS versions. This should be mentioned in the trivia section. Oh, I see it already has been. Never mind. 12:59, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I added some text about the (traditional) three-fingered salute and found that the mention of the alleged second kind of salue became awkward, especially since I have no knowlege of it and the previous text didn't really explain what it did. I think the term "warm reset" that had been used was a bit misleading, as the effect of Ctrl-Amiga-Amiga is simply a CPU reset and reboot, and the fact that the OS might sometimes retain some lingering information in memory has little to do with the keyboard. The fact that kickstart survives is interesting, though. But the text as I've left it is not very good because it mentions the existence of the second kind of salute without explaining it. Since the second kind exists only in unreleased software for an unreleased product, I'm inclined to just remove its mention entirely. Mditto 12:31, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I changed occurances of "Commodore 64" to "Commodore C64". This might seem nitpicking, but the "Commodore VIC20" was not the "Commodore 20" either. "C64" seems to be the common model name of the "CBM64" by "Commodore". I remember it also being called "VC64", but this might have been specific to Germany and thus is of no value here. Please check section <a href="../../../c/o/m/Talk%7ECommodore_64_5697.html#.27CBM_64.27_vs_.27CBM64.27_and_.27Commodore_64.27_vs_.27Commodore_C64.27" title="Talk:Commodore 64">Talk:Commodore_64#'CBM 64' vs 'CBM64' and 'Commodore 64' vs 'Commodore C64'</a> for more on this.

<p>The Commodore VIC 20 wasn't called the Commodore 20 because it was a VIC20 made by Commodore. The Commodore 64 wasn't called the Commodore C64 because C64 from my understanding was a user contraction of the name Commodore 64, which is the full system name and merely doubles as a companyname devicename. Calling it a Commodore C64 in my view is therefore a grating rudundancy. If a company called VIC made the VIC 20 then it would seem equally silly to turn around and call it the VIC VIC 20.</p>
<p>To summarize, I think its poor form to call the Commodore 64, or C64, a Commodore C64. <small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 64.81.58.56 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.81.58.56_3ea5.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.81.58.56">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p>How can it be said that the AmigaOS is based on a microkernel? I've had discussions about this in the past, and people disagreed widely, and I don't even have a real opinion myself. But it seems quite apparent that the AmigaOS being a microkernel is not a <b>fact</b>. Does the AmigaOS have a clear distinction between kernel mode and user mode? I'm afraid not. Can you have a real microkernel without a clear distinction between kernel mode and user mode? I'm not sure, but I'm sure many authoritative people would say you can't.</p>
<p>So, I'm going to delete the references to microkernels if nobody objects in the next few days.</p>
<hr />
<p>The AmigaOS has very little in the way of distinctive modes (kernel mode versus user mode) because it has very little in the way of security. Lack of memory protection and privledge restrictions leave very little room for the necessity of a "kernel mode".</p>
<p>That said, a definition of the Amiga kernel is necessary to continue with this. Is it the exec library, the entire contents of kickstart? If just exec, then perhaps it is a microkernel, if its all of kickstart it becomes monolithic and well in excess of the bounds I define a microkernel with.</p>
<hr />
<p>exokernel seems to fit what there, what do you guys think?</p>
<hr />
<p>Nope. Exokernel it is the name of a specific class of kernels.</p>
<p>There was people in Wikipedia who in the past wanted to delete Amiga Exec from microkernels [see Kernel (computer science) invoice into Wikipedia] but I found a good compromise who saved Amiga far from being deleted.</p>
<p>Exec is an "Atypical Microkernel". It has gained its own class into Kernels and we all must refer to it as already stated.</p>

I feel the <a href="../../../a/t/a/Atari_ST_ca1a.html" title="Atari ST">Atari ST</a> article reads much better than the Amiga one, because it contains the historical context which this one seems to be lacking in right now. In fact it has more information about the Amiga's purchase than this one!</p>
<p>The whole saga of Commodore's purchase of Amiga corporation probably needs an article to itself though. I'm in the process of writing up a brief history about the origins of Amiga, but should I keep it short and put it in this article, or expand it and put it in a separate article? This article seems to be pretty long as it is...</p>
<p>Also certain things needs some reduction, like the info about the keyboard. (Was the Amiga's keyboard more important than the custom chipset!?)

<p>Yes, I very much agree. The whole article is a mess, doesn't emphasize the Amiga's unique strengths well enough, doesn't emphasize its advantages over other PC's of the time, and in general, contains a lot of ambiguities and confusing passages. It also fails to emphasize that the Amiga *still* has considerable advantages over other PC's, such as extremely low overhead, configurability, simplicity of design, dual GUI/CLI, ease of use etc.</p>
<p>It could really do with an extensive rewrite, at the very least to remove the many amibiguous or unclear passages.

<p>Edit: I have deleted the following paragraph:</p>
<p><i>The OS was not without its flaws, however. Its method calling convention, for instance, was for performance reasons implemented in such a way that it made memory protection impracticable. Other problems included the OS being prone to memory fragmentation, the UI freezing while accessing menus and perhaps worst of all, applications making invalid assumptions about the OSs inner workings (which is arguably not a fault of the OS per se).</i> - and replaced it with a couple of paragraphs of my own. While I don't consider this an ideal edit by any means, I wanted to remove the reference to the alleged problem of "the UI freezing while accessing menus" which is completely untrue, and the comment about memory fragmentation, since I'm not sure this isn't a problem for other platforms as well.</p>
<p>Other than that I wanted to change the paragraph because it gives the impression the Amiga wasn't a reliable machine, which is totally false.</p>
<p>Really though I'd like to rewrite the whole article. The segment on the custom chipset, for example, is much too long compared to the other sections, and does not even contain much useful information. By using the present tense it also gives the impression this is the current state of the hardware when in fact the OCS was superceded as long ago as 1993. <a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGatoclass_aee7.html" title="User:Gatoclass">Gatoclass</a> 12:49, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Eh? The UI really does freeze while accessing the menus. This is one of the things that annoys me about the Amiga. Try it, open AmigaAMP or Frogger or similar, play a song and then access the menus. You get a similar effect in MS Windows if you hold in the X button in many applications (Media Player Classic for instance). <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnss123_0498.html" title="User:Anss123">Anss123</a> 13:07, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry, but I have to disagree Anss. I have owned maybe a dozen different Amigas, from the A1000 to the A500, 500+, A2000 and A1200, and I have never experienced this problem - EXCEPT as a result of other misbehaving programs.</p>
<p>The point is that the way the paragraph was written, it sounded as though the OS itself was responsible for the problem, ie that the OS menu routines were unreliable and didn't work properly, which just isn't correct. <a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGatoclass_aee7.html" title="User:Gatoclass">Gatoclass</a> 05:44, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmm, I'm not sure we're talking about the same ting. I'm not talking about the OS crashing; I'm talking about small animations stopping up while in the menus. (e.g. The progress bar of a media player for instance). To me it looks like the OS is blocking some message queue, which something I consider to be a clear case of bad design.

<p>Gatoclass, not to be a grich but I have a couple of issues with the paragraph: <i>The average Amiga user could usually quickly identify a misbehaving program and eliminate it from his software collection. However, lack of memory protection was arguably one of the deficiencies that contributed to chronic lack of interest in the machine from the business world.</i></p>
<p>The first statement can be applied to just about any OS (in that if an application misbehaved you could drop it), the sentence is also misleading as sometimes it could be very hard do (keep in mind that on the Amiga applications could step on each others toes; thus it was not always clear which application was the culprit for a system's instability). As for the second statement, few of the competing “business oriented” OSs (DOS/Windows, Mac OS and AtariTOS) had memory protection; therefore I have to wonder why the lack of it hurt AOS in the business world? Sure, it might perhaps possibly have made a difference, but that is a discussion in on itself.</p>
<p>With this in mind I deleted the paragraph, but if you put it back (for whatever reason) I will not delete it again. --<a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnss123_0498.html" title="User:Anss123">Anss123</a> 20:01, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Okay. I said I'm not an IT professional and while I know the Amiga fairly well, having programmed it right down to assembly language level, I'm not that familiar with other PC developments of the era (although of course I use a PC today&#160;:) ). However I'm aware that lack of memory protection was an issue frequently cited at the professional end of the market as a reason for Amiga's failure to gain more acceptance in the business world. Amigaworld magazine, for example, complained about it a fair bit as I recall.</p>
<p>All the same there were obviously other important factors that stopped Amiga from getting a foothold into that market, the main one being Commodore's own chronic inability to see the machine as anything but a gaming platform. So I'm not going to insist on the reintroduction of that paragraph. I already said I wasn't 100% happy with my edit anyhow, it was really just a quick fix while I contemplated some more considered edits.

<p>Whoever wrote this section seems to think that hardware documentation is a bad thing. Amiga gave detailed documentation of the graphics hardware so that programmers would not be limited to what was spoon fed to them by a priesthood of API programmers. This ensured that the first generation of Amiga programmers would be able to push the graphics hardware to the limit. Perhaps this argumant is lost on programmers brought up on OS-heavy machines manufactured since Amiga's demise.--<a href="../../../d/r/v/User%7EDrvanthorp_afd5.html" title="User:Drvanthorp">Drvanthorp</a> 00:54, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I would agree with you. It's rather POV by suggesting that going through the API would have been better (it may be unthinkable to suggest otherwise now, but things were much different with the limited hardware in the 80s), and seems to imply that the Amiga was alone in this choice (e.g., wasn't hitting the hardware common to some degree on DOS, and proper APIs only appeared with Windows 95?) I'm not sure how best to rewrite it - does anyone object to it being removed?

<dd>Yes, it was common practice on early personal computers to directly access the graphics and sound hardware. Some early machines had little or no API support for these features, so they were often accessed directly. The Atari 400/800 computers are a great example, because Atari actually intentionally left the best graphics features undocumnented in the belief that this would hamper third party game developement and give Atari an advantage in marketing their own games. These hidden hardware features were quickly discovered by programmers that dissasembled Atari's game software, and better documentation became available from third party sources, but never from Atari themselves. Commodore, on the other hand, published programmers reference guides describing the function of every byte of memory in the Vic-20 and C-64. Amiga was founded by hardwear-guru Atari defectors, and marketed by Commodore, so it was only natural that EVERYTHING was documented.--<a href="../../../d/r/v/User%7EDrvanthorp_afd5.html" title="User:Drvanthorp">Drvanthorp</a> 16:42, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There was a classic series of arguments I had (I can't remember if it was comp.sys.amiga.tech or some such, or if it was on the BIX developer support forums) with some of the 3rd party game devs from Europe about going through the OS versus overriding it. With rare exceptions, it was better to go through the OS, even if you ignore whether the software works on the next minor rev of the hardware. And we worked HARD to make the OS not break badly-broken games - I once spent around a week with a hardware trace box tracking down why a (silly) children's program broke with the alpha of 2.0. Final reason: they depended on some scratch register (A1? D1?) to happen to get set to a device structure by OpenDevice() on the console (if I remember the details correctly). So we put one of many patches in to avoid breaking these programs that didn't follow the rules.</dd>
<dd>The ones that went totally direct to the hardware were worse: I analyzed a book written in the UK on how to access the floppy directly (targeted at game programmers). I can catagorically tell you that it would fail on some random percentage of Amigas because they didn't understand things like rotation speed tolerances. And in fact some games did fail when we changes floppy mechanism makers, even though it was totally in-spec. And this is just one of the simpler examples; ignoring how much some of the other stuff could help - or could get out of your way in a smooth manner while handling all the other stuff you didn't _need_ to access directly -- if you bothered to ask the OS, that is.<a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesup_c788.html" title="User:Jesup">jesup</a> 17:04, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Pretty much no. "Demos" that nuked the OS pretty much were ignored. In fact, I don't even remember looking at any of the euroDemos at the time. We were interested in commercial games, and unlike now there was no very easy distribution of patches/updates (though it did happen), so avoiding breaking things was more important. And updates for copy-protected games were even harder. We had a whole series of patches just to keep things from breaking especially in 2.0 and 2.04. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesup_c788.html" title="User:Jesup">jesup</a> 15:07, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I feel the need to justify my edit because there <b>are</b> already links to the AmigaOS article... however, I missed them myself the first time I read the article -- which might either mean that I don't read carefully enough, or that they aren't visible enough&#160;;-)</dd>

<p>Even with the link now pointing directly to the Amiga 4000T <a href="http://www.retromadness.com/amiga/index.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.retromadness.com/amiga/index.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> page, I still think that link doesn't belong here. Look at the other links: they're all big sites with vast amounts of information (only pouet.net leaves me some doubts... it sure is a big site, but how is it Amiga-related, at least at a first glance?). The contrast with a page depicting an A4000T and briefly mentioning its hardware component is evident to me.</p>
<p>Before removing the link again, I'd like to hear some opinion, especially that of the link author. Thanks.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article title: why not "Commodore Amiga"?</span></h2>
<p>I have been wondering for a time now why on Earth the title of this article isn't "Commodore Amiga" rather than just "Amiga". Most, if not all, articles on other computers include the manufacturer's name in the model name, so I don't quite see why this doesn't apply to the Amiga as well. Please comment. If no reasonable arguments appear in favor of keeping the present title, I may change it before long. --<a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWernher_a499.html" title="User:Wernher">Wernher</a> 11:00, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I too have wondered this. I think it should be renamed as "Commodore Amiga". In the early days, Commodore (in the U.S) wanted to distance itself from the Amiga. Instead "Commodore Amiga", it was usually referenced as "The Amiga from Commodore". I don't know the official reason for this, but they could have been trying to stop the "Toy computer" image they gained in the early 80's from affecting the Amiga. <a href="../../../a/d/s/User%7EADSR6581_491c.html" title="User:ADSR6581">Pixel8</a> 11:18, Jun 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you're in a renaming mood, how about <a href="../../../a/1/0/A1000.html" title="A1000">A1000</a>, <a href="../../../a/2/0/A2000.html" title="A2000">A2000</a>, etc. Are you an administrator? Because of course the redirect pages would have to be deleted to enable the move. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMirror_Vax_6652.html" title="User:Mirror Vax">Mirror Vax</a> 13:47, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for bringing that up; renaming the Axxx-articles should also be done. In fact, that's an even surer thing than the "Amiga" to "Commodore Amiga" one. I'm an admin, so actually performing the moves should be OK once we decide on the action as such. --<a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWernher_a499.html" title="User:Wernher">Wernher</a> 02:19, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I haven't decided yet whether to support a renaming to "Commodore Amiga". But perhaps the reason that it has this name now is that the Amiga computer had a history before Commodore bought the company. Amiga, Inc. manufactured joysticks (one of which I have) to support the development of the computer that they were developing. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EVal42_2ddd.html" title="User:Val42">Val42</a> 17:16, Jun 3, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Of course, the Amiga also has some history after the demise of Commodore. An article by the name of Commodore Amiga would have to be purely historical.</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>These two points are the reason I haven't just done the renaming already; I thought we should take the time to discuss the pros and cons of a move to "Commodore Amiga". An argument supporting the renaming of the article is the fact that the Amiga was a CBM product for the majority of the period when it was a serious contender in the market. Before CBM, the Amiga was a mostly unknown (company/)product, and after CBM it must be said to (have) be(en) more of a hardcore CBM hacker scene thing (*ducking to avoid incoming burning arrows from the Amiga crowd*). Any comments on that? --<a href="../../../w/e/r/User%7EWernher_a499.html" title="User:Wernher">Wernher</a> 02:19, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am strongly against renaming this article. Amiga&#160;!= Commodore. It's true that it's been owned by Commodore for most of the time, but on these grounds, most articles should roam around all the time depending on the changing winds. It's just a stupid idea IMHO. <a href="../../../l/j/l/User%7ELjL_5e2c.html" title="User:LjL">LjL</a> 23:22, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Fred Fish Collection</span></h2>
<p>If we're going to mention Aminet I think we should have a mention of the Fred Fish collection. I don't know what became of the collection but as someone who used the Amiga extensively during its time, the Fred Fish collection was the best software collection there was and so it deserves mention, especially if someone knows a link to a currently hosted archive.</p>
<ul>
<li>And while we are at it, why not name every single game and application out there for the Amiga? The Fred Fish collection was a public domain series, not that it didn't have great tools, but I'd rather point out succesful commercial software to show that the Amiga wasn't just a playfield for hobby-coders.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The Fred Fish collection was notable and unusual for the time. It presaged the rise of ftp/gopher (and later web) free software sites. Also, much of what was distributed was done in the public domain (not even modern OSS licenses).
<p>Hobby coders were a big part of the picture in the US (and elsewhere, to a slightly lesser extent). Commercial programs are all well and good, but one hell of a lot of current top programmers got their start on Amigas in the 1980's and early 1990's. You can thank them for things like DragonFly BSD, ReplayTV, BeOS and more things than I can name. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesup_c788.html" title="User:Jesup">jesup</a> 03:40, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Custom Chipset</span></h2>
<p>I am missing info about Agnes, Denise, Paula chips, which made the Amiga what it was: More than the sum of it's parts. Also, if I remember correctly, back in the 90's there was a chip called "caipirinha" (by Phase5 / www.phase5.de) or something that was (for it's time) way ahead of time. Unfortunately it has never seen the daylight. Or am I mistaken?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, Caipirinha (a microchip named after a cocktail, of all things) was definitely invented and designed. Whether it was ever produced and released I don't know. — <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 13:42, 9 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There was also a "Fat Agnus" chip that came out, and (if I remember correctly) was required for certain accelerator boards to function properly. In general, the Custom Chipset section needs to be rewritten to better emphasize the importance of the architecture, how it contributed to a true multitasking environment, and how it was really so far ahead of it's time. --<a href="../../../p/r/u/User%7EPrujohn_ed63.html" title="User:Prujohn">Prujohn</a> 20:08, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Fat Agnus" was the standard A500 chip, I think. You might be referring to "Super Agnus", which could access 1 MiB of Chip RAM and switch between PAL and NTSC. Wonderstruck 11:10, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that's what I was trying to remember. I needed the Super Agnes because we worked on PAL and NTSC projects, and (if memory serves) for compatibility with the "Picasso" 32-bit display board. --<a href="../../../p/r/u/User%7EPrujohn_ed63.html" title="User:Prujohn">Prujohn</a> 04:28, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I found the specs for the Caipirinha. They might be interesting, though I don't know if they belong here or should be under some "Never released CPU's" chapter of WikiPedia:</dd>
<dd><b>The corner-stones of the CAIPIRINHA design:</b>
<ul>
<li>128-bit high performance UMA (Unified Memory Architecture) controller, using fast SDRAMs with a clock frequency of 100 MHz and a maximum band width of up to 1.6 G-bytes/second</li>
<li>64-bit processor bus with a maximum clock rate of 100 MHz</li>
<li>two 24-bit video DMA units with freely addressable access, with integrated 24-bit video DAC's</li>
<li>four 16-bit audio outputs, 44.1 KHz with any number of virtual tracks, sample output, FM and AM synthesis</li>
<li>video-in ports for 2 independent video inputs in Y/UV 4:2:2 quality</li>
<li>audio inputs in 16-bit stereo CD quality</li>
<li>LCD (TFT) controller according to the VESA standard</li>
<li>a PCI-bus interface for medium-performance I/O applications</li>
<li>a local 16-bit DMA bus with 66.7 MHz and a maximum band width of 132 M-bytes/second for universal low-cost applications</li>
<li>an integrated IEEE 1394 firewire controller for digital I/O applications</li>
<li>a desktop bus interface.</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">A curious question</span></h2>
<p>Wikipedia may or may not be the best place to ask a question like this, but after much googling, WP is the only thing showing me any info for this, so here goes.</p>
<p>The page mentions community access TV channels being run from classic amiga machines. I happen to recieve one of these channels in my area (Even managing to see the system go down with a guru meditation error, on screen for a day).</p>
<p>Does anybody know of what software package(s) are used for this purpose? I have seen the "slides" if you will, being edited on the air via a popup menu, where one could select the background, font size, etc of the text. The top of the screen always shows the time and local temperature, the middle has the "slides", and the bottom is a scrolling ticker showing a local weather forecast.</p>
<p>Any information would be greatly appreciated! THANKS! 69.146.97.123 07:35, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are multiple ways of doing this, but basically any application that runs on the Amiga can be output to an analog television system with the onboard hardware, or overlayed and timed properly with an external (or internal) "<a href="../../../g/e/n/Genlock.html" title="Genlock">Genlock</a>" (it's a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misnomer.html" title="Misnomer">misnomer</a>). --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonsofpcs_66b8.html" title="User:Tonsofpcs">tonsofpcs</a> <sub>(<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonsofpcs_ff39.html" title="User talk:Tonsofpcs">Talk</a>)</sub> 07:35, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
