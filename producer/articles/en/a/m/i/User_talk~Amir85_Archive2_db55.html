<p>-I'm more a Pathan really. Pathan is the south Asian term for a Pashtun, though it mostly applies to South Asians with Paternal Pashtun descent. I'm a basic mix of Pashtun and Punjabi. A genuine Pakistani of sorts. My mother tongue is Urdu, but my family and ancestors also have spoken Pashto, Punjabi, Hindi and, for a time, even Farsi/Persian. I can barely speak Urdu though, as I have forgotten most of it and can say a few phrases and do some basic conversation. I generally speak English and a considerable amount of French, from French class, both High school and AP (AP is a program in American schools where one can take a college equivalent of a class for so many hours of college credit, if one does well on the exam provided during the spring). -<a href="../../../a/f/g/User%7EAfghan_Historian_d035.html" title="User:Afghan Historian">User: Afghan Historian</a></p>
<p>-Well, because part of my ancestry is Pashtun, I thought it would be a cool name to apply to my person. And I also am a history buff. The name kind of described me. An amateur historian with partial Afghan descent. <a href="../../../a/f/g/User%7EAfghan_Historian_d035.html" title="User:Afghan Historian">User: Afghan Historian</a></p>

<p>Hello dear Amir. You have left me a message concerning the images I have. Yes, I do have a number of Iran related photos. But i didn't understand well. What should I send you? A list of the names of images? I'll be happy to help you in anyway and I will be glad if you can explain me more. And thank you for the great articles you make.

<p>User:Diyako has created an article on a Turkic-Nowruz without mention of its Iranian history and roots. Soon we will here Nowruz has nothing to do with Iran too. His article is <a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevruz.html" title="Nevruz">Nevruz</a>. This should be merged or edited properly. He has gone on the Turkish discussions to promote it.</p>
<p>Here is what user:Diyako has written;</p>
<p><b>Nevruz is the spring festival among Turkic-speaking nations, from Turkey to Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan etc. It is very similar to the Iranian festival of Norouz.</b></p>
<p><b>According to Turkish legends Nevruz dates back to era of Gökturks.</b></p>
<p>Th user Diyako is definnityl anti-Iranian and has an anti-Iranian agenda.</p>
<p>Nevruz is not very similar to the Irnian festival of Norouz it is Norouz!</p>
<p>He has claimed the Kurdish flag has nothing to do with Iran and is a crime to fly in Iran. The Kurdish flag is based on the Iranian flag it is even in the memories of the founders of the Mehbad Republic who wanted to showcase their Aryan and Mede heritage. Back then Kurds only had a oral history about their only know ancestors the Mede and Mede heritage, before other ancestors were accepted. The Sun is also very significant element of ancient Iranian and Zorasatrianism. Diyako is misleading everyone. Go to Kurdistan 20 years ago let alone 50 they will say we are Aryans and our own blood relatives are the Persians. The Kurdish flag is not banned in Iran and is based on Iranian colours. This user also claims the Iranians are only a lingustic group after he saw that the tide was against him that Kurds are in definition an Iranian people so he worked to undermine the definition of Iranian people and even Persians with user:Acuman.</p>

<p>Thanks for your message Amir. Though I don't know Farsi, I could extrapolate from Hindi that "Har Roozetan Norouz, Norouzetan Pirooz" would mean something like "May every day by New Year, and let New Year be victorious."

<p>btw, if you liked the Cowboy Bebop series, make sure you see <a href="../../../t/h/e/Cowboy_Bebop%7E_The_Movie_8e9b.html" title="Cowboy Bebop: The Movie">the movie</a> too, if you already havent.</p>
<p>But since you're a computer engineering student, I especially recommend you watch the series <a href="../../../s/t/a/Ghost_in_the_Shell%7E_Stand_Alone_Complex_833c.html" title="Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a>, especially if youre a futurist philosophy-of-technology freak like me. It deals with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_intelligence.html" title="Artificial intelligence">Artificial intelligence</a> and the internet revolution. Note that the movie <a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_in_the_Shell_7b72.html" title="Ghost in the Shell">Ghost in the Shell</a> is a bit different from the series, even though related. They have different animators, and the story in the movie chronologically comes after the series, even though the series was made after the movie (which appeared in 1996).</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../l/a/u/Laughing_Man_%28Ghost_in_the_Shell%29_e14e.html" title="Laughing Man (Ghost in the Shell)">laughing man</a> story in the series had an almost mystical quality to it. Think about it, the laughing man performs <i>miracles</i> by merely hacking into people's brains and changing their perception of reality. That is in fact a re-statement of Bishop Berkeley's <a href="../../../i/d/e/Idealism.html" title="Idealism">idealism</a>. Whoa. Awesome. I mustve watched the last 3 parts of the last DVD 10 times.</p>

<dd>I also thought the Cowboy Bebop movie was titillatingly psychedlic and pleasantly mind bending. Series like these indeed remain tucked away in one's ambient memories for ages. Like Cowboy bebop, Ghost in the Shell has an excellent soundtrack. It is also psychedelic in its structure. I have to hand it to the Japanese: theyre getting better everyday at everything they do. Theyve come a loooong way since the days of Godzilla and Oshin! Oddly, the opening score of the Stand Alone Complex is in Russian. But even that is cool. It grows on you.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Now...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Firstly, all of the Ghost in the Shell productions (except for the second movie) have been dubbed into English. Whatever you watch, watch those. Do not watch the Japanese audio with English subtitles version, because it will be hard to follow some of their conversations after a while, when the laughing man comes around.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I recommend that you first watch the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Ghost_in_the_Shell%7E_Stand_Alone_Complex_833c.html" title="Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a>, which is what the <i>first season</i> of the series is called, before anything else. I think it is 27 episodes. Do NOT watch any of the movies (<a href="../../../g/h/o/Ghost_in_the_Shell_%28film%29_8706.html" title="Ghost in the Shell (film)">Ghost in the Shell (film)</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/n/Ghost_in_the_Shell_2%7E_Innocence_923b.html" title="Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence">Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence</a>) or the second season series, before seeing the first series. Because then you might not like it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>After you watch the first season, then watch the second season. It is called <a href="../../../s/2E/a/Ghost_in_the_Shell%7E_S.A.C._2nd_GIG_1bd8.html" title="Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG">Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG</a>. Only 4 or 5 DVDs of this season have been released in the US. So I have only watched the first 10 episodes (up to DVD 4). Frankly, so far, I havent liked it as much as I liked the first season. The second season is more about socio-political themes (refugees, globalization, global wars, etc), as opposed to the first season which was mainly about the human mind and psyche and the consequences of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prosthesis.html" title="Prosthesis">Prosthesis</a>, A.I., the question of what is <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_identity.html" title="Personal identity">Personal identity</a>, and merging with the web. But I might be wrong: it might start getting better as the stroy progresses in later episodes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The website I linked you to, refers to both seasons 1 and 2. Make sure you see the mp3 video clips that they have. You will notice that the alot of the animators and crew from the makers of Cowboy Bebop are present here as well. See the mp3 files where it says: <a href="http://www.ghostintheshell.tv/" class="external text" title="http://www.ghostintheshell.tv/" rel="nofollow">Multimedia</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, the movies should be watched last, because the main character (Major Kusanagi) physically dies and her spirit merges with the internet at the end of the first movie. The second movie hasnt even been dubbed into English yet. I watched the second movie in Japanese with English subtitles. It was difficult to follow what they were talking about when the movie starts dipping into <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a> themes. It's better if you wait for the English Dubbed release for the second movie.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>A sidenote: in the Stand Alone Complex series, USA has turned into "The American Empire". I thought that was interesting.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 10:40, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/i/User_talk%7EAmir85_Archive2_db55.html" title="Edit section: Anime dubbing, good or bad?">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Anime dubbing, good or bad?</span></h3>
<p>Obviously, there are differing viewpoints on this question no doubt. It really boils down to taste.</p>
<p>What I do, is that I listen to the English, but also keep the subtitles on. If they are close enough, and the dubbed English doesnt sound crappy, I go on with it. But sometimes the English version recognizeably sucks balls (as in for example the movie <a href="../../../i/c/h/Ichi_the_Killer_b0bf.html" title="Ichi the Killer">Ichi the Killer</a>). And so I switch to the Japanese.</p>
<p>So I think that this question is therefore case specific, and it depends on what particularly youre watching. Some Japanese to English dubbings basically suck, and youre better off watching the japanese original version. Ive seen many of those. (example: do not watch <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gantz.html" title="Gantz">Gantz</a> in English. The English voice dubbing sucks). However in some cases, the opposite is true, because the Japanese do not translate the subtitles properly. For example, in <a href="../../../r/a/h/Rahxephon.html" title="Rahxephon">Rahxephon</a>, I noticed that the English dubbing was actually better than the original voice cast. The Japanese original had some bad lip sinking problems that were quite noticeable for someone like me who has done professional voice dubbing before. And sometimes, the japanese conversations carry proverbs that are only understandable to someone who is Japanese but which also does not convey an important meaning in the storyline (and makes you confused). In that case, if the Dubbing team is really good and have Japanese-American people on their staff, they will translate it properly to convey the proper meaning. Recently, I've seen a lot of superb works dubbed by <a href="../../../a/d/v/ADV_Films_3b35.html" title="ADV Films">ADV Films</a>. Not to mention that sometimes, you will notice that for some reason, the dubbed music sound track is actually enhanced in the English version than it is in the original! ADV studios does a lot of sound mixing. For example, you can notice this in Stand Alone Complex. In the last part, when the major jumps off the building (diving into the city), the English version has a music playing the background (which was extracted from the Stand Alone Complex soundtrack album). In the Japanese version, the sound is slightly more dry, muffled, and not as well audible.</p>
<p>So my advice to you is that, in the case of Stand Alone Complex, content-wise, youll find that there is almost no difference between the dubbed and the original. Plus the dubbed version does an excellent work in sound engineering. So it's OK to watch the dubbed, in my opinion.</p>
<p>But as you said, that is not always the case. For me, I can simply recognize which version is better after watching one or two episodes. It really depends on the story and the voice actors. But I also believe that the Japanese original is not always better than the dubbed English. Authenticity does not always mean better. Sometimes, the japanese do a poor work themselves in translating the subtitles (because of lack of proper English). And the japanese usually have severe budget shortages and time constraints to finish a production (to be aired on their TV in time as their contract specifies), while much more money is usually spent on the English dubbings and sound engineering, which enhance the audio quality of the production. And like you, many people here in America are very picky about the translations conveying the exact meaning. So the dubbing teams usually have Japanese people on their staff. Especially the good ones.</p>
<p>But then again, you have to keep an eye and make your own judgements.</p>

<p>Great job! It looks much better. I basically just got it started with the hopes that someone would come along and improve it - actually, that's what happens with a lot of the Iran-related stubs I've done, especially when they require the quotation of Persian. Speaking of that, what does "khoosh amdeed" mean? I noticed it in Persian characters at the top of the portal. --<a href="../../../j/p/b/User%7EJpbrenna_8d3a.html" title="User:Jpbrenna">Jpbrenna</a> 16:17, 8 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>While answering Southern Comfort, I noticed your message there and wanted to welcome any input into the pederasty pages, as long as it is sourced, of course. I myself am working on sourcing the material there more extensively, so in the end I am sure that any disagreement between us will only result in a better article. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 12:16, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Turanians are written in many old books as old Turks or the people that speak old Turkic, so your knowladge about Turanians were Iranic nomads is not healty..

<p>Hi Amir.</p>
<p>Just saw vol 4 of Gig 2. I liked it. Good news there. I love it when the Tachkomas chit chat on philosophical issues. Also note that the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catcher_in_the_Rye_ec21.html" title="Catcher in the Rye">Catcher in the Rye</a>, which is the book the Laughing man case keeps getting referred to, is actually real.</p>
<p>Im also looking into <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gilgamesh_%28anime%29.html" title="Gilgamesh (anime)">Gilgamesh</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/r/Serial_Experiments_Lain_4e1f.html" title="Serial Experiments Lain">Lain</a>, and <a href="../../../e/l/f/Elfen_Lied_22a7.html" title="Elfen Lied">Elfen Lied</a>. None of them of course will measure up to Ghost in the Shell in my opinion though.</p>
<p>btw, do you by any chance have a bigger sister living in Canada? Just wondering.</p>
<p>Keep cool.--<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZereshk_b6dc.html" title="User:Zereshk">Zereshk</a> 14:39, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Peace, and the Blessings of God be Upon You, Amir. The article on the Battle of Tours was and is heavily sourced at the bottom on the page. Every effort was made by people - please look at the history - to present all viewpoints, the standard-up-the-20th-century conventional western viewpoint, the Islamic historical viewpoint (most particularly from the Arab Chronicles as they are a far better source than conventional western histories), and the current western view. There were over one hundred discussions citing specific sourcing for the article on the discussion page history. If you have a specific item you wish to challange, please name it, and the exact and precise source will be provided. Every effort was made to present all viewpoints so that no one was offended, and the maximum information provided - as witnessed by the fact is it singled out as a good article. I will be glad to work with you on any reference you need on any fact you feel should be disputed. You cannot write an article and say each reference - such as the relative size of the armies - in the text. That information is the bibliography, since we are not writing a college paper, or a book,(with cited footnotes on each line and page) but an encylopedia article. The discussion page is the appropriate place for raising such issues. Again, if you have a problem with the information, please identify it, and I will be glad to give you the specific source, and work with you on wording. This article is genuinely meant to reflect all viewpoints without POV. I lived in the Middle East and have no bias - I will gladly work with you to provide any source, or on wording, if someone finds something offensive. This article is a source of great pride to a number of people, Muslim, Christian, historians, amauters, who worked hard on it, but we welcome help and input from anyone to improve it. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldwindybear_14b1.html" title="User:Oldwindybear">old windy bear</a> 19:39, 15 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I just wanted to let you know that user, khoikhoi (MOD) keeps including the very offensive term, "south azerbaijan" on the Iranian Azerbaijan page. We should not let him post this propoganda and false information. That term has no place in an encycolpedia article. It is not relevent to the content. What a few seperatists call that region should not be shown here. If we dont stop this, people will start including the "a#abian gulf" as an alternate name on the Persian gulf page.</p>
