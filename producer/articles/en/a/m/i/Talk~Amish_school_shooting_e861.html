<dd>If people are saying that these isolated incidents are occuring for a specific linking reason then it is. The perception that school shootings will be more common from now on because of these events is the result of the illusion.

<p>CNN has been airing and re-airing the press conference from the police. The spokesman said that they have three confirmed dead, two students and they believe a teacher's aide which is just an older child then the 13 year old. They have said that the girls were bound and shot execution style in the back of the head. They are still waiting for an update on if any of the other girls have died. Nevan (utc)</p>

<dd>Wolf Rock School was about the most non-notable school before the shooting, and no one would look for info about this event under that name. If the school were famous in its own right, then that would be the logical name.

Given that it's the only school in a small community, it may not even have an official name; locals probably just call it "the school".

<p>I fail to see how the École Polytechnique massacre has anything to do with this incident any more or less than any other school shooting; why should it be included in this article?</p>
<p>It is similar in that a gunman entered the building, and spared the male students, while targeting the females present. However, having allowed some adult women to leave the school, age seems to be a factor here, along with the victims' gender. --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAsteriatic_cdea.html" title="User:Asteriatic">Alexis</a> 06:59, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

If anything, the Platte Canyon shooting seems to be sexual in nature, while the other 2 are more about killing, as it seems at this point. It was clear that the intend in Ecole polytechnique incident was targetting female STUDENTS.

<dd>How many more similarities does one need between the Polytechnique and Wolf Creek? We're not at all saying it was a copycat, we are saying they deserve mention for the similarities. Both happened in schools. Both told the men to leave to separate the women from the men to aim solely at the women, both involve revenge or redemption, and all this has been described by the police already in both incidents. Let the link stay.

<li>I agree that the current title is imperfect, but I think that <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolf_Rock_School_shooting_1f2b.html" title="Wolf Rock School shooting">Wolf Rock School shooting</a> (as suggested above) would be a better one. An opposing point raised above is that "various sources" are reporting the wrong school name, but I don't think that should matter. We should attempt to be accurate and descriptive in our title, and "Amish school" is pretty vague. -- <a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlutor_2e6a.html" title="User:Plutor"><span style="background: white; color: blue; border: solid 1px #666; margin: -1px 0; padding: 0 0.5em; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;">Plutor</span></a><small><a href="../../../p/l/u/User_talk%7EPlutor_ecee.html" title="User talk:Plutor"><span style="background: #ddd; color: #666; border: solid 1px #999; border-left: none; padding: 0 0.3em; text-decoration: none;">talk</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Plutor_72cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Plutor"><span style="background: #ddd; color: #666; border: solid 1px #999; border-left: none; padding: 0 0.3em; text-decoration: none;">contribs</span></a></small> 15:02, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I completely agree with Plutor. In addition, moving the article to <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolf_Rock_School_shooting_1f2b.html" title="Wolf Rock School shooting">Wolf Rock School shooting</a> would be consistent with other similar incidents. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 15:13, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But Plutor, as also as discussed above, it's not clear whether the school's name is in fact Wolf Rock School, as different sources are giving different names. <a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElijya_4eeb.html" title="User:Elijya">Elijya</a> 15:38, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Whatever the name of the school is what we should name the article ("X school Shooting"). I defer to others more knowledgable as to the determination of the school's "official" name. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 17:24, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It would be a mistake to move it to a title no one would search for. The media call it the Amish school shooting. No one seems to be sure what the name of the school is. The next time there is a school shooting somewhere, anyone wanting to refer back to this would likely look fot "Amish school shooting."

<dd>I think that's a poor excuse to misname the article. We should definitely set up a redirect at "Amish School Shooting" but we should stick with the precedent set by the other articles. I really don't think this is too big of a deal but I do think that consistency is a key principle to maintain as Wikipedia continues to grow. But I'm happy to go along with the consensus on this issue. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 17:37, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As soon as we have consensus on the school name, I agree the article should be named "X School shooting". Anything less will be inconsistent with the standard practice here, due to lazyness. Sensationally and emotionally, it's more memorable as "that Amish school incident", but we don't need to push the "Amish? oh my!" button like commercial media sellers -- we can introduce the appropriate amount of fact into the title and have a more professional/respectful/informed article. --<a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDs13_da5c.html" title="User:Ds13">Ds13</a> 17:56, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<p>In the usian media the incident is referred to as the amish school shooting. For matters of research in the future, etc, its best to stick with the name the media dons it. Perhaps for usians 'amish' is telling a lot (like that it happened in pennsylvania). The link with other school incidents is justified, in my opinion these people are fascinated with the kind of story. (i am rather fascinated , but i might be that, had it happened at another significant place), in that regard the link should be provided professionally. Instead of school-shootouts, perhaps, psychological resemblances between similar perpetuators, since i got really curious if it is the collection (hype) of school assault info, that gives these people the idea to go to school. Is there an autoption report of the guy? perhaps he had braintumor? He behaved like that (numerous notes and failure to distract himself from obsessing thoughts apparently not much influencing him before(&lt;none yet described him as special, weird , setback or a bit strange eg..) 80.57.242.54 11:11, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think we could rename it with the proper school name, but leave a redirect under "amish school shooting" as a compromise, to balance between accuracy and convenience. Super Jedi Droid 18:23, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I don't really know much about the Amish but don't they tend to avoid item which are considered too high tech/modern such as phones? Does anyone know how the police were contacted (I'm not saying they wouldn't have used a phone to contact the police just wondering where the phone was that they used to contact the police if they did use one)? Please don't take this the wrong way, I'm not trying to insult the Amish or make fun of their beliefs or whatever just wondering since it seems like something that could have been a problem (on the other hand, I believe they may tend to have one or two public phones available and it would make sense for one of these to be located in or near the school). <a href="../../../n/i/l/User%7ENil_Einne_a722.html" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> 04:54, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have heard that it is common practice in Amish communities to have someone run (or more likely, gallop on horseback) to the nearest non-Amish community and ask someone there to notify the police in case of an emergency they can't handle on their own. <s>I think it's unlikely there would be any public phones available in the community itself.</s> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 06:04, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as having phones: the Amish near my home are permitted one phone (can carry it around, between house and garage), but they're quite modern as far as Amish go. Also, near my grandparents' in <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_County%2C_Pennsylvania_7f9f.html" title="Lawrence County, Pennsylvania">Lawrence County, Pennsylvania</a>, where the Amish are much more primitive than at my home, there are pay phones just sitting out along roads in the middle of nowhere&#160;:-) By the way, in my experience, Amish are usually uncomfortable with horseback riding: it's too military-like. <a href="../../../n/y/t/User%7ENyttend_9f62.html" title="User:Nyttend">Nyttend</a> 21:55, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>No, it was NEAR Paradise, which is a few miles away, along US 30. I guess let Lancastrians who KNOW the area do the editing, esp with a barrage of confusing media reports.

<p>Shortly after this event happenend, I heard reports on Australian ABC News Radio (the national public broadcaster), probably repeating US NPR. One thing reported on the radio, but not here was a series of events as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Police receive a call from a 911 operator advising that the gunman has called saying he has hostages and wants the police to move away in 10 seconds or he starts shooting</li>
<li>Police hold their ground as a police negotiator calls the gunman on the number he called 911 from</li>
<li>Gunman starts shooting hostages, then himself</li>
</ul>
<p>The implication on the radio was that the gunman shot the girls in response to the police trying to negotiate rather than immediately backing off.</p>

<p>One section on the status of the girls specifies:</p>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Police broke in through the windows when shots were heard.[2] The gunman killed himself and five girls. Three died at the scene and two more died early the next morning, with five more girls left in critical condition. Three girls were admitted to Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, four to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and one to Christiana Hospital in Delaware, state police said.[9] At least five girls remain hospitalized, three in critical condition and two downgraded to serious condition as of Tuesday, October 3, 2006.[10] [5]</dd>

<p>There's a couple math problems here regarding the fates of the girls. There were 10 total, and 3 died at the scene. But there were 8 girls admitted to hospitals. A later section on the names of the girls shows only 2 dying at the scene, which matches the 8... maybe the 3rd died shortly after arrival at the hospital? Then our second problem is that 2 more died in hospital the next morning, giving 5 dead total, with "at least" 5 girls still in hospital, according to the article. Do we really need the "at least"? There were 10 girls there, and 5 died, so I don't think there's probably MORE than 5 still in hospital, unless you're talking about the morgue. I'm not sure of the exact facts, so I can't correct this myself, but could somebody else please?

<p>Local news in vancouver bc reported that athe amish had sent a delegation to comfort the gunman's family, and to tell them that they do not hold them responsible for his actions. If the is accurate I think it should be included...does anyone know anything about this 64.59.144.21 18:21, 4 October 2006 (UTC)jlinman</p>

<p>The article now says it has been "determined" that he did not molest two preschool family members 20 years ago that he said he did molest. The article would better state "family members denied he had molested them" or "the alleged victims have told authorities they do not remember being molested." False memories of being molested have been reported in other cases, but I have not read of an adult having false memories of doing the molesting. It is often the case that such behavior is not remembered or is repressed by small children, or older family members may want to hush things up. His reported statement is one side and the reported recollections of the alleged victims and their family are on the other side. A balanced view should be in the article. Has a law enforcement spokesman said definitively it did not happen 20 years ago, and how would they know? <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:54, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The primary issue with the statement is that, as of this particular moment, it is unsourced. I think your objections are noteworthy to an extent but the exact phrasing should depend heavily on the source(s) from which the statement or fact is being taken. Please be careful not to stray from NPOV to OR. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElKevbo_3676.html" title="User:ElKevbo">ElKevbo</a> 17:00, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>My point is, it is hard to prove something did not happen 20 years ago, when the alleged perpetrator said it did, and the alleged victims are very young. The proof would have to be along the lines that persons who were adults at the time are sure he was never alone with them. And the "determination" would have to be pronounced by a responsible authority, not just denial by the family.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 17:29, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I understand your concern and in other contexts I would share it.

<dd>One ref cited now says mental health experts say 1)maybe it didn't happen, 2)maybe they were too young to remember, 3)maybe he did inappropriate touching which did not mean much to them at the time.

<p>I just saw one of the news reports on Yahoo, speaking about four of the girls' funerals - it also mentions that another girl 'has been taken off life supposrt and allowed home to die'. Is Yahoo rated as a good source here? 'Cause if so, doesn't that make it six?</p>

<dd>I know there are example(s) of the term "massacre" being used in WP, but this is neither a Guideline nor Policy at WP as far as I know. Can you cite otherwise? Anyways, "massacre" is a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">POV</a> term, since everyone will have a different threshold for how many need to be killed and in what manner before it is applied. Are two deaths a massacre? One death? 10? 100? We'll all have different answers for this and nobody is "right" or "wrong". POV. Thus, it should not be used. "Killings" and "shootings" are factual. "Massacre" if applied to millions of deaths may be objective, but at these levels, it's POV. --<a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDs13_da5c.html" title="User:Ds13">Ds13</a> 07:20, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
