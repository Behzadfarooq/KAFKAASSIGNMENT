<p>If you make radical changes to a template (<a href="../../../t/u/t/Template%7ETutorial_8cbb.html" title="Template:Tutorial">Template:Tutorial</a>) used on 10 pages in Wikipedia, it is generally assumed that you will have the courtesy to clean up the 10 pages your changes have made look stupid, instead of expecting others to go around tidying up after you.

<dd>Thanks for the reply. If I had thot to check your history, I would have noticed how short your active history is, and especially how short it was at the time you changed the template, I probably would have gone to greater lengths to try and soften the tone of my message--my bad. Anyway, I think the 'be bold' suggestion mostly applies to editing single articles; in general doing things that affect many articles, such as editing a template or moving a highly linked page, have an inferred responsibility to try and follow up such changes. Anyway, I'm glad you're contributing, and hope you're enjoying it. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 22:17, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As it happens, I am rather closely aquainted with the status of texts versus juried journals, etc. Books, chapters in books, and textbooks are not considered on a par with journal articles in academia. They are not allowed to be considered when going up for tenure, for example, and are separated off from academic accomplishments on one's curricula vitae, as another. This seems to be an area of academia you are not particularly familiar with.</dd>
<dd>You are correct that they have some scholarly status, particularly as overviews of the state of a science (in which use they are synthesizing currently journaled research, often for textbooks.)</dd>
<dd>As I have repeatedly stated, biblical and talmudic studies are not my area of expertise (while my son has converted to Christianity and is a biblical scholar, I am not.) I am not at all averse to saying when I don't know something, and I usually do so succinctly. However, research and rhetoric are areas I have considerable background in, as well as some training in dispute resolution, all of which are why I am currently involved in this resolution process. I'm sure you will have noted that I have avoided adding any original text to the paragraphs in question, but instead have been inserting, moving, and editing text which has already been supplied by contributors with more knowledge than I of the content.</dd>
<dd>Given my background, and your history of distracting the arguement and then presenting an alternative text to the compromised text (which practice I counted 3 times in the process of archiving the talk pages), I have determined to shepherd through a compromise text to get beyond the locked editing status. I do hope you will consider getting to that point with a compromise text an important and respectable goal.</dd>
<dd>In getting there, I suggest we should avoid getting into a disagreement about citations. I have been involved in these in the past on a professional level and they are tedious, obstructionist, and expensive, and rarely resolve any differences. I'd rather focus on finding text we can agree on which reflects the contributions of everyone and neutrally presents it. - Amgine 18:04, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It is you who made an argument about the citations. It is disingenuous of you to dismiss my sources and then say "but this is tedious, let's not discuss it" -- a tactic that has the effect of privileging your view and silencing mine. I will respond to you as succinctly as I can. In most tenure cases peer-reviewed articles count for more than books, but not in all. As you ought to know most universities allow each department to develop its own tenure guidelines appropriate to the discipline. In many of the social sciences and humanities -- like history -- writing a book is a crucial sign of scholarly achievement and necessary for tenure and promotion. In some cases, a published book is even necessary for getting a job. But your mis-stating the facts of the tenure process is but a diversion. The tenure process is only one way to measure scholarly status, and it is not appropriate here -- the process at hand is not tenure, but writing an encyclopedia. If you look at peer-reviewed journal articles in history, you will see that their bibliographies are full of books. Books are often important, credible, even authoritative sources of scholarly knowledge.</p>
<p>I mentioned the books I used not because I think every sentence in wikipedia needs a citation, but because I think every sentence in wikipedia needs to be verifiable. That I rely on books written by the preeminent scholars in the field is evidence as to the verifiability of my claims.</p>
<p>Your claims must be verifiable as well. I have pointed to several claims you have made and asked for verification. You have provided none. Instead, you asked me for sources. How dare you then accuse me of distracting the argument? You have done nothing <i>but</i> distract. For example, your continued use of the ridiculous phrase "king messiah." Every time I explained why this was a ridiculous phrase, you simply came up with sillier and sillier questions, and continued to repeat the mistake. Each time I explain why it is wrong to claim that there were many prophet/healer/messiahs, you again distract the argument (demanding I verify my claims, but refusing to provide any evidence or sources for your own claims) and then keep repeating the mistake.</p>
<p>When you first proposed a version of this section you invited people to "rip it" because it was a first attempt. But when I tell you what is wrong with it, you ignore me.</p>
<p>Then when I present a well-researched verifiable version, you complain that it isn't based on your version! How petty can you get! Like you, I invite people to tell me what is missing or wrong with my version. I specifically asked you what was wrong with it. You couldn't come up with a single defect or error.</p>
<p>To be blunt: although I gave you the benefit of the doubt until today, I now understand that your claim that you will shepherd through a compromise version is pompous and ridiculous. You utterly misunderstand the Wikipedia process, which is ultimately about a verifiable encyclopedia. The process invites anyone to contribute and encourages full discussion. But this does not mean that <i>every</i> contribution ends up in the final version. The talk page is a place to examine and debate. If a contribution is unverifiable, misleading, or simply wrong, there is no reason for it to be included in the article. Indeed, it must not be included in the article. You have made your own ignorance clear. You claim the authority to stitch together "compromise" paragraphs when you are simply unqualified to do so, since you have no idea what is true and what is not. If you want to edit merely on style, I recognize your right to do so. But you cannot admit to ignorance and then edit on content. That you want to write a paragraph on "messiah" when you do not understand the Hebrew usage; when you didn't know all priests are descended from Aaron; when you do not recognize who Shaye Cohen or Geza Vermes are; is just so absurd it blows my mind. Even now you claim that you have considerable experience in research, yet you haven't shown any sign of even knowing <i>how</i> to research this topic. That your claims to this ignorant authority have taken up so much space on the talk page is<i>only</i> obstructionist. You have not contributed anything of value, and have only gotten in the way. Surely there is some article on a topic you actually know something about, that you can more fruitfully (and I am sure enjoyably) participate. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> 18:26, 14 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Having served as an editor on committees dealing with considerably more esoteric content than this, I feel I am aware enough of the scholarly process to serve here. That you are attempting to shift the argument to credentials suggests to me you lack of this type of experience.

<p>You are very welcome. I developed this list by talking to professors in history and religion, and by consulting various bibliographies. Shaye Cohen is the premier historian on this period of Jewish history today; Neusner is very good and widely respected though many dispute his analyses. Concerning Jesus, as far as I can tell Meier, Vermes, Sanders, and Fredricksen are the absolute top authorities. I happen to like Ehrman a lot. Crossan is very important though probably my least favorite of the group I put down. Cohen's book from the maccabees to the mishna is <i>very</i> accessible, as is Sanders <i>The Historical Figure of Jesus.</i> I love Vermes but he is much drier, and I love Fredrickson but she is very detailed and intense. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>

Thanks *smiles* Might cite you on my page if you keep on that way. Seriously, it has been hard work, I only hope they like it. Please read the article and help by commenting or such. If some kind of consensus emerges maybe we can get a grudging draw if both sides feel respected and heard, and can agree it is a fairer presentation? What do you think?

<p>Do you mean the edit that adds the etymology of Jesus' name, that it means YHVH (we could just call it "the Lord") is salvation? If so, yes, to my knowledge this is accurate.

<p>Thanks for the apology, Amgine. Although I continue to strenuously disagree with your views on the article, I would hope that all of us can maintain a basic level of civility and avoid nastiness as much as possible as we continue to argue. I think that, generally, you have remained relatively polite over the course of the discussion (although, as I've said, I continue to not think much of your substantive arguments), so I shall assume that this was a momentary lapse due to irritation, which I would certainly not claim to be immune to. That said, we seem to be further from agreement than ever on the article itself. I'll just say that I really am quite confused about the nature of your substantive problems with Slr's version [pausing to revert article back to that version - no reason to unilaterally disarm], and why you feel that FT2's version is superior, especially given the rather glaring ignorance of pretty basic facts on FT's part which I think that some of the recent exchanges on the talk page have revealed (for instance, his claim that Roman emperors of the time of Christ were shorter-lived than non-existent Roman emperors who supposedly lived a century before the beginning of the Roman Empire; or his apparent ignorance of the fact that John/Yohanan and Jonathan are completely different Hebrew names.) Perhaps you could try to explain yourself more fully on my talk page. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 07:15, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hey Amgine, thanks for your explanation. It makes the issues somewhat clearer, although I still disagree with you. I think the process-based argument is rather deeply unfair. Slr has continuously engaged in lengthy discussion on the talk page of his version, and has welcomed constructive criticism. I find it hard to see why the fact that you and others refuse to work to improve his version, and instead work on (or simply revert to, as CheeseDreams does) FT2's version, indicates that there is something wrong with his version, any more than the fact that Slr and I have been reverting back to his version indicates on its own that there is anything wrong with that version. Edit warring is edit warring, and I don't see how all the blame can be put on one side. I will try to bring on some constructive criticisms of Slr's version, and improve, so that it's not simply an edit war, although I suspect this will not help. As to the substantive question, I really am not sure why you find Slr's version to be unreadable. I think that it's really quite good - clearly written and well-researched, although it is obviously not perfect. FT2's version, on the other hand, seems poorly organized and oddly written, and contains howling factual errors. Best, <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 07:50, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, Amgine, I have started making various changes to Slr's version, and I have made some constructive comments about it on the talk page. I'm planning on doing the same for FT2's version (not making changes, but making comments). I will say that I tend not to try to make changes in the midst of an edit war, because I fear that the other version will get approved and all my work will have been for nothing. As soon as it settles down, I'd certainly like to try to contribute. I also do not see how it is Slr's fault that I reverted three times. On the one hand, I have the right to revert up to three times if I think it's appropriate, and I would heavily dispute that this is somehow "unethical." On the other hand, Slr did not force me to revert, and, furthermore, you have reverted a similar number of times. As to the substantive questions, while I do agree with you that Slr has probably been listing an excessive number of sources, although I would disagree that he qualifies every statement with a citation. As to the other issue, that the article is not tied closely enough to the cultural and historical context of Jesus, I would agree with this guardedly. I do not think, however, that the answer is to separate out history from culture - I agree with Slr that this would make little sense. On the matter of Slr's behavior, I <i>would</i> like to see some citations. From what I've seen, however, I'd note that you and CheeseDreams have pretty much consistently failed to ever cite a scholarly source for your claims when challenged on them. At any rate, let me get on to critiquing FT2's version of the article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 17:03, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am trying to figure this out myself. You might have noticed that on the background talk page I have apologized to FT2 (just to show you that I know when I am complaining, here is a complaint: just as I admit when I am wrong, I wish he would admit when he is wronge e.g. when translating John as "Yonatan") -- he quoted the tractate accurately (although I still think the larger point he was making is wrong). ben Tama really was a tana'itic scholar of the second century. But the quote is funny because he refers to the Talmud which just didn't exist then. So was this verse of the Mishnay screwqed around with? I really do not know. I am going to ask my friends who really are Talmud scholars. All I can tell you now is that it is a unique tractate.

<p>I have a question about one of your recent comments:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Slrubenstein views the article as primarily a historian's state of the science, and therefore privileging (probably correctly) academic texts and sources. While a reasonable heuristic, there is certainly a bias in this approach, not least of which is the preponderence of western and christian POV in the available literature.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I am all for including as many POVs as possible -- and I appreciate your generally supportive tone. But I have two questions. First, what other POVs are you suggesting? There are already separate articles on Jewish and Muslim points of view; I think we <i>need</i> a separate article on non-religious POVs. But were you suggesting adding other POVs? Which? Jewish and Muslim? Or am I missing something? Second, the POV of the article (in the current protected form, which was last edited by me) the POV is that Jesus was not the son of God, not divine, not resurrected, will not return. These are certainly the views of the historians cited (Jesus was not divine, the miracles did not occur, he doesn't redeem people from sin). So please, in what way is any of this a "Christian" POV? Am I missing something? It seems downright anti-Christian to me! What do you see that I don't? <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>I must say, I am a little concerned that after writing "there is certainly a bias in this approach, not least of which is the preponderence of western and christian POV in the available literature," you write "I have not examined your essay as to its specific Christian bias or lack thereof." Be that as it may, if I understand you correctly, perhaps your criticism is not of Christian POV but rather "Eurocentrism." However, I am very very concerned about the way you talk about "Christian" versus "Jewish" scholars. Now, in order to avoid a conflict I am having with CheeseDreams, I do not think you are racist and am not accusing you of racism. But I do think there is a danger in thinking that Christian and Jewish historians will have such different methods and conclusions. Surely you wouldn't say that there is a difference between Jewish and Christian physics? Now, I know there has in fact been much bias in history. I recognize that there have been historians who were ideologues for Christianity or White Europe, and that there have been historians who were ideologues for Judaism or Zionism. But these historians do not have much credibility these days in history departments. I think modern historians have really tried to overcome such biases ver self-consciously in the past fifty years. I think most historians see themselves as advocates for people who lived long ago, often far away -- scholars who are trying to understand and make understandable the words and deeds of people who otherwise seem very strange to us ... scholars who turn to history because they are skeptical of what they have been taught about their own place and times. In any event, my sources (in my version of the article) include historians who happen to be Jewish. Also, the historians who happen to be Christian, whom I cite, themselves use Jewish historians as sources (and there are Jewish historians who use Christian historians as sources, with respect for their work as historians, regardless of their religion or race). Do you really want to essentialize Jewish and Christian historians? Do you really have a basis to do this? When you read Fredricksen and Sanders, can you really tell from how and what they write whether they are Jewish or Christian? <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></dd>

<p>Thank you for addressing my concerns on my talk page. I appreciate your sensitivity for bias. Your example concerning readings of the Mishnah is a good one. So I would ask only that you apply your concern for bias with the same attention to specifics, here. That is, I agree that we need to be on the lookout for biases, and make them explicit when we see them -- just as long as we do not dismiss out of hand what someone says just because they <i>could</i> have a bias. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></p>
