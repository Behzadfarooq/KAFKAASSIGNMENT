<p>The title refers to a name that Mozart often used (he was baptized as Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart) as a <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pen_name.html" title="Pen name">pen name</a>. It is a Latinization of the Greek <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theophilos.html" title="Theophilos">Theophilos</a>, which Mozart sometimes also Germanized as "<a href="../../../g/o/t/Gottlieb.html" title="Gottlieb">Gottlieb</a>".

<p>At the opening of the tale, <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salieri.html" title="Salieri">Salieri</a> has not met Mozart in person, but has heard of him and his music. He adores Mozart's compositions, and is thrilled at the chance to meet Mozart in person, during a <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salon_%28gathering%29.html" title="Salon (gathering)">salon</a> at which both of their compositions will be played. When he finally does catch sight of Mozart, however, he is deeply disappointed to find that Mozart's <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personality.html" title="Personality">personality</a> does not match the grace or charm of his compositions: Mozart is crawling around on his hands and knees, engaging in sexual talk with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constanze_Weber_2168.html" title="Constanze Weber">Constanze Weber</a> (who later became his wife). As Mozart himself later explains: "I am a vulgar man....but I assure you, my music is not."</p>
<p>Salieri cannot reconcile Mozart's boorish behavior with the massive <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genius.html" title="Genius">genius</a> that God has inexplicably bestowed upon him. Indeed, Salieri, who has been a devout <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholicism_4982.html" title="Roman Catholicism">Catholic</a> all his life, cannot believe that God would choose Mozart over him for such a gift. Salieri rejects God and vows to do everything in his power to destroy Mozart.</p>
<p>Throughout much of the rest of the play, Salieri masquerades as Mozart's <a href="../../../a/l/l/Ally.html" title="Ally">ally</a> to his face, while at the same time doing his utmost to destroy his <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reputation.html" title="Reputation">reputation</a> and any success his compositions may have. On more than one occasion it is only the direct intervention of the emperor himself that allows Mozart to continue (interventions which Salieri opposes, and then is all too happy to take credit for when Mozart assumes it was he who intervened). Salieri also humiliates Mozart's wife when she comes to Salieri for aid, and smears Mozart's character with the emperor and the court. A major theme in <i>Amadeus</i> is Mozart's repeated attempts to win over the aristocratic "public" with increasingly brilliant compositions, which are always frustrated either by Salieri or by the aristocracy's own inability to appreciate Mozart's genius. During this time Mozart also receives the services of a <a href="../../../m/a/i/Maid.html" title="Maid">maid</a>, Lorl, played by <a href="../../../c/y/n/Cynthia_Nixon_a3b3.html" title="Cynthia Nixon">Cynthia Nixon</a>. While this is never made fully clear in the story, the indications seem to be that she was in fact supplied to him by <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salieri.html" title="Salieri">Salieri</a> in order that she could <a href="../../../s/p/y/Spy.html" title="Spy">spy</a> on Mozart, reporting back to <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salieri.html" title="Salieri">Salieri</a>.</p>
<p>Only Baron van Swieten (who early in the story inducts Mozart into the Brotherhood of the Freemasons) continues to support Mozart. Indeed, by the end of the play, Mozart is surviving solely because of the charity of his brother Masons. Finally, Salieri convinces Mozart (who by this time is half-crazed from frustration and poverty) to compose an opera based on the mythos of the Masons. As a result, Mozart produces the comedy <i>Die Zauberflöte</i>. Van Swieten is horrified to see that Mozart has, in his opinion, parodied the venerated traditions of Freemasonry. He summarily removes Mozart from the Masons. Meanwhile, Mozart's partner in the production of <i>Die Zauberflöte</i>, Emanuel Schikaneder, cheats Mozart out of most of his share of the ticket proceeds.</p>
<p>Now thoroughly destroyed and without recourse, Mozart begins to waste away. Salieri seals his fate by appearing to him in the form of an apparition that Mozart believes to have commissioned a requiem mass from him, driving the man further into insanity. His requiem is left unfinished.</p>
<p>The play ends with Salieri attempting suicide in a last pathetic attempt to be remembered, leaving a false confession of having murdered Mozart with arsenic. He survives, however, and his confession is disbelieved by all, leaving him to once again wallow in mediocrity.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amadeus.html" title="Edit section: Historicity">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Historicity</span></h2>
<p>It is well known that Shaffer took <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dramatic_license.html" title="Dramatic license">dramatic license</a> in his portrayals of both Mozart and Salieri. There is some debate, however, as to just how much. Documentary evidence suggests that there was indeed some antipathy between Mozart and Salieri, but the idea that Salieri was in fact the instigator of Mozart's demise is not given academic credence. In fact, while there may have been real rivalry between Mozart and Salieri, there is also evidence that they enjoyed a relationship marked by mutual respect. For a historical re-evaluation of this rivalry as represented in the play and the film, <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musicologist.html" title="Musicologist">musicologist</a> A. Peter Brown's article "<i>Amadeus</i> and Mozart: Setting the Record Straight"<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> may be more useful.</p>
<p><a name="Mozart" id="Mozart"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amadeus.html" title="Edit section: Mozart">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mozart</span></h3>
<p>Many classical music critics and experts feel that Shaffer's portrayal of Mozart as petulant and loutish is unfair. On the other hand, surviving letters by and about Mozart give examples of his brutal and sometimes profane sense of humor, his arrogance, his stubbornness, and penchant for juvenile indulgences. Also, extant records show Mozart was not a good money manager and suffered from large debts, as portrayed in <i>Amadeus</i>. Finally, Mozart's relationship with his father as portrayed in the film seems to be accurate, judging from the <a href="../../../s/u/b/Subtext.html" title="Subtext">subtext</a> of their letters to each other.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Cairns_%28writer%29_8c16.html" title="David Cairns (writer)">David Cairns</a> called <i>Amadeus</i> "myth-mongering" and argued against Shaffer's portrait of "two contradictory beings, sublime artist and fool" in favour of a "fundamentally well-integrated" Mozart. He also rejects the "Romantic legend" that Mozart always wrote out perfect manuscripts of works already completely composed in his head (or "noodle," to use Shaffer's word), citing major and prolonged revisions to several manuscripts.</p>
<p>A major disparity between the play and real life is the fact that Mozart's mother-in-law, Caecilia Weber, is portrayed as Mozart's landlady, and her daughter Constanze as an innocent girl whom the composer casually met. In fact, Mozart was in love with one of Constanze's sisters, Aloysia, when he met Constanze for the first time, and only years later he would ask Constanze's hand in marriage. His relationship with the Webers seems to have been normal and friendly, especially with one of his sisters-in-law, Sophie, who was among his favourite singers and played one of the main roles in the debut of "The Magic Flute".</p>
<p>Recent studies suggest that Mozart died of some form of <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheumatic_fever.html" title="Rheumatic fever">rheumatic fever</a> (possibly aggravated by overwork and heavy drinking), and not from any poison. A similar fate befell <a href="../../../f/e/l/Felix_Mendelssohn_c1e5.html" title="Felix Mendelssohn">Felix Mendelssohn</a> who also demonstrated prodigal gifts for composing - and, like Mozart, did not survive to his 40th birthday.</p>

<p>In 2004, a modified production of Amadeus premiered in Mount Gretna, PA, at the historic playhouse. This version streamlined the show's lengthy running time by a large amount while retaining the play's throughline. Audience response was excellent and the production is of particular note for it's elaborate sound design and dreamlike scene shifts using minimal set pieces. The production was directed by Will Stutts, Mount Gretna Playhouse's artistic director. The show was stage managed by Joseph Borkovich and featured Robert Campbell as Mozart. Dan Olmstead (Philadelphia, The Manchurian Candidate) played Salieri. Despite it's use of virtual unknowns and it's low-key opening in an out-of-the-way venue, this production was considered by many reviewers and analysts to be the finest American production of the play outside of the legendary original Broadway run and the 1983 Los Angleles production.</p>

<p>Miloš Forman and Peter Schaffer spent great amounts of time rewriting the play into a movie. While the play focuses primarily on Salieri, the movie shows both composers as full characters. Some scenes were shot for the movie, but not used. Some of these made it back into the movie in the Director's Cut.</p>

<p>The original production and touring versions of the play did not allow for good sound reproductions of the music - it was played on tinny-sounding speakers. This was corrected in the film version, which allowed for the music to be heard in full high-fidelity.</p>
