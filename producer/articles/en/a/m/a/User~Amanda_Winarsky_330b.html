<p>Amanda Winarsky was born on November 16, 1989. Infact, everyone was jealous of her birth that yes, even the black pop star from the infamous O-Town tried claiming it to be his birthday as well. In the words of Cher "As If".</p>
<p>She was born in an igloo in Alaska, which came to a shock to Kyle Haney as he did expect her lucious soft skin to be pale and scaley, when in actuality it is black and luciously soft.</p>
<p>Amanda constantly goes tanning because, Kyle Haney (sometimes referred to by Amanda as "his royal blackness") has expressed that she isn't black enough. So Amanda is known to tan multiple times, starting with a base tan and then increasing from there to not burn her skin, until the effects are well-received by Kyle.</p>
<p>Amanda is constantly angry and takes rage classes. They haven't been working. As Kyle Haney quotes, "As my best friend, I do not like to slander her but these classes seem to be making her rage worse. One day in law class, I seemed to slip up on the Journey lyrics. She bit my ear off".</p>
<p>Amanda Winarsky is sometimes considered crazy, which is bogus but this is due to the fact that she does have a split personality. Her split personality usually comes forth in Ms. Holland's law class(another way to make Holland's life hell, see Kyle Haney's page for further hell raising).</p>
<p>Amanda claims that she didn't start the fire, and Billy Joel can confirm this as, and I quote, "...It was always burnin', since the world's been turnin'"</p>
<p>Amanda used to ride motor scooters professionally, she says that she loves the feeling of wind going through her hair while reaching high speeds of up to 15 km/h. She has several custom motor scooters, one with Kyle Haney's face airbrushed on it with one minor difference... in place of his actual body is the body of popular musclebound cartoon character He-Man, from the show "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"</p>
<p>Her other motor scooter is a Bill Cosby Jello pudding motor scooter, which makes the fart sound effects he made in the movie "JACK".</p>
<p>Amanda also is googled at by others, they are usually starring at her peaches and often asking if they can, quote on quote "shake her tree".Amanda simply responds with "Winarskylicious, definition make them boys go crazy"</p>

<p>Sven was born in Russia.</p>
<p>He/She is Amanda's split personality.</p>
<p>Sven enjoys pick-up trucks and WWF wrestling. Sven's idol is Chyna, a WWF wrestler.</p>
<p>The first debut of Sven was a result to Ms. Holland's annoyingness. This brought rage to Amanda's normal personality with the phrases like "YOU'RE CHEEZIN' ME OFF!" and "The Gaunja" said in Ms. Holland's infamous law class. Law = History&#160;? crazy, I know.</p>

<p>Amanda listens to some sweet jams. Such as Journey, JBJ(if you're wondering what that stands for you shouldn't be on her interweb, bitch!), classic M.J, yes that means when he black, Prince, JT, and she also digs when Kyle Haney sings Enrique to her in law.</p>
<p>Amanda and Kyle often have many duets and watch youtube music videos together. There duets are usually consistent Journey and their videos include a wide spread of golden oldies.</p>

<p>When Amanda was in middle school, good old Memo. Elemantry, she was an evil she-devil.</p>
<p>She often pulled pranks and teased the geeky kids. One happening to be a dear friend to her heart.</p>
<p>About 4 or 5 years ago, Amanda dug deep into pockets, not of her own jeans infact they were Kyle Haney's jeans. Amanda dug deep into those pockets found things like: A troll, pocket lint and yes, 2 WHOLE DOLLARS in which she stole.</p>
<p>Also Amanda's latest rage impulsed duty of wrong was when she ditched Kyle Haney at the Tokyo Police Club show.</p>
<p>For her wrong doings, Amanda Winarsky is truely sorry to all those who she may have tortured when they were youngin's and significantly to Kyle Haney.</p>
<p>Don't be fooled by the rocks that she got, she's still, she's still Amanda from da block</p>
<p>In the words of chingy "Holla Back youngins', woot woot"</p>

<p>Queen Amidala's actual name is Padmé Amidala. Which I think is quite lame, because what kind of an name is Padmé. Strike one for the Queen.</p>
<p>Amanda is cooler because she has a spilt personality. Plus one for Amanda.</p>
<p>Queen Amidala gave birth to Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa, whos father is Darth Vador. Plus one for the Queen because well, Darth is one sexy mamajama.</p>
<p>Oh sweet heaven, who are we trying to kid. STAR WARS KICKS SERIOUS HINEY. Queen Amidala wins this battle. Amanda falls up short..to be contiuned.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Amanda still wins by default, as she is much more Tan than that paleface, Queen Amidala</p>
<p>Oh and can't forget a BIG UPS to the ewoks.</p>
<p>P.S. Amanda wins because she is the cat's pyjamas</p>

<p>Deleting Kyle Haney's page is quite an insult. Many people gather around by their computers to read about him. Some even travel many miles to see the Haney in action.</p>
<p>I was once a bystander, a bully and now a friend of Kyle Haney. As a bystander, I never talked to Kyle. I just sort of seen him on the streets, where he was usually hustlin' kids. In my time of a bully, I did steal 2 WHOLE DOLLARS from Kyle Haney's own pocket. Well now we come to the part where I am Kyle Haney's friend and accomplice. Who wouldn't want to be that volcano haired, lucious beard, ruggedly handsome man's friend/accomplice. Whoever wouldn't is nuts, i tell you, completely psycho.</p>
<p>Actually you know what, Don't even bother trying because there is no way he would ditched me to have one of you "white folk" as his accomplice. Theres no way you could sing as much Journey as this lady does.</p>
<p>Fellow Wikis' you best put Kyle Haney's page back on this interweb or you will disgrace this whole country.</p>

<p>As time would recall, on this very date great disservices were done to both Amanda and Kyle when after arriving at school, through like a bajillion feet of snow (accurate assesment of amount of snow, facts via Weather Channel) AND! arriving to school early, they were denied their requests to watch the 1990 hit Patrick Swayze film, Ghost. Despite their nomination of the film and the fact that it won the popular vote (as Amanda and Kyle's votes are worth anywhere from 3-12 each) they were still forced to watch a different movie... the god-knows-when-it-was-made, Finding Forrester.</p>
<p>Let the record show that this movie has none of these:</p>
<p>Ghosts, Patrick Swayze, A ghost helping his living wife make pottery in their basement, Whoopie, and once again, Ghosts</p>
<p>Hell, it doesn't even have dirty dancing, or the Lambada.</p>
<p>The one redeeming quality of this movie is Sean "Shixshchteen Yearsh Old... and You're Black!" Connery</p>
<p>Despite this redeeming quality, the day still remains a tragedy, bottom line: Ghost has valuable lessons; it taught me to not die. I was gonna die... but then I saw Ghost and decided not to. Finding Forrester has no lesson, and if it does, it's that Sean Connery rules, and as Amanda so finely pointed out, the inner city kids with hidden talent movie... IT'S BEEN DONE! HELLO DANGEROUS MINDS, HELLO COACH CARTER, HELLO FREEDOM WRITERS.</p>
<p>but basically what it all comes down to is this</p>
<p><a href="../../../g/h/o/Image%7EGhostA.jpg_d63f.html" class="image" title="Image:GhostA.jpg"><img src="../../../upload/f/f2/GhostA.jpg" alt="Image:GhostA.jpg" width="519" height="755" longdesc="../../../g/h/o/Image%7EGhostA.jpg_d63f.html" /></a></p>
<p>with a cover that hot, who wouldn't wanna see Ghost? Apparently not Riley or the rest of stupid challenge and change</p>
