<p>Censoring the Amazing Racist is foolhardy and against the original mission of Wikipedia- to provide uncensored and factual data to all who request it.</p>
<p>I believe that I could write a non-offensive article regarding the "Amazing Racist" series--- one that factually presents the material as controversial comical satire, along the lines of musical works done by artists such as Marilyn Manson.</p>
<p>Please unlock/de-censor this article so that a factual and concise article may be written for those who request information about this mockumentary series.</p>

<p>This guy is reasonably well known. Certainly more than some of the video games and anime series that have lengthy pages written on them. The deletion was based solely on a fear of the racist nature of the humor. You can't just ignore things you find reproachable. Please unlock this article and request that it be filled with appropriate coverage of the subject.</p>

<p>There seems to be a sudden uprising of anonymous users complaining about this locked page, so I figured I'd address it here:</p>
<p>The article was deleted for notability reasons (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Amazing_Racist_6a23.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Amazing Racist">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Amazing Racist</a>).</p>
<p>It only got locked because a user repeatedly recreated this page in violation of Wikipedia policies (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Amazing+Racist" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=&amp;page=Amazing+Racist" rel="nofollow">its deletion log</a>).</p>
<p>If you are concerned about this page being locked, and believe that this comedy act is notable per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, then perhaps the best course of action is for one of you to create a user account, create a proposed Amazing Racist page as a user subpage (see <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a>), and then come back to this talk page and provide a link to it. However, if you can't find evidence that the subject meets the notability guidelines linked above as WP:BIO or WP:WEB, then you probably shouldn't bother: the article would almost certainly be deleted again on these grounds.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. <a href="../../../v/s/l/User%7EVslashg_16cb.html" title="User:Vslashg"><span style="font-family:Georgia,serif"><b>V</b>slash<b>g</b></span></a> (<a href="../../../v/s/l/User_talk%7EVslashg_99ee.html" title="User talk:Vslashg">talk</a>) 19:01, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>There is no way this should have been deleted. To claim this as a non notable person is beyond my reasoning. I want to get this undeleted. Please see my talk page.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadTim_6ed4.html" title="User:TheMadTim">TheMadTim</a> 00:17, 9 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I Agree with MadTIM - I got to this page via random article as i was skipping through wiki, and found this. I think there are reasonable ground for putting it back up - look at MadTim's Talk page - it very succintly explains who he is without any offensive material being put up. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaledwardmarks_debf.html" title="User:Michaledwardmarks">MichaelEdwardMarks</a></p>
<p>Wikipedia is about open, uncensored content. Unlock this article so someone can write a real article about this comedian; it is disappointing to see Wikipedia censor an article, the truth cannot be discovered without open, uncensored dialogue.</p>

<p>As I said above, I want this undeleted. To censor this is totally against the spirit of Wikipedia, and I honestly find it difficult to believe that 'notability' was the reason.</p>
<p>I propose that this article be recreated.</p>
<p>I have created an article which I believe should form the basis of the new, recreated article. I have never viewed the original article which was deleted, and so have no idea how it relates to my new proposed article.</p>
<p>I don't even know if this is the correct course of action to take, and thoughts on that would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>My new proposed article can be found here&#160;: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:TheMadTim" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:TheMadTim" rel="nofollow">article</a></p>

I concur with the multiple others who have stated the deletion was wrong. Wikipedia is a source of information, regardless of what vandals or unscrupulous individuals make of it. The guy's comedy was controversial, but notable; it was part of a National Lampoon skit, for goodness sakes. It should be recreated forthwith. <a href="../../../r/e/g/User%7ERegBarc_2f88.html" title="User:RegBarc">RegBarc</a> 00:37, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Chaps, there does appear to be a body of people, myself included, who feel that this page should be undeleted or recereated.</p>
<p>I also notice that the article page says that it should not be undeleted without good reason. I would consider the emergence of a body of people, who support the idea of undeletion, sufficient grounds to undelete the article. As such, I am going to undelete it (if I can) in around one weeks time or so. At least this should prompt some discussion on the subject if nothing else. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadTim_6ed4.html" title="User:TheMadTim">TheMadTim</a> 22:41, 17 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I had such a huge respect for Wikipedia and thought it was the, without a doubt, best institution on the internet, which is no small feat. Information on exactly everything and everyone seemed available to anyone seeking knowledge. Apparently someone has decided to change that. I suspect that this is the start of the decline of Wikipedia. One can only hope that some other site will pick up where Wikipedia left off.</p>
