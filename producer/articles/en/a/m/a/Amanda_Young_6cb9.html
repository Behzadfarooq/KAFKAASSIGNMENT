<p>Amanda's first chronological appearance was in the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graphic_novel.html" title="Graphic novel">graphic novel</a> prequel to the first film, <i><a href="../../../r/e/b/Saw%7E_Rebirth_0f3e.html" title="Saw: Rebirth">Saw: Rebirth</a></i>. In it, <a href="../../../j/i/g/Jigsaw_Killer_78b5.html" title="Jigsaw Killer">John Kramer</a> first met Amanda at a hospital. He had just been informed that he had <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancer.html" title="Cancer">cancer</a> and had little chance of recovery. Amanda was recovering from an accidental <a href="../../../o/v/e/Overdose.html" title="Overdose">overdose</a> on <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroin.html" title="Heroin">heroin</a>. John was disgusted that such a bright young woman would throw her life away so easily. Although she had survived the ordeal, he doubted she had learned anything from it.</p>
<p>John Kramer would later take on the persona of Jigsaw (a name coined by the media inspired by the puzzle-piece engravings that he cut out of his victims after they died), who would place his victims in deadly traps. There was a method to his madness, however; those who he kidnapped were people he considered to be unappreciative of their lives. There were ways (however difficult they were) to escape the traps. Those who survived would, according to him, find a better appreciation for their lives.</p>

Amanda in the Reverse Bear-Trap.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>One of his most significant 'subjects' was Amanda. After Jigsaw abducted her, he placed her in trap with a heavy metal apparatus to her jaw - something he described to her as being like a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_traps_in_the_Saw_film_series_1788.html#Reverse_beartrap" title="List of traps in the Saw film series">reverse bear trap</a>. Jigsaw communicated with her via a <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_the_Jigsaw_Puppet_546b.html" title="Billy the Jigsaw Puppet">talking puppet</a> on a nearby television set, explaining that when the timer went off, the trap would rip her jaws open if she did not find the key in time. The key was in the stomach of an apparently dead man lying across the room from her. To get the key, she would have to cut into the man's stomach.</p>
<p>Upon further realization, it was revealed that the man was not dead, but rather heavily sedated by an <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opiate.html" title="Opiate">opiate</a>. Amanda violently cut the key from his stomach just in time to unlock herself and remove the device before it triggered.</p>
<p>As Amanda reeled from what she had just been through, Jigsaw's puppet Billy appeared, out of the shadows before her, congratulating her for surviving. "Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you. Not anymore."</p>
<p>Later, while being interviewed by a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Saw_characters_d707.html#Detective_Brett" title="List of Saw characters">detective</a>, her past as a drug addict was brought up. When she was asked if she was grateful, Amanda tearfully responded, "He... helped me."</p>
<p>Although her role in the first film was brief, the shot of Amanda in the reverse bear-trap grew to be one of the most iconic images from the film, appearing in many of the posters, advertisements and other promotional material.</p>

Jigsaw with Amanda.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>After surviving Jigsaw's trap and being questioned by the police, Amanda was confronted by Jigsaw at her home. Jigsaw enlisted her to become his apprentice, to devote herself to his cause and to follow up on his legacy and carry on his work after he died.</p>
<p>Her first assignment involved dressing in Jigsaw's pig costume and kidnapping <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Saw_characters_d707.html#Adam_Faulkner" title="List of Saw characters">Adam Faulkner</a> before pulling him into the bathroom trap. (A deleted scene had Amanda briefly meeting Adam outside his apartment prior.) Shaken by guilt, Amanda later entered the bathroom again, after Jigsaw had left, and put Adam out of his misery by suffocating him.</p>
<p>Another one of Jigsaw's tests involved <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Saw_characters_d707.html#Detective_Eric_Matthews" title="List of Saw characters">Detective Eric Matthews</a>, who had in the past illegally planted evidence to incriminate and arrest her. While Jigsaw was apprehended by Matthews, Amanda planted herself in a house with other victims, among them Matthew's <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Saw_characters_d707.html#Daniel_Matthews" title="List of Saw characters">teenage son</a>. The house was filled with a poisonous gas, and the only way to get the antidotes was by surviving Jigsaw's traps.</p>
<p>Once Matthews found about the house via what he believed to be live recordings, Jigsaw told the detective that his son was in a safe place, and if he were to just talk with Jigsaw for a certain amount of time he would see his son again.</p>

<p>Matthews, not believing him, brutalized the dying old man and forced him to take him to the house.</p>
<p>Once there, Matthews discovered the bathroom where Jigsaw once held <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Saw_characters_d707.html#Lawrence_Gordon" title="List of Saw characters">Dr. Gordon</a> and Adam. Instead of seeing his son, Amanda attacked him, sedating him and chaining him to the wall. Little did he know, the recordings on the tape were not live and Amanda had already taken his son to a safe place (literally a safe in Jigsaw's workshop), just as Jigsaw had said.</p>
<p>Amanda revealed to Matthews via tape recording her agenda and how she saw Jigsaw as a father figure and someone to follow.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Amanda arrived, telling Matthews "Game over," before leaving the detective to die in the dark.</p>
<p>However, Matthews was able to escape the ankle restraint by forcibly breaking his own foot and, though badly injured, confronted Amanda minutes after she closed the door. The two engaged in a brutal fight, which culminated when Amanda kicked his broken foot and left him to rot in the hallway. While walking away Eric screamed at her, calling her a 'junkie bitch' and stating that she was not Jigsaw.</p>
<p>In the theatrical cut, his fate was left ambiguous; Amanda later stated that she murdered him, but John believed different, thinking that she just left him for dead. The original cut had a much darker fate for him; Amanda went back to Matthews and stabbed him repeatedly long after he had died. Amanda later lied to Jigsaw, telling him that Matthews was locked inside the bathroom as ordered.</p>

<p>Amanda would go on to create a series of traps that resembled Jigsaw's to test those she deemed unworthy of their lives. The only difference was, whereas Jigsaw's traps had some way of escape if the victim were clever enough, Amanda's were impossible to survive, leading to the deaths of people who had successfully completed the tests surrounding their traps.</p>
<p>As Jigsaw lay on his deathbed, Amanda was ordered to kidnap a surgeon, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Saw_characters_d707.html#Lynn_Denlon" title="List of Saw characters">Dr. Lynn Denlon</a>. Amanda placed a trap of her own design around Lynn's neck. The trap wirelessly corresponded with Jigsaw's heart rate; if Jigsaw flatlined, the trap would go off and kill her. Lynn was forced to operate on Jigsaw in order to keep him alive long enough to see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Saw_characters_d707.html#Jeff_Reinhart" title="List of Saw characters">Jeff</a>, another of Jigsaw's victims, finish a series of tests.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Amanda became jealous of Lynn and Jigsaw's relationship, growing increasingly hostile. After Jeff succeeded his own series of tests, Jigsaw told Amanda to free Lynn and let her go. Amanda refused, saying Lynn has learned nothing from what she had been through and instead pulled a gun on her. Jigsaw pleaded with her, telling that although she had the gun, her life was in Lynn's hands.</p>
<p>Amanda, not listening, shot Lynn just as Jeff arrived. It was then revealed by Jigsaw that Lynn was Jeff's wife. Jeff shot Amanda in the neck, fatally wounding her. As Amanda bled to death, a saddened Jigsaw informed her that it was all another test. He knew she was straying from his lessons, and he decided to give her one last chance to redeem herself. Though she had meant everything to him, she had ultimately failed in carrying on his legacy.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amanda_Young_6cb9.html" title="Edit section: Evolution of a Killer">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Evolution of a Killer</span></h2>
<p>Through interviews with actress Shawnee Smith, it has been revealed that part of Amanda's evolution into the killer she was at the end of Saw III was in part due to her horrible childhood. Shawnee herself has stated on numerous occasions that Amanda was severely abused and neglected when she was a child.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> This has been confirmed by writer and co-creator <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leigh_Whannell_a628.html" title="Leigh Whannell">Leigh Whannell</a>, who also commented on Amanda's awful past in one of the commentaries for Saw III. In the original script of Saw III, Amanda herself made references to her past; in one scene she explains to Jigsaw that her father used to abuse her, which explained her emotional turmoil with the Bathroom Trap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When I was a little girl . . . my father would lock me under the stairs. I was terrified of the dark, and he would leave me in there alone. For hours."<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="thumb tright">
<div class="thumbinner" style="width:252px;"><a href="../../../p/d/v/Image%7EPDVD_027a.jpg_64d8.html" class="internal" title="Amanda with a bottle of cleaning alcohol, part of her &quot;cutting&quot; kit."><img src="../../../upload/thumb/3/30/PDVD_027a.jpg/250px-PDVD_027a.jpg" alt="Amanda with a bottle of cleaning alcohol, part of her &quot;cutting&quot; kit." width="250" height="142" longdesc="../../../p/d/v/Image%7EPDVD_027a.jpg_64d8.html" class="thumbimage" /></a>

</div>
</div>
<p>Because of her childhood, Amanda had never properly learned to deal with stress and emotional pain, and thus turned to <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self_injury.html" title="Self injury">self injury</a> as a way of dealing with her problems. While in prison, her abusive tendencies were replaced with heroin. However, after giving up heroin after surviving the Reverse Beartrap, she returned to cutting, burning, and other forms of self injury. Because of her frail emotional state and somewhat mental instability, she is quick to anger, and often acts purely on impulse or emotion (such as trying to kill Eric Matthews and later Lynn Denlon).</p>
<p>The scene in Saw III where Amanda is shown cutting her inside thigh was not in the original script; there was only a brief scene that hinted at Amanda self injuring, in which Amanda is shown squeezing a razor blade (which was later replaced by a scene of Amanda squeezing a leather cutter). Shawnee Smith had been reading the book <i>A Bright Red Scream</i> prior to filming, and she firmly believed that it was necessary to show Amanda's self injuring tendencies (for character depth), and thus insisted that the scene be filmed and put into the movie.<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> Still, some of the scene was cut, including a shot of Amanda using the cloth body of a doll on her bed to soak up the blood from her wounds.</p>
<p>Due to her behavior, Amanda possibly suffers from <a href="../../../b/o/r/Borderline_personality_disorder.html" title="Borderline personality disorder">borderline personality disorder</a>, as well <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stockholm_Syndrome_d840.html" title="Stockholm Syndrome">Stockholm Syndrome</a> in that she bonded to and felt strong affection from someone who had previously kidnapped her.</p>
