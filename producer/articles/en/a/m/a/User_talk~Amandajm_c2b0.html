<p>Hi! I reverted your edits to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelangelo.html" title="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a> because they were highly against the style conventions established in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">wikipedia:Manual of Style</a> (non standard sub-sub-subsections, titles of header in capital, etc.) However, the addictions could be interesting as well, and if you want you can reinstate them, they will be pleased.

<p>Please be less aggressive. Here the ideal is to be calm and willingly towards other users. As for your remarks, 1. <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michelangelo.html" title="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>, I reverted ALL you addings to the precedent format, thinking it would be easier for you to get back the new info from the former version (see history sections) using the proper formatting. 2. Architecture etc. I had to leave home before completing the formatting process. I thought it could be an example for you to continue the work of re-styling.</p>
<p>Some notes: it seems your sources have some lack or errors. "Maderna" is clearly <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlo_Maderno_0b4c.html" title="Carlo Maderno">Carlo Maderno</a>, for example. Anyway, you're adding valuable infos, but please give also attention to the style. For example, don't use words like "amazingly", "beautiful": here they're considered <a href="../../../p/o/v/POV_3e50.html" title="POV">POV</a> stuff, and are usually removed. Language must follow encyclopedic (i.e. as most as possibile "neutral") guidelines. If you add ton of material, but awfully written, users will take no time to mess up the thing and will revert back abruptly your edits (as, for example, I did... but I've just apologized), the principle being: better something less informative but readable, than something full of info that however will make your eyes explode.</p>
<p>But I repeat: you're addings are very welcome, and continue to work for Wikipedia. Let me know. And good work!!! <a href="../../../a/t/t/User%7EAttilios_d110.html" title="User:Attilios">User:Attilios</a></p>

<dd>A further note of style. Headers (titles of section) must not have capitals. <a href="../../../a/t/t/User%7EAttilios_d110.html" title="User:Attilios">User:Attilios</a>

<dd>Did some rewriting in your <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathedral_architecture_of_Western_Europe_16e2.html" title="Cathedral architecture of Western Europe">Cathedral architecture of Western Europe</a>. If some titles are not in the correct position or style, please revert them as you prefer but, please, using the standard "==XX==" and "===XXX===" heading system. I repeat, you wrote some valuable things. Simply a note: I known a bit only of Italian cathedrals, and I think the <a href="../../../p/i/s/Pisa.html" title="Pisa">Pisa</a> example is very particular, and somewhat deceptive IMHO. Some other should be cited to give a more general and informative idea (<a href="../../../m/o/d/Modena.html" title="Modena">Modena</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milan.html" title="Milan">Milan</a>, for example).

<p>I think you're one the most aggressive users I've found here. I think you should give a glance to <a href="../../../e/t/i/Wikipedia%7EEtiquette_76f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Etiquette">Wikipedia:Etiquette</a> before talking with me. You should not be so sticked onto your edits: if you wanna stay in a civil way in a <b>open content encyclopedia <i>that anyone can edit</i></b>, you should learn to treat with people (like me) that will jump one your articles and edit them according to their ideas, that could be different from yours sometimes. Even though my edits can be questionable (like everything in this world), I pretend you'll be polite with me, as well as with all other editors here: menaces like "I will see your edit and check how logic they are" are not welcome, by me at least. If edited something yours, I tried to argument it always. I'm open to debate about all, but only if in a polite way. And I seem I've always spent good works for the substance of your articles, haven't I? As for Pisa, I was simply expressing an opinion: and I think that perhaps my opinion pushed you to add the <b>See also</b> marks, that now make nearly perfect the examples section. As for my articles, <b>they have</b> tons of faults. First, I'm not English mother-tongue, and they need <b>always</b> copyedit in language. Their logic has been sometimes disputed, and sometimes edited back, in a way that I liked or not. I always accepted the debate and found a compromise. So, if you jump on one of my articles and found it has errors, fault, typo, illogical statements, your edits are <b>welcome</b>. I think that's the way to operate in an <b>open-content</b> encyclopedia. Let me know and good work. <a href="../../../a/t/t/User%7EAttilios_d110.html" title="User:Attilios">user:Attilios</a></p>

<p>I've already admitted that my first back-editing was quite rude. The reason is that I have a button allowing me to revert automatically to the precedent version when I see a mess of new things and have no time to check it all. Last weekend I was short of time, and, again I admit it, a bit lazy. I apologize for my brutality, hope you understand. Anyway I think that the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cathedral_architecture.html" title="Cathedral architecture">Cathedral architecture</a> is nearing perfection for style also: my last suggestion is to add, in the Examples section, at least pictures of other significative buildings, in order to give readers the impression that that's a list of <b>examples</b> and that reality <b>can</b> be far different from what is necessarily a simplification. For an example, check the <a href="../../../d/u/o/Duomo.html" title="Duomo">Duomo</a> article: here I added a picture of the <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terracina.html" title="Terracina">Terracina</a> cathedral, just to tease a bit the reader to go off of the common paths. A suggestion a can give are images from the cathedrals in southern Italy (<a href="../../../t/r/a/Trani.html" title="Trani">Trani</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bari.html" title="Bari">Bari</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palermo.html" title="Palermo">Palermo</a>, or, better, less known ones). Let me know and good work. <a href="../../../a/t/t/User%7EAttilios_d110.html" title="User:Attilios">user:Attilios</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>The correct spelling is <i>definitely</i> <b><a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlo_Maderno_0b4c.html" title="Carlo Maderno">Carlo Maderno</a></b>, no other chances (maybe a Latin-like <i>Maderni</i> could have been used in ancient times, but certainly not today, and certainly not the ones you were asking of) possible. All the other ones are the typical typos made by not so accurate and, let me say it, <i>informed</i> English-language scholars. The <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911_Britannica_b1c3.html" title="1911 Britannica">1911 Britannica</a> is full of them, and I spent sooooo much time trying to revert them in articles about Italy. Some are quite funy, even. Ciao!
<dl>
<dd>This does not surprise me. I cannot understand why English people committed (and commits) so many errors for what concerns Italian or Spanish. I think I don't know perfectly English, but I don't write things such as "Westmister" or ". For example, they do not undersand at all the use of apostrophy. <i>Trinita</i> instead of <i>Trinità</i> is a typical error: two words meaning different things. Not to speak about the use of articles "de" or "del", that is so simply exactly the same than your language; or the use of Latin names for cities which have Italian names since centuries. Second, I think that errors span easily due of misinformed books written too many years ago, like the one you referred to, without updating on the progresses made here in Italy. A suggestion to avoid such errors is to go to the Italian Wikipedia and check the correct spelling of things.

<p>About your Michelango the Artist page: I have done some things in the nature of a compromise, but before I go into that let me explain myself:</p>
<p>1) A {{verify}} request is quite different from a request for speedy deletion {{delete}}, {{db-bio}}, {{nonsense}} or {{subst:attack}} or an article for deletion by commitee which is {{afd}} or {{notability}} &lt;nowiki&gt;. I reccomended no such thing. 2) I decided to restore your article by going into the page history and adding a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{cleanup}} tag instead. Hopefully that means another, more eligble editor can go behind me and clean it up. Maybe a member of the wikiproject for Italy or for art.</p>
<p>3)If your looking for sources, I reccomend <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_Rolfe_338a.html" title="Frederick Rolfe">Frederick Rolfe</a> and his "History of the Borgias" his anayzalation of the relationship between <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Julius_II_790c.html" title="Pope Julius II">Julius II</a> is spot on.</p>
<p>4) Consider wikifying the article yourself, as it certainly appears worthwhile.</p>

<p>I really don't know how to help you, but check with either the wikiproject art or the Reniassance history pages. Unfortunately, Corvo's book is the closest I have to real knowledge on Michelango, for my historical speciality isn't really art related and I only touch upon art in passing.

<p>Hi Amandajm,</p>
<p>I'm sorry if I've got you ryled up over my changes. Please reinstate the bit about the link to the colony's founding. I'm confused though how an Anglican diocese could exist back to the 7th C since the CoE didn't exist until the 16th C. The other reason I think why Sydney is so rich is because it is the rump of the older Diocese of Australia.</p>
<p>I understand your concern with the young people. I grew up in a conservative Uniting Church and was taugh the creeds and Lord's prayer. I became an Anglican in my 20's for theological reasons. One of the things I appreciated about the Anglicans was the tremendous work of theology and worship found in the prayer book. At my church (thoroughly evangelical) we use elements of the prayer book in all our services - we just need to be sensitive to context. I get thoroughly lost in a full prayer book service with all its collects and special prayers. We often say the Lord's Prayer together, with the words on the OHP or in printed form.</p>
<p>The thing with the article is we need to write a balanced view of the diocese, namely one that reflects the majority opinion while still providing space for the minority critiques. Perhaps that's a good structural idea... We have a section on Evangelical distinctives that sets out the theology of Sydney (or MTC) eg. Biblical theology, amillenialism, etc. Then we have a section on Critiques/Controversies covering things like liturgy, lay presidency and the ordination of women.</p>
<p>I'm off to a <a href="http://www.ghgt8.no/" class="external text" title="http://www.ghgt8.no/" rel="nofollow">conference</a> now and will be back in a few weeks. I trust you'll hold doen the fort in the meantime.&#160;:) <a href="../../../j/o/u/User%7EJourneyman_c42d.html" title="User:Journeyman">Journeyman</a> 00:06, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I understand how such apparent hypocrisy can be upsetting, but the "priesthood of all believers" is subscribed to by even the Roman Catholic Church (which also reserves the "ministerial" priesthood to men). The idea isn't that all believers can or should be <i>ordained</i>, but that all are God's people (the "royal priesthood, a people set apart"). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolynparrishfan_61da.html" title="User:Carolynparrishfan">Carolynparrishfan</a> 17:24, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi! No, I was surfing amongst Italian communes and, sometimes, on other far different stuff. Have you given a check to <a href="../../../c/a/t/Category%7ECathedrals_in_Italy_99c7.html" title="Category:Cathedrals in Italy">Category:Cathedrals in Italy</a>? It would redirect you to some articles or sections with interesting cathedrals and churches, and of course your copyediting will be welcome there (remember I'm not of English mothertongue). As for the grunting person: the guy is a Norwegian whose wife is from <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannalonga.html" title="Cannalonga">Cannalonga</a>, Italy. He edits only <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannalonga.html" title="Cannalonga">Cannalonga</a>, and is of course stuck with his version of the article. The problem is that it's full of bad style and grammatics errors ("Prov<b>e</b>nce of Bari"..., "9<sup>th</sup> century a.D.", etc.). Further, he continues to add "The most common family name is Cortazzo", probably 'cause her wife is Cortazzo also by surname, eh eh. Examples of such behaviours are in <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_02d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity">Wikipedia:Vanity</a>.</p>
<p>As for style, the articles on my PC looks <b>always</b> great after my editing. I think problems can stem from:</p>
<ol>
<li>We're using different browsers. I use Explorer, for instance.</li>
<li>We have different area monitors. I have a 15" laptop.</li>

<p>Ciao! I'm again here and again with both good and bad news for you. First, the compliments: <b>what</b> you wrote in <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fra_Angelico_7f83.html" title="Fra Angelico">Fra Angelico</a> article is exactly what we need here in neglected sectors of culture (here almost everybody writes of TV, pop stars, wrestling, football and other stupid stuff): informative, in-depth and accurate stuff. But now we come to what in Italian we call the <i>dolenti note</i> (in you know a bit of <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dante.html" title="Dante">Dante</a> you'll be able to translate it). Your article is full of sentences with are totally out of the encyclopedical tone which is expected here. Examples (not your exact words bit gives an idea):</p>
<ul>
<li>"If one looks at XXXXX one will receive the beautiful feeling that ..."
<ul>
<li>Unappropriate: 1) use of first person; 2) emotional adjectives like "beautiful", "mind-inspiring", "stupendous" are strong unadviced here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Beato Angelico, who painted in the Early Renaissance, was one of the most beloved painters of its times, so much was the love for him that ..."
<ul>
<li>Abstracts must be less bombastic: a more appropriate version should be "Beato Angelico (14xx-14xx) was an Italian early Renaissance painter" and stop. "Beloved", "so much" and other para-hagiographic stuff must be cut off at all. If you want to stress things about debatable things as love, popularity, beautiness etc., you must be <b>very</b> careful with the words you use. Never</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I found also typos like "It's importance is...", but you'll be able to remove them easily.</li>
<li>Title of headers must be less phrasal than stuff like (again not exactly what you wrote, of course)===Fra Angelico's most popular works - The works in Santa Croce. It's clear that we are speaking of Angelico, no need to repeat his name in the titles. "Most popular works" is debatable, and anyway sounds bad for a title. I'd prefer a simpleWorks in Santa Croce and let inform the reader that those was its most popular or good works simply saying something like "his masterwork was etc. etc" or "what was perceived as his masterwork", or similar.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well! Hope you won't rage again against me as the first time with the Cathedrals. I've in fact started pointing out that what you wrote was good, but was badly written. But not "bad" in itself: your style would be fairly appropriate for a history of art book, but is strongly against the famous <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> purpose and the tone of this encyclopedia. In conclusion: I've given a premilimary check to your article, removing something, but still it needs much of cleaning up and <a href="../../../w/i/k/WP%7EWikify_9340.html" title="WP:Wikify">wikifying</a>. Read in depth <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_350a.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style">Wikipedia:Manual of Style</a> and then return to <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fra_Angelico_7f83.html" title="Fra Angelico">Fra Angelico</a> to bring it to feature article status. For a comparison, see also the style in <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caravaggio.html" title="Caravaggio">Caravaggio</a>, which IMHO is a good encyclopedical artist entry; see also the format of the sub-article there listing the works. See you soon!! --<a href="../../../a/t/t/User%7EAttilios_d110.html" title="User:Attilios">Attilios</a> 23:01, 6 July 2006 (UTC) (P.S.: also <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verrocchio.html" title="Verrocchio">Verrocchio</a>, if you like him, would need an intervention from you. It's far shorter than Britannica's).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Attention Attilios</b>,</p>
<p>What I hhave done with this article is remove most of, and rewrite the rest of a long article which came sttraight from Brtannica 11.. The article was appalling. It was totally un encylopedic. It showed no appreciation or understamding of Fra Anngeliico's art. It made comments like "Some people find the sweet prettiness appealing but it's pietistc......."</p>
<p>There was a link to "Pietism" and a statement at the beginning drawn from the Britannica to say that Fra Angelico was a "Pietistic" paiinter. WTF does "Pietistc" mean in 21st Century Engliish? Well, if you followed the link of this antiquated word,, you find a wikipage about "Pietism" that links to the Reformation annd to Martin Luuther. Now, I would think that Fra Angelico was the absolute antithesis of the Reformation.. He was a truly devout and conservative Catholic monk, if his paintings are any indication.. So the ignorant quote and well-meaning link were mmade by someone who had no real understanding of the religious climate of the 15th ccentury. On the other hand, to make the statement that he was one of the best-loved painters ofthe Early renaissance may not be "entirely within wiki rules, but it is at the very least true and secondly clear.</p>
<p>The introductory paragraph started with the a very long name- every title he was ever known by, jammed together as if it was actually a) his correct name b) what he was actually called.</p>
<p>In fact, it was neither of these things. He was known as several things, but not ALL of them simultaneously. So I rewrote the paragraph, from an inexplicable, innacurate, but oh so encyclopedic mess to something accurate and easy to follow.</p>
<p>Don't tell me as an art historian that I cannot use "beautiful" in an encyclopedic article.</p>
<p>Before you do that, I suggest you read the crap from Encyclopedia Britannic that well-meaning wikis keep dumping onto these pages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Long convoluted sentences of absolute waffle.</li>
<li>Critcisms of the artists work instead of assesment.</li>
</ul>
<p>This guy (can't remember his name- he was a relation of the Rosettis) writes thing liike "The colours are <i>too</i> bright." Unfortunately, he appears to have been the major writer on Early Renaissance art for britanjica and now, almost every Wiki page on that subjject has been contaminated with his meandering verbose biographies and his inept, neggative POV comments that pass as Critical Assesment of the artists work.</p>
<p>Please go back and actually <b>read</b> what this article said before I rewrote it into a form that might actually be <i>useful</i> to a person who wants to <i>learn</i> something about Fra Angelico.</p>
<p>Now, one of the things that you have done is remove the clear list giving a time-frame in point fashion. If you are going to do this, then please read the rest of the article and devise appropriate heading for the *s that you are removing.</p>

<p>Hi Amadajm,</p>
<p>I see you've been putting in a lot of work at the <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Andrew%27s_Cathedral%2C_Sydney_7f83.html" title="St. Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney">St. Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney</a>, article. Just a comment about all the pictures. First, it's great to see you using a gallery, but maybe a few pictures should be in it. I've added the picture of <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Grant_Broughton_6575.html" title="William Grant Broughton">Bishop Broughton</a>, and the one of his memorial, to the article about him. The article doesn't mention his memorial, so maybe this picture could be removed, at least to the gallery. I don't think the picture of a flower arrangement really tells us much about the cathedral, so if it stays, it should be in the gallery. Please remember that not everyone has broadband, and it would be a shame for them to miss out on this article because they don't want to download a dozen pictures. Thanks for all the hard work.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for replying to my comment. The article is looking better now. All of the pictures seem to relate to the text around them, which is great. I agree that Broughton would better near the text about him, rather than in the gallery. Regarding the gallery, I'm not sure, but I assume that the pictures load faster because they are all reasonably small. (I haven't been able to find anything to back this view up, but it seems reasonable enought to me.) Also, using the gallery has tidied up the article a bit; it was looking a little cluttered. I can understand an artist/art historian liking lots of pictures, and I hope you'll allow a broadcaster to resort to cliché in agreeing. Pictures <i>are</i> worth a thousand words.</p>
<p>With the <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fra_Angelico_7f83.html" title="Fra Angelico">Fra Angelico</a> article, I believe that Wikipedia used Britanica as a means to expand, when Wikipedia had many less contributors. However, if the text is not up to Wikipedia's standards, it is not up to Wikipedia's standards, Encyclopedia Britanica or not.</p>

<p>Hi Amandajm, coming back from vacation I found Your remarks. I am usually working on the German WP in my native language. There I am one of the main authors of the <a href="../../../../de/l/%C3%BC/b/L%C3%BCbeck.html" class="extiw" title="de:Lübeck">de:Lübeck</a> article. Trying to write a social history of this city, I had to produce a lot of bios of people. As You can think, all German cities have a cultural history, which was sharply interrupted by the Third Reich. So I came to look on Bossanyi, but I have to admit, I am not a specialist on cathedral glass (I took the expression from the homepage of the <i>Cathedral Glass Museum</i>). I checked him on google, thought that if I made a "poor" translation of the German WP bio (which is from my hands too), as sources were available to me, and give some hints on his 2nd charrier in England, things might get going. The fountain in <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_Segeberg_936e.html" title="Bad Segeberg">Bad Segeberg</a> was added shortly after the start by another user. From Lübeck I know, that he learned working in glass with an experienced craftsman here. The tradition is old from gothic times, so he is certainly not an inventor, but in my opinion definitely one of the figures in the revival of this art in the 20th Century.</p>

<p>Hi Rifleman!</p>
<p>I've just tracked you down as the person who made some edits and rearranged pics to Ediburgh Castle.</p>
<p>I've had nothing to do with the article previously, but I'm just about to do some serious fixing.</p>
<p>OK! The effects of your editting were as follows-</p>
<p>1. The previous editor had written things like "In the painting to the right, you will see blahdeblah and blahdeblah...." Where is the painting that this editor has referred to a couple of times? Not there any more! You have put in its place some photos, which do not tie up with the text, but you haven't altered the text, so that it matches the photos.</p>
<p>2. The text goes on something like, "In the painting, you can see the Half Moon Battery. When you go around this battery you get to bladeblah..." But you have moved the first reference to the Half Moon Battery, so that now the sentence that begins "when you go round this battery....." is left hanging! It is now totally meaningless!</p>
<p>3. You put up a picture of "HQ XYZ9953 episode 5" (or something). Don't presume that everyone that reads this site will understand what a string of initials and numbers mean. They don't. Please write the title of your pic in full, and also go back to the picture page you created and write a title under that too, so people actually know what they're looking at.</p>
<p>4. A basic rule of editting anything is to READ what people have written, inwardly digest and try to understand how sentences (and possibly even pictures) are connected to each other before you shove them some different place! That way, you avoid making total nonsense out of someone's perfectly good article!</p>
<p>5. I'm about to put back what you moved, sort out the grammar, put the picture in a place where it relates to the previous editor's comments and leave a more-or-less empty box where someone (possibly you) can write all that they know about the Military Tatoo. If you know anything about the regimental stuff, why don't you do that a bit more fully?</p>

<p>I made the edits in good faith. At least, that's the assumption you (and every other editor) is expected to make. If it bothers you that much, you can either revert it or edit it yourself. Why take it up with me now, 2 or 3 months later, after more than a dozen edits by other editors?</p>
<p>I'm sorry that shifting pictures around breaks links with the text. Bearing in mind that the relative positions between the text and the images are not fixed (not everyone uses the same browser; not every browser renders the same way), perhaps the text should refer to the pictures explicitly rather than implicitly.</p>
<p>I added a picture of <b>Headquarters, 52nd Infantry Brigade</b>. Using standardized, international abbreviations, it translates to <b>HQ 52 Inf Bde</b>. That's a standardized, international abbreviation. I apologize for assuming that this would be understandable to all, but let's not trivialize it as "HQ XYZ9953 episode 5" (or something) like you did. --<a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERifleman_82_610c.html" title="User:Rifleman 82">Rifleman 82</a> 13:17, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK, I read the article's transcription, which is [wʊlɒŋgɒŋ]. I read up on the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_English_phonology_5bbd.html" title="Australian English phonology">phonetics of Australian English</a> to make sure we are on the same page. I'll assume you described it in Australian phonetics.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first syllable, [wʊl], has the same vowel as "foot." So I guess this is right.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You are right about the vowel [ɒ] in the last two syllables (ong and gong), it doesn't even exist in Australian English. It's the "a" in the british prunounciation of "what." Originally, it was the vowel in words like "lot," "cloth," etc. but it changed into [ɔ].</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You said the first vowel is prunounced more like "en." Is it like the vowel in "dress" and "bed"? If it is, then the correct way to write that vowel is simply [en].</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I'm not quite sure what you mean by "Gong as in Order of Australia." Are you referring to the "or" in "order"? If so, then you'd write it as [ɡoŋ]. But if it's closer to the vowel in "goat," you'd write it as [ɡəʉŋ].</li>
</ul>
<p>So you'd write it as [wʊl.en.ɡoŋ] (unless, of course, the vowels are different from what I described). The full-stops/periods seperate the vowels, you can remove them if you want.</p>
<p>Please tell me if you need any more help. It's a pleasure to work on phonetic transcription. <a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_fe3b.html" title="User:Ikiroid">The ikiroid</a> (<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_4fb8.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid">talk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_Desk_5611.html" title="User:Ikiroid/Desk">desk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_Help_Me_Improve_8caf.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid/Help Me Improve">Advise me</a>) 14:26, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Then based on your description, it's [wʊl.ɪn.ɡɔŋ] if you pronounce "en" like "in". If you pronounce the "en" in those words like "un," then it's [wʊl.ən.ɡɔŋ]. I don't know which way is the standard in Australia, but perhaps you do. By the way, I'm sorry I didn't understand the Australian cultural references....I try to be international in the way I do things, but there is some stuff that just goes over my head.

<dd>Hi, I took your question to the Language reference desk in order to get a third opinion about the matter.

<p>Looks good. The only thing is that Wikipedia is not an encylopedia in the traditional sense. I would be careful with combining too much information into one article. Any entry over 5 pages becomes unwieldy and should be split. While at the moment some of the entries may appear sparse, in my selection of entries I am banking on future additions.</p>
<p>You got some more work to do before these changes are acceptable though. Please wikify the links that were in the original entries and delete the information in the originals and re-direct the previous entries to <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_bee.html" title="Queen bee">queen bee</a>, where the content now is located.</p>

<p>Sorry, I edited your user vs user talk page. Let me say again, I am open to criticism, and welcome your comments. However, by stating succinctly that art history is what it is, I don't believe I've given a narrow definition of it; in fact it's quite broad. The point is that it is a type of History. I clearly compared Art History to Criticism &amp; Theory. The Art History article has just been restored. As for your comments on my user page, as I said, I'm not really sure I understand what you're talking about. I read all articles I edit. In fact, it was I who wrote the definition section in the article. Hope this clears up things. Incidentally, I believe people would in general appreciate you correcting excessive typos instead of simply apologizing for them.</p>

<dd>Sure thing! The references will help <i>immensely</i>.

<p>Thank you for the comments which you left on my talk page! It's quite possible that the corrections I suggested <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Fluke_%28band%29_b015.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Fluke (band)">here</a> were logically faulty rather than grammatically incorrect. Really, the only <i>problem</i> with the sentence I analyzed was that the subordinate clause was not set off by commas. After I deduced that, I went into grammar-correction overdrive.</p>
<p>I enjoy grammar (and diction) and its correct use. I correct my family way too much. It's quite possible that I made the neither/nor error for the same reason why a layperson may say, "That's between you and I." And I am aware that bands are singular, but a lot of people aren't. Also, "The United States has so much debt, <i>they</i> should look to the cows for help." Number and other sorts of agreement are confusing to many people. Thank goodness English doesn't have gender agreement with nouns.</p>
<p>"So-and-so amassed only a dearth of critical attention" doesn't work because dearth is too abstract. I intented "dearth" to mean "a small amount", when it's really "much less than a big amount." You're right about that: frankly, I was looking for some way to phrase the statement elegantly and was pressed for time, sort of like I have to go to my next class in... 1 minutes, 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Note that I love pedagogy. It's demagogy towards which I feel disdain.&#160;:) I know you don't need justification for <i>my</i> actions, but in addition to those I shall present to you a "Thank you."</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<dd>Done, I'd recommend Peer Review, many of "my" articles have benefited a great deal from outside viewpoints in this process. However, you have to be open to constructive criticism to get the most out of the process, and even when people misunderstand your writing their mistakes show you ambiguities and lack of clarity in the article.</dd>

<p>I've just seen St. Mary Cathedral, Sydney, it looks a very good work. Just a note: my heart a bit cries to see that what, with all respect, is a fake-Gothic church has received such a good treatment here, with such an in-depth article, only because it's from an Ango-Saxon country, while so many true jewels of art in Italy (but also in France and Germany, from what I can see) remain hidden or confined in pathetic state wiki articles. Just to give an example, your article is comparable in size to that of [[Duomo di Milano]... And I'm too ignorant of architecture to produce more than the semi-stub stuff you've seen!!

<p>Seriously, though, I <i>have</i> driven that AWB machine through your contributions a couple of times, but it didn't find much that needed correcting. I've been having fun lately with a website full of photos of UK (all Creative Commons licence) which I've been busily selecting, uploading and using to adorn some of the pages about English villages, stately homes, castles, railway stations and topographical features. It's at [<a href="http://www.geograph.org.uk" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geograph.org.uk" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>] - do you have anything like it over there? You can see a selection of the pictures I've uploaded on <a href="../../../e/u/c/User%7EEuchiasmus_geograph_8270.html" title="User:Euchiasmus/geograph">my uploaded images page</a>.</p>

<p>Hi Amandajm, I think you might have the wrong user. I have no present recollection of ever editing a page on Joan Plowright; I am not even sure who she is. Nonetheless, having looked at the history of her bio page, it seems my scrennname did edit something (on June 10), albeit at a time when I had no access to computers. Perhaps I left my SN logged in on someone else's computer, although I note that the only edit I can find has nothing to do with removing the word Lord from her title, and I really have no opinion on that one way or the other. Perhaps you are referring to something (or, perhaps more likely, someone) else. Cheers! <a href="../../../m/j/l/User%7EMjl0509_36f6.html" title="User:Mjl0509">Mjl0509</a> 21:27, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
All right, maybe it's not a mistake. Maybe I did make that edit; I'm really not sure. At any rate, I certainly am not going to quarrel with you about it; you seem to be up on this stuff! On a side note, I'm very well aware of how to use the history and contribution features of Wikipedia, but thanks all the same.</p>
<p>Hi again; I apologize for the confusion. My official line (and the truth) is: I might have written that, possibly thinking it was a copy editing error. I am only to grateful for your guidance on the matter and am happy to defer to a more informed Wikipedian. My initial reaction stemmed from an inaccurate reading of the change and a (continuing) inability to remember making the change.

<p>Hi, Amanda. Thank you for your contributions. Wikipedia is a friendly place, sometimes (for my own taste) even oppressive in its insistence on "wikilove" and on being nice. In view of this, I'm quite surprised that you find "you young men" never have anything nice to say, and that you encounter only arrogance. Have you searched your own manner of speech for possible explanation? I mean, if people are uncivil in speaking to <i>you,</i> and not in other contexts, there has to be <i>some</i> explanation. But in this case Giano may have been quite flattered by the "you young men"—an assumption or guess that you make about him and Ghirlandajo and their real-life identities. May I ask you to please not make any assumptions about me, by the way? In the first place, if you think in Internet clichés about such things, you'd be likely to be wrong. And secondly, many people prefer not to share or discuss age or gender or other personal details on the Internet (though you yourself don't seem to mind it). Best regards, <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 23:14, 7 December 2006 (UTC).</p>

<dd><i>"...but there are superior editors who watch after Renaissance architecture in the project...".</i> quotation from Ghirlandaio</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This, Giano, Ghirlandaio and Bishonen, is what I am referring to as arrogance. The reversion to a previous state in such a way that new information is dispensed with, is also arrogance. The apparently well-intentioned crashing in to lecture on someone else's conduct of a discussion is also a form of arrogance, unless one is <i>personally</i> offended.</p>
<p>If the page on Renaissance architecture had been well written throughout, well organised, with pictures appropriately incorporated into the text, with quotations and acknowledgements where appropriate, with a reasonable sort of bibliography, then my editting would be a waste of time. I have no doubt there are many "superior editors" but in point of fact, none of them had done anything like a superior job on editting the page in question, in an overall manner that integrated the information. This is not to say that there was not valuable information in it or that there were not parts which were well written.</p>
<p>I've tried to incorporate all the points made by other editors and I hope I haven't omitted anything that anyone regards as important. The imformation mmay turn up in a different place, however. The sentence about the relation of anatomy to architecture, for example, is now under Alberti, the great Humanist theorist.</p>
<p>Concerning my rearrangement of leading pics, I wrote about that at length on the discussion page, and searched to find a juxtaposiition of two pictures that would achieve the same effect, but <i>accurately</i>, rather than using an imginary view which might lead to the impression that Alberti had actually based his design upon it.</p>
<p>There are a great many very obscure topics on Wikipedia which may or may not be used regularly by students. However, an article pertaining to a major aspect of a major artistic period is likely to be utilised by students in large numbers. It is a much more significant article in that sense than, say, <a href="../../../w/h/i/White-tailed_spider.html" title="White-tailed spider">White-tailed spider</a> although you might not necessarily think so if one had crawled up your nose in the night, as they are rather prone to do. The point is, it needs to be an article that is well constructed and well sourced. It needs to be well written, because it will <i>almost certainly</i> be quoted in school projects. It needs to mention the key people and the key buildings. The sections about countries other than Italy need to be properly organised.</p>
<p>In other words, it needs to be the best, most consistent article that we can make it. I don't notice that it has any stars at the top. An article as significant as this topic, ought to have. But it is much easier to gain a star for an article that deals with <i>just one</i> aspect of a very large topic, <i>one</i> artist's biography, or <i>one</i> particular building.</p>
<p>When I've finished with the article, it is going to need very thorough spell-checking, typo corrrection, date-checking and link checking, not to mention the odd split infinitive. The Italian names need checking by an Italian speaker. Someone who <i>really knows the subject</i> needs to run over the specific references.</p>
<p>As for your comments, Bishonen, you are perfectly right, one should not assume anything about identities, unless the information is given out.</p>

<p>Ciao!! I'm just surfing on your article and correcting here and there some typical typos and chaos from non-Italian source (why don't they simply copy-and-paste Italian names and fix the matter for eternity?). Yours is a good work, however I was maybe mumbling if you could also add something to specific entries of the architects cited. I also disagree on the addition of Raphael as architect: I did almost nothing in the field. Maybe you could add some other less known but good architect (I've no names in mind presently, but maybe you can help me)...

<dd>For Palazzo Te, see its <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palazzo_del_Te_26b0.html" title="Palazzo del Te">article here</a>. Note, <i>Palazzo Tè</i> is a wrong Italian form, meaning "Tea Palace"... instead "Te", without the apostrophy, was the name of an island near Mantua. As for the "Tempietto", as I wrote before, the mediocre source confused it with the Tempietto of San Pietro in Montorio (San Francesco it's a large church... I visited it in 1991).

<p>"Palazzo Tè" (pron. TAEH or something similar) in Italian means literally "Tea Palace". "Palazzo Te" (pron.

<p>They are ridiculous? Renaissance was something integrally Italian for two centuries, so what are they complain for? My advice is to leave things as they are now. When and if a consensus for moving material otherwhere will be reached, let's speak of it.

<dd>Yes. I visited it last year (I live in Rome). Particularly noticeable is the statue of the Saint by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stefano_Maderno_d28e.html" title="Stefano Maderno">Stefano Maderno</a>. I admit I didn't notice any matroneaum... The church and its cloister are delicious, but I remember that the storeys around were rather depressing... or maybe I felt this 'cause it was lunch time, and streets of Rome at that time become desert. --<a href="../../../a/t/t/User%7EAttilios_d110.html" title="User:Attilios">Attilios</a> 13:13, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh Ciao! Thanks for compliments: however remember that mine are mostly translations from Italian Wikipedia, although, of course, with additions from things I know, or have source in my library, when possible. Of mine I wrote mostly about singer-songwriters, history entries (History of Italy, Byzantine Empire, etc.), stuff about Rome and about <a href="../../../c/o/n/Condottieri.html" title="Condottieri">condottieri</a>. As for style stuff, I can't really stand people who writes bad! I like style. As for the poem, send me, I'll be pleased to read it! In exchange, I'll send you my shorts stories (I've translated a couple... I won a literary contest this year, I hope I'll ave truly a career as writer... who knows?). Bye and thanks (remember that <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donatello.html" title="Donatello">Donatello</a> is waiting for copyediting also. --<a href="../../../a/t/t/User%7EAttilios_d110.html" title="User:Attilios">Attilios</a> 01:18, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, Amanda. I don´t get which picture you refer to, but I find fairly good the selection of images, specially those of Italian Renaissance. Nevertheless, if you refer to the picture of Seville Town Hall, it is out of focus, and shows a very partial view of Spanish Renaissance. A picture of El Escorial would be much better, (or maybe both). About Baroque, I didn´t answer to your message because that section improved a lot, incluing the title, and now it doesn´t lead to misunderstanding, as it did. Thank you for your good work!--<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarcilaso_904e.html" title="User:Garcilaso">Garcilaso</a> 11:39, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hello again, the picture of Torre de Belem is great! it has good definition and all the decorations can be seen perfectly! Wikipedia has an article about Portuguese Renaissance, it is called <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manueline.html" title="Manueline">Manueline</a>. It was the main, and more develloped style of that times in Portugal, with delicious buildings like Mosteiro dos Jeronimos. Nevertheless, the strength of this mosty Gothic transicion style subdued other forms of more international Renaissance. Of course, there are examples, and I have found some of them while travelling, but I don´t know any especifical literature, perhaps because they don´t make a proper local style by themselves or perhaps in part because of the terrible Lisboa earthquake in 1755. <a href="http://portugalia.free.fr/distritos/jpg_pte/viana_castelo2.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://portugalia.free.fr/distritos/jpg_pte/viana_castelo2.jpg" rel="nofollow">[6]</a><a href="http://img1.travelblog.org/Photos/11135/40968/t/217043-Sao-Roque-Church-0.jpg" class="external autonumber" title="http://img1.travelblog.org/Photos/11135/40968/t/217043-Sao-Roque-Church-0.jpg" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>--<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarcilaso_904e.html" title="User:Garcilaso">Garcilaso</a> 13:02, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the question. Well I had a quick glance at the 'art history and the 'history of art' pages and their discussions. Just my first impressions,.... but I think that it is a big mess. Basically the way I see it the 'history of art' emphasizes the objects where 'art history;' is about the discipline, i.e. what it means to be an art historian. I welcome the difference, but whereas the latter is relatively clearly established (it is about 150 years old), the former goes not only back to the caves, but also involves numerous methodological tangles and conflicts. Now to architecture. Basically, the way I see it, 'architectural history' as it is today is mainly about the objects - similar to the 'history of art' page. This is because there is no real discussion of how architectural historians work methodologically or of the different schools of opinion etc. (also to take into consideration is that many architectural historians are trained as art historians). If you or someone starts a 'history of architecture' page then one would have to work to make parallels (so I would think) with the existent art hitory pages..... Meaning, most of what is NOW in 'architectural history' would have to be retitled 'history of architecture'. 'Architectural history' would then be a page about architectural historians, etc. So you see the tangle. I would humbly think that the art history page should have been titled 'The history of art history' - the latter is a common phrase, I believe among art historians. But sounds odd to the lay person. I will have to think about it a bit more. But my first response is that this is quite a mess and that one should proceed cautiously.<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrosi_7716.html" title="User:Brosi">Brosi</a> 02:52, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Amandajm, I sent a note to the help desk of Wikipedia, but they did not solve it, but I think I finally figured it out. I use Firefox and the dates and ISBNs were all underlined in red. The Wikipedia people told me that that should not happen. I clicked on a date and was told that Firefox can dial the numbers. so somehow Firefox thinks these are phone numbers and for some reason though deletes them in Wikipedia. So I now use Netscape, and hopefully that solves it. I will keep my eyes open however.

<p>Yes, the Renaisance architecture page is mostly Italian Renaisance. The way I see it, Renaissance should be very general like a disambiguation page, but with more meat. In other words, it should end after 'Other Renaissances' and that's it as it overlapps with 'ren. arch'. page. That page then should be 'Italian Ren. arch' with links etc. to the various 'European Renaissances. That would clean up the whole mess.</p>
<p>On the other note, I will try to put in more sources. Most of the stuff I put in was so obvious and uncontrovertial that I thought it did not need too much in the way of specific sources. But I can add that no problem.<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrosi_7716.html" title="User:Brosi">Brosi</a> 19:15, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Amandajm, I have been working some more on the ren. arch page, the beginning. Straightening out language etc. clarifying usage, and putting in sources - up to "characteristics..." that is. I will try to tackle that later. I think that 'charafteristics' is too long and goes over generic classical vocabulary. Better would be to show an early Renaissance use of these features. The 'Influences on the development..' part is not too bad, but could also be rearranged. One would probably want to start with commercial rather than religious, since the renaissance in Rome came after Florence etc.... and then on to Brunelleschi. I think on this page, B should be relative short since there is another Wiki page obvisouly. The <i>Brunelleschi</i> page needs then to be developed, or something could be brought over to that page. etc.... any way need to take a break- chao.<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrosi_7716.html" title="User:Brosi">Brosi</a> 00:51, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm learning from the master. Went a bit overboard on the dates. I think it is looking good. Between the two of us we will get this down. Like the new "influences" too. Tried to put some the skills I am learning here to use on blobitechure which I worked on a bit last night too. I will try to turn my attention now I think to individual Renaissance buildings as you suggested. There should be a page -which is now still mssing - on Russian Renaissance, if that is the right title. A lot of Italian architects were brought up to work on the Kremlin churches etc. An often forgotten part of the Renaissance story. Maybe I will start there. By the way, sorry to bother you with a question about the "architecture portal". I signed up, (though I can;t find my name on the list), but what exactly does signing up mean?

<p>I follow your point, but I am using the latest sources, Battisti and Saalman, both the top scholars on Brunelleschi - whom I cite. Both argue that it is not a B. design - for slightly different reasons- and that at best he was involved only at the beginning. Battisti - I didn't put this in - thinks the building is basically a bad xerox copy of a Brunelleschi. "My assessment of the Pazzi Chapel is largely neagtive.." is how he concludes his essay. But this is probably because he does not like Michelozzo. I think the space is relatively successful for reasons which you outlined. but as to its attribution, alas...it is what the experts say.<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrosi_7716.html" title="User:Brosi">Brosi</a> 01:35, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well I think I got the basics down on Brunelleschi- redid his bio a bit. got some books coming that will help me some more on that.

<p>Dear Amandajm: I took the b.Fletcher part and expanded it to bring in noted Ren. examples. If you could look that over that would be great. Maybe other things come to mind.

<p>No objection to merging the articles from my end. The glass described is not a subset of Favrile glass. Favrile glass was not sheet glass, but a special finish in blown glass vessels. <a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerJ_71f3.html" title="User:RogerJ">RogerJ</a> 21:36, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The name Favrile is a derivation of "handmade" and applies to his blown glass only. It is sometimes used for stained glass, incorrectly. Now that I think about it, I think all his blown glass was branded "Favrile" - iridescent or not. Most of it was iridescent, though.</p>

<p><i>about Michelangelo</i> Hi Margrave! I thought that I'd reply here on your page. As politely as I can...</p>
<p>Please don't be anxious about people saying that Michelangelo was gay. There is a great deal of evidence to be weighed, and the heaviest evidence suggests that he probably did have male/male relationships.</p>
<p>Values were different.</p>
<p>Two mature men in a committed relationship was rare. Nowadays its common. For a married man to have a "boyfriend" in his late teens was common. Nowadays that is totally unacceptable for a married man, and if a man picks up youths behind his wife's back, she leaves him fast. (unless they have what is called an "understanding".) At that time, in the rather elite circles in which he moved with the Medici, as a youth, it was considered much more acceptable for an older man to have a young man as a "pet" or a sexual companion. This doesn't mean paedophilia that involved young children. And it also doesn't mean exclusive homosexuality. A man of wealth and status like Lorenzo had almost no choice about whether he would get married and have kids. Nowadays if a man picked up youths behind his wife's back it would be an absolute scandal. To accuse a man of doing that would indeed be libellous. But to say that there is a very good chance that Lorenzo Medici had sex with some of the young men that he kept around him, is simply a sign of the times in which they were living.</p>
<p>So, that deals with Michelangelo's youth.</p>
<p>As an older man he wrote a very large number of love sonnets. They were all directed to a younger man. But when they were translated, all the personal pronouns were changed to make it look as if he wrote them to a woman. But students of Michelangelo have known for years that he passionately expressed his love for a man. So, if we have fairly solid ground to believe that he was homosexual, what then? Had he been living in the 21st century, he simply would have set up house with his male lover, and everyone would know.</p>
<p>How should we react? Do we throw up our hands in horror because our idol is gay?</p>
<p>The situation nowadays in general, and certainly on this site, is that if you keep insisting that it is wrong to suggest a person might be gay, you will accused of prejudice, and perhaps rightly so.</p>
<p>If this genius, who gave so much to the world, was indeed homosexual, so what? In a world where thousands of artists of every type feel quite free to live homosexual lives, saying that Michelangelo is one of them is not a slander. It can only be a slander if you believe that to be homosexual is a really awful thing.</p>
<p>And I'm afraid that is discrimination.</p>
<p>Just in case you are wondering, I'm a straight grandmother.</p>

<p>Frist off all if you have a comment about what I stated, you should have placed it in the talk page of that article, and not upon my personal talk page. Second, it is slander to say with unfounded fact that Michelangelo is homosexual. I see a current trend that all historical figures especially the talented ones have somewhat magically been demeaned homosexual. Instead of these articles being fair they become a soap box for an underground agenda. You state "a youth, it was considered much more acceptable for an older man to have a young man as a "pet" or a sexual companion. This doesn't mean paedophilia that involved young children. " how can you say such with such honesty? You know better than that even with what goes on now. Then you said "In a world where thousands of artists of every type feel quite free to live homosexual lives" What do you mean by artist? There are few top draw artist after the 18th century. So if I can understand correctly discrimination is not allowed some people to rewrite history and force me to like it? Yes, A real encyclopedia would be 1st quality, aristocratic, learned, and not bias.--<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMargrave1206_6f70.html" title="User:Margrave1206">Margrave1206</a> 19:30, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well I went ahead with the Alberti, and got it pretty well organzied I think. Did a page of San Sebastiano in Mantua (just for you). I got to get some pictures.... Put in missing pages and revised etc. SO now, while I still have some time, I guess I will go to Bramante. It seems already in pretty good shape but some things could be added, starting with a list of his architectural works etc. I guess my goal is to get the 15c. material up-to-date with scholarship etc.<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrosi_7716.html" title="User:Brosi">Brosi</a> 21:34, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, with all the iniquities in the world a typo is the only thing that would completely distract those reading? I imagine only if they didn't have the compactly to comprehend whatsoever. However yes, it is slander to label Michelangelo in that poor and bias article. Wiki should not use historical people to further their agendas, or should I say the editors. However there is no point even speaking to some, for they cannot comprehend what is above them.</p>

<i>Hi, Margrave!</i> The reason that I wrote to you on your user page is that you have accidentally made yourself look really stupid by what you wrote on the Michelangelo page. What you wrote is:-</p>
<p>"There is no POOF that M. was homosexual." And by leaving out the "R" you turned it into a joke that some people find quite hilarious.</p>

<p><i>Deleted message</i> Margrave, I wrote you here an explanatory message, which I have deleted.</p>
<p>The reason that I have deleted it is that I just read part of one of your previous postings, in which you describe the "Middle class" as boorish, ignorant and totally lacking in manners, among other things.</p>
<p>You are, yourself, (one is forced to presume) one of those boorish, ignorant, bad mannered Middle-Cass people. You make that clearly apparent in your posting. And also by the categories that you have chosen for yourself on your user page. Moreover, you don't seem to concern yourself with how many million other Middle Class citizens you insult.</p>

Also your general manners in the way you deal with anything on wiki is lacking. Where you reside is not the seat of Rennisance Europe, don't rewrtie history for your low agenda.

<p><i>Re your last message</i> I am fully aware of the possibility that your Michelangelo posting may simply be a joke. However, as you know, one is obliged, on Wkipedia, to take others in good faith. ie. that you mean either what you say, (or what, despite typos, bad spelling, and bad grammar, you appear to be trying to say).</p>
<p>If, by chance, you are deliberately writing posts to create an impression, it is not quite fair to those who are obliged to deal with you in good faith. There are lots of places on the web where you can take the Micky out of people!</p>
<p>With regards to the content of your postings, there are two reasons why people express prejudice:- ignorance and arrogance. In all good faith, as a teacher, I am obliged to be infinitely patient with the simply ignorant. But when the ignorance is combined with arrogance, I suspect that it is incurable.</p>
<p>--Amandajm 23:47, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wiki is an encyclopedia, not to be used by the lesser to further any agenda. I abhorred these bias articles in which historical people are used in a way to manipulate the uneducated public. Maybe you are unable to fathom the fact that the article and many others are in err? The only ones who "create an impression" or at least trying to, are those rewriting history. No one has the right to profane history with poor and unfounded facts. There was a time when some actually taught the truth, however one cannot live in the past. I find your general attitude and tone argumentative, though I cannot speak for others here. Implying my post are jokes is another tactic to dismiss my comments, or to lessen me. Everyone with a formal education shall not be forced into thinking as your, if this is haughty then so be it. Wiki is not a place to corrupt history with personal views or agendas. One has to questions your bias motives. I am not sure why you insist upon posting on my talk page, perhaps you should respond to the Michelagelo page.</p>

<p>Are you re-writing the Leonardo article? Good luck. For some reason it attracts single-issue crusaders - Leo was gay, Leo lived on green beans, that sort of thing. Where's the Leo painted pictures? Anyway, I'll keep an eye on things and help out if I can. (Have a look at <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caravaggio.html" title="Caravaggio">Caravaggio</a> - a model of what an article on an artist should look like). <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 10:05, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think what Leo needs is a complete top-to-bottom makeover - beginning with a new thinking through of the structure and content of the article. One possibility is to make it strictly chronological and treat of his achievements as we come to them - life and works combined. But that would still need a frame of some sort - a Background section describing the environment in which he worked (the new humanism, the new respect accorded individual artists, etc etc) - and a separate section on his contribution and legacy (sfumato, portraiture, whatever). And why he's so famous today - how he got famouser and famouser, until Marcel had to puncture the balloon. But we have to start with simply junking the existing article. There used to be a band of arts editors interested in this, but they dispersed some time ago, fed up with the steady deterioration of the artifcle - cfizart, Attilios, some others. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 11:50, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The Michelango-poof exchange is funny, but clearly not intentionally so&#160;:). You have Haidac on one side spreading the gospel, and Margrave on the other denying the undeniable. And me in the middle trying to offer a balanced view. It'll be a challenge on both Leo and Mick, trying to write something both honest and balanced. (Incidentally, have you heard of Mikelangelo and the Black Sea Gentlemen? They're a Sydney group with absolutely weird songs). Anyways, on Leo, I think what's needed is a complete re-write, not a mere editing of what's already there.

<p><i>In the interests of positive and cheerful communication!</i> The reason that I post messages that are directed to you in particular on your dicussion page must surely be obvious. I have explained most precisely why I posted on your personal page in the first place. It was out of kindness because your own posting about Michelangelo and the Poof had made you look quite ridiculous. Perhaps the word Poof has not yet filtered through the fog and ascended to the vocabularly of one with such rarefied ideals. Seriously now, the last person with whom I communicated on wikipedia who laid claim to such elite ideology and distinguished lineage called herself Lady Catherine de Burgh. But perhaps you never read anything as ultra middle class as Jane Austin. Those books show so little higher sensibility! They were the Mills and Boon of their day! --Amandajm 06:58, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Good Lord, are you are still obsessed with the typo? I must commend you on your diligent effort to diminish my words in such an immature way. Not only do you call me ridiculous, and ignorant to show your so called superiority, now you insult me under the guises of an apology. To even further a display of your level of enlightenment you now express kindness for those who are so uneducated not to agree with you. Is this how you debate, as the children you teach? It is best to debate an article as educated people do with historical facts and not fictions, lies, generalizations, insults, and subterfuge. I don't use subterfuge when debating, those that result to such usually know they are false to begin with. Stay on the topic, that should not be that difficult when you are able to. This discussion is not about Australia as a penal colony, exconvicts, grammar, or boorish manners. The discussion is about a quest to slander Michelangelo, without solid proof! The article is horrific enough, however to condemn Renaissance Europe is even worse. It seems you find delight in your pettiness, and mediocre insulates. Besides this you take a great deal of pride in dragging Michelangeo's name down. One must wonder why, is this all about uplifting yourself? Why is it that homosexuals deem to recruit the best and brightest of history, when there are other persons that they can rally around? You seem to take this subject very personally, perhaps to you it is more than an article but an expression of some sort. I am very sorry that you consider prejudice, ignorance, and arrogance attributes of those not completely compliant with your personal bias or preferences. If you are looking for role models you have Roman Caesars or someone more contemporary could be Gian Gastone de' Medici.</p>
<p>P.S. If you don't like my grievances about the validity of any article place it on the article page and not my personal talk page.

<p>Amanda, please don't be offended if I offer gratuitous advice on prose style, but take a sentence like this: "<i>Leonardo was born at 3 A.M. on a Saturday, April 15th, 1452, as recorded in the diary of his paternal Grandfather, Ser Antonio. His place of birth was Anciano, near Vinci in the rolling hills of the lower valley of the Arno River. The long stone cottage still stands in the midst of slopes covered with olive trees.</i>" It's long, discursive, and personal. It's the kind of thing you see in a book, when you have 50,000 words to play with and they're all your own. Wiki, unfortunately, isn't like that. A few thousand words is all you've got to shoehorn in Leo's life and works and an explanation of why he matters. So, do we really need to tell the reader that the hills are rolling and that the young Leo never lacked fresh olives? Try to keep to essentialls, and try to be impersonal. In this particluar sentence, I'd edit it dwn to: "Leonardo was born on April 15, 1452, in Anciano, a village near the town of Vinci in the lower valley of the Arno, within the territories of Florence." (Not sure that last point is true, but I want to identify the Florentine connection - imagine Leo's life if he'd been born in Calabria!) <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiCo_bced.html" title="User:PiCo">PiCo</a> 02:19, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi Amanda, This is actually now getting less accurate. The layout is very easily understood with the Bognetti drawing in front of you, but very hard without that. I will rejig, and clarify the layout of the church in general - maybe not today. The articles are clearly going to have to be split, which was the consensus of the arts editors, which I will do sometime. Not my first choice, as you know, but there we go. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbod_859e.html" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> 18:10, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Amandajm. was a little busy with stuff so had to lay low. But to let you know I looked at Leonardo and I like the new additions, and contextualizations etc. I think I can add a little section or expand on his place in renaissance art etc. I thought the discussion of paintings should stick with chronological order and Mona Lisa should be put in its chronological place, toward that back of the list. to de-emphasize the fame mongering. I can also add something on centralzied churches and Leonardo - made some great and important drawings in that genre.

<p>Hello! I'm glad we share an interest in such a facinating figure as da Vinci. I was not trying to water down the intro (the grammatical mistake I made was bad though), so much as to reduce the dehumanizing nature that the intro leaves on the reader. I think it's important to remind ourselves that da Vinci was a man with a clear historical context, not a complete anomaly. Was he incredible? Certainly, but we should not throw about ideas that he was the "greatest" of anything. I also was unsure of whether general statements like "of all time" are very encyclopedic. Lastly, he wrote of only two instances of his childhood, he surely remembered more. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelancholia_i_cd54.html" title="User:Melancholia i">Melancholia i</a> 07:16, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there Amandajm. I love your article on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, to my mind it's nearly an FA-standard article.</p>
<p>You, or perhaps I, may have misunderstood the assessement process - it's purpose is not to 'grade' articles to reward authors or even to give pointers for improvement (although this is sometimes done) - primarily it serves to lump all of the architecture articles into specific categories which can then be used to improve the articles - so, editors might have a look in and decide to pick one and improve it to GA/FA standard (A-class is mostly reserved for either demoted FA-class articles or imminent FAC candidates which have been peer reviewed at <a href="../../../a/r/c/WP%7EARCHPR_78ed.html" title="WP:ARCHPR">WP:ARCHPR</a> - so it's not just one editor making the assessment, it can have some community involvement).</p>
<p>In grading articles which have an architectural component, I usually just consider how well the architectural aspects of the article have been dealt with. I have some logic for doing this on the basis that one of the FA criteria is that the article should be comprehensive. So it's quite possible that an article may have a different class grading depending on which wikiproject has graded it (doesn't the art wikiproject have an assessment department). Most articles are graded by <a href="../../../a/r/c/WP%7EARCHA_6c3c.html" title="WP:ARCHA">WP:ARCHA</a> as being just stub, start or B-class, GA-class and FA-class are automatically added when the article has successfully jumped through those hoops.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> is a bit of a bear pit at the moment in my opinion where the insistence of conformity over 'style' has taken over from any kind of insistence on quality information or it's accurate verification. I do however assess articles according to the current defacto FAC standards - thorough in-line citations seem to be the flavour of the month, so when you quote data eg. <i>The Sistine Chapel is 40.5 metres long and 14 metres wide. The ceiling is about 20 metres above the main floor of the chapel.</i> with no source, this will doubtless be an issue for them. You might also get some flack for the galleried images, but for the life of me, I can't think of a more appropriate article to use them in. If you'd like it reassessing - put it on <a href="../../../a/r/c/WP%7EARCHPR_78ed.html" title="WP:ARCHPR">WP:ARCHPR</a>, but as you say, it's an article about the painting and so you might be better off approaching the art wikiproject.

<p>I have my strong opinions, and I chose you for this question because of some prior edits of yours in the Leonardo article, though I am not sure who are the most respected editors on the topic. My position is that the evidence for any of these does not merit categorizing or even mentioning any of the three Italian names above as involved in pederasty. I have recently deleted such allusions in the Leonardo text. Is this the consensus opinion? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECARAVAGGISTI_a816.html" title="User:CARAVAGGISTI">CARAVAGGISTI</a> 19:34, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Leanardo article had a link blocked by the spam filters, but it was somewhat relavent, and i was unsure if it should or shouldnt be there; it was not because i am a new user (because im not). If i have time ill put the picture on the talk and see what people think.</p>

<p>Hi, Perhaps that was thoughtless of me, as I did not take your feelings into consideration when I made that edit. However, the material I inserted is also beyond dispute, and I was very disappointed that you upset the delicate balance we had achieved. I felt I had been extremely accommodating, and that you were taking advantage of the situation to have things completely your way. I will take another look to see what has been done now. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 12:31, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The present incarnation of that section reads like a bad joke, but there is nothing I can do about it since there are three editors invested in heterosexualizing the man, even going to the length of sticking there a woman's portrait. So it goes, you are doing the children a real service, they can now run happily around the school yard calling each other faggot, with nary a danger of having their heroes tainted. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 21:44, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your comments are emblematic of the negative, censorious mindset that first damns the man and then censors the article. You seem to miss the point that Leonardo's life is not about "having sex with underaged youths" but about loving. Having long term, life-long loving relationships with other males, finding them beautiful, putting up with their foibles, teaching them, receiving their devotion in return, making love with them when they were of an age for it (mind you that homosexual relationships in Italy today are legal between men and youths of fourteen and up, so that even in modern terms none of these youths were "underage", and in his days even less so as life was short and people lived quickly while they could and often married in their mid teens or even younger). So you have done it. You have projected every negative modern construct on Leonardo, showing what you really think of him and rationalizing your "defense" of him and of young people who should not be exposed to such nastiness. But I ask you, whose nastiness is it? Leonardo's or yours? <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 23:30, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I took another look at the article today, and wondered what the fuss was all about - by and large it was quite reasonably stated. So let me apologize for being heavy handed - one often writes things in the heat of passion which are later regretted. What criticisms I still have of the article I will state here. For one, I find the insertion of the woman's picture into the section on relationships to be both deceptive and dishonest. It seems intended to characterize as a lover of women a man who spent his affectional life among males. To anyone in the know it reads as a beard.</dd>

<dd>Second, I find the description of his relations with his apprentices as "sexual" simplistic and prurient. What is important about these relationships is not what he may have done in bed, but that he was in love with these youths. An "ardentissimo e sviscerato amore," remember? That is a very beautiful and economical phrase which conveys much more than ever "sexual" will, and is, too boot, far more authentic since it was written by Melzi himself. If I might retranslate it here for you in terms which I could not introduce into an article, it reads as "an utterly incinerating and eviscerating love," a graphic description which evokes Leonardo tearing open his body to offer his beating heart to the boy. So I would suggest working that phrase in, in the English rendering I gave it in the "Relationships" article, and perhaps describing his interests as "erotic" instead of sexual. It fits the man better as it is a term implying greater complexity. My criticism of you all along has been that your approach is reductionistic and modernizing.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, and I do not expect this to fall on receptive ears, this section will not be complete until we make brief mention that such relationships were universal at the time (fulminations of some other editors arguing ab silentio notwithstanding). That casts his relations in a totally different light, much as we do not today presume to blame Solon for his affairs with boys.</dd>

<p>Thank you for your note. Usually the only editing I can do is minor correction of spelling, punctuation, syntax, etc. Did I change a (correct) European spelling? The only possibility a quick look showed me was "pinion" for "pinnion," but I can't find the latter in a dictionary.</p>

<p>I've decided to call him Len - that's as in Len, Mick and Rafe.</p>
<p>Just deleted the addtion of this pestilential person who insists on adding L-as-vegetarian to the article. So bloody what! Maybe he picked his nose, too - should we add a para about Len as a famous nose-picker? Sheesh! I shall continue to police this one, as it really irritates me.</p>
<p>So, Beethoven's 7th? Consider the scene: a hospital maternity ward, doors open, nurse comes in with a baby, blast of trumpets, dah-dah-dah-daaaaaaaaaaaaah! "It's Mrs Beethoven's fifth!"</p>
