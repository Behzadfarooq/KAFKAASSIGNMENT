<p>Amateur radio licenses in the United States are issued and renewed without charge, although the private individuals who administer the examinations may recoup their expenses by charging a fee. Licenses currently remain valid for 10 years from the date of issuance.</p>
<ul>
<li>The entry-level license, known as <b>Technician Class</b>, is awarded after an applicant successfully completes a 35-question <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiple_choice.html" title="Multiple choice">multiple choice</a> written examination. The license grants full operating privileges on all amateur bands above 50 MHz and limited privileges in portions of the <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_Frequency_ced2.html" title="High Frequency">High Frequency</a> (HF) bands.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The next level, known as <b>General Class</b>, requires passage of the Technician test, as well as a 35-question multiple-choice General exam. General class licensees are granted privileges on portions of all amateur bands, and have access to over 83% of all amateur HF <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bandwidth.html" title="Bandwidth">bandwidth</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The top US license class is <b>Amateur Extra Class</b>. The Extra class license requires the same tests as General plus a 50-question multiple-choice theory exam. Those with Amateur Extra licenses are granted the greatest privileges on all US amateur bands.</li>
</ul>

<p>The current FCC classifications of licensing were not always the same, and in fact have evolved considerably since the program's inception (see <a href="#History_of_FCC.27s_amateur_licensing" title="">History of FCC's amateur licensing</a>, below). When the FCC made the most recent changes it allowed certain existing operator classes to remain under a <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grandfather_clause.html" title="Grandfather clause">grandfather clause</a>. These licenses would no longer be issued to new applicants, however, existing licenses were allowed to be modified or renewed.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Novice Class</b> operator license was for persons who had passed a 5 word per minute (wpm) <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morse_code.html" title="Morse code">Morse code</a> examination, but did not complete the written examination required for the Technician Class. Privileges included four bands in the HF range (3-30 MHz), one band in the VHF range (30-300 MHz), and one band in the UHF range (300-3,000 MHz). This class was eliminated when the FCC removed the Morse code component from all of its examinations in February 2007 (see <a href="#End_of_Morse_code_requirement" title="">End of Morse code requirement</a>, below).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Technician Plus</b> Class operator license was issued to Technician class licensees, who, in addition to passing the written examination, also had passed the 5 wpm telegraphy examination. A Technician Plus Class licensee was authorized the same privileges of a Technician Class licensees, plus the privileges of a Novice Class licensee. Technician Plus class operator licenses are currently converted to Technician Class licenses if renewed or if modified to show a vanity call sign.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Advanced Class</b> operator license, whose privileges included 275 kHz of additional spectrum in the HF bands.</li>

<p>Since 1984, US candidates wishing to become amateur radio licensees have appeared before volunteer examiners, or "VEs" who themselves are amateur radio licensees. Prior to 1984, many Novice exams were administered by volunteers, but all other exams were taken at <a href="../../../f/c/c/FCC_a44b.html" title="FCC">FCC</a> offices. Some of the exam times were not always convenient to candidates, so a few exceptions were allowed in cases where candidates were physically unable to get to the field offices (such as the Conditional license, elsewhere in this article). The FCC currently recognizes 14 Volunteer Examiner Coordinators, organizations that "coordinate the efforts of Volunteer Examiners (VEs) in preparing and administering amateur service operator license examinations."</p>

<p>Each operator is assigned a <b>call sign</b> which is used to identify the operator during transmissions.</p>
<p>Amateur operator and club call signs in the US take the format of one or two letters, then a numeral, and finally between one and three letters. The number of letters used in the call sign is determined by the operator's license class and the availability of letter combinations.</p>
<p>The format of the callsign is often abbreviated as <i>X-by-X</i> where a number in place of the X indicates the quantity of letters, separated by a numeral.</p>

<p>Established in the early 1900's, the FCC's licensing of amateur radio experimenters and operators evolved considerably. By 1964, there were six license classes; Novice, Technician, General, Conditional, Advanced, and Extra. Each license class required two exams, one on theory and one on Morse code, and was valid for five years.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Novice</b> class was the new entry-level license, and would remain so until April 15, 2000. It granted limited privileges &amp;mldsh Morse Code only, with limited transmitting power &amp;mldsh on just a few HF bands. To qualify for a Novice license, a candidate would have to pass a 5 word-per-minute Morse code test (send and receive) and a 25 (later 30) question multiple-choice test. The Novice Class license was valid for two years, as it was intended only as an entry level. Within those 2 years, the Novice was expected to move up to General (or Conditional). In 1978 the Novice changed into a renewable license with the same 5-year validity as other classes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <b>General</b> class originally conveyed full privileges on all ham bands, having passed a separate theory exam and 13 words-per-minute Morse code test.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Technician</b> license was awarded to Novices who passed the General Class theory test, known as <i>Element 3</i>, but who had not passed the 13 wpm Morse code element. Technicians were granted all General Class privileges above 50MHz and kept their Novice privileges on HF.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Conditional</b> license class was a special case. Prior to 1984, the FCC administered all license exams except those for Novice class. Hams who were unable to travel to their nearest FCC Field Office could have the test proctored by two hams with General (or higher) licenses, who would send the completed exam to the FCC for grading. Successful examinees were given Conditional licenses, which brought the same privileges as the General class. The FCC retained the right to require Conditional licensees to come in to an FCC office for retesting. The current Volunteer Examiner program evolved from the Conditional exam procedure. In 1978 all Conditional Class licenses became General Class.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Advanced</b> class, was earned after the General Class through passing the <i>Element 4A</i> theory exam.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Amateur Extra</b> class was reached by passing both the <i>Element 4B</i> (a theory test) and a 20 wpm Morse code test.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_radio_licensing_in_the_United_States_9931.html" title="Edit section: Incentive licensing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Incentive licensing</span></h3>
<p>In 1964, the FCC and the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Radio_Relay_League_f049.html" title="American Radio Relay League">American Radio Relay League</a> (ARRL) developed a program known as "Incentive Licensing," which rearranged the HF spectrum privileges. The General/Conditional and Advanced portions of the HF bands were reduced, with the spectrum reassigned to those in the Advanced and Amateur Extra classes. It was hoped that these special portions of the radio spectrum would provide an incentive for hams to increase their knowledge and skills, creating a larger pool of experts to lead the <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_Age_fae6.html" title="Space Age">Space Age</a>. The opposite happened, however, as new ham radio applications fell drastically.</p>
<p><a name="Novice_enhancement" id="Novice_enhancement"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_radio_licensing_in_the_United_States_9931.html" title="Edit section: Novice enhancement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Novice enhancement</span></h3>
<p>In the mid 1980s, the greatest number of licensees were in the Technician class. In 1987, a number of changes, later called the "Novice Enhancement," where introduced which divided the Technician class into two new classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Technician</b>, a simpler theory test, Element 2, was created instead of using the General Class's theory test (now called Element 3).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Technician Plus</b>, was issued to operators who could pass the new Element 3 theory test and the Novice Class's 5 wpm Morse code test (Element 1).</li>
</ul>
<p>The changes also granted Novices and Technician Plus classes limited voice privileges on the 10-meter HF band. Novices were also granted voice privileges on the 222MHz and 1200MHz portions of the radio spectrum with limited power. For the first time, Novices and Technicians were able to operate in voice modes on HF, though still in limited areas and limited power. It was hoped that this would prompt more hams to move up to General, once they had a chance to sample HF without a Morse key. It did have some effect.</p>
<p>The license were also extended from five years to ten years in 1984.</p>
<p><a name="Restructuring_in_2000" id="Restructuring_in_2000"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_radio_licensing_in_the_United_States_9931.html" title="Edit section: Restructuring in 2000">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Restructuring in 2000</span></h3>
<p>In 2000, a "restructuring" took place, with the greatest change being the elimination of the 13 WPM and 20 WPM Morse code tests in favor of a standardized of 5 words-per-minute as the sole Morse code requirement for both the General and Extra Class licenses.</p>
<p>This had several effects on the classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the Advanced Class was no longer issued, as it would only be separated from the Extra class only by the second half of the Element 4 theory exam.</li>
<li>Second, new applicants were no longer accepted into the Novice and Technician Plus classes. Although the Technician tests did not change, entry level applicants where all issued Technician classes. Those that could pass the 5 wpm Morse code test simply gained limited privileges on the HF bands.</li>
<li>The third effect was that pre-1987 Technician operators were now qualified to become General-class hams, having already passed both the Theory and Code exams now required for the higher class. All that was necessary was to apply for the General license.</li>
</ul>
<p>The restructuring also led many pre-1987 Technicians to study for and pass the Element 4 theory examination, becoming Extra-class operators, now that the 20WPM code barrier had been dropped to the 5WPM which they had already passed.</p>
