<h2><span class="mw-headline">Article Title</span></h2>
<p>I think this article ought to be renamed. Firstly, Why the single quote? Where did it come from? Secondly, "aman" is an abbreviation, I think the full name is more appropriate for an article title. In Israeli press in English, "Millitary Intelligence" is usually used. The correct name, as far as I know, is "Directorate of Military Intelligence". How about "Israeli Military Intelligence"?--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoron_5be3.html" title="User:Doron">Doron</a> 09:22, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>If there's no objection, I will rename this article to "Israeli Directorate of Military Intelligence".--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoron_5be3.html" title="User:Doron">Doron</a> 08:04, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><s>Based on what? I need to see a source — those agencies are known for their abbrevations. My question is, then, where did Israeli Directorate of Military Intelligence come from?</s> Intelligence Branch is just a direct translation. Two sources consulted are: <a href="http://www.archives.mod.gov.il/pages/MISC/operation.asp?AR=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.archives.mod.gov.il/pages/MISC/operation.asp?AR=1" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and <a href="http://www.tzafonet.org.il/kehil/school_tzafonet/csoolot/elicohen/modin.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tzafonet.org.il/kehil/school_tzafonet/csoolot/elicohen/modin.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 06:42, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, a brief search shows that it is used rather than a straight translation (<i>i.e.</i> single quotes), but A'man appears to be more well known through the abbrevation in English than the formal English name <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Aman%22+intelligence++Israel&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Aman%22+intelligence++Israel&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> (150,000) versus <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Directorate+of+Military+Intelligence%22+%22Israel%22&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Directorate+of+Military+Intelligence%22+%22Israel%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> (500). I think this name needs to be tackled first as this is what the agency is most notable for in English. I deleted the <i>Directorate of Military Intelligence</i> redirect and created instead a <a href="../../../d/i/r/Directorate_of_Military_Intelligence_%28Israel%29_90a7.html" title="Directorate of Military Intelligence (Israel)">Directorate of Military Intelligence (Israel)</a>, since a brief search DMI is used by other countries (South Africa, Sri Lanka, etc.), so it should be left open to all of them via country in parentheses. Let's forgo any further renamings pending further discussion. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 07:01, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC) — Oh, I seem to have deleted your <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_Directorate_of_Military_Intelligence_be11.html" title="Israeli Directorate of Military Intelligence">Israeli Directorate of Military Intelligence</a> redirect, misreading it for 'Directorate of Military Intelligence,' I only realized this now after having already created an the IDMI redirect. Heh.&#160;:) <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 07:56, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, Doron, if, for consistency, you wish to go against the current naming convention by opting in favour of the formal English terms for <a href="../../../y/a/m/YAMAM_9cbd.html" title="YAMAM">YAMAM</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magav.html" title="Magav">Magav</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/27/Ma%27shaz.html" title="Ma'shaz">Ma'shaz</a>, etc., note that the formal English name for the <a href="../../../m/o/s/Mossad.html" title="Mossad">Mossad</a>, for example, is <i>the Institute</i>, or in full, <i>the Institute for Intelligence and Special Tasks</i>, but, like <a href="../../../a/27/m/A%27man.html" title="A'man">A'man</a>, most English-speaking people know it as the Hebrew word: the Mossad. I did not simply pick A'man as a title of this article on a whim, many examples, but see in particular: <b><a href="http://www1.idf.il/Aman/" class="external text" title="http://www1.idf.il/Aman/" rel="nofollow">www1.idf.il/Aman</a></b> <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 07:25, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Oh, I forgot to mention, I used A'man because it makes sense phonetically. For example, see this correct use in: <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/anan1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/anan1.html" rel="nofollow">jewishvirtuallibrary.org</a>. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 07:30, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just for the record, Wikipedia naming policy is (generally) to use the most common english name. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">→Raul654</a> 07:31, Jun 20, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's what I thought. Thanks, Raul. Also, note, Doron, that using <a href="../../../a/27/m/A%27man.html" title="A'man">A'man</a> <i>viz.</i> <a href="../../../a/m/a/Aman.html" title="Aman">Aman</a> also has the additional advantage of sparing the name from an attached parnethesis, as the latter is the (rather notable in English as such) land of the Valar and Maiar in Tolkien's legendarium. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 07:49, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I wish this discussion had taken place before I made all the changes (I raised this issue almost a week ago).</p>
<ul>
<li>As for the single quote, why does it make sense phonetically? Single quote in Hebrew transliteration is usually used <i>before</i> a vowel for the letter 'ayin, which is clearly not the case.</li>
<li>As for Aman (with or without the quote), I'm not sure the popularity contest is the right way to choose article titles - suppose "the Zionist Entity" had got more google hits than "Israel", would you change the article title? (or for more concrete example, compare <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;biw=1270&amp;q=%22apple+macintosh%22+computer&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;biw=1270&amp;q=%22apple+macintosh%22+computer&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;biw=1270&amp;q=%22mac%22+computer&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;biw=1270&amp;q=%22mac%22+computer&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> for <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Macintosh_48d6.html" title="Apple Macintosh">Apple Macintosh</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=Weblog" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=Weblog" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=blog" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=blog" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> for <a href="../../../w/e/b/Weblog.html" title="Weblog">Weblog</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;biw=1270&amp;q=%22National+Socialist+German+Workers+Party%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;biw=1270&amp;q=%22National+Socialist+German+Workers+Party%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;biw=1270&amp;q=%22Nazi+Party%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;biw=1270&amp;q=%22Nazi+Party%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> for <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Socialist_German_Workers_Party_8d44.html" title="National Socialist German Workers Party">National Socialist German Workers Party</a>). There should be more concrete reasons to choose a title than just hit counts.</li>
<li>I find "Aman" to be somewhat informal and thus less appropriate for an encyclopedia entry title (even if it is widely used in mass media and on the web). In Israel it is formally referred to as <i>Agaf Modi'in</i>, it's official name (in contrast to the Mossad, whose original name is seldom used in Hebrew). I thought since it has an official name, it ought to be used.</li>
<li>As for my suggestion - <a href="http://www1.idf.il/DOVER/site/mainpage.asp?sl=EN&amp;id=4&amp;unit=17062&amp;srch=&amp;bScope=True" class="external autonumber" title="http://www1.idf.il/DOVER/site/mainpage.asp?sl=EN&amp;id=4&amp;unit=17062&amp;srch=&amp;bScope=True" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> has Director of Military Intelligence, which inspired me to google "Directorate of ..." and to find that it is more common than, say, "Branch of...".</li>
<li>I'm not sure how your link to the Hebrew website of IDF's Intelligence Corps is relevant.--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoron_5be3.html" title="User:Doron">Doron</a> 08:51, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Aman is used as per notability, like Mossad is used versus <i>the Institute</i> as I already mentioned per formal English terms. You seem to be saying yes populairy contest fo Mossad (in <i>English</i> and Hebrew) but not for Aman; I mentioned other agnecies as well. The other examples are not pertinent to this topic. I mean, it's good to see that my efforts on this article are so appreciated by you, but I would hope for some consistency nonetheless (ala <a href="../../../y/a/m/YAMAM_9cbd.html" title="YAMAM">YAMAM</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magav.html" title="Magav">Magav</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/27/Ma%27shaz.html" title="Ma'shaz">Ma'shaz</a>, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>My objection was to using a popularity contest (and google in particular) as the main criterion, I didn't say it didn't count at all. In the Mossad case, the direct translation is <i>never</i> used. And I didn't just arbitrarily choose the direct translation, I used what I <i>thought</i> was the official translation, though I couldn't be sure of it. The Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs website uses just "Military Intelligence", (and not "Aman"). I've already made similar changes in <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Border_Police_1ed2.html" title="Israel Border Police">Israel Border Police</a> and met no opposition, I suppose the final conclusion of this discussion would apply to it as well.--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoron_5be3.html" title="User:Doron">Doron</a> 09:51, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, this is a double standard. You want to use the formal name of A'man in English, but not that of the Mossad. Yes, notability of the name is key in this case, as per naming conevntions. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 10:10, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Alirght, so you found the formal English term, fine. I know about these from Hebrew, not English. I just wished to write the actual article (content-wise), which I have. (I already mentioned Director of MI in the body of the article, you did not need an external link to learn that, btw, Doron). Note that I have used: <a href="http://www1.idf.il/DOVER/site/mainpage.asp?sl=EN&amp;id=4&amp;unit=17062&amp;srch=&amp;bScope=True" class="external free" title="http://www1.idf.il/DOVER/site/mainpage.asp?sl=EN&amp;id=4&amp;unit=17062&amp;srch=&amp;bScope=True" rel="nofollow">http://www1.idf.il/DOVER/site/mainpage.asp?sl=EN&amp;id=4&amp;unit=17062&amp;srch=&amp;bScope=True</a> already to create <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Defense_Forces_0099.html#The_General_Staff" title="Israel Defense Forces">Israel_Defense_Forces#The_General_Staff</a>, so I am well aware of that link and its designations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Hebrew link uses <b>Aman</b>, that is how it is relavent — Aman obviously has no site of its own, and as the ICorps falls under its jurisdiction, this is no coincedence</li>

<dd>Now you may ignore all my arguments above and just answer me this: do you think, following the same logic, that we should rename <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Defense_Force_7039.html" title="Israel Defense Force">Israel Defense Force</a> to IDF, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_Israel_12ff.html" title="Communist Party of Israel">Communist Party of Israel</a> to Maki, <a href="../../../n/a/h/Nahmanides.html" title="Nahmanides">Nahmanides</a> to Ramban, etc.?</dd>
<dd>I would also appreciate it if you could spare me the time and explain to me the single quote, which is the thing that bothers me the most.--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoron_5be3.html" title="User:Doron">Doron</a> 12:06, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>That's unfair. I said I <i>was</i> being abrasive, so there is no need to emphasize the <i>are</i> (?!). And I argue that it is you who are ignoring my arguments. And it is you who are changing lons-standing conventions, for these articles (A'man, Magav), and as per the principle (most common name in English). I made the changes to correspond with the re-re-name, you can change any back that make less that way considering that the name of the article is A'man. The Israeli Defence Forces are more well known in English than T'zahal and <a href="../../../i/d/f/IDF_f68d.html" title="IDF">IDF</a> needed to serve as disambaguation page, <a href="http://www.maki.org.il/english/english.html" class="external text" title="http://www.maki.org.il/english/english.html" rel="nofollow">Communist Party of Israel</a> advertises itself as the CPI in English (about 1000 hits for each, so it's clear which to choose), and yes, if Ramban is more well-known in Egnlish (significantly as A'man versus IDMI, Mossad versus the Institute. Now, I have made my case rationally and with some rpetition about the naming convention, and I stand by my point. And it appears that Raul agrees with me. I take excpetion to your accusation that I forced anything. I'll make changes as I see fit, based on rational considerations, and I expect you to do the same. And, again, I stand by all my points. If you want to have a discussion: fine, but I just hope I won't need to repeat myself because I used some examples here over three times now. Finally, I explained the single quote, I provided a link for it, I explained the discrapency with the existing <a href="../../../a/m/a/Aman.html" title="Aman">Aman</a> did you read it closey? Or do you mean, single quotes for Intelligence Branch which denoted it being a translation. I hope this dosen't go on for much longer like this.

<li>I thought the comment ending with the ":)" mark made it clear that I was trying to cool the discussion down, not stir it. My poor sense of humor needs some refinement, perhaps.</li>
<li>I think it is better to have a discussion before a disputable modification rather than the usual revert war, which is why I proposed this change and waited for some time without objections before applying it (I admit I didn't do so in the magav case, though no-one has complained). I think it is unfair to revert everything while the discussion is still on-going (and I wouldn't retaliate by re-reverting everything back as is often done in Wikipedia). I would have been happy to revert it all myself and save you the trouble of scanning for my changes, if we'd have concluded that I was wrong in renaming the article - I don't enjoy vandalizing Wikipedia in my spare time.</li>
<li>In the <a href="http://www.police.gov.il" class="external text" title="http://www.police.gov.il" rel="nofollow">Israel Police website</a>, the word "magav" doesn't even appear in the text (it appears once as part of a URL and twice as part of an email address) and "Border Police" appears 12 times (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?biw=1270&amp;hl=en&amp;q=site%3Apolice.gov.il+%22border+police%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?biw=1270&amp;hl=en&amp;q=site%3Apolice.gov.il+%22border+police%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:police.gov.il+%22magav%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;filter=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:police.gov.il+%22magav%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>); In the <a href="http://www.mfa.gov.il" class="external text" title="http://www.mfa.gov.il" rel="nofollow">Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs website</a> "magav" appears 4 time and "Border Police" appears 293 times (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;biw=1270&amp;q=site%3Amfa.gov.il+%22border+police%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;biw=1270&amp;q=site%3Amfa.gov.il+%22border+police%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:mfa.gov.il+%22magav%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;filter=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=site:mfa.gov.il+%22magav%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>). This leads me to believe the official English name is Israel Border Police, and "Magav" is just a nickname based on the pronounciation of the Hebrew abbreviation MGv. I wish Aman had a website that would tell us once and for all what their English name is.</li>
<li>You could save yourself a lot of time if you would simply exmplain why the single quote. You do not explain anywhere why A'man (rather than Aman), <i>None</i> of the links you have provided explains why it is so, and only one of them even has this form.--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoron_5be3.html" title="User:Doron">Doron</a> 13:25, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Searching it in the official Israeli website is not a sound approach, I used goodle. I'd like to see your belief substantiated with something definitive as to what the border guard is called. Magav is not a nickname, it is the abbervaiation which is most common in English. Smae with A'man, this is the bottom line for English naming conventions.</li>

<dd>Ridden with guilt for demoralzing you, I'll drop my "directorate of..." suggestion for now; I've written an email to IDF and police spokesperson offices as to what's the official English names, I hope this should satisfy you. In the meantime, I insist on the quote mark. The <a href="http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/taatiq.html" class="external text" title="http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/taatiq.html" rel="nofollow">Academy of Hebrew Language</a> have never heard of your transliteration rules, apparently, as they make no mention of using the single quote and I have no idea what you mean by "it's phonetic" which you keep repeating without explaining. The closest thing to your suggested transliteration is the use of the <i>double</i> quote mark where it is used in Hebrew. If this is what you meant by "it's phonetic", then it should be Ama"n, not A'man. Neither of them is particularly esthetic, but Ama"n is at least correct. This rule goes for all the other abbreviations you introduced - hama"n, moda"sh, etc.. If you do not provide a more rigorous justification to your spelling, I will rename it to Ama"n (if the reply from the spokesperson's offices confirms Aman, that is). If you become discouraged to write articles for one reason or another, it would be a pity, I don't see any reason why you should share this with me unless you think it is my fault.--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoron_5be3.html" title="User:Doron">Doron</a> 18:19, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Raul, let me be clear: <b>1.</b> If Doron, in his very selective hearing here, implements his <i>Directorate of</i> suggestion, then the Mossad needs to be renamed as The Institute. I already explained very clearly why, and he has ignored that; I am trying very hard to assume goodfaith, but it seems increasingly to be spite (and yes, I share it with him for a reason). <b>2.</b> As for the dreaded apostrophe (and perhaps Doron has heard of <a href="http://www.google.co.il/search?hl=iw&amp;q=+++%22Ha%27aretz&amp;btnG=%D7%97%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A9&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.il/search?hl=iw&amp;q=+++%22Ha%27aretz&amp;btnG=%D7%97%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A9&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">Ha<b>'</b>aretz Daily Newspaper</a>), the use of the apostrophe in transliterating Hebrew is well-known, and I do not feel obliged to explain to him its rules at length. He can review this article, though, aptly named <a href="http://www.forward.com/issues/2002/02.11.15/arts5.html" class="external text" title="http://www.forward.com/issues/2002/02.11.15/arts5.html" rel="nofollow">"Apostrophe Now"</a>, <i>Philologos</i>, 2002. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 22:10, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Finally, Doron's source (based on 1957 rules), which does state: ראשי תיבות. ראשי תיבות הגויים כמילים נכתבים כמילים רגילות עם מירכאות. למשל: מנכ"ל manka"l, בע"מ be`a"m [<i>i.e.</i> be--&gt;`&lt;--a"m], שו"ת shu"t. ראשי תיבות שאינם הגויים רצוי לכתבם מלא, <u>also mentions that</u>: "אחידות. השימוש בתעתיק מוסכם מבטיח לכותב שהקורא יצליח לפענח את הטקסט שכתב. ככל שתהיה אחידות בשימוש הסימנים, יוכלו המשתמשים להתרגל לכתב הן ככותבים הן כקוראים. עם זאת, בכללים המפורטים להלן הוצע במקרים יחידים סימן חלופי לצד הסימן המומלץ. נראה שבמקום שיש חלופות יכריעו בסופו של דבר המשתמשים מה יהיה הסימן המוסכם. מכל מקום את החלופות המוצעות אי אפשר להבין בשום דרך אחרת," which is certainly something to keep in mind, as I have scarcely seen the usage as seen in the former passage employed recently, and the article already explains that it is an abbrevation. There is no need to confuse the reader needlessly, just as there is no need to call the Mossad <i>The Institute</i> or A'man as <i>The Directorate</i>. Lastly, note how <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazon.com.html" title="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, which I'm sure can afford compotent translators, uses <i>A'man</i> in its editorial reviews of Samuel M. Katz <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0891415262/102-7303979-8628956?v=glance" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0891415262/102-7303979-8628956?v=glance" rel="nofollow"><i>Soldier Spies: Israeli Military Intelligence</i></a>, etc. Not <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> on my part. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 22:38, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lastly, as for Doron changing the name of <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magav.html" title="Magav">Magav</a> (<u>border guard</u>) into Border Police, I was wandering whether he happned, upon changing Magav's official site's name from "Magav official site" into "Border Police official website" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israel_Border_Police&amp;diff=14659454&amp;oldid=13503877" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israel_Border_Police&amp;diff=14659454&amp;oldid=13503877" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, to actually <u>visit</u> that website. Had he done this, he would have seen that Magav titles itself as <i>Border Guard</i>. Don't take my word for it, Raul, click on the site yourself (and of course, note the infamously irrelavent words used in the url): <a href="http://www.police.gov.il/english/BorderGuard/Mission/00_about.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.police.gov.il/english/BorderGuard/Mission/00_about.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.police.gov.il/english/BorderGuard/Mission/00_about.asp</a> Sorry that I don't have the time to go through these basics and doing the preliminary resarch that he should have done upon changing the name. <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 23:04, 20 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

Had it been so, I would have suggested "Intelligence Department" (rather than "directorate" = <i>hanhala</i>), and "Border Guard" (rather than "police" = <i>mishtara</i>). The rule I <i>am</i> suggesting is to use the <i>official</i> English name, you know, letting these bodies decide for themselves what they are called in English.

The Academy's rules are similar. Therefore <b>using the apostrophe is wrong in "A'man", "Matk'al", "A'gam", "Ha'man", "Moda'sh"</b> (though it's perfectly correct in "Be'eri", for example).

<p><a name="Apostrophe" id="Apostrophe"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Apostrophe</span></h2>
<p>I would like to restart the discussion about apostrophes in the article (and in the title in particular). I strongly believe the apostrophes are misplaced in all the transliterations of Hebrew abbreviations that appear in this article, specifically: A'man, A'gam, Ha'man, Moda'sh and Matk'al (in cotranst to Be'eri and Ya'alon, which are correct). I am aware that such spelling may appear elsewhere occasionally, but I claim it is incorrect nevertheless.</p>
<p>The article <a href="http://www.forward.com/issues/2002/02.11.15/arts5.html" class="external text" title="http://www.forward.com/issues/2002/02.11.15/arts5.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Apostrophe Now</i></a>, provided by <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">El C</a>, states three cases in which the apostrophe is used in Hebrew-to-English transliteration:</p>
<ol>
<li>To indicate a glottal stop (such as Yisra'el or Gil'ad). By definition, it must come before a vowel; this only occurs in "Matk'al", though still not applicable, as there is no glottal stop here, the word is composed of two syllables, "mat" and "kal".</li>
<li>Following a <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schwa.html" title="Schwa">schwa</a>. This is not applicable to any of the five.</li>
<li>To separate proclitic prepositions and articles from the main word. This is not applicable to any of the five.</li>
</ol>
<p>A Hebrew article on <a href="http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/taatiq.html" class="external text" title="http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/taatiq.html" rel="nofollow">transliteration</a> by the <a href="../../../a/c/a/Academy_of_the_Hebrew_Language_d796.html" title="Academy of the Hebrew Language">Academy of the Hebrew Language</a> gives similar rules. In addition, it states that an apostrophe should be added where a pair of letters may be mistaken for a <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digraph_%28orthography%29.html" title="Digraph (orthography)">digraph</a> (such as mats'hiv or mat'sis), also not applicable to any of the five. Also, apostrophe may be used to distinguish between <i>alef</i> and <i>`ayin</i> (though the grave accent (`) is preferred), which is also not applicable here as there is no <i>`ayin</i> in any of the five abbreviations.</p>
<p>Therefore I propose to remove the apostrophes from all of the abovementioned abbreviations, including renaming the article, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>They constitute incorrect spelling, and even if such spelling is sometimes used elsewhere, Wikipedia shouldn't propagate it.</li>
<li>They are less esthetic spellings.</li>
<li>The spelling without the apostrophe is arguably more common.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another issue is the very use of some of these abbreviations. I think "Haman" and "Matkal" are better substituted with "Intelligence Corps" and "General Staff", respectively.</p>
<p>Finally, if my suggestion is accepted and "A'man" is transformed into "Aman", then a new name for the article is needed, since <a href="../../../a/m/a/Aman.html" title="Aman">Aman</a> is already in use. I suggest "Aman (military intelligence)" or "Aman (IDF)". Any other suggestions? --<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoron_5be3.html" title="User:Doron">Doron</a> 08:48, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Well, since there are no objections, I will proceed by removing all incorrect apostrophes <i>except for the ones in A'man</i> (because those would require renaming the article). I urge editors to propose an alternative name for "Aman" (without the apostrophe) or otherwise point out why there should be an apostrophe).--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoron_5be3.html" title="User:Doron">Doron</a> 11:50, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
