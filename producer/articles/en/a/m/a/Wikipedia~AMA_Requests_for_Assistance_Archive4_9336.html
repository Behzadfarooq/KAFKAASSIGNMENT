<h3><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominick_690e.html" title="User:Dominick">User:Dominick</a></span></h3>
<p>I request assistance with user Dominick, who has been stalking me, sabotaging my work. The animus stems from a dispute concerning the entry <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traditionalist_Catholics_263f.html" title="Traditionalist Catholics">Traditionalist Catholics</a>, which is about to go into mediation. Meanwhile, Dominick is following me around removing links to a traditional Catholic site (and specific pages at the site) he does not like. A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed a link to the page "Religious Life" from the entry "Nuns."</li>
<li>Removed link to a screen capture of EWTN's priests calling the Novus Ordo a "complete fabrication" from the entry "Novus Ordo Missae."</li>
<li>Removed a link to Jewish-Christian relations section from the entry "Jewish-Christian Reconciliation."</li>
<li>Removed link to Epiphany customs from the entry "Epiphany."</li>
<li>Removed another link to the page called "Religious Life" from the entry "Religious Order."</li>
<li>Removed link to site's index page from the entry "Catholicism"</li>
<li>Removed link to the site's index page from the entry "Apologetics"</li>
<li>Removed link to page on the Feast of St. Anthony from the entry "Anthony of Padua."</li>
<li>Removed link to page on the Feast of St. Brigid from the entry "Brigid of Ireland."</li>
<li>Removed link to page called "Votive Offerings" from the entry "Ex-voto."</li>
<li>Removed link to pages on the Days of the Dead from an entry "Day of the Dead."</li>
<li>Removed a link to a page on Twelfthnight from an entry called "Twelfth Night".</li>
<li>Removed a link to a page on Catholic funerals from an entry called "Requiem."</li>

<dd>Please answer this one, this preempts my own action. I have a list of problems with this user's conduct. ALso the links I removed are link to this users own website, that this person runs, and often are out of context and portrayed as an "official" Catholic position. <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominick_690e.html" title="User:Dominick">Dominick</a> <a href="../../../d/o/m/User_talk%7EDominick_f59a.html" title="User talk:Dominick"><sup>(TALK)</sup></a> 16:44, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I may be able to help, but I would need to know exactly what remedies or services you are seeking? Informal mediation? Arbitration? Keep in mind that neither of these remedies are approrpaitely requested here, but I may be willing to help if there is a clear request.Gator (talk) 16:48, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>To Dominick: No, the site in question is a traditional Catholic website. If you can find the word "official" -- or anything remotely resembling it -- associated with the links in question, let us know.</p>
<p>To Gator: I am not sure what services I am seeking, but as to remedies, I want him to stop harrassing me, stalking me, erasing perfectly good and relevant links simply because he doesn't like them, libeling me, etc. Used2BAnonymous 16:53, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I need a more precise idea of what you want. We here at the AMA are not enforders of policy. You might want to try an admin for that. If you and Dominick would like to enter an informal mediation, I might be able to be of some service. other than that, you might want to try adn take your request somewhere else.Gator (talk) 18:12, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sure I think this can be handled informally. It would be better for U2BA. I will not enter in a debate here, Gator. I will say the site in question is an extremist view traditional website, that is owned by the linker. I explained that wikipedia is not a site traffic enhancer. She got mad, she wants mediation. If she has good faith I think a mediator can explain it. So far another admin could not work with her. <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominick_690e.html" title="User:Dominick">Dominick</a> <a href="../../../d/o/m/User_talk%7EDominick_f59a.html" title="User talk:Dominick"><sup>(TALK)</sup></a> 19:30, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK, I'm going ot advise Used2BAnonymous to file an RFC (request for comment) against Dominick if she really feels that Dominick is stalking, libeling etc. her. This really isn't the right place for this.Gator (talk) 20:02, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>This issue is moot:</b> u2ba has left, the hundred-odd links she added to her site in various articles have been removed as linkspam.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Biased Arbitrators and invisible accusations "Help!"</span></h3>
<p>I would like to request some assistance and advice over some unfair treatment I suspect I have been subject to. I have been participating in a content dispute in an article for the past five months. About a month ago, I requested arbitration (after having requested for comment and proposing mediation) on the grounds that my edits were combatable with Wikipedia policy and were backed by reliable sources, as opposed to the individual who I was complaining about, whose edits were not and he refused to co-operate despite the many concessions I had made. The first arbitrator to respond said that he rejects the case and says that he may complain about me because my edits were found insulting by a proportion of the people who the article was in reference to. I did not complain about his vote, but I did complain about the fact that he suggests that I was in the wrong and could have arbitration brought against me, and I asked him to explain that to me, given that Wikipedia policy clearly says that my edits are perfectly acceptable and I suggested that he may be displaying <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double_standards.html" title="Double standards">double standards</a>, as he conveniently chooses which policies are binding and which ones are not. He then changes his vote and says that he would like the case to be about my behaviour. His proposal was accepted and I now have an arbitration case brought against me for the purpose of considering my behaviour. When I asked him what was I being accused of, he just said that they will be considering my behaviour. I asked the other arbitrators who accepted the case the same question and I received similar replies. This seems unfair to me: I believe that I have the right to know what I am being accused of. How am I supposed to defend myself if I don't know what I am being accused of? I also suspect bias, as the arbitrator may have not taken kindly to my suggestion of double standards. A casual glance at his talk page would reveal that his "way of doing things" has been questioned before. I would like an advocate to have a word with the arbitrators and notify them that having an arbitration case brought against me without specific accusations is unfair and wrong, and ask them to make specific accusations or to drop the case. I need to know what I am being accused of. Saying that the purpose of the case is to "consider my behaviour" does not refer to any specific transgression nor to any particular aspect of my behaviour. I tried to guess what they were referring to and made an appropriate statement, the problem now it that it exceeds 2000 words and there is a 500-word limit. If I knew what I am being accused of, then I could remove the redundant parts. This whole case is unfair: <b>I have the right to know the accusations against me so that I can defend myself. It is not fair for them to conceal them from me and then expect me to defend myself adequately. All other arbitration cases have specific accusations against the "defendant". Why not me?</b> Any advocate who would be willing to assist me will have to have a good knowledge of procedure. I really need help with this. I have prepared a whole lot of evidence including diffs. I would like the advocate who accepts this case to e-mail me (my e-mail can be found on my user page), as I will require strict confidentiality over this issue until it is solved. The arbitration case is <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_REX_1206.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/REX">here</a>. Thank you.

This person would make a lot of damage to Serb community, as well as to relations between Serb community and others communities from Balkans on this Wikipedia (Bosniak and Croatian). He is spreading Serb nationalism, and incorrect information, it seems that he devoted his life to spread lies, and propaganda.</p>
<p>He keeps deleting some parts of the article called <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republika_Srpska_295d.html" title="Republika Srpska">Republika Srpska</a>, like this, making fun of <a href="../../../s/r/e/Srebrenica_massacre.html" title="Srebrenica massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a>:</p>
<p><i>On October 4, 2005, the Special Serb Government Working Group of Republika Srpska reported that 25,083 people were involved in the massacre including 19,473 members of various Bosnian Serb armed forces that actively gave orders or directly took part in the massacre. They have identified 17,074 by name.</i></p>
<p>Also he keeps renaming <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bosnian_language.html" title="Bosnian language">Bosnian language</a> into Bosniak language, which is incorrect information, because there is just Bosnian language in <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO-639_dc78.html" title="ISO-639">ISO-639</a> standard, and in English. (This is a special Serb policy toward Bosnian language, some kind of denying Bosnian language spreading incorrect information.)</p>
<p>Some other users which work on <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republika_Srpska_295d.html" title="Republika Srpska">Republika Srpska</a> article, support the request for assistence.</p>
<p>I have warnd him in his talk page, and few times in <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republika_Srpska_295d.html" title="Republika Srpska">Republika Srpska</a> article, but that didn't stop him.

<p>This fellow is a prolific editor and writes very, very short stubs. Some people tried to help him but he doesn't learn well. Some of his very short stubs have been expanded into very good articles. For some reason his behavior is regarded as bad for Wikipedia, though I see no evidence that he has ever failed to edit in good faith. His case is now in the evidence phase before the arbitration committee. I would recommend that he apply to AMA himself, but I don't think he'd know how to do that.</p>

<p>A user is repeatedly making reverts to the pages of <a href="../../../r/e/z/Reza_Pahlavi_II_6802.html" title="Reza Pahlavi II">Reza Pahlavi II</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi_06b7.html" title="Mohammad Reza Pahlavi">Mohammad Reza Pahlavi</a> for the past few days. This person refuses to take part in a discussion on the topic, and simply seems to ignore the reasoning which is - as it seems -accepted by all other contributors to the page. He/She shows no interest in finding an intermediate solution either, and simply makes reverts all the time. Several warnings have not been useful. The person likely is using a dynamic IP address which these days has been 219.93.174.107 and more recently 219.93.174.105 (That it is the same person is clear from the type of revert, which is exactly the same.) This, I beleive, qualifies as vandalism, as the points of dispute are simple historical facts, agreed upon also by others in the discussion page. The person does not give any reasoning for their behavior, either, and is effectively undermining the validity of the articles by their his/her behavior.

I've explained my views, and I've asked him to explain why has he made those changes both in the article's discussion page, and his user's discussion page, and not only he hasn't replied, but he has gone so far as to delete my explanation from his page saying i was smearing. Can someone check it? I haven't done anything wrong and I've followed the procedure when editting the pages, explained my changes, contacted the other user only to find disdain and scorn, I haven't written any unsuitable information, I'm just triying to make sure that rumours and POVs are left out of the article, specially when they're "backed" with false irrelevant information, in a language other than english. I don't want to start an edit war, but leaving the article as it is now is not an option.</p>

<p>This user has made a small career for himself by plagarising materials he does not own copyright to, in the field of <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_modification.html" title="Body modification">body modification</a>. He is using Wikipedia to advance his personal agenda, and may also be using it to promote his products. His repeated removal of links to Body Modification E-Zine articles that are either source material for Wikipedia edits or are highly relevant to the entry that contains them and his repeated vandalism of the Wikipedia entry on <a href="../../../b/m/e/BME_7d6d.html" title="BME">BME</a> evidence this. Due to the fact that he derives personal income from selling compilations of other people's copyrighted materials, I believe it is a conflict of interest for him to even edit body modification pages at all. In the past several days, he has vandalised <a href="../../../b/m/e/BME_7d6d.html" title="BME">BME</a>, <a href="../../../b/o/d/Body_Piercing_538e.html" title="Body Piercing">Body Piercing</a> and <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tattoo.html" title="Tattoo">tattoo</a>.

<p>I think I about had it with the new royalist fashion of no longer naming people the way they are known best/referred to most often (as the <i>basic</i> wikipedia guidelines would have it). These people ar warring for ages on the pages regarding the guidelines about how nobility should be named (in the title, in the article text, how they should be adressed, even if dead for millenia, etc..., etc...). The folly has hit <a href="../../../b/j/a/WP%7EBJAODN_1a71.html" title="WP:BJAODN">WP:BJAODN</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/m/Wikipedia%7ELamest_edit_wars_ever_e4b1.html" title="Wikipedia:Lamest edit wars ever">wikipedia:lamest edit wars ever</a> several times, to the point one starts thinking these people are trying to achieve notoriety by being mentioned on these pages as often as they can.</p>

I reverted explaining that it is best to have <i>the simplest unambiguous name according to which someone is known</i>, re-redirecting all double redirects (about 10). A few hours later re-reverted by <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">User:John Kenney</a> (who forgot to re-redirect Willem van Oranje of the Netherlands), giving as edit note: <i>This is a perfectly recognizable name, and is clearer, and it follows the naming policy.</i> No, the name is <i><b>not</b></i> clearer to anyone who is used to talk about the guy (the clearer name would be the "Orange-Nassau" variant; and "William I of Orange" is perfectly in order with naming policies of whatever kind).</p>

<p>This request is relating to a possible systemic bias. In my opinion, the core issue of the dispute is concerning NPOV as I explain here: <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_AI_Workshop_b27a.html#Locus_of_dispute" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/AI/Workshop">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/AI/Workshop#Locus of dispute</a>. I am requesting impartial arbitrators to address this arbitration specifically the "locus of dispute" which has, so far, been mainly ignored by <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">User:MarkSweep</a> (who filed the RfArb just prior to his nomination as admin). The locus of the dispute has mainly been ignored by the administrators currently working on the arbitration. Instead they have been focusing on symptoms of the dispute instead of the basic and original dispute concerning NPOV or several highly controversial articles. I view the RfArb as a filibuster to avoid the issue regarding NPOV.</p>
<p>Note: I have never even been the subject of RfC and there has not been a RfM concerning this dispute over NPOV. One RfM was filed but I view it as another filibuster focusing on symptoms rather than the actual dispute. That RfM was not accepted. It should be taken into a consideration that I am a Scientologist and I would appreciate arbitrators who are not biased against Scientology.

<hr />
<p>I am still waiting for any assistance.</p>
<p>In the meantime, because of Wikipedia's lack of concern I have adopted an attitude that Wikipedia is incompetant and damaging to the global society. Time has indicated that the arbitration on me is being coordinated by critics of Scientology who are attempting to prevent me from contributing important data regarding the critics. My information is substantiated and necessary to NPOV the articles on <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnie_Lerma_2c17.html" title="Arnie Lerma">Arnie Lerma</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Touretzky_d2ed.html" title="David Touretzky">David Touretzky</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Henson_dfaf.html" title="Keith Henson">Keith Henson</a>, <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenu.html" title="Xenu">Xenu</a>, and <a href="../../../f/i/s/Fishman_affidavit.html" title="Fishman affidavit">Fishman affidavit</a>. I am under attack by a cabal of "Critics of Scientology" and their sock puppets and their front man MarkSweep has filed an arbitration on me without while ignoring any problems with the other contributors simply because I am the Scientologist and cleaning up the misinformation and propaganda. For example, Lerma was convicted of his copyright violation yet he has Maureen D(Drueck) working on the article reverting my addition. Please see talk pages on these articles. Their actions are outrageous yet I am the one being scrutinized because the information I present is the truth and damaging to their position which is built on lies!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a complaint against <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">UninvitedCompany</a>, an administrator. Basically, he violated the blocking policy, by blocking me (for 72 hours) after I made 2 reverts, claiming I had broken the 3RR policy listing 4 reverts - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Bible_and_history&amp;diff=20370332&amp;oldid=20354011" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Bible_and_history&amp;diff=20370332&amp;oldid=20354011" rel="nofollow">22:51 5 August 2005</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Bible_and_history&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=20370467" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Bible_and_history&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=20370467" rel="nofollow">23:00 5 August 2005</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Bible_and_history&amp;diff=20398348&amp;oldid=20376050" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Bible_and_history&amp;diff=20398348&amp;oldid=20376050" rel="nofollow">08:58 6 August</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Bible_and_history&amp;diff=20437729&amp;oldid=20422234" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Bible_and_history&amp;diff=20437729&amp;oldid=20422234" rel="nofollow">23:12 6 August 2005</a> - however, none of these cover a period over 24 hours. At the time of the fourth revert listed, there was only 1 prior revert in the prior 24 hours. This is also true for the time of the 3rd revert listed.</p>
<p>I accused UnivitedCompany of breaking the blocking policy, and UnivitedCompany openly admitted doing so - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:-Ril-&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=20473667" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:-Ril-&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=20473667" rel="nofollow">"I have indeed violated the letter of the blocking policy"</a>. I also accused UninvitedCompany of blocking me because he/she has an anti-Islamic POV and didn't like the fact that I was opposing anti-Islamic POV pushers, UninvitedCompany replied admitting that they have an "extremely anti-Islamic" POV -<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A-Ril-&amp;diff=20538731&amp;oldid=20534086" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A-Ril-&amp;diff=20538731&amp;oldid=20534086" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>I don't feel this is appropriate behaviour for an administrator - violating blocking policy, and reinterpreting 3RR as 1RR, simply to punish people whose opinions they disagree with, isn't really something that should be permissable. Several administrators have already stated that the block was probably inappropriate (and none have supported UninvitedCompany's stance), but they seem unwilling to become involved (possibly due to UninvitedCompany's status as a longstanding admin (which UninvitedCompany claims makes them a "senior administrator", a post which simply does not exist), not that a cabal exists).</p>
<p>I would like to raise an RFC over the matter, but I need a co-signatory to do so, so I was wondering if someone else would be able to look into the matter.</p>

<p>This is still ongoing, and it's getting more and more petty. I've been asked to prove that a political party that all the major news networks in canada say is right wing, is seen by most as right wing. The argument is "the party calls itself centrist". well the communist party of the USSR called itself democratic. I am a political science major, and I've spent my entire life, however short its been, studying political parties. I am more certain that this party is right wing then I am that breaking your bones will hurt, its something I KNOW because for YEARS my studies have shown the same thing. I'm starting to get really aggrivated, this guy seems to be wanting to re-write history, and thats not popular with me. can somoene help? <a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPellaken_97c4.html" title="User:Pellaken">Pellaken</a> 19:08, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Request for assistance - personal attacks and legal threats</span></h3>
<p>Hello - I would like to file a request for assistance in a dispute with <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a>. SlimVirgin has behaved in an extremely hostile manner towards me for the past several weeks after I filed an RfC against two of her editor friends for violating wikipedia policies in an article content dispute. She has attacked me personally several times over the talk pages of several articles and in another RfC complaint against a different editor for personal attacks. She is currently attempting to expunge my additions and exclude me from participation on the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chip_Berlet_64c2.html" title="Chip Berlet">Chip Berlet</a> article for POV reasons (she is openly friends with the individual who is the subject of this article - himself a controversial political figure - and is actively trying to insulate him from sourced criticism by his political opponents). She has been extremely uncooperative in attempts to resolve a disagreement over this article's content and, in response to a proposal I made for revising the disputed content, she openly announced that she intends to exclude me from participating there. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AChip_Berlet&amp;diff=20568681&amp;oldid=20568521" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AChip_Berlet&amp;diff=20568681&amp;oldid=20568521" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>In this same message she made several statements alluding to legal proceedings, which I consider to be a legal threat in violation of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_legal_threats_370c.html" title="Wikipedia:No legal threats">Wikipedia:No legal threats</a>. I have repeatedly voiced my objections to her comments against me, which I consider to be personal attacks, and have directed her repeatedly to <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">Wikipedia:No personal attacks</a> in an attempt to get her to stop. SlimVirgin has been cautioned against personal attacks by the Arbcom before, which ruled "<a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a> is cautioned not to make personal attacks, even under severe perceived provocation."<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Lyndon_LaRouche_2#Caution_to_SlimVirgin_on_personal_attacks" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Lyndon_LaRouche_2#Caution_to_SlimVirgin_on_personal_attacks" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> I have also reminded her of this in an attempt to caution her against further attacks on me, but she has continued. Any assistance you could offer on this matter would be greatly appreciated. SlimVirgin is, unfortunately, an administrator herself and as such has many other administrator friends whereas I am only an editor, so a member advocate is very much needed in this case.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Pseudoscientific attack</span></h3>
<p>Several pages to do with historic measures and weights are currently under attack.</p>
<p>Revert wars are obviously not going to solve the problem, and discussions have proven futile.</p>
<p>One could probably claim that these are acts of vandalism, which I guess would solve the problem, but I'm convinced the person who does this sincerely believes in his <i><a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a></i>, so lets call it that.</p>
<p>The user in question seems to have operated under 3 different IDs: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=69.164.70.243" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=69.164.70.243" rel="nofollow">69.164.79.243</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=66.200.223.112" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=66.200.223.112" rel="nofollow">66.200.223.112</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rktect_e626.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rktect">rktect</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the claims made are classic <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscientific_metrology.html" title="Pseudoscientific metrology">pseudoscientific metrology</a>,</p>
<p>but additional problems are a totally arcane Wiki markup, total disrespect for conventions for discussion pages, and typically pasting vast amounts of more or less irrelevant text into articles and talk pages, totally blurring them.</p>
<p>Many articles have been subject to the contributions of this user. Some are currently under control, most are not. For a good example of what the edits consist of, see this example (reverting one <i>attack</i>): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mile&amp;diff=20531931&amp;oldid=20515153" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mile&amp;diff=20531931&amp;oldid=20515153" rel="nofollow">Mile (diff)</a>.</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also agree that this is a problem; I don't think that the problem editor is committing vandalism, but like Egil, I believe that he's sincere in his belief in the pseudoscience he's adding.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The editor in question is, among other things, writing at least partially in the first person, something which I normally only see in original research. On the VfD pages for the various articles, he seems to be trying to confuse the voting by pasting rather large amounts of text from one vote into the others, or pasting entire sections of the articles in question into the votes, rather than engage in actual discussion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>He also seems to be inclined to engage in Wikilawyering and personal attacks (see the third paragraph of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Standards_of_measure_in_the_Medieval_East&amp;oldid=20516868" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Standards_of_measure_in_the_Medieval_East&amp;oldid=20516868" rel="nofollow">this version of this article</a>).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will say that I think some of the material the problem editor wants to add <b>may</b> have merit, i.e. it may be possible to get a useful, and encyclopedic, article out of some of it after the pseudoscience has been extracted.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm certainly not an expert in the subject matter, but it seems to me that a table comparing various systems of weights and measures, without original research as to their interrelatedness, would be very useful.</p>
<p>However, I feel that the way the material is presented, and the stridency of the editor that it be presented in a particular way, make these articles unworkable at this time.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">An admin is ignoring wiki guidelines</span></h3>
<p>There is an article written by an Admin which I have been trying to edit for the past 3 days. Everytime I do anything to the article he reverts it back to his original. At first since i was new I kept replacing the whole aritlce with a new one, then another user explained to me that wiki doesnt like that and its better to amend whats already posted. No problem, so I started making amendments and admin continued to revert. So I read up on the wiki guidelines and turns out I had a right in what I was doing. The article was making an accusation without citing source for that allegation or any evidence. Lots of weird things going on just check the discussion page. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lebanese_Forces" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lebanese_Forces" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lebanese_Forces</a></p>
<p>The admin who I am having issues with is David Cannon.</p>
<p>One example of what I mean is with this quote: <i>"Despite public denials, there is evidence that the Lebanese Forces accepted military and financial support from the government of Israel in the early years of the civil war."</i></p>
<p>Where is the evidence? I have removed this from the Lebanese Forces description but David seems to think it belongs there. If there is such evidence I believe it should be linked to it or cited. Unless evidence can be attached to this statement, this line should be deleted. David seems to want to keep this although he has no evidence.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Overcoming Infantilism</span></h3>
<p>A circle of persons have contributed an article entitled "Infantilism" which addresses the topic of Paraphilic Infantilism, a psychosexual condition. This particular circle of people are "pro-infantilism" and have a history of antagonism toward infantilists who view the condition as pathological, or wish to completely overcome the condition. I personally founded an organization named "Overcoming Infantilism" to help infantilists overcome the condition, and this circle of people has a history of antagonism toward my organization.</p>
<p>The article they have submitted is for the most part objective (although it could use some balance, IMO). I have no major problem with the majority of the article, but I object to their attempt to refer to me and my group by name in a negatively biased fashion, in an attempt to publicly attack my group and discredit it. I deleted their reference to myself and my organization and wrote them a nice (in the talk section) note politely requesting they decist from using Wikipedia to push POV attacks against me. I asked that they refrain from writing about me or my private organization without at least contacting me to check out the facts. I included complete contact information.</p>
<p>They responded by deleting my note, making no attempt to contact me, and restoring the POV-biased paragraph against my organization. From my past experience with these people I doubt they will resolve this peacefully. Can someone here please help? I'm a newby to Wikipedia, but I understand the project and I support your mission.</p>
<p>Dean Winiarski dean@overcoming-infantilism.org</p>
<p>update 8/3/05 - I have made every effort to work with these people peacefully but they are intransigent. They insist on using their article to personally bash me and my organization. The hostility they have toward my organization is a point of public record. They are incapable of an objective view because their POV is radical. They have demonstrated an agenda of seeking to "normalize" their fetish lifestyle within society. OI is a non-profit organization that seeks to help persons who are hurting and struggling to overcome this fetish, and they see OI as a threat because we view this fetish as a potentially destructive sexual addiction. This is clearly an example of Wikipedia being used to promote a fringe POV bordering on personal attack (they are including my personal name). I fear that they will continue to revert the negatively biased description of my organization unless someone steps in to help. - DW</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Article histories and mysterious alterations!</span></h3>
<p>Perhaps article history is not something wikis find important or perhaps this is specific to wikimedia or even Wikipedia:</p>
<p>I've observed a few instances where an article's history has been altered or even truncated! I've also seen instances where users have taken ownership for edits that weren't theirs to begin with - they were mine! Is this standard behavior of a wiki? This kind of mysterious altering of article history seems to violate some primordial law of time. A historical event happens, the software should not erase or allow the erasure/alteration of the event itself. This is consitent with software tools such as <a href="../../../c/o/n/Configuration_management.html" title="Configuration management">configuration management</a> systems or more loosely known as, <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revision_control.html" title="Revision control">revision control</a> systems.</p>
<p>This arbitrary alteration of an article's history is foreign and in some respects offensive.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evangelical_Free_Church_ecdd.html" title="Evangelical Free Church">Evangelical Free Church</a> was listed on the 'requesting information page' as an article that didn't exist and needed information. I proceeded to provide basic content. I prompted a friend to work on it with me and we did, but to our dismay was subsequently trashed/truncated by a vandal as we later discovered when another wikipedian restored our latest edit and summarized it by saying, "reverted vandalism". We were pleasantly surprised and proceeded with a couple more edits and then left it to others. This all occurred in February, in January it was listed as a info needed article. Looking at the history on the article shows that none of this ever happened!! Nor what we did to work on it!! It even was made to look like the article had been created with an extensive essay - far much less than I started the empty article out as.</p>
<p>Perhaps I don't understand the evolution of articles here or the technical morphing process (underworkings of the wiki software) but it seems to me that an article under a specific title would continue to be that same article when retrieved under that same title.

<li>Hmmm, I seem to have solved the problem with the example I sited above - the article was renamed. However, the question remains since I have seen some odd behavior from time to time - wondering where my edits have gone.

<p>I don't like dealing with people who are on the sides of Nazis, Zionists or Islamists. The problem is, I find that Wikipedia is filled with these crackpots who do anything to push their agendas and little is being done about it. I can't seem to find peace and/or legitimate scholastic contributions to this "encyclopedia". Everybody I meet seems partisan, but all the people who keep to themselves find their edits being controlled by them(I have checked various neutral edits being violently reverted without remorse). I know about the caveat under the editing page, but is it really in Wikipedia's best interests to allow this fighting to go on by such a loophole? So many people of all different persuasions I have met randomly online, tell me that they will not use my Wikipedia sources for the chief reason that anybody can edit and that the information is suspect. I implore the Wikipedia management to do something about this and to purge its ranks of those who are on a vilification spree, in favour of their POVs.</p>

My previous tries to engage in a constructive talk with him has been unsuccesful, and has resulted in him calling me names, writing them in Persian possibly to avoid English readers understand the words (in <a href="../../../t/e/h/Talk%7ETehran_6ee4.html" title="Talk:Tehran">Talk:Tehran</a> for example, where he reverted a few hours of my work, including completely removing a section on city governance). He avoids engaging in constructive conversation with me. Also, my previous attempt to stop him from posting verbatim material copied from articles from the web has been unsucsessful, him claiming that copying material from Iranian websites to the servers of the Wikimedia foundation in Florida is OK.</p>
<p>Also, he tries organizing other people to push something I don't consider pro-Iran as they call it, but pro-their own interpretation of Iranian affairs. See <a href="../../../i/r/a/Talk%7EIran_cc71.html" title="Talk:Iran">Talk:Iran</a> for example.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../v/i/r/Virago.html" title="Virago">Virago</a> - dispute spillover from German Wikipedia</span></h3>
<p>An anonymous user keeps reinserting some weird racist theory in the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virago.html" title="Virago">Virago</a> article, the most off-kilter part being "Because the Jewish Boasianism controls the West serving Jewish group interests (cf.

I know I have not followed Wikipedia etiquette in my edit summaries, but at some point, a rose is a rose, and bullshit is bullshit.</p>

<p>The album in question was recorded and published in 1989/90, and initial releases (EPs and a short LP) were indeed issued in 1990. However, the edition of the album in question was compiled and released on July 1, 1991.

<p>Hey there. I think the problem here, as I've mentioned to Mike on his talk page, is a mixup between the <b>copyright date</b> and the <b>release date</b>. <a href="../../../i/a/n/IANAL_268a.html" title="IANAL">IANAL</a> but I think albums are copyrighted as soon as recording is finished. This is the date that apppears on the back of the album. The album may actually be released for sale later, and in some cases not until the next calendar year. Wikipedia uses the <b>release date</b>, which can be found at Amazon, allmusic.com etc. A similar thing applies with movies (e.g. <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_and_Ted%27s_Excellent_Adventure_5d8c.html" title="Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure">Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure</a>) -- <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_wub_6388.html" title="User:The wub">the wub</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_wub_1807.html" title="User talk:The wub"><font color="green">"?/!"</font></a> 28 June 2005 20:37 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is a major war going on at the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchist_League_of_Canada_43ac.html" title="Monarchist League of Canada">Monarchist League of Canada</a> between myself and User:AndyL, with a little input from <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_Grey_08a4.html" title="User:Peter Grey">User:Peter Grey</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Biased Administrator</span></h3>
<p>I feel some attention needs to be brought to the actions and attitudes of a particular administrator: AndyL, particularly in relation to the pages covering subects attached to the Canadian monarchy: <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchy_in_Canada_f2ef.html" title="Monarchy in Canada">Monarchy in Canada</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_Canada_dbf4.html" title="Elizabeth II of Canada">Elizabeth II of Canada</a>, the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monarchist_League_of_Canada_43ac.html" title="Monarchist League of Canada">Monarchist League of Canada</a> &amp; <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_General_of_Canada_3270.html" title="Governor General of Canada">Governor General of Canada</a>. I have unfortunately been dragged into a number of revert wars with him, even though communication on the related Discussion pages is attempted. Provided proof and strong argument is disregarded in favour of his personal opinion, a good example of which can be seen in his unfaltering stance on the Crown in Canada being "British," regardless of quoted extracts from articles written by a constitutional expert, as well as logical argument on my part. ([<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Monarchist_League_of_Canada#Crown" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Monarchist_League_of_Canada#Crown" rel="nofollow">Talk:Monarchist League of Canada</a>])</p>
<p>AndyL has been identified, by outside sources, as a staunch republican and anti-monarchist. His posting history on Wikipedia will reveal this to be true, and his arguments for many edits to monarchy related pages are nothing more than republican opinion without any fact to back it up. Thus, he has a strong POV and uses his administrator position to push the POV into Wikipedia pages.</p>
<p>As well, after instigating a consideration for deletion of the page <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_II_of_Canada_dbf4.html" title="Elizabeth II of Canada">Elizabeth II of Canada</a> he immediately began deleting large sections of the article. Removing large portions of text from the page a) influenced the opinions of those casting a 'vote' on the article, and b) violated Wikipedia policy which states that there should be a 5 day lag time for discussion before the article is deleted, and that the person who instigated the consideration for deletion should not be the one to delete it. Though he did not delete the article completely, he did remove large parts of it, section by section, the day after instigating discussion.</p>
<p>In general he has hijacked the Wikipedia articles related to the Monarchy of Canada, pushing his POV with a bullying attitude and starting revert wars on a number of occasions. I did not come to Wikipedia to partake in war, however AndyL seems to want to draw other Wikipedians who do not agree with his opinions into one.</p>
<p>I hope this issue can be resolved in due course, and I would appreciate some assistance with the matter. gbambino</p>

<dd>I'm sorry gbambino but reverting your edits, posting you on the 3RR page on your fourth revert and posting a VfD on one of your articles is not administrative abuse - ie no administrative powers have been used. If I had summarily deleted the article or banned you that would be something else. And no, removing parts of the article and moving them to another article is not "deletion" (any editor can do that), deletion is pressing the delete button that admins have and making the article and its history completely disappear.AndyL 16:24, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">ADMINISTRATOR ABUSE: Administrator <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> is a Wiki Terrorist</span></h3>
<p>Asking for assistance regarding Administrator <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a>:</p>
<p>Regarding the page and edits to <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Terrorism_b8bf.html" title="Islamic Terrorism">Islamic Terrorism</a>, Administrator Mustafaa acts as the police to this page to ensure that his biased POV is inserted. He was called in by <a href="../../../y/u/b/Yuber.html" title="Yuber">Yuber</a> to revert my edit, which was balanced, an improvement, and entirely without a POV (as are all my edits). They worked to team up to ensure that only their biased POV is inserted. Mustafaa then blocked me, in the process breaking many Wiki policies. Basically Mustafaa ‘s reactionary vandalism and his act of blocking me was an act of Wiki terrorisim.</p>
<p>Administrator Mustafaa broke many of Wiki policies:</p>
<p>1. Abuse of Administratorship: Most important is that Mustafaa has an obvious POV and abuses his Administratorship to ensure that his POV is inserted into his favorite articles.</p>
<p>2. Edit Abuse: Mustafaa (and Yuber) made a reactionary rv revert of the entire article instead of simply making one simple correction, the only correction that they disagreed with.</p>
<p>3. Edit Abuse: Unlike what they stated, there has been no previous discussion of this issue. The only previous discussion concerned their own sensitivity to the term. The term “Islamic Terrorism” is the term used by the West and it is the term being described. I provided a source (and there would be tens of thousands of sources, because this is the proper term in the West. I accurately described the dispute that some Muslims have over a term used in the West.</p>
<p>4. Violating blocking Policy: Use of blocks to gain advantage in a content dispute, and self-blocking to enforce a Wikiholiday or departure are specifically prohibited. Likewise, users should not block those with whom they are currently engaged in conflict.</p>
<p>5. Violating blocking Policy: logged-in users with a substantial history of valid contributions, regardless of the reasoning for the block should not be blocked.</p>
<p>6. Violating blocking Policy: the 3RR policy is not to be used to deal with vandalism as mine was of Mustafaa and Yuber vandalism.</p>
<p>7. Violating blocking Policy: Mustafaa made no warnings, he just wanted to protect his POV.</p>
<p>I believe that I have made significant contributions to Wiki and I very greatly object to 2 people teaming up to block me out of the system so that they can insert their POV.</p>
<p>These people are doing a real disservice to Wiki, and I can think of no worse vandalism than they have done:</p>
<p>I think Administrators like Mustafaa are dangerous for Wiki, especially when they are so willing to violate Wiki policy to insert their POV.</p>
<p>So, I would appreciate any information and assistance you can provide to Noitall. Thank you.</p>

<p>There has recently been some debate regarding the naming conventions to be applied to articles on Plato's works. I came up with a scheme that seemed to be consistent within the works and Wikipedia naming guidelines, but encountered opposition mainly with one party. Unfortunately, my attempts to bring others into the discussion via the normal dispute resolution strategies have proven almost entirely fruitless. I decided we should put together a survey, since I figure that will be an even better way to bring in some much wanted consensus. Despite personally messaging all parties already involved in the discussion and giving several days, no one has responded at all to my messages, nor on the discussion page. I can't make a survey without agreement as to the survey content and format with the others in the discussion, as I understand it. Maybe I'm being railroaded with silence here, maybe they just truly either don't care anymore or haven't had time to respond (a few are pretty active editors, though), so basically I'm stuck in limbo here. I can't make the survey without input, and I can't go any further into dispute resolution without a survey, it seems. Any help or advice as to how to move the issue along would be welcomed. I'm happy to concede my point in the issue on the grounds of consensus, but until that happens, I see no reason to stand down on getting more opinions.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">revert war</span></h3>
<p>There's a revert war going on at the "Marla Ruzicka" article and I wish someone would do something about it. This is the lady who was recently blown up in Iraq. The article is a bit overly-reverential, but the real problem is that some of the users will not allow external links critical of Ruzicka's efforts to stand. -Gnossie</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Unjustified removal of contents</span></h3>
<p>User nicknamed Ashley Y, with whom I have disagreed on certain other pages due to her opinions which I regard coming from some feministic bias, has removed all contents from the page <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognatic_succession.html" title="Cognatic succession">cognatic succession</a>, putting a redirect instead. The removed content is now available at the talk page <a href="../../../c/o/g/Talk%7ECognatic_succession_02ad.html" title="Talk:Cognatic succession">Talk:Cognatic succession</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cognatic_succession" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cognatic_succession" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cognatic_succession</a>), and my grounds for the need of a separate page (= against a redirect) can be condensated in: <i>primogeniture is not the only form of succession, there are several other methods, listed and presented in the removed text, and therefore the subject deserves an independent page.</i></p>
<p>This is obviously leading either to a revert war, or then Ashley Y getting factually incorrect and misleading contents to stay in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I am very disappointed that she has not bothered to make improvements to the article, nor discuss (on its talk page) her intent to make a redirect and remove all contents. 62.78.105.140 16:28, 29 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not sure where to say this, but I guess here is the best place. Coolcat has been a constant problem user. Many of his edits on the pages in question are quite biased. On talk pages, he resorts to personal attacks<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nanjing_Massacre&amp;diff=12697968&amp;oldid=12696849" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nanjing_Massacre&amp;diff=12697968&amp;oldid=12696849" rel="nofollow">1</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AArmenian_Genocide&amp;diff=11229718&amp;oldid=11229384" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AArmenian_Genocide&amp;diff=11229718&amp;oldid=11229384" rel="nofollow">2</a> and threats<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Cool_Cat&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11583199" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Cool_Cat&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=11583199" rel="nofollow">1</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mel_Etitis&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=12115355" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mel_Etitis&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=12115355" rel="nofollow">2</a>. Coolcat even goes so far as to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AArmenian_Genocide&amp;diff=11348548&amp;oldid=11347861" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AArmenian_Genocide&amp;diff=11348548&amp;oldid=11347861" rel="nofollow">deny the holocaust</a>. The "spelling corrections" he talks about are things such as changing "concentration camp" to "relocation camp." Coolcat has also insulted myself and other wikipedians on IRC, then going on to claim he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:AngryParsley#User:Coolcat_edited_your_post" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:AngryParsley#User:Coolcat_edited_your_post" rel="nofollow">designed the internet</a> and to again deny the holocaust, then say the holocaust happened, then deny it again:</p>
<pre>
[01:43] &lt;Linuxbeak&gt; Alright. In your Armenian Genocide article, you said you deny the holocaust.
[01:43] &lt;Linuxbeak&gt; Is this true?
[01:43] &lt;Linuxbeak&gt; AngryParsley specifically pointed this one out to me. I can certainly understand
 why he's got something against you, no offense meant.
[01:43] &lt;Cool_Cat&gt; I do not remeber denying anything
...
[01:45] &lt;Cool_Cat&gt; I was being sarcastic
[01:45] &lt;Cool_Cat&gt; Tehir claim was I was a denieler
...
[01:46] &lt;Cool_Cat&gt; I personaly think the Nazi goverment were in charge of mass murder yes
[01:46] &lt;Linuxbeak&gt; So the Holocaust happened?
[01:46] &lt;Cool_Cat&gt; I do not believe all germans are evil no
[01:46] &lt;Cool_Cat&gt; yeahit happened
...
[01:48] &lt;Cool_Cat&gt; no one is disputing Holocaust at either govermental, diplomatic or academic level
[01:48] &lt;Cool_Cat&gt; people however do dispute the armenian genocide
[01:48] &lt;Cool_Cat&gt; providing it as a solid fact at best conflicts NPoV
[01:48] &lt;Cool_Cat&gt; No one is denying people died, I am not at least
[01:48] &lt;Cool_Cat&gt; I am claiming it wasnt necesarily a goverment sposored exterimination plan
</pre>
<p>After that, the discussion devolves into incomprehensible ramblings about Michigan and genocide. These are only a couple of examples of Coolcat's misconduct. Many more were collected by Davenbelle <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavenbelle_Evidence_re_User%7ECoolcat_567a.html" title="User:Davenbelle/Evidence re User:Coolcat">here</a>.

We're disagreeing with him because he denies the holocaust, insults others, edits with extreme bias (including changing statistics without citing any sources and using the edit summary "sneaky vandalism")<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10846934" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkey&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=10846934" rel="nofollow">1</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngryParsley_f0b2.html" title="User:AngryParsley">AngryParsley</a> 16:51, 7 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Revert War on Wolverine (comics) page</span></h3>
<p>I've been engaged in a revert war on the page for the comic book character Wolverine. I expanded the section on his superhuman abilities, expanding the amount of detail on it, and citing sources for my statements, and I got into an argument with someone who asserted the character had superhuman strength. I eventually incorporated his/her arguments into my version, so as to reflect the disputed issue of his strength. But now I'm in a revert war with a number of users who don't like my version because, according to them, it's redundant, the issue should be vague, I'm only stating my opinions (untrue). They've approached this issue with an utter lack of civility, attacking me with Straw Men and insults, calling me a troll, accusing me of "vandalism," accusing me of deliberately trying to annoy them, etc. One user, ScifiterX just today posted a series of attacks on me on the Discussion page for that entry, telling others "what I think," accusing me of omitting important details, and has accused me of refusing to engage in discussion there (when in fact, the discussion there has only been going on for four days, before which I discussed this matter on our individual Talk pages). I just discovered the discussion there now, and posted a response there. I feel their attacks are unnecessary, as they seem to think that anyone who disagrees with them is guilty of starting a flame war, despite the fact that I have attempted to be civil and polite with them. They largely ignore my arguments, except to distort them. I worked hard on that section, and see no reason why it's too long or should be censored just because it apparently doesn't conform to their sense of aesthetics. Any viewing of my contributions will show that I have not engaged in vandalsim, and that my contributions were always made in good faith and sincerity, mostly consisting of minor edits for wording/NPOV, with some more lengthy contributions as the rarity. I apologize for having to trouble you, but I would appreciate intervention on this matter. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENightscream_713e.html" title="User:Nightscream">Nightscream</a> 7.12.05. 1:40am EST.</p>

Nothing wrong with that necessarily, except each picture is only of the actress gagged and nothing else. He has inserted these pictures into the articles of the particular actresses, and I have removed the Anne Archer one (maybe that wasn't the right move to make?).</p>
<p>The thing is, I feel that this man is simply flaunting a fetish of his rather than adding relevant material. Anne Archer and other actresses have done far more work than merely being gagged, and seeing pictures of such in their articles where a more representative picture (or more diverse set of pictures) would do, does not seem appropriate to me. I simply get the strong impression that this man is merely flaunting his interest in gagged women rather than intending to fairly represent the actresses in question.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Dealing with biased contributions</span></h3>
<p>I recently had a biased contribution on <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autism_rights_movement.html" title="Autism rights movement">autism rights movement</a> and I'm not sure how well I handled that. From what I read of Wikipedia's NPOV policy, POV contributions can't be deleted just because they are biased, except in extreme cases. I tried my best with this contribution, but parts of it I couldn't NPOVize. I did leave the whole contribution on the talk page. In addition, a lot of that person's contribution was not appropriate to the article. I tried moving some of it to other articles, and I created a new article for part of it. I was very worried when I saw the biased contribution that it would cause people to delete more than was necessary, or provoke a VFD nomination, so I couldn't let it stay there. On the other hand, I think the contribution was interesting and thought-out so I hate deleting it. It was contributed by an anonymous user, and I suspect it was a newbie who was unfamiliar with NPOV policy. I would like someone to help me deal with this issue. Also, I would like to point out something that there is heated disagreement of with respect to autism: most autistic people do not see autism as a disorder but as a way of being, and I think it is important for any potential advocates to know of that ahead of time. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 07:21, 25 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemish_Interest_1b42.html" title="Flemish Interest">Flemish Interest</a></span></h3>
<p>This article is supposedly an article describing a right wing party in Flanders (Belgium), called <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flemish_Interest_1b42.html" title="Flemish Interest">Flemish Interest</a>, yet it resembles more a personal blog of just one user, who is patently biased in favour of this particular right wing party. This user sits on the article like a goose on her eggs. I have tried making several changes, but these were always changed back to the personal rant of JvB. This article is absolutely no longer an encyclopedic article, neutrally describing the party, its members, programme, voters, main policies, history etc... Basically I propose to create a guideline / template on how to write an article describing political parties in order to reduce NPOV disputes. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>There is already a conflic between San Marcos and Saint Mark issue in the article <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_University_of_San_Marcos_9083.html" title="National University of San Marcos">National University of San Marcos</a>.And i want to request and assitance on it please.</p>
<p><a name="Background" id="Background"></a></p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h4>
<p>The university article was stub until february of 2005, when i as student of this university decided to improve it as i can. I based on arguments from Catholic Encyclopedia in which it uses and anglicize version in which says University of Saint Mark decided to use this as a pipe link to peruvian articles related to National University of San Marcos, i never wanted to ask for change the name of the article, i just wanted to be specific with the anglicize use of the name.</p>
<p>But people involved in peruvian articles decided to improve it as Hasdruval which i thank him to his contributions, however a vote was begun by <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarbucksFreak_70a3.html" title="User:StarbucksFreak">User:StarbucksFreak</a> to decide which name should be used from the results of this vote i am still not conviced, i dont think so it reflect an accurate point of view from wikipedians.</p>
<p>The reason of why i come here is to ask you an advice is also because i feel i am <b>threatened</b> by <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">User:Viajero</a> and i think this because of his words and i quote :</p>
<p><i><b>In case you are not aware, the vote was 8-3 in favor of San Marcos. This issue is now closed; it is not open to further "interpretation"; no appeal is possible. However, if you continue to insert "Saint Mark" into articles, I will revert you. -- Viajero 17:52, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</b></i></p>
<p>For this words i feel <b>harrasment</b>, <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">user:Viajero</a> in my personal point of view feels he is the owner of many articles related to peruvian topics such as <a href="../../../l/i/m/Lima.html" title="Lima">Lima</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Fujimori_b38a.html" title="Alberto Fujimori">Alberto Fujimori</a> articles, and each time i try to clarify some, he reverts me, using arguments which i consider silly, such as brevity, clarity, etc..</p>
<p>He has a double standard to judge articles, in <i>University of Saint Mark</i> he says, its better to be brief, but in Alberto Fujimori article he says all what he wants.</p>
<p>It is not the first time i feel i have some kind of threat because of him,</p>
<p>previously, he said me, that because my english is not good i cant do edits on wikipedia, and i feel that as some kind of discrimination against me.</p>
<ul>
<li>And i quote
<ul>
<li><i>you are not the right person to be determing what correct Engish usage is</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and in Lima city article he said <i><b>If you are unable to accept native speakers of English correcting your texts, then you won't last very long here.</b></i></p>
<ul>
<li>even when i wanted to discuss the issue about motto in Lima city he said this
<ul>
<li><i><b>we are spending far too much time and energy on insignificant details</b></i>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I dont think so this is a proper way of how newly wikipedian should be treated, i humble ask to fellow members of wikipedia counsil of assitance to took my case and mediate if necessary.<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyApple_dadc.html" title="User:HappyApple">HappyApple</a> 19:06, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, #2</span></h3>
<p>I would like to ask for assistance.</p>
<p>There has been an ongoing, bitter, dispute between me and two "administrators" who have sought to selectively edit an entry on the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Tribune-Review).</p>
<p>Earlier versions of the encyclopedia entry included patently offensive, erroneous and frankly libelous contentions, including the malicious lie that the newspaper had called the wife of a prominent presidential candidate a "lesbian."</p>
<p>This aside was created by a user called Gamaliel, and supported, for a time, by another user called Willcmw.</p>
<p>A review of their collaboration can be found at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Gamaliel/Archive_3.</p>
<p>A mediator did arrive, long after I requested one, and long after I had worn down the others, dissuading them from printing erroneous, unlawful and unreferenced material.</p>
<p>While the material disappeared, thankfully, from the main entry, it continued to appear in the Discussion section, and the incorrect info continued to be retrieved by Internet search engines.</p>
<p>While I agree that it is generally important to maintain disputed material in archive form, this likely shouldn't apply to words that are malicious, offensive or libelous.</p>
<p>I would most appreciate someone taking care of this.</p>
<p>At 1644 EST (USA), I removed all of the disputed material at en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pittsburgh_Tribune-Review, only to see Gamaliel continue to replace it.</p>
<p>I feel this is vandalism.</p>

<dd>FYI, the same editor, using the email account of Carl Prine, an investigative reporter at the Tribune Review, sent this same message to <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">user:David Gerard</a> who, in turn, reposted it here:<a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-April/022880.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2005-April/022880.html" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. Also, a check of the talk page archives shows that the only references to Teresa Heinz Kerry being a lesbian, which is the issue that he is concerned with, are those made by this editor himself. Lastly, it should be noted that the editor has been highly disingenuous about his identity, volunteering false information. Nobody disputes the right of editors to participate anonymously, but they should not pretend to be other than they are, and they should probably not participate in editing descriptions of their work without disclosing their identity (assuming that the anon is, in fact, Carl Prine).

<dd>I've pulled out some of the more notable comments from this editor and posted them, temporarily, on User:Willmcw/sandbox. In many of them he implictly threatens legal action against Wikipedia, and in others he writes as if he had no connection to the newspaper and no special knowledge of Carl Prine. (<i>the more I dug up about Prine, the more I realized</i>... [that]...<i>the vast majority of the evidence seems to point to the fact that Prine is a pretty damned good newsman</i>). I had previously assumed that his editor was some mid-level business exec at the paper and I'm frankly astonished that he appears to be Prine himself. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 07:48, Apr 19, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Willmcw -- this really isn't a place for investigation into people's claims, it's for people to get the services of an advocate if they so desire. I've tried to contact this person and see if they desire such a service, let's leave it at that. Discussions and debate from other pages don't need to be brought here, it's not the purpose of this page. --<a href="../../../w/g/f/User%7EWgfinley_3fa2.html" title="User:Wgfinley">Wgfinley</a> 01:13, 20 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. My name is Carl Prine. I am a reporter for the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. I did, in fact, intervene in a matter that involved an unpaid university editorial assistant, an intern who was using her experience copy editing two entries, including the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review article, for her graduate thesis.</p>
<p>She does not have an email account here. She does not have her own computer. She did these revisions during her spare time in a pooled research library near our desk, a spot with several computers. She also helps out at another newspaper outside of our chain. I cannot speak about any revisions she has completed from computers outside of the Tribune-Review.</p>
<p>I mentor at several colleges in the area, and encourage them to make use of the Internet, but to be skeptical of much of the information appearing on the web. The person in question became exasperated at both the falsehoods expressed in the PTR article and the attitudes of the "administrators" who sought to "correct" her. When she was blocked, for the first time I ventured into the Wikipedia world.</p>
<p>Again, she is not a paid employee of this newspaper. Her role here is informal, and I know her only in a cursory way. I am not her professor, student newspaper editor or her college advisor.</p>
<p>I have created a user name and have posted my thoughts from both the library pool and my own desk. I also have forwarded privately to top Wikipedia administrators the offsite email address of the intern so that they can communicate with her directly. She is concerned that Willmcw and Gamaliel (I hope I have those names spelled correctly) will attack her in her private life.</p>
<p>From the level of their discourse, and their actions, I recently have reviewed, I don't blame her. I don't much care for bullies, and I don't mind wading into the controversy. I have given my name, email address and direct telephone line to senior administrators so that they know exactly who I am, my recent involvement in this matter, and what I intend to do to make sure this woman is treated fairly.</p>
<p>I should like to add that the PTR entry continues to use my name in ways I, personally, believe are irrelevant or misleading. I have not changed these because it would be unethical, I believe, to do so. I shall leave to future revisers the task of deciding the importance of some brief television work I did, or the sorts of awards I have won, to the history of the newspaper chain. Had I written the thing, my name would not have appeared at all.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why I do not appreciate these snide, uninformed comments about me, shown both on this page and on other parts of Wikipedia related to this controversy.</p>
<p>I have not changed, or even read, any comments in these pages about me personally until recently. Now that I have read them, however, it should be noted that they are simply wrong, and the intern did the right thing by erasing them. It's also why I have taken a very personal interest in this matter and agreed to post the complaint because she was blocked and couldn't do so.</p>
<p>In my very short time in these forums, it appears that some "administrators" appear to write untruths, based on scant evidence, to discredit organizations, businesses or people they don't like. When a young woman calls them on it, using the rudiments of her journalism education, they attack her, then silence her.</p>
<p>Then I see that they attribute untrue things about me, a person they do not know. While I believe Wikipedia can be a valuable tool, it seems equally rife with problems, and perhaps the senior levels of the effort should review who is trusted to edit many of these entries.</p>
<p>That someone is now suggesting a young intern called the wife of a presidential candidate a "lesbian," instead of one of the "administrators" who silenced her is indicative, I believe, of a larger problem. I have made my own suggestions to those higher in the chain of command here about this issue.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have cautioned her to simply file any new revisions from her home computer. The entire matter seems to have been resolved, and my role in this will only be that of monitor.</p>
<p>Further correspondence may be directed to me at cprine@tribweb.com.</p>

<dd>If this anon user wishes to participate in the Wikipedia project then she needs follow the same norms of behavior as any other editor. As with the previous request, I again second the request for a mediator to resolve the differences between her and the other editors. Among other things, threats of legal action and repeated lies about her affiliation with the article subject make it difficult to assume good faith on her part. The matter is not resolved if the anon user keeps popping up and making demands. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 20:24, Apr 25, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe User Riccati has committed a <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_personal_attacks_15ec.html" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attack</a> against me in the form of a comment in one of his/her edit summaries. Quote: "NPOV revert to last Davidcannon; AladdinSE, I don't have time now to correct all your POV insertions, but did <b>wipe your filth from Hariri's grave here</b> -- perhaps others can remove the rest elsewhere." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rafik_Hariri&amp;diff=11567556&amp;oldid=11544263" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rafik_Hariri&amp;diff=11567556&amp;oldid=11544263" rel="nofollow">[32]</a>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Gigantour speedy deletion</span></h3>
<p>The <a href="../../../g/i/g/Gigantour.html" title="Gigantour">Gigantour</a> article was nominated for speedy deletion by <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShoefly_20cc.html" title="User:Shoefly">Shoefly</a> because it was apparently self-promotion and advertisement. Not only are these not part of the criteria for speedy deletion, but they are also incorrect. I don't believe Shoefly read the article's <a href="../../../g/i/g/Talk%7EGigantour_43b9.html" title="Talk:Gigantour">Talk</a> page, which had a discussion on the advertorial nature of the article, and it was explained that the original author of the article (me) was not affiliated with the tour and therefore it cannot possibly be self-promotion. I think that if <i>anything</i> were to be done about the article, it should have been listed on <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVfD_d394.html" title="WP:VfD">VfD</a>, not speedy deletion. I have asked for an explanation on Shoefly's talk page, but he hasn't replied.</p>
<p>I would like to know who actually deleted the article, why they decided it was speedy deletion worthy, and how I can get it undeleted. I would also like to know why people can get an article deleted without a trace without even so much as a minor concensus.

<p>Please clarify the meaning of "whack-job" (see below a transcript of an article's history). I'm not familiar with Wikipedia's jargon.</p>
<p>I've been editing aspects of an article that didn't conform to accepted scientific form, eliminating personal opinions which don't conform to the scientific and humanistic literature on the topic, beginning to include appropriate references, and using language conforming with currently published peer-reviewed material.</p>
<p>I just found that they have been all deleted on grounds of "reverting a whack-job." I'd like to re-write the article as to make it compliant with the Wikipedia policies, in particular concerning verifiable and referenced neutral information (ie, balanced when conflicting definitions have been published in the scientific literature). I didn't encounter any problems doing so in other articles.</p>
<p>Please advice how to proceed to attain the intended scholarly encyclopedia character in the article of reference (see below).</p>

Dr. Lerman, 

I have restored your edits to the "Sleep paralysis" page with some changes.   
As you may or may not be aware, Wikipedia is an open source encyclopedia 
which can be editted by anyone.  I would recommend reading 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia if you are curious as to its nature in 
more depth. 

Anyone is free to edit any page and I suspect your changes to the above 
article were reverted, and refered to as a "whack job" is because many of 
them were "commented out" in HTML code causing them to not appear in the body 
of the article and thus created fragmented sentences.  I have restored your 
edit with those comments removed.  I have no background in this area of 
science, however, and therefore, I cannot be sure if the person who reverted 
your edits had a problem with their scientific merit or with the manner in 
which they had been inputed into the article.  If the latter, I suspect that 
the problem is now resolved. 

If you are interested in regularly contributing to Wikipedia, I would suggest 
becoming a member.  Details on this are available at 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Why_create_an_account%3F 

It is very helpful to create an account as, if something like this were to 
arise in the future, you would be able to correspond with the other editors 
of the page to resolve the problem in a more direct manner. 

Best regards, 
Wikipedia user "Jord"

<dd><a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a>, unfortunately, your revert re-inserted a lot of text that was removed long ago because it couldn't be verified. I've tried to discuss these issues with "Dr. Lerman" on several occasions through Wikipedia, but he keeps insisting that we email him. Of course, you relize, on Wikipedia, we discuss issues about Wikipedia on Wikipedia, but he keep wanting to take up his issues via email.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Dr. Lerman" refuses to discuss issues about articles on the article's Talk pages. His changes are controversial. If he'd be willing to discuss the issues first, we might be able to come to an agreement. But if he won't abide by wiki-conventions, I don't see any other option than to keep his changes out.</dd>

<dd>Now, I reverted your revert, Jord, but I don't have anything against you or "Dr. Lerman" (who refuses to create an account). I just want to discuss the wide-sweeping changes he wants to make to the article. By the way, he asked for arbitration on this issue on <i>numerous</i> page on Wikipedia (such as the Help desk), but not <i>once</i> did he bring it up on the most obvious place, the articles talk page. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot"></a>— <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrecklefoot_571c.html" title="User:Frecklefoot">Frecklefoot</a> | <a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFrecklefoot_f6c2.html" title="User talk:Frecklefoot">Talk</a> 15:38, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Frecklefoot, thanks for this information. I will follow up with the good doctor and hopefully we can find an aimicable solution here. I tend to agree that the best option is for him to post his concerns on the talk page--with or without an account--and air them there for all to see. In his reply to my email it seems as though he is good natured but not all that familiar with the Wikipedia community and its practices. I will continue to monitor and hopefully help. With respect to my edit, I am not surprised, I did not even read the text of the article but assumed that there was some difficulty there in code and opted to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">be bold</a> however it seems I assumed incorrectly. - <a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJord_173a.html" title="User:Jord">Jord</a> 16:56, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">False edit summary by Raul654</span></h3>
<p>While reading the article on AIDS, I noticed that an editor offered language clarifying the lack of concensus among scientists regarding the etiology of the syndrome. But Administrator Raul654 has apparently twice in short order reverted the npov language, alleging vandalism. Offering meaningful edits that reflect the actual status of scientific discussion is in no way vandalism. Claiming that meaningful, well considered contributions are vandalism is in fact slanderous and bullying. I'm not an experienced Wikipedia writer, but this seems way out of line for a person who claims to be some senior official in the Wikipedia project. Albaco 04:58, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>When I read further, I notice that administrator Raul654 reverted all edits between Aug 12 and July 28. Is it the role of administrators to wholesale revert two weeks worth of contributions by several editors, then claim those who continue to contribute to the article are "Vandals"? I was told that this is supposed to be a place for people to edit collaboratively. I think my original hunch was right -- this isn't a good place to donate free writing services. !Albaco 05:03, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This administrator might have settled down, after I contributed edits intended to provide inclusive and accurate encyclopedic content, but his actions seem to be motivated by disdain for scientists whose views don't support a majority view, and a lack of skill in composing language that accurately reflects diversity in controversial scientific matters. That's understandable, but as an administrator -- one who boasts a leading role in the Wikipedia "Community" -- the following advice he posted on his user page seems innappropriate:

<p>Alias <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">User:Pigsonthewing</a> This guy has problems with deletion of things. Its a shame, All his time is spent deleting rather than building Wikipedia. Therefore I am going to retract before he does all the work and time I've done building pages up. Sorry to have people like him here ruining Wikipedia. Here's just one example from someones page: <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENick_Boulevard_addb.html" title="User talk:Nick Boulevard">User talk:Nick Boulevard</a></p>
