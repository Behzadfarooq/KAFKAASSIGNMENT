<dd>It looks like <b>Amateur astronomy</b> and <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skygazing.html" title="Skygazing">Skygazing</a> are both well developed articles. Which one should be the "main" article into which the other one should be merged? 64.191.171.69 18:01, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Amateur astronomy should be the main article since it is the name of the hobby as understood by most people and the most professionally sounding name for it as opposed to skygazing, stargazing or something else like it--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 01:58, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Skygazing isn't a commonly used term in most astronomical circles as the term "stargazing" is much more often used.

<p>It sounds as if there's a lot of support for merging <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skygazing.html" title="Skygazing">Skygazing</a> with <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_astronomy.html" title="Amateur astronomy">Amateur astronomy</a>. I partly agree with merging the articles (my thoughts have changed as detailed below), preferably to here, but there are at least a couple of considerations that I think should be taken into account before this happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>To me, the Skygazing article reads more as if it's a publicity drive for amateur astronomy than an actual description of what it is. It'd be good for a library book, but I'm not sure if it's ideal as a descriptive article <i>about</i> amateur astronomy. The words and phrases used are artistic rather than direct and straightforward, and just by being so, it's arguably not written with a very neutral point of view. <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skygazing.html" title="Skygazing">Skygazing</a> is also written from a very instructional stance that assumes the reader wants to <i>try</i> astronomy instead of simply find out what it is. (Phrases like "We can" and "you can" that are used frequently really emphasise this.)</li>
<li>This is in many ways related to the previous point. In my opinion at least, some of the sections listed in Skygazing don't directly belong in Amateur astronomy, beyond a mention. This is mostly because the bulk of the text in <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skygazing.html" title="Skygazing">Skygazing</a> that <i>isn't</i> already detailed on a more specific page tends to be simply instructional, telling people how they can do certain things instead of explaining what they are. eg. Text that explains things like what a <i>Lunar Crater</i> is might be of interest to someone who wants to do some amateur astronomy, but it's not really of interest to someone who wants to find out what <i>amateur astronomy</i> is. Besides, if someone—amateur astronomer or otherwise—wants to find out what a Lunar Crater is, the information about it is in the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impact_crater.html" title="Impact crater">Impact crater</a> article. If there's anything new in the <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skygazing.html" title="Skygazing">Skygazing</a> article, then that's where it should be merged to. Ditto with planets, constellations, and a lot of other things.</li>
</ol>
<p>Having finished writing this, I'm now wondering if <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skygazing.html" title="Skygazing">Skygazing</a> should be merged with <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_astronomy.html" title="Amateur astronomy">Amateur astronomy</a> at all. A better action might be to rename it to something like <i>How to get started in amateur astronomy</i>, and then refer to it from here in the <i>See also</i> section.</p>
<p>I really don't want to criticise the <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skygazing.html" title="Skygazing">Skygazing</a> writing, because it's clearly been translated well, and reads nicely. I just think it reads a bit too instructional to be a descriptive article <i>about</i> amateur astronomy. The amateur astronomy article used to be like this in a few ways, and I rewrote at least some parts of it when I did a lot of refactoring of it some time ago. I'm fully aware that opinions are likely to vary on this, and I'm interested to see what people think.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>I agree. Both articles do a nice job of covering their respective subjects, but there's too much that does not overlap to make a merge practical. I wonder whether the suggestion to merge was done in the first place because of the title of Skygazing. Find a way to rename the Skygazing article that does justice to it. Not "How to get started in amateur astronomy," though, because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an instruction manual.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I do not agree that the Skygazing article is well developed. There are articles about solar observing under the "naked-eye" heading and an outright false statement about observing sunspots with a telescope. In addition, the formatting of the pictures and text is visually distracting. Not that I could do any better with the layout but the discussion about daytime observing is outright dangerous to the naive. David</p>

<dd>David, I added a safety note, you can see below this section that i suggested one be added a couple of months back, but almost nothing has been done to the article since, as it is likely to be a wasted effort, with deletion or severe cutting in the wings.<a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 22:04, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If skygazing can be done during the day then i need to understand how that is a subset of astronomy. I like the article but it requires re-naming if it is exclusively astronomy, but can remain the same if it includes weather, clouds, ice crystals, vapour trails, and other day time sky/atmospheric optical phenomena. Rainbows, halos, etc are sun related, and have a clear link to astronomy. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 14:40, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>further thoughts; If the purely astronomical components (ie <i>space</i> content viewed <i>through</i> the sky) can be integrated into the astronomy articles, then the nearer sky objects/effects that are not really space, could stay? where is the dividing line, is it at some altitude that sky becomes space? Isn't it ALL skygazing, and then day/night sky/space become the subsets? there should be a warning though, skygazing for clouds and optical effects can be hazadous, the UV can burn the eyes, I know because it just happened to me, after 10 days of awesome clouds, iridation, halos, etc, i had the pain and irritation like sand in my eyes, welders get it as well, called 'arc burn'. <a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 10:10, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A quick perusal of Google brings up no significant links to <b>Skygazing</b>. Skygazing is basically a slang term for astronomy. It is not any defined field in the English language. It is not even a word in some English dictionarys. Large sections of the Skygazing article are redundant; they cover parts that are already entries on their own in Wikipedia (i.e. atmospheric phenomena types, astronomical object types, telescope types. ect). It is full of inaccuracies and incorrect terms. The section/subsection structure of the whole article needs a lot of work. I am not sure this work should even be done. It has some informative sections but those parts seem to violate the "do not instruct" policy of Wikipedia (<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia: What Wikipedia is not</a>). I really think "Skygazing" should be redirected to <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_Astronomy_0c33.html" title="Amateur Astronomy">Amateur Astronomy</a> and parts of the Skygazing article it should be added to the relevant articles. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalfblue_1364.html" title="User:Halfblue">Halfblue</a> 23:44, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with this. For consistency, though, I also think the <i>Beginning in amateur astronomy</i> section of this article needs re-writing or removing. It's very instructional. It used to make up most of the article, and I left it there some time ago when I wrote a lot of other parts around it. Parts of it might be able to be re-written to be less instructional, but I wonder if now it might be time to just do away with large parts of it entirely. <a href="../../../i/z/o/User%7EIzogi_2699.html" title="User:Izogi">Izogi</a> 06:22, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree with deletion and thats probably because I AM A SKYGAZER for many years, but I accept that the article is far less than satisfactory and yes most of it is redundant and in need of work. But there are plenty of processes to take care of that; peer review? perhaps just get someone who wants it to stay to write new content? thats probably the hard part. much easier to delete and feel warm fuzzies.. I am trying hard to understand though, how you equate skygazing with astronomy? perhaps checkout the sky sometime and you might see quite a lot of noy very astro stuff going on. I would think that the term skygazing is quite easy to understand, and writing an article with content that is literally about gazing at the sky could eb fairly simple and straightforward, so i regard all this chatter as some sort of diversion from the real issues, which could be that there is a lot of work to clean it up, but might be just that we dont wanna get entangled, so how about its simplified down to a list of points, we debate those, vote if really necessary, and we get in their and execute them. How about moving all the astro content to relevant astro pages, and leave non-astro skygazing content, as a simplifying exercise. will anyone squeal if i do that? my favorite skygazing website is <a href="http://www.metvuw.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.metvuw.com/" rel="nofollow">MetVUW</a> around a million hits a week, and <a href="http://www.atoptics.co.uk/" class="external free" title="http://www.atoptics.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.atoptics.co.uk/</a> possibly the best world site, certainly referenced by NASA spaceweather.com. I am thinking that many people less priviledged than you and I are skygazers, for survival reasons, but even less are astronomers. Let s at least agree that the article needs to be fixed when someone can be bothered.<a href="../../../m/o/z/User%7EMozasaur_fb9c.html" title="User:Mozasaur">moza</a> 12:49, 27 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It turns out there are 17k returns for skygazing in wiki but it maybe of interest that the Robert Moses State Park actually has an official permit; "SEE DIRECTIONS BELOW MAP, REMEMBER, TO OBSERVE YOU MUST HAVE A SKYGAZING PERMIT!

<p>I don't think anyone is denigrating the term. The problem is it’s an imprecise term. The precise term for most of the activates listed in the article <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skygazing.html" title="Skygazing">Skygazing</a> is <b>Amateur Astronomy</b>. The header paragraph of the article describes <b>Amateur Astronomy</b>. You can find citations of <b>"Skygazing"</b> on Google but most of those are shorthand for <b>Amateur Astronomy</b>. Get my drift? For <b>Skygazing</b> to survive as a separate article there needs to be proof that it is separate and distinct from <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_astronomy.html" title="Amateur astronomy">Amateur astronomy</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Meteorological_phenomena.html" title="Meteorological phenomena">Meteorological phenomena</a>, ect. On the face of it perusing the article I would say <b>Skygazing</b> is just a description of <b>Amateur astronomy</b> with some meteorological stuff thrown in. That makes it redundant and a candidate for deletion and or redirection. 69.72.93.189 20:28, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Skygazing is just a subsection of amateur astronomy (generally using your eyes and visible light, and excluding e.g. amateur radio astronomy). I think the material should just be included in the amateur astronomy page. <a href="../../../r/n/t/User%7ERnt20_32c8.html" title="User:Rnt20">Rnt20</a> 12:35, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astronomical_society.html" title="Astronomical society">astronomical society</a> article looks more like a list of links than something that describes the topic with more detail than this article, so I've replaced the main-article template that <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeblakesley_e5fc.html" title="User:Joeblakesley">User:Joeblakesley</a> added with an inline wiki link. To me at least, it reads batter this way, but happy to discuss as always. <a href="../../../i/z/o/User%7EIzogi_2699.html" title="User:Izogi">Izogi</a> 08:16, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Reading and re-reading the article, I think that most of the <i>Beginning in amateur astronomy</i> section reads as superfluous, and it only seems to be there because it always was since very early on. That section is very instructional and promotional, the suggested reading is a random collection of unverified personal favourites that random people have added over time, and the whole section doesn't really fit well with Wikipedia in general, in my opinion. In it, the article suddenly jumps from explaining what Amateur Astronomy <i>is</i> to telling people how to do it, and it doesn't read well. (If that information is to go anywhere, it should be in a separate article titled something like <i>How to get started in amateur astronomy</i>.</p>
<p>I also wonder if there's an entire section missing about the history of amateur astronomy. Without going into detail, for instance, such a section could glaze over some of the ancient civilisations, more recent self-funded amateurs such as <a href="../../../t/y/c/Tycho_Brahe_a182.html" title="Tycho Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a> (at least I think he was self-funded, from memory), perhaps getting to things like amateur observations of the Moon before recent expeditions and equipment made the majority of that work redundant. It's really only very recently that amateurs have become overshadowed (but not extinguished) by professionals, and I think there's a lot of scope for a major section of the article to summarise a lot of this history, perhaps giving the article a bit of what it seems to be missing at the moment. <a href="../../../i/z/o/User%7EIzogi_2699.html" title="User:Izogi">Izogi</a> 10:52, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes this sounds good. Even relatively recent amateur astronomers have sometimes had a big impact -- e.g. <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Guthe_Jansky_4b45.html" title="Karl Guthe Jansky">Karl Guthe Jansky</a>.

<dd>A historical context would help. I added one to <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_telescope_making.html" title="Amateur telescope making">Amateur telescope making</a> but that hobby had some clearly definable foundations as a "hobby". The problem I am trying to get around for Amateur Astronomy is does the lack of "professionals" in the field early on mean the people in it could be described as "amateurs"? A lot of early scientific work was done by self taught gentlemen/nobility who had the time and money to fund their own research (like the example given Tycho Brahe), but that was the way "professional" science was done back then and seems to be different from the term "amateur" used in this article. &lt;----hmmm modify that and it may make a good intro paragraph&#160;;^) <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalfblue_1364.html" title="User:Halfblue">Halfblue</a> 12:41, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Does anyone have a good photo of amateur astronomers in action? I was thinking of perhaps one of those dusk photos with silhouettes of people walking around telescopes. The current photos are just photos, which could really be used to demonstrate anything, but imho it'd be great to open with a photo showing amateur astronomers in action. <a href="../../../i/z/o/User%7EIzogi_2699.html" title="User:Izogi">Izogi</a> 10:13, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I hope nobody minds me attempting a somewhat substantial refactoring effort. I've never thought the headings were quite right and were dividing things up where they'd go better together, so I've removed a whole lot of sub-sections. (Perhaps once it's all refactored nicely, it might be easier to divide it up better.) I think I've left all the information in there, but please feel welcome to edit (or comment) if you think otherwise.</p>
<p>Also, what would people think if we removed the <i>Beginning in amateur astronomy</i> section entirely? Whenever I read it, it reads very badly like instructionalism, and I think that distracts from the whole article. A lot of the content could and probably should be re-written and merged with other sections (so wouldn't be lost), but I think it needs some serious fixing all the same. <a href="../../../i/z/o/User%7EIzogi_2699.html" title="User:Izogi">Izogi</a> 10:53, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, I think I have the main part of what I wanted done, and hopefully I haven't offended too many people. Some significant parts of the text didn't survive, but in my view they were plainly subjective. (eg. You should get this type of telescope, and you'll do better to try star hopping before a GOTO, etc etc.) I'll probably continue to play with reformatting the remaining text in the next short while.</dd>

<dd>It's probably worth noting that I've not bothered trying to save the <i>Related reading</i> section at all (formerly <i>Suggested reading</i>). Most of the books that were listed seemed to be just a tiny part of the vast range of beginning astronomy books that are out there, and I'm not sure how to justify listing a few of them without listing everything. Plus, looking at the evolution of this article over time, I think that section might have simply become a repository for people to enter their favourite book of the week, rather than something that justifiably belongs as part of the article. How do people feel about this? I'm not really averse to having a list of books as a concept, but I do think that anything there should be a seriously stand-out book. Otherwise it should really be in an article called something like List of amateur astronomy books. <a href="../../../i/z/o/User%7EIzogi_2699.html" title="User:Izogi">Izogi</a> 04:16, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Personally, I agree with the idea of moving the list of books to a separate article, as long as there is link to that article in this one. I have taken the liberty of creating a new article with the title you suggested and transferring the book list exactly as it appeared here to the new article. I have also added a link to the new article in the "See also" section here. This is really a suggestion only, so feel free to go with this idea, re-work it, or delete it. If the list article stands, I would encourage people to add appropriate titles there. -- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDannyZ_bf17.html" title="User:DannyZ">DannyZ</a> 01:47, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The List of amateur astronomy books page has been <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">PROD'd</a>, so I took the liberty of merging the books back onto this page to maintain the information.

<dd>Thanks for the thoughts. I'm not so much against having a list of additional reading as a concept, but I do think that simply having it, as an itemised list, invites people who pass through to just add their favourite books. There are so many books about amateur astronomy (especially getting started books), that a lot of them don't get more than a single print run, perhaps get given to lots of people as birthday presents, and then dissappear and become difficult to track down, verify, and whatever else. I guess my main concern is that the list could get uncomfortably long and messy, and difficult to manage and verify, and to me it'd seemed that this was what was happening. The best thing about having a separate article is that if it's going to get messy, at least it'd happen <i>over there</i>.&#160;:) (It's not exactly the way that Wikipedia's supposed to work, though, hence someone nominating it for deletion.)</dd>
<dd>I'm not 100% sure how to fix this problem (short of not having such a section at all), but personally, I think the best guideline for why a book should be listed, short of being worthy of having its own article, might be that the article could cite some information from it as an authoritarian source. This way it's absolutely clear why it's worthy of being listed, and it means that if someone finds a better, more authoritarian source, they can replace the citation with a better book that covers the same topic. But then it'd go into a References section instead of a Further reading section. It'd be nice to hear what other people think. <a href="../../../i/z/o/User%7EIzogi_2699.html" title="User:Izogi">Izogi</a> 22:37, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>An anonymous user has recently added a section for famous amateur astronomers, one of whom is <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_H._Levy_fbdd.html" title="David H. Levy">David H. Levy</a>.</p>
<p>I have a lot of respect for David Levy, but is he really an amateur in the normal sense? I know he goes to a lot of amateur astronomy meetings and maybe he'd consider himself an amateur astronomer at times if asked, but I'd always thought his main contributions had been more professional. He certainly seems to make what I'm guessing is at least a large portion of his money from his astronomy-<i>related</i> work. (Books, radio show maybe?, lectures, interviews, columns, etc.) His resume on <a href="http://www.jarnac.org/aboutdavid.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.jarnac.org/aboutdavid.htm" rel="nofollow">his website</a> lists an impressive number of boards he serves on, and sizable number of publications (research and otherwise), most of which I <i>presume</i> he's been paid to produce in some way. Or is all of this just brought on by fame for having done so much as an amateur astronomer? He doesn't exactly seem like a professional in the regular sense, either. <a href="../../../i/z/o/User%7EIzogi_2699.html" title="User:Izogi">Izogi</a> 04:42, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've just removed a couple of images from the article which seemed to be more about particular objects in the sky rather than characterising amateur astronomers. They weren't bad images, but could just as easily fit on at least several other articles. I hope this doesn't offend anyone, and I wouldn't be really offended if someone wants to put them back. More broadly though, I was hoping to make some more space for pictures which I think might fit better. Examples would be photos that are more directly related to the characteristics of <i>amateur</i> astronomy, and would help to differentiate it from everything else space-related. eg. Does anyone happen to have an photo of a typical back yard observatory that might demonstrate the sorts of equipment amateurs often work with? <a href="../../../i/z/o/User%7EIzogi_2699.html" title="User:Izogi">Izogi</a> 02:42, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What do people think about external links in this article? I'd kind of like to just purge most of what's there at the moment, but it seems like that'd be quite a dramatic thing to do without consulting. Wikipedia has an unofficial style guide (see <a href="../../../e/x/t/WP%7EExternal_links_ce44.html" title="WP:External links">WP:External links</a>) which in essense indicates that external links should try to be specific to sites that elaborate on what the article talks about (but possibly cover things that aren't in the article). Since the article's not supposed to be instructional as per other policies, I'm not sure we should really be linking to sites that are inherently instructional. (eg. How to buy your first telescope) The style guide also indicates that links to things like forums and commercial sites should generally be avoided unless there's a clearly obvious reason to link there, and I tend to agree. <a href="../../../i/z/o/User%7EIzogi_2699.html" title="User:Izogi">Izogi</a> 23:44, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmm, well I've cut out some of the links and I think what's there now looks about right (in my opinion), although I'm still not 100% sure about the Society for Popular Astronomy. Basically it's links to the biggest communities for three different areas of amateur astronomy. I've removed a heap of other links on the grounds that they should go in other articles that are more specific (if anywhere), that they're very instructional, that they're forums, or that the linked topic is already represented through another more prominent link.
