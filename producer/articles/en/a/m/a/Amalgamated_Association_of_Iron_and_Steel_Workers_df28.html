<p>The <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_Depression_6ed5.html" title="Long Depression">Long Depression</a> of 1873-79 forced a number of unions to merge in order to survive. In 1876, the Sons of Vulcan (a <a href="../../../p/u/d/Puddling_furnace.html" title="Puddling furnace">puddlers</a> union), the Iron and Steel Heaters Union (a union of workers who operated roughing and rolling machines, and who acted as catchers for still-hot rolled steel), the Iron and Steel Roll Hands Union (another union of roughers, rollers and catchers) and the Nailers Union (riveters) merged to form the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers.</p>
<p>It openly embraced conservatism in its national constitution shortly after its founding. From its inception, the union refused to admit African-Americans as members.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>Local AA affiliates were organized in 'lodges.' Each lodge represented one particular skill, which meant there might be several lodges within a given mill. Each lodge elected a president as well as other officers. The president appointed a mill committee to enforce rules—both against the employer and against workers who did not wish to honor the contract. A joint committee composed of lodge presidents (or their designees) oversaw other contractual matters and negotiated contracts.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Each lodge also had an executive board, which functioned as a policy-making body and trial court. Each executive board also appointed its own president, who held little day-to-day power. The executive committee acted as a strike committee during job actions, and the executive board president acted as a strike coordinator. Membership meetings were rare and held only during crises; at such times, all workers in a plant were usually allowed to participate and debate the issues (not just dues-paying members).<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although local contracts were negotiated by each local, contracts were also submitted to the international's executive board for approval. The international could, and sometimes did, reject local contracts.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>The AA's membership was concentrated in <a href="../../../i/r/o/Ironworks.html" title="Ironworks">ironworks</a> west of the <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allegheny_Mountains_1d86.html" title="Allegheny Mountains">Allegheny Mountains</a>. The union negotiated national uniform wage scales on an annual basis; helped regularize working hours, workload levels and work speeds; and helped improve working conditions. It also acted as a <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiring_hall.html" title="Hiring hall">hiring hall</a>, helping employers find scarce puddlers and rollers.<sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>The AA was accommodating of technological advance, even when such changes led to large numbers of layoffs or the dissolution of local affiliates. At almost no point, even after losing several strikes and being effectively dismembered, did the AA see technological advancement as a problem.<sup id="_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the 1880s, the union's embrace of technological change led it to abandon its emphasis on a national master agreement on wages. By 1892, the AA argued that technological differences in each steelworks dictated different wages and hours in each plant as well.<sup id="_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>The AA was a founding member of the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federation_of_Organized_Trades_and_Labor_Unions_2aa2.html" title="Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions">Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions</a> (FOTLU). The union was strongly committed to <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craft_unionism.html" title="Craft unionism">craft unionism</a>, as was FOTLU. The <a href="../../../k/n/i/Knights_of_Labor_4b95.html" title="Knights of Labor">Knights of Labor</a>, a labor organization of unskilled workers committed to <a href="../../../i/n/d/Industrial_unionism.html" title="Industrial unionism">industrial unionism</a>, attempted to convince the AA to abandon FOTLU and join the Knights. The head of the Knights, <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terence_V._Powderly_ba8d.html" title="Terence V. Powderly">Terence V. Powderly</a>, promised that the AA would retain its organizational distinctiveness rather than be forced to disband and merge its members with local and regional Knights bodies, and that it could retain its own hierarchical internal governance structure. But the AA refused. The AA subsequently fought bitter battles with the Knights for the allegiance of iron and steel workers, and eventually contributed to the collapse of the Knights' national iron and steel worker division.<sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>The AA organized the Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Works in <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homestead%2C_Pennsylvania_e31a.html" title="Homestead, Pennsylvania">Homestead, Pennsylvania</a>, in 1881. The AA engaged in a bitter strike at the Homestead works on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/8/1882.html" title="1882">1882</a> in an effort to prevent management from forcing <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow-dog.html" title="Yellow-dog">yellow-dog</a> contracts on all workers. Violence occurred on both sides, and the plant brought in numerous <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strikebreaker.html" title="Strikebreaker">scabs</a> (mostly Scandinavians). But the AA worked cooperatively with unskilled workers and immigrant groups to discourage scabbing and tamp down ethnic tensions. The strike ended on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_20.html" title="March 20">March 20</a> in a victory for the union.<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#_note-8" title="">[9]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/8/1883.html" title="1883">1883</a>, the AA briefly withdrew from the AFL after the federation approved a series of resolutions condemning high tariffs. To the AA, protecting the American steel industry—and the jobs of its members—was more important than the effect the tariffs had on workers and consumers in general.<sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#_note-9" title="">[10]</a></sup></p>
<p>The rise of the steel industry created significant challenges for the AA. Unionized iron manufacturers often accepted the union's claim on members in their newly-established steel-making divisions. But new, non-union steel companies resisted the union. The union was unsuccessful at the <a href="../../../d/u/q/Duquesne%2C_Pennsylvania_4abf.html" title="Duquesne, Pennsylvania">Duquesne</a> and Edgar Thomson plants near <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh%2C_Pennsylvania_b3a2.html" title="Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a>, the Cambria steelworks near <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnstown%2C_Pennsylvania_7ca3.html" title="Johnstown, Pennsylvania">Johnstown, Pennsylvania</a>, and the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steelton%2C_Pennsylvania_f979.html" title="Steelton, Pennsylvania">Steelton</a> mill. However, the union successfully had organized the <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jones_and_Laughlin_Steel_Company_cdea.html" title="Jones and Laughlin Steel Company">Jones and Laughlin</a> steelworks by <a href="../../../1/8/8/1885.html" title="1885">1885</a> as well as most employers in Ohio and Illinois. By 1892, the AA had organized about half the skilled workers in the steel industry.<sup id="_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#_note-10" title="">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>By 1891 the AA had more than 24,0000 members, which was about two-thirds of the millworkers eligible to join. It was the largest union in the nation, and one of the most influential unions in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Federation_of_Labor_d658.html" title="American Federation of Labor">American Federation of Labor</a> (AFL).<sup id="_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#_note-11" title="">[12]</a></sup></p>
<p>But size also created internal strife. Technological advances and the growth of the steel industry had forced the layoffs of many puddlers and other ironworkers. Yet, puddlers still dominated the union politically and were still a majority of its members. Skilled steelworkers felt the union increasingly ignored their needs. In a concession to the steelworkers, the AA amended its constitution in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1890.html" title="1890">1890</a> to admit unskilled workers. But membership was restricted to the local level and the admisson of unskilled workers was left to the discretion of the local affiliate. Few lodges actually gave such permission, and even fewer unskilled workers joined. The amendment did little to assuage the steelworkers, however. Dissension became so bad that William Weihe lost his <a href="../../../1/8/8/1889.html" title="1889">1889</a> re-election bid for international president.<sup id="_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#_note-12" title="">[13]</a></sup></p>

<p>Frick locked the workers out on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_29.html" title="June 29">June 29</a>.<sup id="_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#_note-15" title="">[16]</a></sup> The striking workers ringed the plant and patrolled the <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monongahela_River_63ad.html" title="Monongahela River">Monongahela River</a> (which ran alongside the mill) to prevent anyone from entering.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> Local sheriff's deputies failed to retake the plant on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_5.html" title="July 5">July 5</a>.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>Frick then sent 300 <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinkerton_National_Detective_Agency_cc8a.html" title="Pinkerton National Detective Agency">Pinkerton National Detective Agency</a> guards to seize the plant and re-open it on the night of <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_5.html" title="July 5">July 5</a>.

Two workers and two Pinkertons died and dozens were wounded.<sup id="_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#_note-21" title="">[22]</a></sup> The Pinkerton tug departed with the wounded agents, leaving the remaining agents stranded.<sup id="_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#_note-22" title="">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>The strikers continued to sporadically fire on the stranded barges, and an attempt was made to sink the barges with a cannon.<sup id="_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#_note-23" title="">[24]</a></sup> When the Pinkertons tried to disembark again at 8:00 a.m., a firefight broke out and four more strikers were killed.<sup id="_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#_note-24" title="">[25]</a></sup> The strikers attempted to burn the barges several times during the day, but failed.<sup id="_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#_note-25" title="">[26]</a></sup> At 5:00 p.m., the Pinkertons surrendered and were handed over to the sheriff.<sup id="_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#_note-26" title="">[27]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_9.html" title="July 9">July 9</a>, despite union claims that law and order had been restored, Governor <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_E._Pattison_46d2.html" title="Robert E.

<p>The strike collapsed after an anarchist gained entrance to Frick's office and shot and stabbed him (although not mortally).<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[31]</a></sup> Public support for the strike evaporated, and large numbers of strikers began crossing the picket line.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>

<p>The Homestead strike affected the AA nationwide. The Joliet Iron and Steel Company, the <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jones_and_Laughlin_Steel_Company_cdea.html" title="Jones and Laughlin Steel Company">Jones and Laughlin Steel Company</a>, the St. Louis Wire Mill Company, the Edgar Thomson works and the Duquesne works all refused to sign contracts with the AA while the Homestead labor action lingered. A deepening in 1889 of the Long Depression led most steel companies to seek wage decreases similar to those imposed at Homestead.<sup id="_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#_note-34" title="">[35]</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1893, Carnegie defeated an AA union drive at the Duquesne steelworks. In 1885, Carnegie ousted the AA at the Edgar Thomson works.<sup id="_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#_note-35" title="">[36]</a></sup></p>
<p>An organizing drive at the Homestead plant in 1896 was crushed by Frick. In May 1899, 300 Homestead workers actually formed a lodge, but Frick ordered the Homestead works shut down and the unionization effort collapsed. Carnegie Steel remained nonunion.<sup id="_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#_note-36" title="">[37]</a></sup></p>
<p>De-unionization efforts throughout the Midwest began in 1897 when Jones and Laughlin Steel refused to sign a contract. By 1900, not a single steel plant in Pennsylvania remained union. The AA presence in Ohio and Illinois continued for a few more years, but the union continued to collapse. Many lodges disbanded, their members disillusioned. Others were easily broken in short, desultory battles. Carnegie Steel's <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mingo_Junction%2C_Ohio_5cd3.html" title="Mingo Junction, Ohio">Mingo Junction, Ohio</a> plant was the last major unionized steel mill, but it, too, broke the AA and withdrew recognition in 1903.<sup id="_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#_note-37" title="">[38]</a></sup></p>

<p>AA membership sagged to 10,000 in 1894 from its high of over 24,000 in 1891. A year later, it was down to 8,000. By 1909, it had sunk to 6,300.<sup id="_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#_note-38" title="">[39]</a></sup></p>
<p>The collapse of the AA in the steel industry was due not only to the shock of the loss at Homestead, but by changing conditions in the steel industry. So long as steel, like iron smelting, remained a craft-like endeavor, the AA—with the allegiance of each plant's skilled workers—could control the industry. But as the steel industry mechanized, the skills needed to manufacture steel shrank. Inexperienced workers could learn the unskilled work quickly. Steel manufacturers also realized that having multi-plant operations meant that production could continue if the union struck a particular facility.<sup id="_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#_note-39" title="">[40]</a></sup></p>
<p>Although the AA lost nearly all its members in the steel industry, the union continued to maintain its presence in the iron industry.</p>
<p>The AA looked for growth, however, in the tin industry, which still required skilled workers. By 1900, the union had organized 75 percent of the sheet metal mills and all but one of the tin mills in the country. That year, the union changed its named to the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers.<sup id="_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#_note-40" title="">[41]</a></sup></p>

<p>But the AA seriously misjudged both the economics of the tin industry. A sheet metal trust formed in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a> which brought nonunion plants into competition with the AA's unionized facilities at the American Sheet Steel Company.

The trust incorporated plants of the American Tin Plate Co. into U.S Steel. If the AA was to save its existing locals at American Tin Plate and American Sheet Steel, it had to organize all the plants of U.S. Steel. But before an organizing drive could get under way, U.S. Steel's tin plate subsidiary withdrew recognition from the AA and refused to bargain at unionized plants. The independent American Sheet Steel did the same.<sup id="_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#_note-42" title="">[43]</a></sup></p>

<p>The AA never recovered from the U.S. Steel strike. It turned strongly conservative, hoping through submissiveness and cooperation to maintain its few remaining contracts. U.S. Steel slowly dismantled AA unions in its plants.<sup id="_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#_note-46" title="">[47]</a></sup></p>
<p>The puddlers in the union's ironworker locals attempted to secede in <a href="../../../1/9/0/1907.html" title="1907">1907</a>. Angered at the union's decline and the way national leaders ignored their interests, the puddlers had retained membership throughout the battles with Carnegie and U.S. Steel. Adopting their old Sons of Vulcan name, about 1,250 of the AA's 2,250 puddlers left the union. But the secession did not last. The Sons of Vulcan won recognition from the Lockhart Iron and Steel Company of <a href="../../../m/c/k/McKees_Rocks%2C_Pennsylvania_77d3.html" title="McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania">McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania</a>. But when the new union demanded a massive wage hike in 1910, the union was forced to strike. After the successful strike, fights broke out between returning union members and strikebreakers who had stayed in the plant. The company slowly replaced all the strikers. Weakened, the Sons of Vulcan soon lost recognition at Youngstown Sheet and Tube, and at the A.M. Byers ironworks. The secessionists slowly drifted back into the AA.<sup id="_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#_note-47" title="">[48]</a></sup></p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_1.html" title="June 1">June 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a>, U.S. Steel finally withdrew recognition of the AA at the 12 remaining unionized mills. While the union's larger locals, such as those at <a href="../../../y/o/u/Youngstown_Sheet_and_Tube_606c.html" title="Youngstown Sheet and Tube">Youngstown Sheet and Tube</a> and the LaBelle Iron Works, disbanded without a fight, most of the union's smaller affiliates fought back. A strike was called. The AFL began a national campaign to publicize dangerous working conditions in the company's plants and the monopolistic nature of the trust. U.S. Steel aggressively countered, breaking up union meetings with hired thugs, driving organizers out of town, bringing in strikebreakers and shifting production to other plants. Although the AA flirted with bankruptcy, donations from other unions kept it afloat. The strike dragged on for 14 months, and was broken in December <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a>.<sup id="_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#_note-48" title="">[49]</a></sup></p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a>, the AA was unable to win wage increases among independent steel employers to match those unilaterally bestowed by U.S. Steel.<sup id="_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#_note-49" title="">[50]</a></sup></p>
<p>The depression of <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a> forced sizeable wage decreases on the union. The union, which had once organized nearly every tin and sheet metal plant in the country, now could count less than one-fifth under contract.

<p>Faced with declining membership, the AA amended its constitution in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1910.html" title="1910">1910</a> and offered membership to all iron and steel workers.

<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/0/1909.html" title="1909">1909</a>, AA president P.J. McArdle won approval for an AFL organizing drive at U.S. Steel, but the drive never got off the ground.<sup id="_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#_note-53" title="">[54]</a></sup></p>
<p>During <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the AA saw some limited growth. The AFL formed a National Committee for Organizing the Iron and Steel Workers to take advantage of worker restiveness.

<p>Shortly after <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armistice_Day_cb39.html" title="Armistice Day">Armistice Day</a>, AFL organizers in and around Pittsburgh began to be harassed. The anti-union pressure quickly spread to the Midwest and West.<sup id="_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#_note-55" title="">[56]</a></sup></p>
<p>The AFL pushed back with a <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steel_strike_of_1919.html" title="Steel strike of 1919">national strike</a>. On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_1.html" title="April 1">April 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1919.html" title="1919">1919</a>, miners in Pennsylvania struck to demand that local officials allow union meetings, and frightened town mayors soon issued meeting permits. The success of the miners' strike led the AA to hold a strike referendum in August in which 98 percent of its members favored a general steelworker strike to begin <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_22.html" title="September 22">September 22</a>.<sup id="_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#_note-56" title="">[57]</a></sup></p>
<p>The September strike shut down half the steel industry.<sup id="_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#_note-57" title="">[58]</a></sup></p>
<p>But the owners quickly turned public opinion against the AFL. A <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Red_Scare_b159.html" title="First Red Scare">Red Scare</a> had swept the United States in the wake of the Russian revolution of October <a href="../../../1/9/1/1917.html" title="1917">1917</a>. The steel companies took advantange of the change in the political climate, publishing articles exposing Foster's past as a <a href="../../../w/o/b/Wobblie.html" title="Wobblie">Wobblie</a> and <a href="../../../s/y/n/Syndicalism.html" title="Syndicalism">syndicalist</a>. The steel companies also played heavily on <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nativism_%28politics%29.html" title="Nativism (politics)">nativist</a> hatreds and implied that immigrant steelworkers were <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communism.html" title="Communism">communists</a>.</p>
<p>The use of state-sponsored violence against the union was widespread. President <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woodrow_Wilson_eb76.html" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>'s stroke, however, prevented federal officials from meeting steelmakers' demands to use federal troops to put down the strike. State and local authorities did intervene, and encouraged the use of widespread violence against the union. State militia violence was so bad that the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Army_6c52.html" title="U.S. Army">U.S. Army</a> was forced to occupy <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary%2C_Indiana_1cab.html" title="Gary, Indiana">Gary, Indiana</a>.<sup id="_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#_note-58" title="">[59]</a></sup></p>
<p>Steel companies turned toward strikebreaking and rumor-mongering to break the strike. Tens of thousands of African American and Mexican workers were brought in as strikebreakers, and many racist white steelworkers returned to work to stop minorities from taking their jobs.<sup id="_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#_note-59" title="">[60]</a></sup></p>
<p>The AFL refused to contribute funds or staff to support the strike. By November, most AA local affiliates had collapsed.<sup id="_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#_note-60" title="">[61]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Steel strike of 1919 collapsed on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_8.html" title="January 8">January 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/2/1920.html" title="1920">1920</a>.

<p>By mid-<a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a>, the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Depression_3776.html" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> and conservative leadership had left the AA with only 5,000 members and less than $30,000 in the bank. Union president Michael F. Tighe, 76, was referred to as 'Grandmother' due to his advanced age and timidity.<sup id="_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#_note-62" title="">[63]</a></sup></p>
<p>Passage of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Industrial_Recovery_Act_8221.html" title="National Industrial Recovery Act">National Industrial Recovery Act</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_16.html" title="June 16">June 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1933.html" title="1933">1933</a> sparked widespread union organizing throughout the country. Even the AA attempted to organize workers. An organizing drive at Jones and Laughlin Steel saw more than 6,000 workers sign membership cards. A similar drive at the U.S. Steel works in nearby Duquesne in late 1933 enrolled one-quarter of the mill's unskilled workforce, mostly immigrants and blacks.<sup id="_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#_note-63" title="">[64]</a></sup></p>
<p>The AA's membership rose to more than 150,000 by February 1934. Nearly one in two steelworkers had signed a union authorization card (although they had not become dues-paying members).<sup id="_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#_note-64" title="">[65]</a></sup></p>
<p>Strike activity, too, soared. Steel strikes affected the same proportion of the industry as strikes did strikes in the rubber and auto industries. The number of striking steel workers jumped from none in 1932 to 34,000 in 1933. Roughly 75 percent of the workers were fighting for recognition of their union.<sup id="_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#_note-65" title="">[66]</a></sup></p>
<p>Tighe denounced the strikes and resented the way new members seized control of the lodges.<sup id="_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#_note-66" title="">[67]</a></sup></p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amalgamated_Association_of_Iron_and_Steel_Workers_df28.html" title="Edit section: Rank and File Movement">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rank and File Movement</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>, an opposition group known as the Rank and File Movement formed within the AA. A number of militant local affiliates had sprung up across the nation or had joined existing lodges in large enough numbers to elect their own, militant leaders. The locals coalesced into the Rank and File Movement and challenged the conservative leadership to act, demanding that the AA reorganize along industrial union lines. At the AA national convention in late April, the Rank and File Movement forced through a resolution which committed the international to a nationwide strike on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_16.html" title="June 16">June 16</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>, if the major steel employers did not recognize the union in every plant.<sup id="_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#_note-67" title="">[68]</a></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the federal regulatory scheme under which the AA had been organizing began to collapse. The <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Labor_Board_fc87.html" title="National Labor Board">National Labor Board</a> (NLB), which attempted to enforce Section 7(a) of the NIRA, lacked the powers necessary to enforce the act, and employers had begun to ignore the Board and violate the law. Senator <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_F._Wagner_d066.html" title="Robert F. Wagner">Robert F. Wagner</a>, co-author of the NIRA, had begun to write new legislation in the fall of 1933 to more fully lay out the rights of workers in the U.S. and establish a new agency to enforce these rights. Wagner introduced his legislation on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_1.html" title="March 1">March 1</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/3/1934.html" title="1934">1934</a>.<sup id="_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#_note-68" title="">[69]</a></sup></p>
<p>Simultaneously, a fight was brewing between the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Auto_Workers_1a7e.html" title="United Auto Workers">United Auto Workers</a> (UAW) and the auto industry. The UAW had organized nearly 50,000 auto workers in 1933, but the auto manufacturers had refused to recognize the union, established company unions and rejected the NLB's call for mediation. Roosevelt had personally intervened in the dispute. In an agreement applauded by the AFL, Roosevelt stripped the NLB of its jurisdiction over the auto industry and established a separate Automobile Labor Board.<sup id="_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#_note-69" title="">[70]</a></sup></p>
<p>The March 1934 auto industry agreement paved the way for new legislation which did away with the toothless NLB, but which only worsened the problems of the labor movement. With the steel strike deadline approaching, the steel industry was gearing up for war with the AA. But the Wagner bill, which might have averted a strike by establishing stronger protections for workers, had little chance of passing. Again Roosevelt intervened. He called a conference at the White House on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_12.html" title="June 12">June 12</a> at which AFL president William Green was one of the attendees. A compromise bill was hammered out which authorized the president to create one or more new labor boards to enforce Section 7(a) by conducting investigations, subpoenaing evidence and witnesses, holding elections and issuing enforcement orders.<sup id="_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#_note-70" title="">[71]</a></sup></p>
<p>At a special convention of the AA on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_13.html" title="June 13">June 13</a>, Green convinced the AA to call the strike off. The Rank and File Movement's inadequate organization, the obstructionist policies of the Amalgamated's national leadership, strong opposition from the steel industry and the promise of enhanced governmental protection cut the legs out from the nascent organizing drive. Tighe exacted his revenge: Throughout the rest of the year, he suspended locals that called for aggressive action.<sup id="_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#_note-71" title="">[72]</a></sup></p>
