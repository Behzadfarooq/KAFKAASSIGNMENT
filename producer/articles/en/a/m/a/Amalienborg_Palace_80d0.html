<p><b>Amalienborg Palace</b> (<a href="../../../d/a/n/Danish_language.html" title="Danish language">Danish</a>: <i>Amalienborg Slot</i>) is the winter home of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Danish_monarchs_8df0.html" title="List of Danish monarchs">Danish royal family</a>, and is located in <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copenhagen.html" title="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denmark.html" title="Denmark">Denmark</a>.

</div>
</div>
<p>The Frederiksstaden district was built on the former grounds of two other palaces.</p>
<p>The first palace was called Sophie Amalienborg Palace. It was built by Queen <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophia_Amelia_of_Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg_90cf.html" title="Sophia Amelia of Brunswick-Lüneburg">Sofie Amalie</a>, consort to <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_III_of_Denmark_74ab.html" title="Frederick III of Denmark">Frederik III</a> on part of the land which King <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_IV_of_Denmark_1901.html" title="Christian IV of Denmark">Christian IV</a> had acquired outside of Copenhagen's old walled city, now known as the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indre_By_9f76.html" title="Indre By">Indre By</a> district, in the early <a href="../../../1/6/0/1600s.html" title="1600s">1600s</a>. Other parts of the land were used for <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosenborg_Castle_393c.html" title="Rosenborg Castle">Rosenborg Castle</a>, Nyboder, and the new Eastern fortified wall around the old city.</p>
<p>It included a garden, as a replacement for an earlier garden which had been destroyed under siege from Sweden in 1659— the Queen’s Garden, which was located beyond the city's western Gate <i>Vesterport</i>, an area today known as <a href="../../../v/e/s/Vesterbro.html" title="Vesterbro">Vesterbro</a>.</p>
<p>Work on the garden was begun in 1664, and the castle was built 1669-1673. The King died in 1670, and the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Dowager_cfa1.html" title="Queen Dowager">Queen Dowager</a> lived there until her death on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_20.html" title="February 20">February 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/8/1685.html" title="1685">1685</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_15.html" title="April 15">April 15</a>, <a href="../../../1/6/8/1689.html" title="1689">1689</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_V_of_Denmark_6040.html" title="Christian V of Denmark">King Christian V</a>, Sophie Amalie’s son, celebrated his forty-fourth birthday at the palace with the presentation of a German opera, perhaps the first opera presentation in Denmark, in a specially built, temporary theatre. The presentation was a great success, and it was repeated a few days later on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_19.html" title="April 19">April 19</a>. However, immediately after the start of the second performance a stage decoration caught fire, causing the theatre and the palace to burn to the ground, and about 180 people to lose their lives.</p>
<p>The King planned to rebuild the palace, whose church, Royal Household and garden buildings were still intact. <a href="../../../o/l/e/Ole_R%C3%B8mer_9797.html" title="Ole Rømer">Ole Rømer</a> headed the preparatory work for the rebuilding of Amalienborg in the early <a href="../../../1/6/9/1690s.html" title="1690s">1690s</a>. In 1694 the King negotiated a deal with the Swedish building master <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicodemus_Tessin_the_Younger_3a7e.html" title="Nicodemus Tessin the Younger">Nicodemus Tessin the Younger</a>, who spent some time in Copenhagen that summer, reviewing the property. His drawing and model were completed in 1697. The King, however, found the plans too ambitious, and instead began tearing down the existing buildings that same year, with the reclaimed building materials used to build a new Garrison Church.</p>
<p>The second Amalienborg was built by <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_IV_of_Denmark_e827.html" title="Frederick IV of Denmark">Frederik IV</a> at the beginning of his reign. No palace was built; however, there was built a summerhouse, a central pavilion with <a href="../../../o/r/a/Orangery.html" title="Orangery">orangeries</a>, and arcades on both side of the pavilion. On one side of the buildings was a French-style garden, and on the other side were military drill grounds. The pavilion had a dining room on the groundfloor. On the upper floor was a salon with a view out to the harbour, the garden and the drill grounds.</p>

Christian IX's Palace in Amalienborg</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>According to Eigtved’s master plans for Frederikstad and the Amalienborg Palaces, the four palaces surrounding the plaza were conceived of as town mansions for the families of chosen nobility. They were identical from the outside, but different on the inside. The building site for each palace was donated free of charge to the chosen aristocrat to build on, and they were further exempted from taxes and duties. The only conditions were that the palaces should comply exactly to the Frederikstad architectural specifications, and that they should be built within a specified time framework.</p>
<p>Building of the palaces on the western side of the square started in 1750. When Eigtved died in 1754 the two western palaces had been completed. The work on the other palaces was continued by Eigtved's colleague and rival, <a href="../../../l/a/u/Lauritz_de_Thurah_0300.html" title="Lauritz de Thurah">Lauritz de Thurah</a> strictly according to Eigtved’s plans. The palaces were completed in 1760.</p>
<p>The four palaces are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Christian VII's Palace, originally known as Moltke's Palace</li>
<li>Christian VIII's Palace, originally known as Levetzau's Palace</li>
<li>Frederik VIII's Palace, originally known as <a href="../../../b/r/o/Brockdorff%27s_Palace_96a7.html" title="Brockdorff's Palace">Brockdorff's Palace</a></li>
<li>Christian IX's Palace, originally known as Schack's Palace</li>
</ul>
<p>When the Royal Family found itself homeless after the Christiansborg Castle fire of 1794, the palaces were empty for long periods throughout the year, with the exception of the Brockdorff Palace, which housed the Military Academy. The noblemen who owned them were willing to part with their mansions for promotion and money, and the Moltke and Schack Palaces were acquired in the course of a few days.</p>
<p>A colonnade, designed by royal architect <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caspar_Frederik_Harsdorff_4af0.html" title="Caspar Frederik Harsdorff">Caspar Frederik Harsdorff</a>, was added 1794-1795 to connect the recently occupied King’s palace, Moltke Palace, with that of the Crown Prince, Schack’s Palace.</p>
<p>Currently, only the palaces of Christian VII and Christian VIII are open to the public.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amalienborg_Palace_80d0.html" title="Edit section: Christian VII's Palace">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Christian VII's Palace</span></h3>
<p>Christian VII's Palace is also known as Moltke's Palace, and was originally built for Lord High Steward Adam Gottlob Moltke. It is the southwestern palace, and has been since 1885 used to accommodate and entertain prominent guests, for receptions, and for ceremonial purposes.</p>
<p>Moltke’s Palace was erected in 1750-1754 by the best craftsmen and artists of their day under the supervision of Eigtved. It was the most expensive of the four palaces at the time it was built, and had the most extravagant interiors. Its Great Hall (<i>Riddersalen</i>) featured woodcarvings ("<i><a href="../../../b/o/i/Boiserie.html" title="Boiserie">boiserie</a></i>") by <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_August_le_Clerc_cf7a.html" title="Louis August le Clerc">Louis August le Clerc</a>, paintings by <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fran%C3%A7ois_Boucher_293e.html" title="François Boucher">François Boucher</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stucco.html" title="Stucco">stucco</a> by Giovanni Battista Fossati, and is acknowledged widely as perhaps the finest Danish Rococo interior.</p>
<p>The mansion was formally opened on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_30.html" title="March 30">March 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/5/1754.html" title="1754">1754</a>, the King’s thirtieth birthday. Due to Eigtved's death a few months later, such follow up work as the Banqueting Hall, was completed by <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicolas-Henri_Jardin_128f.html" title="Nicolas-Henri Jardin">Nicolas-Henri Jardin</a>.</p>
<p>Immediately after the Christiansborg Castle fire in March 1794 and two years after the death of the original owner, the palace was sold to the royal family, headed by the schizophrenic King <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_VII_of_Denmark_e304.html" title="Christian VII of Denmark">Christian VII</a>. It was the first of the four palaces to be sold to the royal family, and Caspar Frederik Harsdorff was assigned to turn it into a royal residence. They moved in December 1794.</p>
<p>After Christian VII’s death in 1808, Frederik VI used the palace for his <a href="../../../r/o/y/Royal_Household_0460.html" title="Royal Household">Royal Household</a>. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs used parts of the Palace in the years 1852-1885. For short periods of time in the intervening years the palace has housed various members of the royal family while restoration took place on their respective palaces. In 1971-1975 a small kindergarten was established at the palace, and later a schoolroom, for Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim.</p>
<p>After 200 years the facade, decorated by German scuptor Johan Christof Petzold, was severely damaged, causing parts of Amalienborg Place to be closed off to prevent injury. Since 1982 both the exterior and interior have been restored. Restoration work was completed at the beginning of Copenhagen's year as <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Capital_of_Culture_2ac3.html" title="European Capital of Culture">European Capital of Culture</a> in 1996. In 1999 the restoration was awarded a medal by <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europa_Nostra_6475.html" title="Europa Nostra">Europa Nostra</a>, an international preservation organisation.</p>
<p>The palace is occasionally open to the general public.</p>

<p>Christian VIII's Palace is also known as Levetzau's Palace, and was originally built for <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privy_Councillor_8183.html" title="Privy Councillor">Privy Councillor</a> Count Christian Frederik Levetzau in 1750-1760. It is the northwestern palace, and was the home of Crown Prince <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederik%2C_Crown_Prince_of_Denmark_2ad7.html" title="Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark">Frederik</a> until 2004.</p>
<p>After Eigtved's death in 1754, the supervision of the building's construction was carried out by royal architect Lauritz de Thurah according to Eigtved's plans.</p>
<p>The palace was sold by the <a href="../../../f/e/e/Fee_tail.html" title="Fee tail">entailed</a> estate of Restrup, which had been established in <a href="../../../1/7/5/1756.html" title="1756">1756</a> by Levertzau, the late owner. The family set one condition when they sold the building— that the Count’s <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coat_of_arms.html" title="Coat of arms">coat of arms</a> should never be removed from the building. It can still be seen beside that of the monarch's.</p>
<p>The King's half-brother <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hereditary_Prince_Frederick_of_Denmark_and_Norway_50a4.html" title="Hereditary Prince Frederick of Denmark and Norway">Frederik</a> bought the palace in 1794, and painter and architect <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikolaj_Abraham_Abildgaard_fdf2.html" title="Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard">Nikolai Abildgaard</a> modernized the interiors in the new French <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empire_%28style%29.html" title="Empire (style)">Empire</a> style. The palace was named Christian VIII’s Palace after his son, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_VIII_of_Denmark_19a0.html" title="Christian VIII of Denmark">Christian Frederik</a>, who grew up in the palace, took over the building in 1805 upon the death of his father, and would become king in 1839.</p>
<p>Christian VIII died in 1848, and the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Dowager_cfa1.html" title="Queen Dowager">Queen Dowager</a>, Caroline Amalie, died in 1881. From 1885 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs used parts of the Palace, but moved in 1898 when the Palace became the residence of Crown Prince <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_X_of_Denmark_6bc4.html" title="Christian X of Denmark">Christian (X)</a> and Princess <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandrine_of_Mecklenburg-Schwerin_ed33.html" title="Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin">Alexandrine</a>. After the death of Christian X the Palace was placed at the disposal of Prince <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Knud_of_Denmark_8d06.html" title="Prince Knud of Denmark">Knud</a>, the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heir_Presumptive_303a.html" title="Heir Presumptive">Heir Presumptive</a>.</p>
<p>Today, there is little left of the remaining rococo interior; much of the interior reflects the changing taste and style of its residents over the years.</p>
<p>In the 1980s the palace was restored as residence for the Crown Prince, storage facilities for the Queen’s Reference Library and a museum for the <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl%C3%BCcksburg_ead1.html" title="Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg">Royal House of Glücksborg</a>. The museum features private royal apartments from 1863-1947 including original fittings and furnishings.</p>

<p>Frederik VIII's Palace is also known as Brockdorff's Palace. It is the northeastern palace, and was the home of <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Dowager_cfa1.html" title="Queen Dowager">Queen Dowager</a> <a href="../../../i/n/g/Ingrid_of_Sweden_c3c2.html" title="Ingrid of Sweden">Ingrid</a> until her death in 2000.

<p>It was originally built for Count Joachim Brockdorff in the 1750s. Brockdorff died in 1763, and Lord High Steward Adam Gottlob Moltke acquired the palace. Moltke sold it two years later to Frederik V.</p>
<p>From 1767 it housed the Military Academy, also known as the Army Cadet Academy (<i>Landkadetakademi</i>). In 1788 naval cadets replaced the army cadets. The Academy was closed in 1827.</p>
<p>The following year the palace went to Christian VIII’s son-in-law and heir, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_VII_of_Denmark_7e21.html" title="Frederick VII of Denmark">Frederik VII</a>, who ascended the throne in 1848, and his bride, the King’s daughter, Princess Vilhelmine. Architect Jørgen Hansen Koch successfully and thoroughly refurbished the palace in French Empire style in 1827-1828.</p>
<p>After the marriage was dissolved in 1837, various members of the royal family lived in the palace. In 1869 it became the home of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_VIII_of_Denmark_62b5.html" title="Frederick VIII of Denmark">Frederik VIII</a>. In 1934 it became the home of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_IX_of_Denmark_0954.html" title="Frederick IX of Denmark">Frederik IX</a> and Queen Ingrid.</p>

<p>Christian IX's Palace is also known as Schack's Palace. It is the southeastern palace, and has been the home of the royal couple since 1967.</p>
<p>Building work was commenced in 1750 by Eigtved, and was supervised first by architect Christian Josef Zuber and later by Philip de Lange.</p>
<p>It was originally commissioned by <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privy_council.html" title="Privy council">Privy Councillor</a> Severin Løvenskjold, but in 1754 he had to give up due to economic difficulties. The project was taken over by Countess Anne Sophie Schack nee Rantzau and her step-grandson Hans Schack. A fire shortly after the change of ownership delayed completion by a couple of years.</p>

<p>In 1794 the palace was taken over from private residence by the <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regent.html" title="Regent">Regent</a>, Crown Prince <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frederick_VI_of_Denmark_d114.html" title="Frederick VI of Denmark">Frederik VI</a>, and his Crown Princess <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marie_Sophie_of_Hesse_5048.html" title="Marie Sophie of Hesse">Marie of Hessen-Kassel</a>. He died in 1839, and she in 1852. The palace was used after her death by, among others, the Supreme Court and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>It was later the home of <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_IX_of_Denmark_cd26.html" title="Christian IX of Denmark">Christian IX</a> until his death in 1906. The home remained untouched afterwards until 1948. In 1967 the Palace was restored for the successor to the throne, Crown Princess <a href="../../../m/a/r/Margrethe_II_of_Denmark_315a.html" title="Margrethe II of Denmark">Margrethe</a> and Prince <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henrik%2C_Prince_Consort_of_Denmark_c771.html" title="Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark">Henrik</a>.</p>
