<p><b>Amateurism</b> (from Fr. <i>amateur</i> "lover of," from O.Fr., from L. <i>amatorem</i>nom. <i>amator</i>, "lover,"). Based on etymology, an <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur.html" title="Amateur">Amateur</a> is someone who engages in an activity out of love. As a value system, amateurism elevates things done without self-interest above those done for pay (<i>i.e.,</i> <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professionalism.html" title="Professionalism">professionalism</a>). The term has particular currency in its usage with regard to <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sport.html" title="Sport">sports</a>. By definition <b>amateur sports</b> require participants to participate without remuneration. Amateurism was a zealously guarded ideal in the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a>, especially among the upper classes, but faced steady erosion throughout the 20th century, and is now strictly held as an ideal by fewer and fewer organizations governing sports, even as they maintain the word "amateur" in their titles.</p>
<p>The term "shamateurism" has been coined to refer to the hypocrisy which arose in some highly competitive sports where it became common for individuals, governments, and/or private organizations to extend to "amateur" competitors financial rewards for their participation or achievements, in effect making a "sham" of their amateur status.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_sports.html" title="Edit section: Background">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> sport had always been the preserve of the rich who were the only people who had free time in which to pursue sport, the working classes worked six days a week and sport was forbidden on the <a href="../../../s/a/b/Sabbath.html" title="Sabbath">sabbath</a>. The traditional mass sports that did exist were mostly played on public holidays e.g. <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrove_Tuesday_ab97.html" title="Shrove Tuesday">Shrove Tuesday</a> when traditional 'mob football' was popular. When the '<a href="../../../f/a/c/Factory_Act_of_1844_d8c1.html" title="Factory Act of 1844">Factories Act</a>' gave working men half a day off the opportunity to take part in sport was suddenly available. Unlike the rich where payment had never been an issue working class sportsmen found it hard to play top level sport due the need to turn up to work. Hence there were competing interests between those who wished sport to be open to all and those who feared that professionalism would destroy the 'Corinthian spirit'.</p>
<p>Proponents of the amateur ideal deplored the influence of <a href="../../../m/o/n/Money.html" title="Money">money</a> and the effect it has on sports. It was claimed that it is in the interest of the professional to receive the highest amount of pay possible per unit of performance, not to perform to the highest standard possible where this does not bring additional benefit.</p>
<p>Strict prohibition of professionals was held to inhibit the stated goals of celebrating the highest standards of performance, and this argument has generally defeated amateurism around the world in many sports.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_sports.html" title="Edit section: The present day">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The present day</span></h2>
<p>By the early <a href="../../../2/1/s/21st_Century_ad84.html" title="21st Century">21st Century</a> the <a href="../../../o/l/y/Olympic_Games_4ea8.html" title="Olympic Games">Olympic Games</a> and all the major team sports accepted professional competitors. However, there are still some sports which maintain a distinction between amateur and professional status with separate competitive leagues. Most prominent of these is <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golf.html" title="Golf">golf</a>.</p>
<p>Problems can arise for amateur sportsmen when sponsors offer to help with an amateur's playing expenses in the hope of striking lucrative endorsement deals with them in case they become professionals at a later date. This may jeopardize their status as amateurs, and if allowed to let slide, may be seen as corruption or cheating rather than as true "shamateurism".</p>
<p>Where professionals are permitted, it is hard for amateurs to compete against them. Whether this is a triumph of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_market.html" title="Free market">free market</a> or an example of corruption depends on the viewer's perspective. To some an amateur means an incompetent or also-ran, and to others it means an <a href="../../../i/d/e/Idealist.html" title="Idealist">idealist</a>. To say that the athlete should not be paid can prevent performances only possible for an athlete who is free to pursue the sport fulltime without other sources of income; to make payment for performance the driving engine of the sport can invite cynicism and inflated wages. A truly idealist maximisation of athletic excellence without <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercenary.html" title="Mercenary">mercenary</a> motive seems beyond human capacity.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_sports.html" title="Edit section: North American collegiate athletics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">North American collegiate athletics</span></h2>
<p>All North American university sports are conducted by amateurs. Even the most commercialized college sports, such as <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association_2404.html" title="National Collegiate Athletic Association">NCAA</a> <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_football.html" title="College football">football</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/l/College_basketball.html" title="College basketball">basketball</a>, do not financially compensate competitors, although coaches and trainers generally are paid. <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athletic_scholarship.html" title="Athletic scholarship">Athletic scholarship</a> programs, unlike academic scholarship programs, cannot cover more than the cost of food, housing, tuition, and other university-related expenses. A promising academic can be paid to go to school, but a promising athlete cannot.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that the rules are not circumvented, stringent rules restrict gift-giving during the recruitment process as well as during and even after a collegiate athlete's career; college athletes also cannot endorse products, which some may consider a violation of free speech rights.</p>
<p>Some have criticised this system as exploitative; prominent university athletics programs are major commercial endeavors, and can easily rake in millions of dollars in profit during a successful season. College athletes spend a great deal of time "working" for the university, and earn nothing from it at the time; basketball and football coaches, meanwhile, earn salaries that can compare with those of professional teams' coaches.</p>
<p>The most ardent critics of collegiate athletics say one of two things. First, that young athletes (stereotypically young <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">black</a> men, especially in football and basketball) are being encouraged to waste their time chasing after a career in basketball or football for four years rather than focus on getting an education while in college. Second, that colleges have no business wasting time and effort in developing apparently "professional" athletic programs, as they should be concentrating on educating people.</p>
<p>Supporters of the system say that college athletes can always make use of the education they earn as students if their athletic career doesn't pan out, and that allowing universities to pay college athletes would rapidly lead to deterioration of the already-marginal academic focus of college athletics programs. They also point out that athletic scholarships allow many young men and women who would otherwise be unable to afford to go to college, or would not be accepted, to get a quality education.</p>

<p>Through most of the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a> the Olympics nominally only allowed amateur athletes to participate. The amateur code was strictly enforced. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Thorpe_b93f.html" title="Jim Thorpe">Jim Thorpe</a> was stripped of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Track_and_field.html" title="Track and field">track and field</a> medals for having taken expense money for playing baseball in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1912.html" title="1912">1912</a>.</p>
<p>Later on, however, successful Olympians from Western countries often accepted endorsement contracts from <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sponsors.html" title="Sponsors">sponsors</a>. Complex rules involving the payment of the athlete's earnings into trust funds rather than directly to the athletes themselves, were developed in an attempt to work around this issue, but the intellectual evasion involved was considered embarrassing to the Olympic movement and the key Olympic sports by some. In the same era, the nations of the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_bloc.html" title="Communist bloc">Communist bloc</a> entered teams of Olympians who were all nominally <a href="../../../s/t/u/Student.html" title="Student">students</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Soldier.html" title="Soldier">soldiers</a>, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full time basis. (<a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korea_2774.html" title="North Korea">North Korea</a>, and to some extent <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> still do this; although China allows professionalism in popular team sports, it can be assumed that athletes in disciplines such as gymnastics from these countries are trained in state academies and have state-given stipends.)</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../1/9/7/1972.html" title="1972">1972</a> retirement of <a href="../../../i/o/c/IOC_7245.html" title="IOC">IOC</a> President <a href="../../../a/v/e/Avery_Brundage_d25f.html" title="Avery Brundage">Avery Brundage</a>, the Olympic amateurism rules were steadily relaxed and in many areas amount only to technicalities and lip service. In the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>, the <i>Amateur Sports Act</i> of <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a> prohibits national governing bodies from having more stringent standards of amateur status than required by international governing bodies of respective sports.</p>
<p>In 1982 <a href="../../../a/d/i/Adidas.html" title="Adidas">Adidas</a> was paying British Olympic athletes to wear their gear. The main person involved in the scandal was <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horst_Dassler_2e9e.html" title="Horst Dassler">Horst Dassler</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../../t/e/a/Team_sport.html" title="Team sport">team sport</a> which has had the greatest problems with shamateurism is probably <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_union.html" title="Rugby union">rugby union</a>. At one time <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_football.html" title="Rugby football">rugby</a> had been popular with both the middle and working classes in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> yet working class players found it hard to play away games or to cope with injuries. 'Boot money' had long been paid to certain players to help them cope with expenses. The struggle between clubs that supported 'broken time payments' and those that supported a stricter interpretation of amateurism came to a head in 1895 when clubs from the North of England broke away to form the Northern Rugby Union (later known as the <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_Football_League_e235.html" title="Rugby Football League">Rugby Football League</a>), whose rules eventually diverged from the <a href="../../../r/f/u/RFU_e142.html" title="RFU">RFU</a>'s, forming the sport now known as <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league.html" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a>. Rugby league stayed an amateur sport for 3 years following the great schism with the exception of allowing payment for missing work through playing commitments or injury, after this they allowed players to be paid for playing as long as they had a regular job. Full-time professionalism did not come into <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_league.html" title="Rugby league">rugby league</a> until much later and amateurism continued in the form of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Amateur_Rugby_League_Association_e91b.html" title="British Amateur Rugby League Association">British Amateur Rugby League Association</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_union.html" title="Rugby union">Rugby union</a> was to officially remain an amateur sport for the next 100 years. This was occasionally strictly enforced as in the famous case of Jock Wemyss who in 1920 was told that he could not be given a Scotland shirt for his second cap since they had given him one six years earlier. In 1931 France was even expelled from the <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_Union_Six_Nations_Championship_9147.html" title="Rugby Union Six Nations Championship">Five Nations Championship</a> following allegations that their domestic league was in fact professional, but without any noticeable changes they were allowed to rejoin just before <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>.</p>
<p>The union authorities placed severe sanctions on associations with rugby league. Even playing an amateur game was sufficient to receive a ban from the sport. In one incident in the early 1900s a union team from <a href="../../../h/u/d/Huddersfield.html" title="Huddersfield">Huddersfield</a> played a charity match against a local league side; all the players were subsequently banned for being "professionalised". Union players who actually went to play professional league were routinely banned for life from even attending rugby union matches as supporters. In 1959 <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Jopling%2C_Baron_Jopling_e93b.html" title="Michael Jopling, Baron Jopling">Michael Jopling</a>, the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29_3ac1.html" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative</a> candidate for election in <a href="../../../w/a/k/Wakefield.html" title="Wakefield">Wakefield</a> was invited to kick off one half of a <a href="../../../w/a/k/Wakefield_Trinity_6246.html" title="Wakefield Trinity">Wakefield Trinity</a> home match. He was later informed by his local rugby union club that he had "professionalised" himself and that he was no longer welcome at the club <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2094-1650644,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2094-1650644,00.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>Payment for expenses was often permitted however. The "amateur" <a href="../../../1/9/0/1908.html" title="1908">1908</a> <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia_national_rugby_union_team.html" title="Australia national rugby union team">Australian</a> rugby union tourists to <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> received payment of 21 <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shilling.html" title="Shilling">shillings</a> a week, more than twice the payment for players on the following season's "professional" <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_national_rugby_league_team_3f1d.html" title="Great Britain national rugby league team">Great Britain</a> rugby league tour of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australasia.html" title="Australasia">Australasia</a>.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>By the 1980s and 1990s there were mounting allegations that the top players were in fact making a living from the game.

<p><b>Boot money</b> has been a phenomenon in amateur sport for centuries. The term "boot money" became popularized in the 1880s when it was not unusual for players to find half a crown (corresponding to 12½ pence after <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimal_Day_6980.html" title="Decimal Day">decimalisation</a>) in their boots after a game.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Football_Association_b0ba.html" title="The Football Association">The Football Association</a> prohibited paying players until <a href="../../../1/8/8/1885.html" title="1885">1885</a>, and this is referred to as the "legalization" of professionalism because it was an amendment of the "Laws of the Game". However, a maximum salary cap of twelve pounds a week for a player with outside employment and fifteen pounds a week for a player with no outside employment lingered until the <a href="../../../1/9/6/1960s.html" title="1960s">1960s</a> even as transfer fees reached over a hundred thousand pounds; again, "boot money" was seen as a way of topping up pay. Today the most prominent English football clubs that are not professional are semi-professional (paying part-time players more than the old maximum for top professionals; this includes all the major existing <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Women's football (soccer)">women's clubs</a>, in which full professionalism has not taken root yet) and the most prominent true amateur men's club is probably <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corinthian-Casuals_F.C._5563.html" title="Corinthian-Casuals F.C.">Corinthian-Casuals F.C.</a> (descended from the club that was once Britain's finest in the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_century.html" title="19th century">19th century</a> but today four divisions below <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Football_League_a245.html" title="The Football League">the Football League</a>).

<p>Ironically, <a href="../../../s/a/i/Sailing.html" title="Sailing">sailing</a> has taken the opposite course. Around the turn of the century, much of sailing was professionals paid by interested idle rich. Today, sailing, especially <a href="../../../d/i/n/Dinghy.html" title="Dinghy">dinghy</a> sailing, is an example of a sport which is still largely populated by amateurs. For example, in the recent Team Racing Worlds, and certainly the American Team Racing Nationals, most of the sailors competing in the event were amateurs. While many competitive sailors are employed in businesses related to sailing (primarily sailmaking, naval architecture, boatbuilding and coaching), most are not compensated for their own competitions. In large keelboat racing, such as the Volvo Around the World Race and the America's Cup, this amateur spirit has given way in recent years to large corporate sponsorships and paid crews, but even there one will occasionally find a team that stays true to the Corinthian ideal.</p>

<p>Like other Olympic sports, <a href="../../../f/i/g/Figure_skating.html" title="Figure skating">figure skating</a> used to have very strict amateur status rules. Over the years, these rules were relaxed to allow competitive skaters to receive token payments for performances in exhibitions (amid persistent rumors that they were receiving more money "under the table"), then to accept money for professional activities such as endorsements provided that the payments were made to trust funds rather than to the skaters themselves.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1992.html" title="1992">1992</a>, trust funds were abolished, and the <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Skating_Union_fb15.html" title="International Skating Union">International Skating Union</a> voted both to remove most restrictions on amateurism, and to allow skaters who had previously lost their amateur status to apply for reinstatement of their eligibility. A number of skaters, including <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Boitano_9b0b.html" title="Brian Boitano">Brian Boitano</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katarina_Witt_878f.html" title="Katarina Witt">Katarina Witt</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jayne_Torvill_c867.html" title="Jayne Torvill">Jayne Torvill</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Dean_bed4.html" title="Christopher Dean">Christopher Dean</a>, and <a href="../../../e/k/a/Ekaterina_Gordeeva_4a13.html" title="Ekaterina Gordeeva">Ekaterina Gordeeva</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Sergei_Grinkov_afea.html" title="Sergei Grinkov">Sergei Grinkov</a>, took advantage of the reinstatement rule to compete at the <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994_Winter_Olympics_3ac2.html" title="1994 Winter Olympics">1994 Winter Olympics</a>. However, when all of these skaters promptly returned to the pro circuit again, the ISU decided the reinstatement policy was a failure and it was discontinued in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>.</p>
<p>Prize money at ISU competitions was introduced in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, paid by the sale of the <a href="../../../t/e/l/Television.html" title="Television">television</a> rights to those events. In addition to prize money, Olympic-eligible skaters may also earn money through appearance fees at shows and competitions, endorsements, movie and television contracts, coaching, and other "professional" activities, provided that their activities are approved by their national federations. The only activity that is strictly forbidden by the ISU is participating in unsanctioned "pro" competitions, which the ISU uses to maintain their monopoly status as the governing body in the sport.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Many people in the skating world still use "turning pro" as jargon to mean retiring from competitive skating, even though most top competitive skaters are already full-time professionals, and many skaters who retire from competition to concentrate on show skating or coaching do not actually lose their competition eligibility in the process.</p>
