<p>The last paragraph needs NPOVing, but I'm not the person to do it. Who exactly claims amalgam is poisoning patients, who advises the removal of all fillings.

<dd>Theresa, it doesn't make any difference. This is Wikipedia. This artical, as it is at this time, is both POV and factually inaccurate.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>I clarified mercury's toxicity (which is mild) and he immediately went crying to <a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Maveric149/archive_19#Mercury" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Maveric149/archive_19#Mercury" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> who dismissed his complaints like the rubbish they are.

If people want to start again with a new username that's fine by me, it's only if they use two accounts at once - for example if they vote twice in a poll, once with each account, that is becomes appropriate to bring sockpuppetry to the attention of the community. And finally there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that a single edit by an anon user, (that changes the spelling of a word) means that crusadeon illeteracy is using proxies to hide his edits.</dd>

<dd>Mercury will amalgamate easily with gold and silver. One way this was used was at the "sludge" portion of a mine. After all the usable ore was extracted, the sludge was passed over a copper-mercury amalgam, which bound to the gold. The copper-mercury-gold amalgam was occasionaly scraped off and then distilled to remove the mercury. The result was fairly high purity gold.</dd>

In fact if you think about it, this is almost certainly what's going on as he has signed his comment above while editing as an non logged in user with IP 203.109.254.49 which resolves to proxy1.ihug.co.nz compare this with the IP you pointed out 203.109.254.40 which resolves to proxy2.ihug.co.nz.</dd>

<dd>It was nothing personal. It was just that too much needed to be done. You also used phrasing that seemed to indicate a bias. You should almost never use "I" in an article. Also, "START XXX HERE" is not very becoming of an encyclopedia. I'm going to look over your contributions to this article and attempt to NPOV them.</dd>

<dd>I'm sorry, but there is very little that I can use. The links you have provided as being "scientific", are anything but. Their methods are not scientific. They did not check the mercury levels in the sheep until after they removed the fillings. That would cause an enormous amount (compared to what would be released if they were left intact) of mercury to be released, and with radioactive tracers, even minute amounts of them will show up brightly on an X-ray image.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You should also know that in a scientific study, one should never present any kind of opinion at all. Their "mercury vapor releasing tooth" presentation was full of opinion and bias. I especially liked this quote: "... even if we don't consider the neurological impairment and the brain damage that they surely cause in dental personnel and the infertility and the heart break that they cause to so many families". They are the same knid of uninformed people. They just attempt to seem more plausible by presenting their evidence in a scintific manner.</dd>

<p>Earlier you stated "I clarified mercury's toxicity (which is mild)".</p>
<dl>
<dd>I assume you are refering to <a href="../../../m/e/r/Mercury_%28element%29.html" title="Mercury (element)">Mercury (element)</a>?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes. Mild toxicity isn't like the "completely safe" view of the document at the time. Thanks for the "widely regarded as safe".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Since you appear to know about chemistry more than I do, maybe you can document that _mild_ toxicity so that the page is no longer "amalgam never-ever toxic" POV?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>See below, I don't see how an amalgam can be toxic.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That will be difficult for me to do. With the knowlege I have of chemistry, Mercury, and metalurgy; I do not believe that amalgam fillings pose any threat to human health whatsoever.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hmmm. Perhaps the 120 millions US $ amalgam study here will help your toward NPOV. <a href="http://www.vimy-dentistry.com/nhanesscreening.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.vimy-dentistry.com/nhanesscreening.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.vimy-dentistry.com/nhanesscreening.htm</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Nope. "...mercury is the most toxic non-radioactive element towards human life..." that statement is false.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Perhaps you can tell me about the difference between non-gamma-2 amalgam and gamma-2? The anti-amalgam fans claim non-gamma-2 leaks more, but the German government banned gamma-2 claiming it leaks too much compared to the non-gamma-2. Is there any metallurgic document to help calculate the leak of either?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, but metallurgy is not my specialty.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The article clearly states that alloys do not exhibit all of the properties that their constituent metals have. Objectively looking at the issue, given that so many people have amalgam fillings, why aren't people dying left and right from mercury poisoning?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Considering the extremely hard diagnosis of mercury poisoning even as an excellent team of toxicology specialists look at an affected town (Minamata, Japan, 30+ year of poisonous fish killed hundreds), it is unclear that people dying from say multiple sclerosis will be mentionned under a mercury poisoning statistic. It's much easier to recognize the multiple sclerosis entity, tell the patient of his impending doom from a disease with no known cause, give him the number of the polluter-funded multiple sclerosis association, and leave it at that. Yet when you want to study neuron-damaging immune disorders like that you expose rats to mercury and lead together and get the same symptoms and you can cure them with lead chelators(which removes mercury as well - at least in rats). The same paradigm existed before lead paint was banned (polluter-funded support groups for patients with a disease "with no known cause" and all that).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So mercury poisoning diagnosis is hard. Let's simplify your question to: why aren't people simply dying left and right?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Mercury poisoning diagnosis is not hard, Mercury poisoning is so rare that it is seldom looked for as a cause of symptoms.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Only what leaks from the alloy is toxic AFAIK, which is certainly not a quick effect like eating a thermometer and being somewhat sickly for a day. A good question is how much amalgam leaks.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Amalgam does leak substantially and neuron growth cone degeneration at low levels covered here: <a href="http://www.mindfully.org/Health/Mercurcy-Exposure-Nerves.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.mindfully.org/Health/Mercurcy-Exposure-Nerves.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindfully.org/Health/Mercurcy-Exposure-Nerves.htm</a></dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think you have misunderstood the purpose of that study. They were not studying what, if any, affect amalgams have on brain tissue, they were studying what affect Mercury ions have on brain tissue.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the study, they cultured snail neurons, and then put a few drops of Mercury chloride on them. Of course the neurons are going to degrade. Especially because they used a Mercury salt, which are much more dangerous than elemental Mercury or even Mercury (II) oxide. What would you expect to happen if they put a few drops of phosphoric acid on a snail neuron? Probably the same thing, but millions of people drink phosphoric acid on a daily basis (albeit in a dilute form). In fact, if you have ever drank a soda, you have consumed phosphoric acid, which is also used as a metal etchant.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This neuron degeneration is typical of a number of human diseases.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also many forms of mercury are delayed effects. You can have 80 times the fatal level in your blood from a single exposure and look/feel healthy for months at a time. Then go sick and even die(with the same neuron damage shown in the video at <a href="http://www.iaomt.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.iaomt.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.iaomt.org/</a> ). The link with the original exposure is rarely made because of the months between the exposure and effects, and the strong symptoms appearing all of a sudden hinting wrongly at a recent cause(which is never found).</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, that was the dimethylmercury poisoning case where Dr. Wetterhahn died. A professor at my college knew her personally, but how does this apply to the article? We are not debating the fact that some merucy compounds are toxic, we are debating whether or not amalgams are.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Key research here would be what mercury does when it enters the body as a vapor or thru lymphatic draining(a quick way to administer certain drugs under the tongue).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn't imagine that much would happen. Elemental Mercury needs to oxidise to present any danger to the human body. I don't think lymph would be very rich in oxidsers.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In amalgam the effect certainly doesn't affect all of the population(hence the counter-indications of the manufacturer), usually requires blood-brain barrier to be weakened by another process (fluoridation come to mind), and the varieties of symptoms or mercuric compounds involved or claimed are astonishingly numerous. Some people having the complete set of statistical factors against them are doing fine, just like with cigarettes.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Why is the human lifespan longer now than at any point in human history, given all the "toxic" chemicals that are being used in our food, water, clothes, medical treatments?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Modern hygiene, vaccines(even those mercury-controversial ones), a few chemical bans (leaded paint and gasoline banned, etc), addition of vitamins/minerals to some food because having everyone taking vitamins is too hard(vitamin D in milk, enriched wheat flour, etc). Less wars deaths, welfare so the poor don't just starve, better public education about health, more condom use, various medical breakthrus, and probably 20 more factors.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Your question is very generic, so I researched from the amalgam point of view first.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Rising is the lifespan of the average individual. And maybe even the one of the person covered in amalgam counter-indications, or those who have a disease that has a synergic toxicity with mercury(for lead poisoning there are proof) because of all the other factors.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've researched the diet-type that would cause the fewest cavities, therefore the fewest amalgam in theory(could not verify historics but Japan no longer does amalgam in dental schools); I've found Japan with the highest life expectancy despite high pollution necessiting gas masks for the sick at street corners. The Okinawa island near Japan, far away from urban pollution, has the longest-lived group of centenarians per capita on earth by a wide margin. They also have extremely low rates of handicaps, and a very low crime rate.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Yes, pollution affects life expectancy and such; But I'd like to stick to the topic of amalgam in the mouth of people, but not other products or amalgam bits as sewer waste.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'm still trying to verify the amalgam use in Japan. Anecdotal evidence from my Japaneese-born friends has been good but not wikifiable.</dd>

<dd><i>In 1984, human autopsy studies were published which demonstrated that the amount of mercury found in brain and kidney tissue was directly related to the amount of mercury amalgam fillings in the teeth. This contradicts the previous position that mercury in fish was the largest contributor to mercury in the brain of the average person.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This needs a reliable reference.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK. Seeking...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>In the 1980s, significant research at the University of Calgary School of Medicine demonstrated that mercury from dental amalgam fillings could be found in the blood and tissues of pregnant mothers and their babies within a few days. Neither of those studies make claims regarding the safety or toxicity of mercury in the brain at the levels detected in the study.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This needs a reliable reference.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK. Seeking...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>In this case the government worries about much smaller quantities of mercury than are contributed by amalgam user brains.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I am very skeptical of this statement. Elemental mercury is extremely unreactive, you could drink a shot glass of mercury and remain unharmed. Any exposure to elemental mercury will cause only negligible amounts to be absorbed by the body.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>True; proven in cases where children eat broken thermometers. In this case the mercury comes out.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The very point I am researching right now is that amalgam-leaded mercury ISN'T a liquid it's a vapor. And it ISN'T swallowed, it is leeched thru the lymphatic drain under the tongue which bypasses the digestive system and the liver(used as such as the administration route of certain drugs). I could not find any internet-available documents on it so far.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As I've stated above, I don't think that lymph would affect Mercury in any significant way.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, very large amounts of mercury are absorbed by the body when it is exposed to organic mercury compounds. See <a href="../../../d/i/m/Dimethylmercury.html" title="Dimethylmercury">dimethylmercury</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Which is why I mentionned the fish advisory is misleading people to think mercury of amalgam is as toxic as fish mercury. You left the fish advisory by itself, which is meaningless by itself - it should have been removed if the rest of that argument is removed.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Chemical reactions causing the amalgam alloy to break down have long been claimed to make the mercury bound to something else. I lack chemistry competence to prove or disprove it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>This is a widely misunderstood position because mercury in fish is 80% methylmercury(a known neurotoxin), which is not present in amalgam. The ADA claims that the mercury in amalgam is not neurotoxic at all.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This makes no sense without the above text.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Scrap the ADA reference; the ADA has changed it so I'm no longer using it (for the same reason I'm not using their 1800's arguments that mixing amalgam in the office is nontoxic. They have evolved beyond that one too).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>However the extreme anti-amalgam POV people consider the fish advisory proves that mercury is poisonous at that level, and that amalgam is a level superior to that so it must be even more toxic therefore banned. This misconception must be addressed. The misconception that disease is automatic when you go above the government standards and automatically safe when less than that standard is also a common illusion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>A medical research team at the University of Kentucky established a probable relationship of mercury exposure from silver amalgam dental fillings to Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This needs a reliable reference.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>OK</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Hair analysis for mercury is doubly untrustworthy because it sometimes fails to find mercury in the hair of individuals who have died of chronic mercury poisoning from fish or from chronic exposure in mines. There is no way to reliably test the presence of mercury in a human body part while it is alive. The only reliable tests are done after autopsy and, more ralely, an amputation.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>From a chemical standpoint, this seems wrong, but I cannot comment on it from a medical standpoint.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>People who died from 40 years of being fisherman and eating fish in Minamata, Japan(as recognized by Japan) sometimes have no mercury in their hair. This mirrors the study of Amy Holmes in Autism:talk that some individuals (autistics) do not excrete mercury thru hair at a normal rate(the most autistic had 19 times less mercury in hair than the age matched non-autistic control with the least mercury in hair).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<p>The current entry for "Amalgam" was informative, but had four limitations: (a) <i>accuracy:</i> in certain places it was factually inaccurate; (b) <i>language:</i> there remained some basic linguistic mistakes; (c) <i>incompleteness:</i> there were certain key areas of information which had not been included yet; (d) <i>links:</i> only two links were provided for what is a broad subject with many excellent website resources in existence.</p>
<p>As this is my area of specialist research, and I have a library of books, papers, articles, studies and clippings on it, and have been writing about it for years, and am one of the leading experts in this field in Ireland and Britain, I decided to try and and address these four issues all at once.</p>
<p>Although I gave a lot of thought to it, and spent many days putting together carefully re-edited or new paragraphs where appropriate, I found that all of my changes were immediately reverted. This reversion was made completely indiscriminately, since even my basic corrections of a few spelling and grammatical errors had been reversed to their previous linguistically inaccurate versions. This therefore leads me to conclude that the reversion took place more or less automatically, without any particular attention being given to the specific proposed changes and additions individually.</p>
<p>In other words, this is against the community spirit of Wikipedia. I still hope that we can work together to improve this "Amalgam" entry, and so I have two suggestions:</p>
<p>(i) I could reinstate the changes I proposed all at once, but this time one by one, in small degrees. In this way, each one could be considered in its own right, rather than multitudinous changes being reverted all at once indiscriminately;</p>
<p>and/or (ii) If the person who reverted the entry would like to enter discussion with me with regard not to my entire proposed changes as a whole, but with regard to individual aspects of the changes I proposed, then perhaps we can try to come to some compromises, and together work to improve this entry. Likewise, others could join in the discussion if they wish.</p>
<p>My intention would be that in both the discussion and in the entry itself there would be an academic attempt to come as far as possible to objective statements, rather than statements of opinion.</p>
<p>My logic is that this is very clearly a controversial topic (just see the history and discussion pages!) and, correspondingly, there exist two (or more) very different schools of thought on the matter. Since both of these camps have appeared before the U.S. House of Representatives (April 2002) to discuss the issue, as well as before courts of law in many protracted lawsuits, in neither case with any clear conclusion one way or the other yet, then in an objective knowledge base like an encyclopedia we, as a result, should do our best likewise to reflect both sides of the conflict, if we have any pretension to objectivity.</p>
<p>In other words, from a scientific perspective, the matter is not decided, since there is no conclusive proof of either safety or danger from amalgam which has been submitted either in scientific, legal or government circles. Correspondingly, it is our duty to report on both sides in an objective fashion, i.e. with phrases such as "Some dentists argue. . . while others claim. . . " or "Some studies have shown. . . while others have suggested. . . " or "Dental associations in some countries (e.g. x, y and z) maintain. . . while those in some countries (e.g. p, q and r) have stated. . .. " etc. Some paragraphs of the current entry do not currently report on both sides in this objective fashion, but instead reflect the opinions of one side only.</p>
<p>It is not that I wish any parts of the entry to be changed to an opposite opinion. I would much rather that opinions were left out (including my own, which I have already done my best to put aside for the sake of academic reporting), and that instead these opinions were given equal mention as two sides of what is an ongoing scientific, political and legal debate at large in dozens of countries, still without conclusive resolution.</p>
<p>P.S. I am Simon K - but my proposed changes appeared under "212.2.175.179". I don't know how this happened, unless my log-in session had accidentally expired, since I would have liked it to appear under my username "Simon K". Simon K 16:11, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was unable to look at these pages for a long time, but returning now to Wikipedia I am very pleased at the solution, which strikes me as an admirable one, to have created two pages. Thank you for finding this good resolution to the dilemma. The new ‘dental amalgam controversy’ page was a good idea, and it seems to me to be a good compromise/balance, describing both sides of this controversial topic in a fairly objective manner, combining contributions from different people.

<p>There is no controversy, there is discussion about the toxicity and the impact of such on the body. <a href="../../../p/s/i/User%7EPsilocin_939e.html" title="User:Psilocin">Psilocin</a> 23:42, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>One of the interesting things about amalgams is that they are plastic when made, but quickly harden. What's going on in terms of chemistry/physics? Seems like it would be a good addition to this article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Mercury apparently acts as a <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solvent.html" title="Solvent">solvent</a> for the other components of dental amalgams, by altering or breaking some bonds, and by rearranging or disrupting the crystalline and/or other structual forms that would exist in the components of the mixture. It seems likely that the components other than mercury harden as the mercury becomes isolated in pockets as the alteration of the structure of other components takes place, leaving distinct, isolated pockets of liquid and vaporized mercury, which subsequently leaks, in its elemental form, into the mouth due to wear and during removal. There seems to be little evidence that the resulting mixture contains any types of <a href="../../../a/l/l/Alloy.html" title="Alloy">alloys</a> incorporating mercury, which is why the term amalgam is used for these mixtures, in order to distinguish the blend from 'true' alloys wherein all the components are chemically bonded. Unless evidence is provided indicating that more than a fraction of any alloys that are produced by the solvent (or other chemical activity upon components of the amalgam mixture) actually incorporate mercury, then it can only be assumed that labeling dental amalgams (what the FDA calls a 'device') as 'alloys' is purely POV. While amalgams may or may not contain some alloys incorporating other components of the mixtures used, it needs to be resolved whether or not mercury is incorporated in these presumed 'alloys'. It is implied, by the general meaning of amalgam, that a heterogenous mixture remains after hardening, rather than what is generally implied by the term 'alloy'. If the term is to be used, then there needs to be clarification on this matter, or a pov tag is needed. <a href="../../../o/m/b/User%7EOmbudsman_aae9.html" title="User:Ombudsman">Ombudsman</a> 22:52, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
