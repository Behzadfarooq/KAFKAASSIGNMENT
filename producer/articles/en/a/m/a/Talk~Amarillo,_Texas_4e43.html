<dd>I don't consider him as a "native" of Amarillo. According to IMDB, he was born in Amarillo but raised in LA. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000384/bio" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000384/bio" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> If Danny Elfman is going to be on the list then I guess change the header "Notable natives" to "Notable people from Amarillo." --<a href="../../../j/2E/_/User%7EJ._Nguyen_e461.html" title="User:J.

<p>Granted I have limited knowledge of the city of Amarillo but I do vaguely remember seeing a flag hovering around the City Hall in Buchanan street. It was basically the city's seal on a white background. I might be wrong. Anyways, I'm tracking down a better version of the city seal which doesn't have a JPEG source and being not blurry. --<a href="../../../j/2E/_/User%7EJ._Nguyen_e461.html" title="User:J. Nguyen">J. Nguyen</a> 02:47, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I wondered the same thing. I only remember seeing a flag with the city seal as well. I was planning on taking a look next time I went there. I've searched the official <a href="http://www.ci.amarillo.tx.us" class="external text" title="http://www.ci.amarillo.tx.us" rel="nofollow">City of Amarillo</a> website to find out, but haven't been successful. <a href="../../../l/b/b/User%7ELbbzman_23b1.html" title="User:Lbbzman">Lbbzman</a> 19:23, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Did anyone ever find out the real story on the city flag? Is what's displayed the actual flag, or is the flag simply the city seal on a white background as I remembered? <a href="../../../l/b/b/User%7ELbbzman_23b1.html" title="User:Lbbzman">Lbbzman</a> 13:23, 6 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Argh, I was just too lazy to go to the city hall to finish the flag puzzle. I probably going to regret for saying this but I'm going early next week and I'm going to take a picture of it but will not recreate it if it is the blue one. --<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_What_Where_Nguyen_Why_874b.html" title="User:Who What Where Nguyen Why">Who What Where Nguyen Why</a> 13:50, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I finally went <i>inside</i> the city hall, today. I didn't see a flag display. The display cases were empty when I went in. Again, I confirmed that the flag along with the USA and Texas flags hovering outside of the city hall is just a plain white flag with the city seal. Still not confirmed if it is the city flag. I might in the future sadly attend a commission meeting on Tuesdays afternoons and maybe ask someone who works there. However, that is not a guaranteed. --<a href="../../../w/h/o/User%7EWho_What_Where_Nguyen_Why_874b.html" title="User:Who What Where Nguyen Why">Who What Where Nguyen Why</a> 22:33, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I just added the requested citation that mentions dairies moving into the Amarillo area. Unfortunately, the article is specifically about Hereford, which is west of Amarillo and is consistent with what the Amarillo WP article indicates. Also, since the reference is a Wall Street Journal article, a URL cannot be provided. A better, on-line accessible source, would be preferred, but this should suffice for now. <a href="../../../l/b/b/User%7ELbbzman_23b1.html" title="User:Lbbzman">Lbbzman</a> 03:09, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, it is okay. I was planning to take photos sometime this week when I have the time. About the dairies thing, I only got stories about Hereford too in the Amarillo Globe News' website which is why I put the {{fact}} template. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:rAfwh5nGgiQJ:www.amarillo.com/stories/123004/bus_915784.shtml+site:amarillo.com+Hereford+dairies&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2&amp;client=firefox-a" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:rAfwh5nGgiQJ:www.amarillo.com/stories/123004/bus_915784.shtml+site:amarillo.com+Hereford+dairies&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2&amp;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> I think it is best to live it with the Wall Street Journal as the reference if Wikipedia wants to keep this info consider they're more well known publication compare to a town's local newspaper.

<dd>I have taken photos of the City Hall. Amarillo's City Hall is just plain ugly so I'm changing plans on what photo should be in the "Law and government" section. Hopefully get a suitable photo for this section by the end of next week. Also, I can confirm that the flag floating around the city hall is just a white flag with a seal but still doesn't mean it is the city flag. <a href="http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us-tx-am.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us-tx-am.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> I have to go inside the city hall to figure it out.

<p>I can think of a couple of times in recent history when Amarillo has been featured in American national news:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Punks and Preps" case</li>
<li><a href="../../../o/p/r/Oprah_Winfrey_92a2.html" title="Oprah Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> trial - this is mentioned briefly in the "Amarillo featured in entertainment" section but not sure if it should be expanded</li>

<dd>I don't like the idea (I changed my mind easily) because it could stray away the focus on concentrating the city in general and could lead to redundacy such as Oprah. I don't consider Brian Deneke to be notable enough to mention in the article... Yes, the Tulia drug sting should stay in the Tulia, Texas article. I'm thinking about creating a "Culture" section similar to the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Seattle%2C_Washington_9194.html" title="Seattle, Washington">Seattle, Washington</a> article in a few days/weeks which will include the dire need for an "Arts" section and the subsections of it would be the "Media and entertainment"/"Sports teams." It would replace the "Sites of interest" section because of redundacy. Maybe, we could include the "headline news" section after "installing" the "Culture" section. Heck, it could be a sister section to section that I regret on creating, "Amarillo featured in entertainment." Also, on the to-do list I cancel the idea of a "Peoples" section. The "Culture" section would do the job just fine.--<a href="../../../j/2E/_/User%7EJ._Nguyen_e461.html" title="User:J. Nguyen">J. Nguyen</a> 02:44, 11 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>Another time when Amarillo was featured in American national news was during the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cullen_Davis_f718.html" title="Cullen Davis">Cullen Davis</a> murder trial in the late 1970s. This was a Ft. Worth-area murder case that involved a powerful millionaire, his ex-wife, and her daughter and boyfriend. The case was moved from Ft.

<p>Hi. I'm thinking about spinning off two sections into articles. The top candidates are "Amarillo featured in entertainment" and "Companies list". I will then move the "Notable natives..." to the "Culture" section. If there is no objection by a couple of days, then I will seperate them. Don't worry, the Amarillo article will still mention them just as a "See also" page. We need to condense the size and make it less "listy." Right now, it is 41 kilobytes. I think those references templates are causing the increase file size because the article doesn't look that huge.

<p>Don Vito Corleone has suggested in the to-do list that the reference list be scaled back to around 30 references. Could you please provide a MoS or other style guide supporting your position?

Anyways, the reason is why I came up with the conclusion is that in a couple of months I might nominate this article into feature article status after adding few more info (no more one sentence paragraphs) and cleaning up the prose. I was reading through past nominations such as the recently rejected <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_article_candidates_Michael_Jackson_b707.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Michael Jackson">Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Michael Jackson</a> the objection voters were complaining that the authors putted way too much in-line citations for information that can be easily verified. Sadly, we have to appease the voters if we wanted to be in the FA. --Don Vito Corleone 18:54, 26 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I just took a look at the FAC link for the Michael Jackson article. It looks to me like the argument there was against excessive <i>in-line</i> citations, and there was an urging of using footnotes instead. Since all of the references on the Amarillo article are footnotes, I wonder if we should leave it as is and take our chances on a FAC nomination. I know you (and others) have put a lot of work into finding the references as they stand now, and I'd hate to remove those unless absolutely necessary. But I could be wrong.

<dd>Okay will leave all of the current references intact. We could always wait if more than 3 FA voters demand them to trim down. That is of course if we nominate this article before this decade ends or something. --Don Vito Corleone 03:25, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>Hi xxxxxxx, All the information we have on the Amarillo flag is from 2000 or earlier, so it is quite possible it has changed its flag. This does happen a lot in US municipal flags!

<p>Amarillo's history, art, and culture is expressed, in part through the locations listed on the National Register of Historic Places. By relegating these places to a single link under "See also", readers miss out on a significant part of what makes Amarillo unique. More importantly, most of these places lack articles, and moving these red-links out of sight also lowers their profile and thereby lowers the probability that an editor will discover these links and create worthy articles. In my view, removing these links from the article was a mistake. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 23:29, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Howdy. I shall reply and gave you my reasons for downplaying the National Register of Historic Places. You brought an interesting points such as encourage visitors to create new articles about certain Amarillo's historical buildings which Wikipedia needs. However, I have a bias against putting a list within an "encyclopedia" city article. There was a very vague paragraph about the National Register of Historic Places in this article, so I guess we could compromise by mentioning <i>some</i> of the historical landmarks. Most of the historical buildings in that list are in downtown Amarillo. I just don't like putting repeating info that also can be found in a separate Wikipedia page. --<a href="../../../j/2E/_/User%7EJ._Nguyen_e461.html" title="User:J. Nguyen">J.

However, the correct format should be <i>lastname</i>, <i>firstname</i>, instead of <i>firstname</i>, <i>lastname</i>, for the author citations. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeatonjr_6ccc.html" title="User:Deatonjr">Deatonjr</a> 02:24, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
