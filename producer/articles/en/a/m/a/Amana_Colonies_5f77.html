<p><b>The Amana Colonies</b> are a group of settlements of German <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pietists.html" title="Pietists">Pietists</a> in <a href="../../../i/o/w/Iowa.html" title="Iowa">Iowa</a> comprising seven villages. Calling themselves the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Inspirationalists.html" title="Inspirationalists">Ebenezer Society</a> or the Community of True Inspiration, <i>die Gemeinde der wahren Inspiration</i>, they first settled in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_state_542e.html" title="New York state">New York state</a> near <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo%2C_New_York_0d75.html" title="Buffalo, New York">Buffalo</a> in what is now the Town of <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Seneca%2C_New_York_a4de.html" title="West Seneca, New York">West Seneca</a>. However, in order to live out their beliefs in more isolated surroundings they moved west to the rich soil of east-central Iowa (near present-day <a href="../../../i/o/w/Iowa_City%2C_IA_a91c.html" title="Iowa City, IA">Iowa City</a>) in 1855. They lived a <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commune_%28intentional_community%29.html" title="Commune (intentional community)">communal life</a> until the mid 1930s.</p>
<p>Today, Amana is a major tourist attraction known mainly for its restaurants and craft shops. Included in the shops are woodworking shops, wine shops, and even a brewery called <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millstream_Brewing_6d28.html" title="Millstream Brewing">Millstream</a>.

<p>By 1840 there were nearly 1000 members of the Community of True Inspiration, many living on the estates in <a href="../../../h/e/s/Hesse.html" title="Hesse">Hesse</a>. This growth took place in spite of persecution from German officials. The government, closely tied to the Lutheran church, viewed the Community's <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a> as a political threat. Even in <a href="../../../h/e/s/Hesse.html" title="Hesse">Hesse</a>, Inspirationists were fined for their refusal to send children to state schools. Rising costs and rents and several years of drought aggravated the conditions on the estates. Metz and other leaders realized that they must seek a new home for the Community in <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_of_America_8a5e.html" title="United States of America">America</a>.</p>
<p>In September of 1842 a committee led by Christian Metz traveled to America in search of land on which to relocate the Community of True Inspiration. They purchased a 5,000 acre (20 km²) site in western <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, near <a href="../../../b/u/f/Buffalo%2C_New_York_0d75.html" title="Buffalo, New York">Buffalo</a>, and by the end of 1843 nearly 350 Inspirationists had immigrated to the new settlement, which they named "Ebenezer," meaning "hitherto hath the Lord helped us."</p>
<p>From the start, in order to facilitate all members of the community to come to America and live together, all property in Ebenezer was held in common. The initial plan was that after some time the land would be divided among the people according to their contribution of money and labor. However, leaders saw that the disparity in wealth, skills and age would make it difficult for all to purchase a portion of land--the community would fall apart as a result. Therefore in 1846 a constitution was adopted which established a permanent communal system. Any debate on this was resolved when Metz spoke a divine pronouncement endorsing the communal system after he had visited a similar communal society in Ohio.</p>
<p>Ebenezer flourished. By 1854 the population reached 1,200 people. Six villages were established, each with mills, shops, homes, communal kitchens, schools and churches. To accommodate this growth, additional land had been purchased, but more was needed. However, the booming growth of nearby Buffalo put land prices at a premium. Furthermore, the community leaders perceived a threat from the economic development around them. It was felt that capitalist and worldly influences were bringing about a growing interest in <a href="../../../m/a/t/Materialism.html" title="Materialism">materialism</a> and threatened the spiritual focus of the Inspirationist community. The leadership decided it was time to move the community again--this time to the unsettled west.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amana_Colonies_5f77.html" title="Edit section: Amana Colonies today">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Amana Colonies today</span></h3>
<p>At the turn of the 21st century, the Community of True Inspiration is approaching its 300th year of existence although the Amana of today differs from that of a century before. By the 1930s, the communal system in Amana had generated stresses which it chose not resolve. Many community members found the rules associated with communal living to be petty and overly restrictive. Regulations governed most aspects of daily life including dining, dress and leisure activities. Many young people wanted to be free to play baseball, to own musical instruments or to bob their hair in the new style. Families wanted to eat together at home rather than in the communal kitchen dining rooms. Although members received an annual spending allowance, many people felt theirs was inadequate and were frustrated by their inability to enjoy more material goods. Increasingly the elders were unable to enforce the rules.</p>
<p>In 1931, the community found itself in a crisis. In addition to the social strains of communal living, the community had suffered several economic setbacks in the previous decade. The Amana Society had lost an important source of revenue when its calico print works closed after <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_I_9429.html" title="World War I">World War I</a>. A fire in 1923 extensively damaged the woolen mill and completely destroyed the Amana flour mill. And the national economic depression had shrunk the market for the Society's agricultural products.</p>
<p>The Elders presented the membership of the community with a choice: either they could return to a more austere and disciplined life or they could abandon the communal system. However, the results of the votes were not conclsive On June 1st, 1932, the members elected to retain the traditional church as it was, and to create a <a href="../../../j/o/i/Joint-stock_company.html" title="Joint-stock company">joint-stock company</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amana_Society_46ba.html" title="Amana Society">Amana Society</a>, Inc.) for the business enterprises to be operated for profit by a Board of Directors. This separation of the church from the economic functions of the community--the abandonment of communalism--is referred to by Amana residents still today as "the Great Change."</p>
<p>Today, the Amana Society, Inc., corporate heir to the land and economic assets of communal Amana, continues to own and manage some 26,000 acres (105 km²) of farm, pasture and forest land. Agriculture remains an important economic base today just as it was in communal times. Because the land was not divided up with the end of communalism the landscape of Amana still reflects its communal heritage. In addition, over 450 communal-era buildings stand in the seven villages--vivid reminders of the past.</p>
<p>The most widely known business that emerged from the Amana Society is <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amana_Refrigeration_707b.html" title="Amana Refrigeration">Amana Refrigeration</a>, Inc. This national leader in the production of <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refrigerators.html" title="Refrigerators">refrigerators</a> was founded by an Amana native, George C. Foerstner at the time of the Great Change. The first beverage cooler, designed for a <a href="../../../b/u/s/Businessman.html" title="Businessman">businessman</a> in nearby <a href="../../../i/o/w/Iowa_City_c43d.html" title="Iowa City">Iowa City</a> in 1934, was built by skilled craftsmen at the Middle Amana woolen mill. In the decades that followed, the mill became the site of this large, now private, plant producing <a href="../../../r/e/f/Refrigerators.html" title="Refrigerators">refrigerators</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freezers.html" title="Freezers">freezers</a>, <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_conditioners.html" title="Air conditioners">air conditioners</a>, and in 1965 introduced a new product--the Amana Radarange <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microwave_oven.html" title="Microwave oven">Microwave Oven</a>. Today, the 19th-century woolen mill smoke stack still rises over the modern plant.</p>
<p>The Amana Church continues to be a vital part of the Amana community. A visitor to <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amana%2C_Iowa_1013.html" title="Amana, Iowa">Amana</a> today would do well to visit an Inspirationist cemetery. Surrounded by pine trees to symbolize eternal life, the cemeteries continue to express the Inspirationist ethos of <a href="../../../e/g/a/Egalitarianism.html" title="Egalitarianism">equality</a>, humility and simplicity. As they have been for over 140 years, members are buried in order of death with plain, uniform <a href="../../../h/e/a/Headstone.html" title="Headstone">headstones</a>. Like the cemeteries, the Amana churches are much as they were when built 125 years ago. The building exteriors are unpretentious; no steeple or colored-glass windows declare that the edifice is a house of God. Inside, the unfinished wood floors, plain pine benches and unadorned walls echo the tradition of <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humility.html" title="Humility">humility</a> and <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piety.html" title="Piety">piety</a>. Men still enter and sit on one side of a central aisle; women on the other. Worshippers come early for quiet contemplation. <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English language</a> services were introduced in 1960, but in both <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_language.html" title="German language">German</a> and English services the order of worship has changed little over the years: a reading from <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scripture.html" title="Scripture">Scripture</a>; a reading from a testimony from Rock, Metz or Landmann; <a href="../../../h/y/m/Hymns.html" title="Hymns">hymns</a> that would be recognized by a congregation of a century earlier.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heritage_tourism.html" title="Heritage tourism">heritage tourism</a> has become important to the economy of the Amana area. Historic preservation efforts by several local nonprofit organizations, as well as the Amana Society, Inc. in conjunction with land-use and historic preservation ordinances attempt to preserve the natural and built environment of Amana.</p>
<p>There is also a collection of sites some 13 miles south. However, it has nothing to do with the Amana Colonies and is merely a stopping point for interstate traverlers.</p>
