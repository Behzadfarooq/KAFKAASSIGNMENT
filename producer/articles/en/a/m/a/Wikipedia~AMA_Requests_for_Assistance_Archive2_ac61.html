<p>I realize this is probably one of the most controversial topics on Wikipedia. Unfortunately a new dispute has arisen, and I think a resolution process aught to be initiated. Please examine the article and related Talk page. We have attempted to reach consensus but, while some compromise was reached, there remains an outstanding disagreement. My inclusion of a caricature keeps getting deleted. I beleive the Talk pages fully explains the dispute, so there is no need to reproduce it here.

I rved back and then he deleted my entry and instead introduced <i>Evolutionary Science</i> without comment. I then rved again this time using the talk page to explain to <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanedidona_a695.html" title="User:Shanedidona">shanedidona</a> first that a revert should be commented and to argue that <i>Evolutionary Science</i> is neither a real terrm or oxymoron for that matter. After that he did not revert but introduced <i>Evolutionary Science</i> again in the page this time using the talk page to offer me a compromise deal that if both terms are in the list he will be ok with it. I have answer no to this as this is a project to disseminate factual information and as such <i>Evolutionary Science</i> can not be considered a oxynoron.

<p>(Please note the above statement was made by Mr. Tyler, without my knowledge or permission, it has nothing to do with me.) <b>Request for advocate by UserWikiUser</b>. I request a reasonable person to help me against abuse by several people but in particular a user called ChrisO, who has hounded me against all wikipedia rules for most of the time since I registered 7 months ago - to the point where I have felt suicidal. He is abusing me now in a sort of frenzy and says he will shortly "ban" me "long term" as I have filed a Mediation request against a user, and BEFORE I have had time to file a Mediation appeal re him. (I warned him recently that if he did one more attack I would file for Mediation re him. Now hence his upping the level of his attacks.)</p>
<p>When I filed for Mediation, among other abuses of the rules he said: "<b>You also have no right to abuse Wikipedia dispute resolution procedures for your own ends, as in your frivolous arbitration request last August and the equally frivolous mediation request you've made this week</b>.". This is untrue, I do have the same right to file a Mediation appeal that anyone else does.</p>
<p>And is breaking the Mediation procedure by flaming me beneath my appeal on the Mediation page with lies about me, which is against the wiki rules. He is as clearly determined to stop me having a Mediation appeal re him and the other person I've asked to stop abusing me, as he is to ban me simply for editing. I don't know why he has this incredibly extreme obsession against me, but I SEEK ASSISTANCE with preventing him from using the wikipedia to harrass me and stopping my normal use of it, to the detriment of my health.<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikiUser_82f9.html" title="User:WikiUser">WikiUser</a> 16:07, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there, I reverted an edit to <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Crippen_3617.html" title="Dan Crippen">Dan Crippen</a> made by the above anon user. He reverted it back and in his summary line justifying his revert he called me a "known vandal." My problem with the information he added was that it was utter speculation about Crippen's name being circulated as a replacement for the current outgoing NASA administrator <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_O%27Keefe_1f0e.html" title="Sean O'Keefe">Sean O'Keefe</a>. Not only should an encyclopedia not be a repository for rumors, he credited it to a Website called NASAWatch which was odd, since it's essentially a fannish blogsite (he also added an external link to NASAWatch, which smacks as possibly someone involved with the site looking for some free advertising). Anyway, I posted a message on the IP's usertalk page asking him to reconsider his revert, but given the rude and inaccurate way he tagged me as a "known vandal" in the edit summary I am not anticipating an easy resolution. <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0">Katefan0</a> 16:20, Feb 17, 2005 (UTC)</p>

Reversion was mainly done to keep users within this subgroup from listing themselves in a list of renowned graffiti artists from other primary sources, which are cited at the end of the article.

<p>I am not a partisan in favor of the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alticor.html" title="Alticor">Alticor</a> complex (I am a former distributor, a very long time ago for a very short time.), but there seems to be an edit war going on over the <a href="../../../q/u/i/Quixtar.html" title="Quixtar">Quixtar</a> article. Perhaps someone more knowledgable than I could take a look and perhaps see if the person who keeps changing Quixtar to Quickscam and <a href="../../../a/m/w/Amway.html" title="Amway">Amway</a> to Scamway can be persuaded to move the dispute to discussion; if it keeps up, perhaps editing could be frozen to allow heated passions to cool.</p>

<p>I have a problem with <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding_Boy</a> in that he is hell bent on pursuing action against me at the highest level, RfC to Ac and then back to AC while refusing mediation. Now simply put I believe that EB has a specific agenda here in that he wants to force his POV on the articles of his choice. Currently JakeW and myself appear to frustrate his aims and as such he intends to attempt to neutralise us. There is currently an AC matter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Robert_the_Bruce" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Robert_the_Bruce" rel="nofollow">open</a> which is a shocker.

<p>I'm not sure how to proceed. I'm new to Wikipedia and I'm working hard to read and understand the overall vision, style and intent. But I have come up with a problem. In the "Deaf" article, there were things written there that were terribly inflammatory, patently false, blatently prejudiced and downright sinister and they were represented as the point of view of culturally deaf people. Of dispute right now is "Views of Treatment" to which I contributed a major re-write.</p>
<p>You should understand that I'm a deaf person who takes a cultural view of deafness. Almost all of the article is terribly offensive to deaf people who share my view, yet the people who originally created the content did decide to address the view of the culturally deaf. The problem is they seemed to have fabricated or fantasized as to what the view of culturally deaf people actually was. Fine. I've posted extensively updates but there is this one section that another contributor posted a NPOV notice on.</p>
<p>I have no problem whatsoever in resolving it, but all I get is utter, profound silence. I posted an offer on the article's talk page to the effect that I was willing to collaberate on creating a page that was a fair representation of the two views, but no one has responded to my suggestion or even expressed any further interest in the page. I told people what I was willing to do, but since I didn't want to wait forever to get feedback I also included a deadline for responding to my offer. I said that if no one responded saying they would like to resolve the issue, I would assume my work was satisfactory and remove the NPOV notice.</p>
<p>But then I realized that maybe I wasn't supposed to set the rules on removing the NPOV notice. That's why I'm seeking input now. What does one do when no one responds to an appeal to resolve the problem? My intention is to completely rewrite the entire article and give it a true neutrality rather than having an article in which I have to represent the culturally point of view as a reaction to negative assertions the orginal authors believed to be benign and acceptable assumptions that could be embraced by anyone without offense. I'd be happy to discuss this via email. Thank you.</p>

<dd>I know that your situation is very hard and uncomfortable to you and wanted to advice you. As you're new to Wikipedia, surely you don't know anything about our <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution</a> system. We've got four 'resorts' (I like to talk about 'stages') in this system:
<ol>
<li>Informal discussion (called negotiation or conciliation): discuss this with the other users and try to get consensus.</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">Request for Comment</a>: You list the page into the Request for Comment page and other users (voluntarily) get into the discussion and try to help.</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/f/m/WP%7ERfM_d120.html" title="WP:RfM">Request for Mediation</a>: This consists in a mediated discussion between both parties. The mediator (a member of the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_eaa9.html#Mediators" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">Mediation Comitee</a>) will only mediate, he/she won't judge.</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/f/a/WP%7ERfAr_c2e7.html" title="WP:RfAr">Request for Arbitration</a>: This should only used for extremely complex cases where anything above has failed. Here, the whole <a href="../../../a/c/_/WP%7EAC_3d3c.html" title="WP:AC">Arbitration Comitee</a> will take a decision about the topic.</li>
</ol>

<dd>I think that is a good issue to consider when deciding if advocacy work is appropriate when people list their disputes here. We can help people who have problems understanding the dispute resolution process or who need someone who can help them articulate their position when dealing with other members who may have more experience; so it is important to make sure that within some request for acting as some kind of mediator there is not also a request just to help the individual with understanding the process or what they are trying to acheive, that, IMHO, is within the balliwick of advocacy here. Remember someone is reaching out to our association because they can't figure out how to do it themselves, so even a little informal communication may be very helpful to them without some declaration of full "advocacy" status on their behalf.
