<p>It's a nonspecific word, that's true. But there's a controvery on wether or not it's the longest - Nile is longer traditionally, but it's a close call and small inaccuracy adds up. Likewise for other measurements: Volume, area, rate of flow. We do have to find something else to put here.</p>

<p>I've just moved a lot of stuff around, re-written a lot of stuff, revised things from 1911 that are way out of date and generally, hopefully, improved this article a lot. Still pretty patchy, though, there's loads about Dom Pedro opening up trade in the 1850s and hardly anything about wildlife. But I thought it was improved enough to take the notice off about needing attention.

<p>The opening para used to say it was called the River Amazon in UK English. While we say 'River xxx' for all our own rivers and some foreign ones (eg River Nile) I've never heard anyone call it the River Amazon, so I removed that bit. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 00:13, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You have watched too many American programmes on TV. In English, the word "river" always goes first. The other word order ("Colorado River", etc) is acceptable only in where it is the locally used name (i.e. in the US and Australia). <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon"><i>Chameleon</i></a> 12:19, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Are you British? Have you ever heard anyone British say 'River Zambezi', 'River Mekong', 'River Yangtze'? I doubt it - we don't ever refer to those rivers like that, and nor does anyone call it the 'River Amazon'.<a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 22:36, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, from London. Of course I have heard or read those and others (the Seine, the Rhône...) with "river" first. I have also heard Brits ape the Americans by putting it after. The tendency to forget the normal order increases with the distance away from the UK (and therefore the likelihood that the person has got to know it from watching some US documentary). Give it a few decades and I'm sure we'll be drinking out of "aluminum" cans beside the "Thames river" and watching films in "theaters", but not quite yet. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChameleon_a79b.html" title="User:Chameleon"><i>Chameleon</i></a> 22:58, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good, me too. I'm not the kind of person to let americanisms encroach on the language we speak on this island, and I am certainly not 'forgetting the normal order' or aping anyone, I've simply <i>never</i> heard any British person refer to the Amazon as the River Amazon. It sounds as weird to me as 'Thames River' does. Most common usage would probably be calling it simply 'the Amazon'. My most recent change to the opening para reflects that, hope that's acceptable to all.</dd>

<dd>I would definitely refer to the River Zambezi and the River Yangtze that way. Likewise the River Amazon. The "Amazon River" sounds like it should be some minor river in Connecticut. 82.36.26.229 18:10, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>82.36.26.229, I kind of took that the wrong way. I know all of you are from England, but we should just keep it in the middle, like requested earlier, "The Amazon". I'm just not used to calling any river with it's name second. It looks weird to me.<a href="../../../n/y/r/User%7ENyrockzss_be8a.html" title="User:Nyrockzss">nyrockz</a> 22:23, 5 February 2006 (UTC)nyrockzss</p>

<dd>I am in the UK and River Amazon sounds perfectly correct to me. I'd probably usually refer to it simply as the Amazon, but if I had to include the word river I would place it before the name. In British English this is the usual construction, eg River Avon, River Severn, River Trent never Avon River, Severn River or Trent River. They would sound unacceptably unnatural. River Zambesi would be perfectly acceptable to me. However there are exceptions, such as Orange River and Great Fish River, never River Orange or River Great Fish. I think this has something to do with the rivers being named for a person or persons (Eg the House of Orange), or including an adjective. Being much more ancient, the meanings of the names of British rivers are usually long obscured to most people while foreign names like Mekong or Zambesi are similarly opaque. So we have the River Zambesi, River Rhine, River Seine etc.</dd>

<p>Imagine we were naming rivers. If we had one to name after Smith we would no doubt call it the Smith River, not the River Smith. If we named a river after its depth we'd call it the Deep River, not the River Deep. Only if the name was simply a name whose meaning we did not know would we place "River" first - if there was a river called "Nozama" we'd call it the River Nozama.

<p>I'm not much of one to contribute since i'm not good at this type of writing, but it might be interesting to point out the annual wave that travels down the amazon and its ability to be the potential "endless wave." Cool tie in to surfing i think.</p>

<p>I thought that most of the rain that falls in the Amazon Basin is generated through evapotranspiration <i>within</i> the basin. Also - the idea that moisture moves inward from the Atlantic, across a whole continent, before being forced to rise by the Andes seems rather unusual to me. Can anyone source this information? <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 14:00, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Amazon basin is definitely in the Trade Wind zone and these blow monotonously to the west, except of course during El Ninos. The tropical Atlantic generates a tremendous amount of moisture and the trades blow this across the Amazon Basin to the Andes. I don't have a reference for this. The ITCZ is well known. Yes I guesss half of the moisture is recycled, but still precipitation greatly exceeds evaporation. Hence the unparalleled volume of water in the Amazon <a href="../../../z/y/z/User%7EZyzzy_98ca.html" title="User:Zyzzy">User:Zyzzy</a></p>

<p>In the second para the flow rate is given as '184,000 metres cubed during the rainy season'. However, the table on the right gives it as closer to 220,000. Which is correct? Surely the figure in the table, as the average flow rate all year round, should be lower than the figure in the text?</p>
<p>I'm no expert, but I found this from one website.</p>
<p>"Flow rate is an important measurement when examining a river’s size. The average flow rate of the Amazon River is about 200,000 cu m/second (7,100,000 cfs). However, during flood levels the discharge of the Amazon increases to nearly 300,000 cu m/second (10,000,000 cfs). For comparison, the average flow rate of the Mississippi River is 16,800 cu m/second (593,000 cfs), and its flood discharge at St. Louis, Missouri, during the floods in the summer of 1993 was 30,000 cu m/second (1,000,000 cfs)."</p>
<p>Could this be more accurate? Interestingly, I did find a page that gave the flow rate as "184,000 cubic meters (6.5 million cubic feet) per second in the rainy season" (direct quote) which seems to suggest the person who wrote this page got the info from that site. However I would like to respectfully point out that the name of the website <a href="http://www.junglephotos.com/amazon/students/homework/amazonfacts.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.junglephotos.com/amazon/students/homework/amazonfacts.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.junglephotos.com/amazon/students/homework/amazonfacts.shtml</a> does sort of suggest it was never meant for serious study.</p>
<p>Some update:</p>
<p>Actually both figures are correct but the measurements are taken at different locations. 219,000 is the average at the mouth while 184,000 is rainiy season value for around 960 km (?) upriver. Sources:</p>

<p>In the main box of information the length is stated as 6296 Km, whereas the section the Longest rivers in the Amazon system the length is stated as 6762 Km. If the second of these is correct then the river becomes the longest in the world as the Nile is stated as being 6695 Km. If someone can find a reliable source to find which is correct, that would be nice</p>
<p>Actually older lexigraphic information gives about 6518km for the length, i think the whole thing is mainly due to the debate about the real source. My suspicion is that 6296 km is definitely wrong and the correct answer somewhere above 6500 km. It would be nice if someone could research the official data from some cartographic institute or some brazilian government statistics. Additional note: Encarta and Encyclopedia Britannica both list the length as &gt;6400km</p>

<p>Unfortunately the national geographic article is not really helpful at all. While confirming the apurimac as source river, which seems to common consensus now (?), it gives a length that is shorter than the other figures and thus contradicting its own information (source = spring farthest away from the mouth). My guess would be a factual error by the article concerning the length data. Also the article still fearures different/contradicting length information at different locations. It might be helpful to use the same throughout the article and maybe have a note/comment on the different length data on the amazon in general.</p>

Using <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Earth_e2fe.html" title="Google Earth">Google Earth</a>, I have attempted to measure the Amazon from its source at Nevado Mismi to its mouth on the Atlantic shores in 25 km segments. This way I have worked out the <b>total length</b> of the Amazon River as being <b>6,386.8 km</b> (3,968.6 mi).</p>
<p>I measured each 25 km segment in partial segments of 40 m (Google Earth elevation: 7,292 ft), and have specifications of latitude and longitude for each 25 km-stopover noted down below.</p>
<p>I ask all the Wikipedians to check the different segments and note down below where their length differs from my measurements. When you write down differing length, you might do it this way: "Segment 175-200 = 25.322 km" (= Distance from Point 175 to 200) and note it down at the bottom of each river's name.</p>

<p>The Amazon River is located in North Eastern Brazil.</p>
<p>The Amazon River is in South America in Brazil. It is about 6280km long or 3920 miles long. It may not be the longest, but it is the widest. The Amazon covers close to 2.2 million square miles or 6,100,000km2. The Amazon is the largest river in the world! It is 30x the length of Britain. The Amazon River Basin is roughly the size of the forty-eight contiguous United States (the United States not including Alaska and Hawaii)</p>
<p>Amazon River has a temperature, of about 26°C (78°F).</p>
<p>When the Amazon River floods most trees around the river have their roots under water. When its further bank is out of sight it looks like an inland sea.</p>
<p>The annual outflow of freshwater is approximately 20% (one-fifth of the ocean). The Amazon's daily freshwater discharge into the Atlantic Ocean is enough to supply New York City's freshwater needs for nine years. More water flows into the ocean from the Amazon River than the combined output of the Mississippi, the Nile, and the Yangtze rivers. It is estimated that the Amazon discharges between 34 million and 121 million litres (9 million and 32 million gallons) of water per second and deposits a daily average of 3 million tons of sediment near its mouth.</p>
<p>The Amazon has been described, as the “greatest river in the world”, but in the future it could be littered, fish dead, a bit like this river</p>

<p>I am changing this article to describe the Amazon as the second longest in the world. I readily acknowledge that, for some, this is a controversial issue.

I will gladly discuss the issue, but I think that this is actually a matter of Wikipedian credibility, as I believe I make clear in my comments. <a href="../../../u/n/s/User%7EUnschool_e4b4.html" title="User:Unschool">Unschool</a> 16:57, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>THE LONGEST RIVER IN THE WORLD IS AMAZON RIVER, please check this article.

<p>It's always a positive thing when a discussion is relating to a wide variety of scientific findings. In this case, however, the above mentioned article of the Jacek Palkiewicz expedition does change very little in the discussion of the length of the Amazon River. The source found at Quehuisha Nevado by Jacek Palkiewitz (15°31'05" S, 71°45'55" W) is only 7 km west from the source at Nevado Mismi (15°30'36.95" S 71°41'58.92" W) as even the maps presented by Palkiewitz show. This means that right now there is only a discussion which is the source proper, but no news concerning the length of the Amazon. - What has to be changed though is that neither of these sources is the source of the Apurimac but of one of the Apurimac tributaries. Accordingly I will alter the above detailed findings of the "Lenth of the Amazon River" within the next days. -- <a href="../../../m/e/i/User%7EMeister_c732.html" title="User:Meister">Meister</a> 13:58, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Someone has methodically done his or her best to make it seem that the controversy has been resolved and that the Nile is the longer river, although upon finding the begnning of the Amazon it was defiend that the Amazon was one continious river while the Nile was instead a sum of smaller rivers... Maybe I'm wrong to think such a conclusion came... But I'm not wrogn to expect that if the statement does not favours the Amazon it shall be neutral and mention the dispute... Instead of being final about someone's beliefs. -- 200.121.134.140, 27 September 2006</p>

<p>I tried to help by simplifying grammatically. I'm not sure what the paragraph about the cloud cover was trying to get across- after parsing (read the edit I did, and you can see) the meaning of it seemed to be that the photographs referred to were taken in a manner that did not prove the assertion they were tacked on to- that there are no clouds, like in the picture, but that the picture was taken in the morning, when there are nevewr any clouds anyway?

<p>I've updated the beginning of the article concerning the length of the Amazon. Though I'm not saying my wording is perfect I strongly believe the controversy concerning its length should be mentionted. BTW, why do the Spanish and Portuguese version of Wikipedia each state Amazon is the longest river in the world, though they don't agree on the figure? I read a lot of discussions here on Wikipedia and they all quote just English sources. Isn't the Amazon a Latin American river? Shouldn't the Latin American sources be taken into account preferably? --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroig_52e9.html" title="User:Caroig">Caroig</a> 21:48, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That the local source say that the Amazon is the longest is not only irrelevant, it may even be suspect (due to local bias). I don't care if the source is South American, North American, European, or <i>Martian</i>, as long as its <b>scientific</b>. But even one single source is not enough in this case. I'm going to revert this because <b>the widespread, world-wide consensus is still that the Nile is longest</b>. You've given us no citations, but there are literally <i>hundreds</i> of citations that could be brought to bear on this opening that would refute your contention. I personally don't <i>care</i> which is the longest. But I do care that Wikipedia is not used for one person's grandstanding of their own pet issue. This issue has been discussed at extreme length both here and on the Nile pages. this issue may not be settled once and for all, but it's <i>not</i> going to be overturned by <b>one person</b> who thinks he knows better than the majority of the world's geographers. 216.199.161.66 22:09, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Have you read what I wrote? Neither I care which river is the longest. But I do care that Wikipedia is a reliable source and that gives a reader the most updated information and if there exists a controversy, it informs them so. Though using the world controversy seems to be an euphepism. And writing <i>according to most sources</i> is a lie. Because the correct statement is according to most online accessible English sources such as Britannica, Encarta, etc. the length of Amazon is some 6,400km. These are your citations. But these are not <i>scientific</i> proofs. I've read all the discussions very carefully and there are links, e.g. to a an expedition led by a Polish scientist, whose findings were approved by the <a href="http://www.palkiewicz.com/ekspedycje/index.php?p=zrodl_amaz5" class="external text" title="http://www.palkiewicz.com/ekspedycje/index.php?p=zrodl_amaz5" rel="nofollow">Lima's Geographic Society</a> (not a scientific body?). <b>Why can't there be a simple text stating, that according to various sources the length of the Amazon varies between 6,400 km and 7,062 km?</b> Full stop. I've spent a long time in Latin Amrica and as a matter of curiosity I was checking their atlases, textbooks etc. and as I remember, they were all quoting the length to be around 7,000 km. I'll try to get exact book quoatations with ISBNs. I simply don't like the fact English Wikipedia states the length of the Amazon is 6,400km, while Spanish Wikipedia quotes 7,020 km (seems to be the most common figure in Spanish media), Portuguese 6,868 km, German Wikipedia quotes various measurements of various sections of the river though not giving the overall length etc. So there definitely doesn't seem to be a world-wide consensus. There might be an North-American census, or rather a tradition. If you write about biased information, there rather seems to be a bias against any non-English source. Once again I simply suggest the core text state something like <b>there exist various measurements</b> and quoting the range. BTW, why don't you sign your edits (or sign them with an IP only)? --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroig_52e9.html" title="User:Caroig">Caroig</a> 08:34, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, first of all, while you quoted the LGS before, I don't believe you had a link to the info, correct? So that was only nominally better than a non-cited source. Secondly, the date on this information is 1996-99. The National Geographic Study's most recent finding on this is 2001 and—and this is where I get confused—indicates that the current source, Nevado Mismi, is even further upstream than the source that you quote, yet <i>still</i> the NGS says that the Amazon is the second longest. Okay, so the sources I'm quoting are English-language sources. Guess what, this is the <i>English</i> Wikipedia, most of us are going to be reading and citing English sources. That does not mean that other sources are not welcome. I would be happy to change this, <i><b>IF</b></i> you can bring to bear multiple sources from whatever languages that confirm the Amazon is longer than the Nile. I do not accept a sentence like, "Why can't there be a simple text stating, that according to various sources the length of the Amazon varies", because the length of the river does <i>not</i> vary. Something stating that sources disagree on its length is acceptable, but how high up in the article this belongs depends on how many and how authoritative those sources are. For example, if all you have to show that the Amazon is the longest is the LGS, then no, that's not enough to merit inclusion in the introduction. It only merits inclusion in the introduction if you can show, later in the article, that there exists no consensus. The information that I have indicates that the consensus is that the Nile is the longest. Show me differently, then we can begin to rewrite this article. Oh, and as to why I sign this way? It's a personal matter. Sorry, but I have no choice. 216.199.161.66 18:43, 29 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, of course the length doesn't vary, it's the sources which don't agree on its length. I'm not going to do any edits on this article until I can add a bit more sources (preferably from books on geography not from general compendia). The main point here is not what the longest river in the world is but what the length of this river is. The fact this is English Wikipedia (or rather an internatinal one?) doesn't mean it should rely on English sources only, especially not in an issue which concerns a scientific fact. The new source, Nevado Mismi, is really a bit more upstream than the previously identified one, but only by kilometers (or tens of kilometers), so it shouldn't change the figure very much. I can't help it but I believe the traditional English sources adhere to the 6,400 km length simply because of convenience, because it has been used for so long. Perhaps, when they try to update it, they found so many other figures, varying quite substantialy, that they rather keep the traditional length, nicely rounded to 4,000 mi. I see nothing bad in stating we are not sure. I might ask our friends from the Spanish Wikipedia (which quotes 7,020 km, they definitely didn't invent this number, it's the same one I've been familiar with for many years) if they could quote some sources (atlases etc.), and, if my language knowledge allows, from other language Wikipedias too. One more thing, I came upon this issue when I was updating the river infobox, using a new template I created and I was surprised to see this, in my view, real old figure when all sources I ever came upon (mainly Spanish, but also in other European languages). Anyway, I think the article would need some rewriting, because it is not well structured, contains out-of-date information etc. If time allows, I'll try to collect more sources (not only about the length) and start working on it. --<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECaroig_52e9.html" title="User:Caroig">Caroig</a> 07:46, 30 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've been following this rather intense discussion, and have already made many arguments about it in the past over on the <a href="../../../n/i/l/Talk%7ENile_aaf8.html#Longest_River_Dispute" title="Talk:Nile">Nile</a> page. May I make a few comments about some of the points here? And before I do, let me first of all extend my apologies. I'm a tad anal retentive, and it has rubbed me the wrong way every time I look at this discussion section and see the word "length" mispelled, so I've corrected it. Also, Caroig, I've taken the liberty of pushing your last comments over one tab space, to more clearly delineate your comments from your colleague's.
<ul>
<li>One thing, Caroig, that I felt hurt you initially is that, as I recall, on your first edit of this issue, you implied—no, you <i>stated</i> (I went back and looked)—that the previous writers were using "19th century" information. That was a bit of a broad swath to cut, and probably contributed to the level of vitriol in the response. Surely you don't really believe that the English speaking sources whose credibility you impugn are so irresponsible as to be relying on sources over 100 years old, especially about such a remote area as the Amazon basin?</li>
<li>I believe you also invited a harsh response, Caroig, when you wrote, "writing <i>according to most sources</i> is a lie." A <i>lie</i>? In Wikipedia, one of our key policies is to <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. In my world, if someone speaks a untruth, it is a lie only if the person speaking the untruth is aware of the non-truthfullness of their statement, and is making the statement for the purpose of misleading others into believing that untruth. Do you really believe that whoever wrote those earlier comments was <i>lying</i>? If not—and maybe even if yes—you would be wisest to avoid using that term in your discussions here, methinks.</li>
<li>I think that your assertion that English speaking sources are, essentially, allowing inertia to make their judgements for them in this matter is not altogether impossible. Many persons (I hope that I am not amongst them) do wish to hold onto to what they have been taught in the past and have difficulty integrating new information. <i>But acknowledging that this is possible is far from saying that it has happened, or even that it is likely.</i> After all, the scientific community, regardless of the language they speak, is rife with persons who live each day in hope of being the one who comes up with something "new". That is why the National Geographic Society made such a big deal about the discovery of Nevado Mismi. Why would they not also trumpet that this discovery made the Amazon the world's longest river? NGS has a long history—almost all from their first half-century of existence—of bringing the world up to speed on the newest geographical information. I'm sure it pains many of their leaders that there is so little left to "discover" today, and that they would have given their left arm to be able to "prove" that their new discovery also led to a new ordering of the world's rivers.</li>
<li>You say that the Spanish sources for many years have quoted the longer figure. Could they too not also be guilty of information inertia? After all, the most recent investigation in this matter has been done by an English-language organization.</li>
<li>Your comments about the article needing some reorganization are well taken. While this is by no stretch of the imagination the worst large article I've come across (most of it's organization is at least understandable), it can definitely use some work.</li>
<li>I don't think that this article exhibits a bias against non-English sources. I think it simply is a realistic reflection of the fact that most of its writers are English speakers, the majority of whom speak only English. I speak a bit of Spanish, and could probably handle any Spanish-language sources you would care to include, but what am I to do with something Polish or French or Japanese? How much can such a source mean anything to me? You could put a quote in from a Hungarian journal on bovine diseases, tell me that it discusses the length of the Amazon, and I wouldn't know the difference. I have to assume that Wikipedia has policies in place for handling these sorts of things, but I am unaware of them.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Okay, so that's my two cents worth. For now, I must say, I think that, until Caroig or someone else documents appropriately, I recommend leaving the language in the article as it stands currently. <a href="../../../u/n/s/User%7EUnschool_e4b4.html" title="User:Unschool">Unschool</a> 20:47, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>This was recently added: "but that has some dissagreements.the Amazon river is anywhere between 6,259km/3,903mi and 6,712km/4,195mi long. The exact length of the two rivers varies over time and reputable sources disagree as to their actual length. The Nile River in Africa is reported to be anywhere from at 5,499km/3,437mi to 6,690km/4,180mi long. But there is no question as to which of the two great rivers carries the greater volume of water"</p>
