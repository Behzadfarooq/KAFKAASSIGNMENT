<p>I made a few POV to NPOV changes. Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Somebody changed Catholic "<a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogma.html" title="Dogma">dogma</a>" to "<a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a>". I changed it back to dogma. Marcotte's criticism wasn't a challenge to Catholic theology - she appears to have been angered by some aspects of Catholic law or rules - aka dogma.</li>
<li>I changed <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reproduction.html" title="Reproduction">reproduction</a> back to <a href="../../../r/e/p/Reproductive_rights.html" title="Reproductive rights">reproductive rights</a>. I don't think Marcotte was challenging the biological laws of nature behind reproduction. She was clearly concerned with reproductive rights - i.e. access to birth control, abortion, etc.</li>
<li>Her views are "allegedly" anti-Catholic, not "radically" anti-Catholic. Teh use of "Radically" under any circumstance here is POV and inappropriate. I would imagine that if one of us were to speak with Marcotte, she wouldn't consider her views to be anti-Catholic at all - in fact she may even be Catholic herself. The KKK holds "Radically" anti-Catholic views. Marcotte did not express any such views.</li>

<dd>If the article means to refer specifically to birth control or reproductive rights, then "dogma" is <i>definitely</i> the wrong word. The Catholic Church has not <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogmatically_defined.html" title="Dogmatically defined">dogmatically defined</a> any teachings on birth control. Of course there are teachings about birth control which Catholics are supposed to adhere to, but they simply aren't dogmatic. (The virgin birth is an example of a belief that <i>is</i> dogmatically defined.)</dd>
<dd>I say this only for your edification. My own opinion is that this article should be deleted. An encyclopedia should not have these stub articles springing up for every minor controversy that hits the news. 18.252.5.164 19:30, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I was thinking of adding an article before this idiot storm, on the grounds that she runs a popular blog and now writes for a major politician's site. As for the terminology dispute, this no longer matters unless somebody objects to "teachings". I don't know if I like "angry". That may work in some cases, but the main quote I saw people attacking her for looked like a 'rude' joke. The article doesn't need to speculate on her state of mind. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDan_f2f7.html" title="User:Dan">Dan</a> 01:29, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm putting "strongly-worded" back in, and will keep doing so. While I personally believe "obnoxious," "bigotted," and "vicious" are more appropriate adjectives, "strongly-worded" is MORE than sufficiently neutral. No sane person would consider the terms she used as anything less than "strongly-worded." If you can come up with another adjective, I invite you to do so. There WILL be a characterization of the comments in this article.--Kromagon 03:42, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was confused by the last external link on this article. While it's understandable that the article should link to blogs directly involved -- pandagon and another Marcotte blog -- the last link was to someone's blog article attacking Ms. Marcotte. It seemed rather irrelevant. Especially given its recent insertion without edit comment by an unregistered editor, I concluded it was an attempt to promote the linked blog, and reverted the edit.

<dd>However, her opinions on the lacrosse case have nothing to do with her involvement in the Edwards campaign.

<dd>That is not true. Edwards's campaign was criticized for hiring a woman who held such an opinion about the case even before the Catholic League got into the act. The critics, even if you call them a legion of trolls, were what originally brought the case to the general attention. <a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldfritha_cc31.html" title="User:Goldfritha">Goldfritha</a> 02:04, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Was criticized" is pretty vague. Who criticized the campaign on those grounds? What makes the criticism notable? Where in the news media were Marcotte's comments on the lacrosse case publicized? <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrendelkhan_c5fb.html" title="User:Grendelkhan">grendel</a>|<a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrendelkhan_bc03.html" title="User talk:Grendelkhan">khan</a> 05:33, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Anti-Catholicism category doesn't belong on this article. Marcotte's criticisms were directed solely at the policies and dogmas of the Church, not against Catholics in general, and not against the Church, no matter how offensively they were phrased. It's the difference between "the State of Israel's policies toward the Palestinians are disgusting" and "Hollywood is run by Jews that hate Jesus and love anal sex", if that makes it any clearer--the latter is anti-Semitism; the former is not. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrendelkhan_c5fb.html" title="User:Grendelkhan">grendel</a>|<a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrendelkhan_bc03.html" title="User talk:Grendelkhan">khan</a> 02:13, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The premier group representing Catholics in the area of civil rights, defamation and bigotry have unequivocally accused her of anti-Catholic bigotry. Whether or not it is in fact bigotry on her part does not have to be determined here. I can see no reason why her own words, which are the very source of her notability should not be included (after all she had no article before the controvery and would not have merited one). And if they are nothing more than criticism of Catholic doctrine, why should their presence in the article be objectionable? Likewise the anti-Catholicism category. It's not an "anti-Catholics" category, definitively labeling her as such, although there is a pretty good argument for that. It is just a category which labels the subject. It's a tough argument to make that this article does not touch on the subject of anti-Catholicism. <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMamalujo_db34.html" title="User:Mamalujo">Mamalujo</a> 09:11, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can't quite make out what you mean by "Likewise the anti-Catholicism category. It's not an "anti-Catholics" category,"; please look at the contents of that category. Also, I seriously doubt that if you go to the article on Hollywood and mention that it's run by Jews who hate Jesus and love anal sex, because William Donohue said so, it'll fly. Or even just adding Category:Anti-Catholicism over there, since William Donohue says that Hollywood is run by those Jesus-hating, anal sex-loving Jews. "William Donohue said so" isn't a good argument in that case, and it's not a good argument in this case. As I said before, Marcotte criticized the policies and dogmas of the Catholic church. Whether she did so using filthy, filthy words or not is unrelated to whether or not she was engaging in anti-Catholic bigotry. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrendelkhan_c5fb.html" title="User:Grendelkhan">grendel</a>|<a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrendelkhan_bc03.html" title="User talk:Grendelkhan">khan</a> 13:37, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's nice to see that you are the arbiter of what is anti-Catholic. Marcotte did a lot more than simply criticize the doctrine of the Catholic Church. If that was all she had done, she would not have been forced to resign. As one example, she said, "The Catholic church is not about to let something like compassion for girls get in the way of using the state as an instrument to force women to bear more tithing Catholics" and "I suspect Pope Ratz will give into the urge eventually to come out and say there’s no limbo and unbaptized babies go straight to hell. He can’t help it; he’s just a dictator like that. Hey, fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly, the Pope’s gotta tell women who give birth to stillborns that their babies are cast into Satan’s maw". And this gem: "Q: What if Mary had taken Plan B after the Lord filled her with his hot, white, sticky Holy Spirit? A: You’d have to justify your misogyny with another ancient mythology." Your statements saying this is only criticising doctrine are like saying Mel Gibson's drunken rant was only a comment on Jewish influence in geopolitics. It's untenable. <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMamalujo_db34.html" title="User:Mamalujo">Mamalujo</a> 18:10, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One more point. It's not just that "William Donohue said so." Marcotte was formally criticised for bigotry by the Catholic League for Civil and Religious Rights. Just as the actions of the ADL are not just are not just the opinions of Abe Foxman, this criticism is more than just the opinion of some guy. The organization's board includes Robert P. George, the McCormick Professor of Jurisprudence at Princeton University who's served as served on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and the President's Council on Bioethics, Mary Ann Glendon, the Learned Hand Professor of Law at Harvard and President of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, and philosopher and diplomat Michael Novak who was the U.S. chief ambassador to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (just to name a few). Granted, the organization's criticism doesn't mean without fail that any particular comments are unequivocally anti-Catholic bigotry, but what better gauge do we have. Or must Catholics just sit back, shut their pie holes and take the abuse? The fact that we are even having this discussion just supports Philip Jenkins premise in The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice that venemous attacks are tolerated which would not be tolerated toward other groups. <a href="../../../m/a/m/User%7EMamalujo_db34.html" title="User:Mamalujo">Mamalujo</a> 18:33, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
