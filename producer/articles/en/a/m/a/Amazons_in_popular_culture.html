	    <p>It has been noted that until the 20th century, <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazons.html" title="Amazons">Amazons</a> were typically depicted in <a href="../../../l/i/t/Literature.html" title="Literature">literature</a> as an alien adversary that threatened the masculinity of heroes. As such, the typical goal of the heroes has been to defeat and humiliate them as a way of reasserting their own, masculine superiority.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, Amazons were depicted with increasing sympathy. Today, the typical depiction of the characters is as an isolated community of powerful and beautiful warriors whose respect and cooperation the male heroes are challenged to earn. An early modern example of this sort of self-sufficient all-female community having to learn about men comes in the <a href="../../../1/9/1/1915.html" title="1915">1915</a> <a href="../../../f/e/m/Feminist.html" title="Feminist">feminist</a> <a href="../../../u/t/o/Utopian_novel.html" title="Utopian novel">utopian novel</a> <a href="../../../h/e/r/Herland_%28novel%29.html" title="Herland (novel)">Herland (novel)</a>.</p>
<p>The most famous modern example of an Amazon is the <a href="../../../d/c/_/DC_Comics_9a75.html" title="DC Comics">DC Comics</a> <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superhero.html" title="Superhero">superhero</a> <a href="../../../w/o/n/Wonder_Woman_0ea1.html" title="Wonder Woman">Wonder Woman</a>, who for a time ruled over two different Amazon tribes: <a href="../../../t/h/e/Themyscira.html" title="Themyscira">Themyscira</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bana-Mighdall_52b3.html" title="Bana-Mighdall">Bana-Mighdall</a>. Amazons were also frequently featured on the <i><a href="../../../w/a/r/Xena%7E_Warrior_Princess_5260.html" title="Xena: Warrior Princess">Xena: Warrior Princess</a></i> (<a href="../../../x/e/n/Xena.html" title="Xena">Xena</a>'s sidekick, <a href="../../../g/a/b/Gabrielle_%28Xena%29_5cd9.html" title="Gabrielle (Xena)">Gabrielle</a>, was herself an Amazon, and Xena, while technically not being one, fits the image of a warrior-woman) and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Hercules%7E_The_Legendary_Journeys_4565.html" title="Hercules: The Legendary Journeys">Hercules: The Legendary Journeys</a></i> television series. <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_E._Howard_3cc8.html" title="Robert E.

Esther Freisner has published a series of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthology.html" title="Anthology">anthologies</a> on the theme of <i>Chicks in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chainmail.html" title="Chainmail">Chainmail</a>,</i> containing humorous takes on Amazon characters by a number of science fiction and fantasy writers.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Original_Series_61be.html" title="Star Trek: The Original Series">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></i>, they are referred to in the episode <i><a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomorrow_is_Yesterday_488f.html" title="Tomorrow is Yesterday">Tomorrow is Yesterday</a></i>.

<p>In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Animated_Series_3340.html" title="Star Trek: The Animated Series">Star Trek: The Animated Series</a></i>, the crew had found women of this nature on a planet called Taurus II. The original landing party had to be rescued by an all female combat detail. The episode was <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lorelei_Signal_163d.html" title="The Lorelei Signal">The Lorelei Signal</a></i>.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_book.html" title="Comic book">comic book</a> series <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Y%7E_The_Last_Man_e29c.html" title="Y: The Last Man">Y: The Last Man</a>,</i> in which every male on Earth, except one, is wiped out in a mysterious plague, includes a hyper-feminist <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult.html" title="Cult">cult</a> called the Daughters of the Amazon, who believe that <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Earth_70b5.html" title="Mother Earth">Mother Earth</a> cleansed itself of the "aberration" of the Y chromosome.</p>

<p><a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Wolfe_0963.html" title="Gene Wolfe">Gene Wolfe</a>'s Soldier series of novels feature Amazons, one of whom becomes a lover of the protagonist, Latro.

<p>A <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Next_Generation_3745.html" title="Star Trek: The Next Generation">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></i> episode features similar women in "<a href="../../../a/n/g/Angel_One_3c17.html" title="Angel One">Angel One</a>". These women are tall and strong and dominate the smaller, weaker, more servile men. On this world, the females control the government and the technology, and males play the roles of househusbands, secretaries, and domestic servents.</p>
<p><a href="../../../m/a/s/Master_of_Olympus_-_Zeus_6021.html" title="Master of Olympus - Zeus"><i>Zeus, Master of Olympus</i></a>, a computer game, features these women under the command of Artemis who, depending on the scenario/campaign played, are either the player's allies or deadly enemies, since Artemis can either "bless" the game player's leader (with extra pork from hunting or fighting forces) or "curse" the game player's leader (usually by attacking and destroying parts of the player's city), depending on the scenario/campaign played. Some scenarios also feature <i>independent</i> amazons, such as the Military 2 scenario and The Labors of Hercules scenario.</p>
<p>The <i><a href="../../../s/l/i/Sliders.html" title="Sliders">Sliders</a></i> episode <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love_Gods_%28Sliders%29_0fc9.html" title="Love Gods (Sliders)">Love Gods (Sliders)</a> depicts women in control of an Earth, due to a germ warfare virus killing most of the men, and causing the survivors to be sterile, and left the women unaffected by it. When the male Sliders were found, they were mistaken for men that somehow escaped the plague, not knowing that they're from <i>our</i> plane of existence, travelling to different dimensions.</p>
<p>A <i><a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate_SG-1_3423.html" title="Stargate SG-1">Stargate SG-1</a></i> episode, "Birthright", has the military unit from Earth asking woman warriors on another planet for aid against spaceborne and dimensional enemies.</p>
<p>A <i><a href="../../../t/h/u/Thundarr_the_Barbarian_b0d6.html" title="Thundarr the Barbarian">Thundarr the Barbarian</a></i> episode, "Attack of the Amazon Women", depicts a race of Amazon warriors located in what was left of <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mount_Rushmore_ebc9.html" title="Mount Rushmore">Mt. Rushmore</a>. These women were blue-skinned and amphibious, capable of existing on land and underwater indefinitely. It is possible they were a nod toward the people of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Comics_b294.html" title="Marvel Comics">Marvel Comics</a>' Atlantis as they were blue-skinned water breathers as well. Thundarr and his companions came to the aid of Dionna, the deposed queen of these Amazons, aiding her small band of rebels in defeating Strya, a half-woman, half-<a href="../../../s/h/a/Shark.html" title="Shark">shark</a> sorceress who had conquered her kingdom and found an "ancient" nuclear warhead, which she intended to use in her attempt at conquest.</p>

The <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honored_Matres_ba27.html" title="Honored Matres">Honored Matres</a> are another group of all-female warriors from the <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dune_universe.html" title="Dune universe">Dune universe</a>, though they also utilize <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_domination.html" title="Sexual domination">sexual domination</a> of men to obtain power.</p>
<p>Another computer game, <i><a href="../../../d/i/a/Diablo_II_0e9e.html" title="Diablo II">Diablo II</a></i>, depicts these women in it as a combat class.</p>

<p>A few episodes of the <i><a href="../../../t/h/u/Thundercats.html" title="Thundercats">Thundercats</a></i> feature women of this nature on "Third Earth". They are referred to as "Warrior Women", and have a hierarchy that includes a queen as the head of society.
