<p>Merrick goes overboard printing rumors and exaggerations in the Pioneer about the Montana annexation, interest from Wyoming, and even suggestion from Washinton about making the camp an independent territory or state. Merrick is delighted with the extra sales the story is producing, until a furious Swearengen insults Merrick for lying and unprofessional journalism. In calmer tones, h explain that each rumour has some truth, but his article allows selfish forces to take advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>The disgusting Mose Manuel, the man who killed his brother and sold his claim to Walcott, spends his profits wantonly, and Tolliver obliges plying him with women and tempting him to gambling. Bullock and Utter come in to question him about his brother. Mose answers belligerently, and Tolliver joins in defending him. Walcott comes in to coldly report the shooting of a Cornishman at their operation. Utter blows up at him. He knows full well they ‘got to’ Mose. Later, Mose realizes most of his money is gone and gets angry at Tolliver and Walcott. He raises a gun and Walcott speaks like the trickster devil after knowing he’s won, and provokes Mose further. Mose looks ready to shoot and so is shot by Tolliver’s men. Walcott orders that Bullock be called before the doctor.</p>
<p>Outside, he rants. In addition to his previous anger over Joannie, over which he savagely beat up Walcott, he is angry that Walcott had Bill’s last letter. He also worries about Jane and her drinking. More generally, he is angry that ‘it’s all amalgamation and capital’, the title of the episode and a phrase he uses repeatedly despite not fully understanding it. He sees big business interests as taking over the camp and tells Bullock that he plans to leave. He refuses to tell Bullock why he laid a pounding on Walcott.</p>
<p>Bullock who didn’t know his brother well, talks briefly to William about him. William goes out to plant three sunflower seeds he brought, hoping Mr. Bullock will like them as his own father did. He suggests taking lunch to Bullock which he and his mother does.</p>
<p>Swearengen puts Farnum to the task of befriending and monitoring the telegraph operator, especially messages to and from Yankton. He does so with annoying gusto, taking particular interest in Miss Issinghausen’s telegram before she tells him off in no uncertain terms. E.B. rushes to tell Swearengen of it, in the presence of Merrick, to have him ‘construe’ it.</p>
<p>Ellsworth handles business, especially money matters, with Alma. She is bringing a safe from Denver and keeping it at the hardware store. She also wants him to being a letter to Swearengen. He mentions his proposal but she is still not ready to answer.</p>
<p>Fields, the ‘nigger general’ had caught a wild randy horse escaped from the Sioux and wants Hostetler to cut his genitals so he can sell him to the cavalry.</p>
<p>Jane keeps a vigil outside of Joannie’s place, protecting her from Walcott. Joannie invites her to stay and, still confused, seems to desperately want that. Jane returns back to Utter’s jail cell and has a hilarious conversation with Utter as he tells her he is leaving. Despite his gruffness, he is happy she is moving in with Joannie. He refuses to tell her where he is going.</p>
<p>Trixie is still struggling with math while the safe is installed in Bullock and Star’s hardware store. Martha suggests that Alma might like to see it installed. Trixie worries about friction between Martha and Alma and questions Ellsworth about his proposal went. She is frustrated Alma has not accepted. Alma is interested to know that Martha suggested she watch the safe installed. She again delays answering Ellsworth proposal.</p>
<p>Alma’s letter to Swearengen intimates that she guesses Miss Issinghausen is a Pinkerton. Their discussion is complicated. In brief, her backing out of their agreement might lead to Swearengen’s implication in Brom Garrett’s murder and Alma’s relatives taking her claim and readily selling it to ‘bigger interests’, something he cannot allow. He threatens to stick with the deal they made, offering $5000 incentive. She agrees insisting the sheriff escort her from the camp.</p>
<p>With E.B. unsuccessful in monitoring, Dan Dority is set on the task. The Russian tries to remain honorable, but knows he is being threatened.</p>
<p>Bullock tells Tom Nutall that Mose will get away with murder. Nutall takes William off to show him the bone-shaker. All are tense around Martha, especially her unctuous kindness toward Alma when she arrives. Nutall leaves William with a low-class ruffian, I believe the man who tarred Fields in an earlier episode who will put William on the bike after building up some steam. A montage of scenes occur overlayed with music. Trixie becomes the first depositor giving over her large gold nugget. Mose is on death throes. Issinghausen looks over the contract with Bullock present. Fields and Hostetler struggle with the horse. The ruffian offers money to William which he refuses. The horse breaks loose and runs wild, eventually trampling William and the man. Faces turn to realization that something is wrong throughout the camp. Nutall runs to them and whispers back is broken’.</p>
