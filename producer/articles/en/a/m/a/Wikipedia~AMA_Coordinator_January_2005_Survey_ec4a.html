<li>From Alex756's talk page: Glad to see you around Alex&#160;:-) And to see activity... to which I really cannot participate&#160;:-( just too much to do. I feel like I do advocacy all the time, but not really here any more. I have a suggestion... about the sign-post... why don't you make a deal with it, so that to advertise your activity over there&#160;? I'll give you an example. Say a user A is unhappy with a certain rule, but the rule has a couple of tough gardians; User A is quite timid, so does not really dare to be bold with the gardians and question the rule. He might ask help from a more vocable person, and this person could start making the opinion on the sign post... so as to test the solidity of the ground. Such as raising the question of this rule interest and general support. Depending on feedback, the advocate knows better what chance there is for success. ... <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthere_36ed.html" title="User:Anthere">SweetLittleFluffyThing</a> 23:26, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've lost count of how many users I've helped: almost one hundred, probably. The most time I put into a case was when <a href="../../../l/i/r/User%7ELir_4e26.html" title="User:Lir">user:Lir</a> was banned by Jimbo, and I helped him get reinstated (around five hours, spread over several days). My work as an advocate has nearly always been successful; the few rare cases of failure have been when the person I was trying to help turned out to be a troll. By the way, I find my AMA work blends into my Mediation Committee work: generally, people ask me for help on my user page, and I help them. It's usually either (a) someone frustrated that another user won't allow them to express an idea (or insert a properly attributed POV) or (b) someone distressed at another user's discourteous remarks on a talk page. A little courtesy and friendly interest of my own usually smooths things over quickly. <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">--user:Ed Poor</a> <a href="../../../e/d/_/User_talk%7EEd_Poor_6f26.html" title="User talk:Ed Poor">(talk)</a> 14:54, Jan 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've not been an advocate for very long, but I have managed to help in two cases: the "Lugnut" anon case, and the Ray Foster vs. Dcreemer case. I think my efforts in Ray Foster vs. Dcreemer helped to calm the dispute from RfM state to a more localized page-survey state, and clarify some WP best practices. In the lugnut case, while I think I did every effort to try to track down the problem, I was not apparently able to convince the anon to come on full-fledged to WP. I've acted in an unofficial capacity to try and help another case though not in an official advocate capacity. Beyond that, I've tried to improve the format and maintenance of the Requests page, rekindled some communication elsewhere in the AMA pages, and submitted suggestions on AMA operation. I've also done preliminary investigations on a number of requests to aid in their assessment, and responded to a few non-dispute requests to assist the user. I'd say all told that I've spent about 30 hours involved in AMA related efforts, with probably half involved in advocacy or dispute related issues. As for improvement of the advocacy effort, I think increased visibility, timely response to requests, and maintaining good records of advocacy activity would be the best next steps. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<li>To expand: I have never advocated as an AMA member, as in advocated after the coordinator passed a case to me. I was requested to by Alex once, but I was away at the time. I have once or twice helped people out who requested so on my talk page etc. <a href="../../../l/u/d/User%7ELudraman_395d.html" title="User:Ludraman">J<small>OHN</small> C<small>OLLISON</small></a> (<a href="../../../l/u/d/User_talk%7ELudraman_707d.html" title="User talk:Ludraman">An Liúdr</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ludraman&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ludraman&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">amán</a>) 17:14, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hmm... I remember responding to this, but for some reason it is no longer here. I haven't really helped anyone officially with the AMA (mostly because I haven't checked Wikipedia very often recently and I'm not getting email notifications of these things); I've offerred unofficial assistance to members here and there, however. Obviously, I do not think that my work as an advocate has been successful, for the above reason. One easy step to improve the Association would be to notify members of requests in some way, rather than relying on the AMA Requests for assistance page. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetasquares_f66f.html" title="User:Metasquares">Metasquares</a> 16:01, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As it turns out, I haven't been very involved in dealing with individual requests, or at least not those directed to the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_Requests_for_Assistance_1619.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA Requests for Assistance">AMA Requests for Assistance</a> page. I've helped individuals occasionally when they came to me directly, but it seems most of my work in the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">dispute resolution</a> system has been more focused on representing community interests. In trying to discern and promote the interests of the community, I've commented on the course of several arbitration cases and even brought one myself.</li>
<li>We aren't being given a quota of billable hours, are we? Just kidding, but I really have no idea how much time I've spent, particularly since I often didn't think of my work as being explicitly in an AMA capacity, even if it had an advocacy component. On occasion, the time involved has been pretty substantial, such as in presenting and supporting a request for arbitration.</li>
<li>Well, I haven't accomplished everything I wanted, but I feel my work has at least had some impact.</li>
<li>One thing that might help members is to develop more ideas and suggestions for how they can get involved in the community generally, even in ways that are not directly advocacy. Professional associations frequently urge their members to participate in outside community organizations as a way to develop personal connections and improve the visibility and public acceptance of the profession. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 19:31, 24 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have, in all, responded to five requests for assistance, and handled two cases directly, the last one being the issue of <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERay_Foster_3fef.html" title="User:Ray Foster">User:Ray Foster</a>, which was settled to the satisfaction of all parties without going to arbitration. Total time worked has been something on the order of fifteen hours. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 20:09, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
