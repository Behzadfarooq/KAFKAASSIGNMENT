<p><a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">user:drgitlow</a>, a psychiatrist and author of a few pamphlets and books on alcoholism continues who "treats" alcoholics to remove anything from the <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcoholism.html" title="Alcoholism">alcoholismarticle</a> that is critical of the disease theory of alcoholism or the treatment industry, he removes anything that is critical of the AMA (American Medical Association) and the APA (American Psychological Association), he removes cited, credible references as quickly as they are put in the article. Within the article has called some of the authors cited in there "pundits". He insists the AMA has the final word on everything alcoholism related and has removed references because the authors are not MDs. He even removes quotations from a Supreme Court Justice who stated there was a large body of scientific evidence that disputes the disease theory in alandmark decision.</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that there is no consensus in the scientific community over the disease concept of alcoholism, he insists since the AMA/APA claims such a diseas exists the Wiki article should assume the AMA/APA POV. We have told him the article should assume a neutral position on the disease debate and instead reflect all the voices within the debate. He continues to ignore those requests/demands.</p>
<p>He has already asked that we only allow medical people to edit the article. He ignores other editors requests that he stop removing their entries. He insists on wring the article in a manner that reflects the AMA/APA Alcoholics Anonymous POV and is removing anything that conflicts, criticizes or questions those organizations or their ideas and methods. He has turned the article into his own. We could use an admin to drop by and remind people what NPOV is and how all sides of a debate should be voiced (and refeerenced).

<dd>Unfortunately, Mr_christopher continues to misunderstand his position. The article on alcoholism previously reflected a general consensus of the medical community, much as the entries do for other chronic disease states. Mr_Christopher has misstated several of my comments, the originals of which remain in the alcoholism discussion area. Mr_Christopher states that there is no consensus in the scientific community when in fact there is (the federation of medical societies and research organizations voted on such a consensus many years ago, and that consensus passed as AMA policy within its House of Delegates). Although Mr_Christopher thinks there is no consensus, he has no facts to support his perspective. He continues to vandalize a scientific article written largely by the scientific community by changing the facts. It is as if he entered the entry on grass and constantly changed it to state that grass is red and that the public at large is in disagreement regarding the color of this plant. Mr_Christopher could use a reminder that reliable and verifiable sources should be used to present a neutral point of view within a scientific article entry.<a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 02:48, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mr_Christopher should also look back. I corrected a cited quote from a Supreme Court Justice to accurately reflect what the Justice said within his opinion. I have never stated that the AMA has the final word on anything having to do with alcoholism. In fact, I said quite the opposite: the AMA has policy that reflects what other organizations believe, not what it generates itself. I've never said anything at all about the American Psychological Association. Mr_Christopher continues to confuse the APA (American Psychiatric Association) with the other APA (American Psychological Association). Finally, yes, I have removed some citations that were not from reliable sources. Just because an individual says that Apollo 11 didn't go to the moon doesn't mean that individual should be cited as if he has any basis for his statement. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 02:52, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Finally, while I have not yet asked that the page be protected from the type of changes that Mr_Christopher has been making, I am concerned that Mr_Christopher's perspectives need to find a new outlet. <a href="../../../d/r/g/User%7EDrgitlow_8bf4.html" title="User:Drgitlow">Drgitlow</a> 02:55, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do cleanup editing of many pages. One of the things I do is remove unnecessary date links, following what I believe is stated in the WP:DATE policy. I now find I have been targeted by USER:REBECCA (formerly USER:AMBI) who objects to my date link removal and has started mass reverting my editing work. She is reverting not only my date link changes, but all other changes I made to the articles. Also, it was just a little over an hour ago today (Friday) that she stated she would start 'happily' reverting all my work if I did not agree to her directives, but she has gone back to days prior to Friday mass revert my work. You can see the discusison in my talk page.</p>
<p>What I request is that USER: REBECCA be barred from mass reverting my edits solely on the basis of her personal objections to de-linking non-date-format-required date links and that USER:REBECCA be barred from imposing and enforcing her personal choices on my editing work, regarding whether to link or delink such dates.</p>

<p>Several people working on this article have been unable to reach anything close to an agreement, with each side insisting that the other is trying to violate NPOV with unsupported claims, and some rather heated personal accusations.

<p>Similar case here as Mr. Wolok at the bottom of the page.I have two editors and one in particular that trailed me here from an outside site after a comment thread dispute and are altering my work to reflect well on the subject of the article. I tried to balance the story but he keeps changing my edits and accusing me of bias employing circumstantial ad hominem attacks and obtuse evidenciary requirements. All evidence is rejected as not relavant, or sourced, yet when a source is provided it is erased as an exception to the rule. It has been in mediation but the third party just continued to blame me using the "us versus them" cliche. All this is now is three against 0ne instead of two.

<p>I need advice from some experienced wikipedians on point-of-view policy. The "age of the earth" article is entirely about the history of radiometric dating and how the earth is 10 billion years old, etc etc. There's a small disclaimer at the top saying that there are some alternative views. Am I correct in saying that this isn't allowed? Shouldn't an article called "Age of the Earth" cover the <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Reasoning_behind_NPOV" title="WP:NPOV">entire body of knowledge</a> on the age of the earth, or just the scientific facts?

Am I justified in asking for arbitration? I don't actually want any help here, I just want to know whether my claim has merit.

<p>I'd like some advice as to how to deal with <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoseNuggets_0929.html" title="User:NoseNuggets">User:NoseNuggets</a>, a frequent editor to pages related to American sports. I am familiar with him through <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_sports_events.html" title="Current sports events">Current sports events</a>, where his regular edits to the page have seriously lessened the quality of it. He consistently puts his edits in the past tense, italic type and casual style, even though he has been told several times that current-events pages should be in present tense, roman type and headline style. New editors to the page see his edits and follow his style rather than the correct one. I have been told NoseNuggets' edits to other pages are also of low quality. His edits to <a href="../../../c/u/r/Current_sports_events.html" title="Current sports events">Current sports events</a> have improved somewhat -- they are less <a href="../../../s/p/o/SportsCenter_52cb.html" title="SportsCenter">SportsCenter</a>-ish than they were before.</p>
<p>In January, I created an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_NoseNuggets_b1fe.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/NoseNuggets">RFC</a> page to bring attention to NoseNuggets' conduct, but he more-or-less ignored it.

<p>There is an instance whereby a discussion was brought up by myself pertaining to a political powder keg pertaining to the Australian government's negligence to identify indigenous cultures through recognition via sovreignty, but to utilise dual-name schemes to appease whilst also cashing in on tourism via the 'exotic' or 'cultural' falsification of a region.</p>
<p>The issue in question is the matter of Ayers Rock, dual named Uluru. The current article has a majority of editors who regularly maintain it who are of the inclination that it's dual name should not be used; playing devils advocate (as I believe as opinion that it should be purely Uluru, yet from a legal and legitimacy standpoint it should be Ayers Rock until the Government aknowledges it's aboriginality).</p>
<p>To cut a long story short, rather than answering the one question I posed, I seem to have set off this powder keg with allegations flying at me from all directions. Rather than answering the question I put forwards (that being 'what was the cause for decision last time the issue was raised?') certain editors put it to a poll, however a straw man poll at that; the poll summary was set up biased, incorrect and farcically and the voting commenced immediately with no interaction from third parties.</p>

<p>About 6 hours ago, I happened upon the <a href="../../../t/e/n/Tennessee.html" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> discussion page, where a user named <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBookofsecrets_f975.html" title="User:Bookofsecrets">Bookofsecrets</a> was sparking and re-sparking ana rgument about the offensiveness of the word "southern". I posted a solution to this arguement, and was almost immediately contacted by Bookofsecrets about how "he had not asked for" my "petty opinion" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:PHDrillSergeant#Zip_the_Lip" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:PHDrillSergeant#Zip_the_Lip" rel="nofollow">Here</a>. I responded to him in his User Talk page, replying in an intelligent (albeit angry) way, letting him know that I did not need his "permission to post on an article's talk page" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bookofsecrets&amp;oldid=51122838" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bookofsecrets&amp;oldid=51122838" rel="nofollow">Here</a>. His reply was that I was offended him for pointing the finger at him (on an unrelated issue). To this, I replied with another message informing him that I was not talking about him on <i>that</i> particular issue, giving him a link to <a href="../../../e/g/o/Egotism.html" title="Egotism">egotism</a> (which I thought he might find useful) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bookofsecrets&amp;oldid=51127125" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bookofsecrets&amp;oldid=51127125" rel="nofollow">Here</a>.

<p>Needless to say, I am particularly peeved at this person who believes that not only is he the center of the universe, but he is superior and no one should argue with his superior opinion.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Israelbeach Vs. Woggly</span></h3>
<p>In the past 24 hours there has been an escalation in the war of the words between <a href="../../../i/s/r/User%7EIsraelbeach_1341.html" title="User:Israelbeach">user:Israelbeach</a> and <a href="../../../w/o/g/User%7EWoggly_b7b8.html" title="User:Woggly">user:Woggly</a>. Woggly who never apologized for her personal attacks against Israelbeach was never addressed or blocked for these attacks by the administrators. In fact, she has been attacking Israelbeach, whose identity is for all to see, from an anonymous position. Not very fair or ethical!</p>
<p>Israelbeach, in turn, revealed Woggly's identity, something he was wrong for doing. According to Wiki policy: "This sort of behavior is blockable on its own (for example, moving another user's User Talk page), but should be considered an aggravating factor for the purposes of the block. For example, behavior that would earn a 1 day ban might become a 1 week ban if the Administrator believes the behavior was for the purposes of harassment. <i>The block should only be enforced after warning the user and these pleas go ignored.</i>"</p>
<p>Israelbeach was warned by <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">user:jpgordon</a> and according to the logs deleted all material within minutes. <i>Israelbeach should not have been blocked according to Wiki policy as he never ignored any warnings by adm but reacted quickly to them</i>.</p>
<p>Woggly is now rightfully worried about legal action that Israelbeach can take against her for stating, without substance, that he was "dangerous" and other accusations made in front of his local community and the world public. She now appears to be leaving Wikipedia on her own.</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b> Both Israelbeach and Woggly are professional editors and should be encouraged to stay with the Wiki project. The block on Israelbeach should be removed immediately, as it only serves to increase conflict. Remember, after a first warning, Israelbeach on his own removed all personal data even though he thought he was correct due to that personal information regarding Woggly was posted by Woggly with a direct link to Wikipedia that anyone can find on a simple Google search.</p>
<p>Both Israelbeach and Woggly should be warned with no punitive action taken and instructed not to interact with one another on Wikipedia. These are two professionals with tremendous pride - do not expect either to aplogize at this point. We must encourage both users to stay, to avoid court action (with the documentation that Israelbeach has on these clear personal attacks, no judge would deny Woggly's guilt) and keep Wikipedia operating with less negative news coverage.</p>
<p>I do not blame Woggly or Israelbeach for their now wanting to resign from Wikipedia, I place the blame solely on the desk of the administrators (with the exception of <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">user:jpgordon</a>) who could have taken action on the personal attacks which started this conflict. Woggly and Israelbeach are both assets to Wikipedia, all action should be taken to keep them here.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Request assistance, guidance and comment</span></h3>
<p>Hello - I had a good browse about and this seems the most sensible place to get some guidance and help. This started out as me making some comments on another user’s talk page, since that user was blanking and hiding things on it for no reason. I pointed out that blanking/hiding was not a good thing and that other users may presume bad faith. As a result of getting nowhere with the user directly I went to 3O and got an outside view (partially to make user understand that this wasn’t personal, and partly to reassure <i>myself</i> that I wasn't going too far or being too harsh). 3O opinion was broadly in line with what I had already said - as a result of that the user "upped the stakes" by "archiving" his talk page to hide it all and accused me of stalking him. I posted once more within the dispute before it became clear to me the user had no concept of things and was not even grasping the issue. As a result of the user making a very clear accusation of stalking against me I posted my final thoughts and left the situation (I have no time for people who behave like that). User made some enquiries on the issue to the 3O user, clearly not understanding the 3O process. As a result of a few days rest the user has now (as a logged out anon IP) decided to post sockpuppet tags on both my and 3O users talk page, in the belief that because 3O gave similar view to my own he/I were socks (total rubbish, as both our contribs and history, +checkuser if needed would happily prove). It is clear to me that user has himself broken sockpuppet rules by logging out to post the sockpuppet notices - and that that action is warnable - but I am not directly getting involved with him again - he reminds me of someone I used to work with years ago, plays the naive card, baits and baits then as soon as anyone turns the word calls rape (or in this case stalker/sockpuppet). Any help that AMA members could provide would be greatly received, as I am now doing what I need to protect myself - aware that characters like this are smear merchants.

<dd>Actually, what is really going on is a total lack of understanding of Wikipedia policies due to not reading them. This user does not even know how to sign his own posts. That being said, there are a number of issues that need to be resolved, among them:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Proper application of NPOV (this user believes that anything negative against RGLE violates NPOV, but the RGLE claims against UGLE, which are also negative, are perfectly allowable.)</li>
<li>Notability - third party research indicates that RGLE may be an entity perpetrated by just a few individuals, and with almost no real presence except for a web page, so it may not meet notability guidelines.</li>
<li>Misleading "facts" - part of the vandalism going on is stating that RGLE is what is called a "regular Masonic jurisdiction", when it in fact is not, as evidenced by a letter from UGLE (who grants regularity) that is posted on the talk page.</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Overzealous reverting</span></h3>
<p>I have come across someone who seems to have taken reverting vandalism too far and is reverting quite useful entries based on his/her own standards of what is potential vandalism. You just need to go through the user talk page to see this. Is there a mechanism to report this sort of person?</p>

<dd>To be honest I can't be bothered as there are better things to do with life. It just seems to me that this person has confused fighting obvious vandalism with content editing and set him/herself up as an editor. And anything contributed by someone without an account and without an edit summary is automatically reverted by him/her.

<dd>This seems fairly simple to me. If the user keeps up the disruption, the user can be blocked.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Blocked and Banned new user, desperate for help</span></h3>
<p>I have no desire to be working my way around a block, but I have no other choice to contact an advocate. My name is Straightinfo, and I am a new user of Wiki who began editing the [Bernie Sanders] article. I had my additions repeatedly warped and twisted by one or two users, I reverted many of these changes. Finally, an Admin named [Heah] semi-protected the page, which blocked me from saving my work, but allowed the other users to edit it. They claim my addtions were a violation of NPOV or that my citations were worthless, neither of which is true, you be the judge.</p>
<p>I have attempted to explain my edits as clearly as possible, have engaged in debate wth the other editors, and have tried to discuss what's happened with as many others as I can, many of whom were supportive of the changes. Admin Heah simply blocked me, claiming I'd violated the 3RR rule, which I did not (check the record) and extended that ban for 10 days when I challenged hs decision. I desperately need an advocate here. I thought wiki was a neutral place which promoted fairness and good information, I am becoming deeply disappointed. All I want to do is add to wiki Please help. ---[Straightinfo]</p>

<p>I have a dream that the <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuba.html" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> article, (and a few related articles), can actually become encylopedic. The editing process with these articles has descended into an edit war. Two, perhaps three users appear to me to be intractable, either not responding at all in one case, and refusing to comply with Wikipedia policy WP:NPOV, WP:V etc.. in all three cases. Reasoning with these three people hasn't worked, and I hope for help or guidence to end this edit war and to bring these articles back to be encylopedic. <a href="../../../b/r/u/User%7EBruceHallman_9787.html" title="User:BruceHallman">BruceHallman</a> 18:54, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Dealing With Religious War on Jack Hyles</span></h3>
<p>A group of people have taken it on themselves to post a section of defamatory assertions against <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Hyles_12fe.html" title="Jack Hyles">Jack Hyles</a>, which they justify by pointing to various newspaper articles and anectdotes. I believe these people will not allow the Jack Hyles page to be anything other than a gossip page devoted to destroying the reputation of Jack Hyles; indeed, one editor recently pointed out that the page has already been through an edit war. I am well-aware that Jack Hyles is controversial and that many people hate him, but I have never seen anyone prove the claims made directly against him. In fact, one of the editors supporting the attacks defends his stand by stating that he never claimed that Jack Hyles actually did the things of which he is accused; he simply wants to have all the published accusations against Jack Hyles listed on Wikipedia. This is not the sort of content an encyclopedia article should contain.</p>

<p>I would like to ask for assistance concerning disputes involved the <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spice_Girls_4805.html" title="Spice Girls">Spice Girls</a> page, and the individual girls pages (<a href="../../../g/e/r/Geri_Halliwell_33b3.html" title="Geri Halliwell">Geri Halliwell</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanie_Chisholm_de48.html" title="Melanie Chisholm">Melanie Chisholm</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emma_Bunton_b2c4.html" title="Emma Bunton">Emma Bunton</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/c/Victoria_Beckham_45d1.html" title="Victoria Beckham">Victoria Beckham</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melanie_Brown_ace4.html" title="Melanie Brown">Melanie Brown</a>). The issue involves one particular member - <a href="../../../h/o/t/User%7EHotwiki_4fcf.html" title="User:Hotwiki">Hotwiki</a>. He has constantly dished out insults, personal attacks and threats and acts in a rude and arrogant manner (see Geri Halliwell talk page). Despite improvements made to the pages, he constantly reverts changes - as illustrated on the Emma Bunton, Geri Halliwell and Melanie Chisholm pages.</p>
<p>The main dispute revolves around the Spice Girls discography. On the Spice Girls talk page, I suggested that solo information should be removed and put on the girls own pages. My point is that is a Spice Girls discography - not a Victoria Beckham or Geri Halliwell discography. Very few of the other discographies on Wikipedia that is about a group includes solo info - The Beatles, ABBA, Jackson 5, Backstreet Boys etc. Also, it was suggested that the Spice Girls library be absorbed into the discography to make it a comphrensive collection of the groups work. The consensus from the discussion agreed with the point of view - Hotwiki being the only exception. I have no yet started these changes to the discography, becuase it is very clear the user will simply revert them and I refuse to be draw into such a petty and childish game - so I would glady appreciate assistance, please. <a href="../../../r/i/m/User%7ERimmers_934f.html" title="User:Rimmers">Rimmers</a> 19:26, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My consolidation of two sections of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parsi.html" title="Parsi">Parsi</a> article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parsi&amp;oldid=44842104#Definition_of_Parsi" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parsi&amp;oldid=44842104#Definition_of_Parsi" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> was reverted by <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a> because <i>"rv unilateral rewrite - you have inserted too much opinion and disregarded that there are other editors involved here"</i>.</p>
<p>My request for advocacy with respect to my writeup:</p>
<ul>
<li>what is considered "too much opinion"?</li>
<li>must a rewrite (of my own stuff incidentally) be discussed - particularly since it simply covers matter that is already present, but does so in greater detail?</li>
<li>is a unilateral rv the correct course of action for a "unilateral rewrite"?</li>
</ul>
<p>Although SouthernComfort's argument may initially seem plausible, on closer inspection I've determined that <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a>'s revert is not for any formal reason's per-se, but simply because the rewrite clarified something which he does not approve of (or does not mirror his personal opinion).</p>
<p>Thus my request for advocacy: Is <a href="../../../s/o/u/User%7ESouthernComfort_743b.html" title="User:SouthernComfort">SouthernComfort</a>'s revert legitimate <b>or</b> should my edit remain and be developed (for example, to be less verbose).</p>

<p>I'm a newbie. I stumbled across this article and was surprised at its one-sided nature, and its errors of fact. A number of the corrections I have tried to make get removed, and dubious tags have been removed without providing the requested verification. The principal other party has refused mediation.</p>
<p>To keep it simple, the writer(s) of the original article was so unfamiliar with the material that <i>Our Sunday Visitor</i> was called <i>Our Catholic Visitor</i>, and this unfamiliarity with the material partly explains the problems with the article.</p>

<dd>Yet more dishonesty. Bob Pickle is not a "newbie". He is a promoter of a notorious anti-Roman Catholic conspiracy theory on religious internet sites and blog sites. Even the religion that first promoted the claim, the Seventh-day Adventists, and did so for over a century, has now disowned it and the Church's own historian has admitted that the Church's "photographic evidence" was doctored and not real. Pickle is annoyed that users on Wikipedia will not allow him to promote the myth as fact on WP (among other things he did was to try to add in links to his website to the article!!!). <i>All</i> users who have covered the issue on WP have pointed out that his claims have not a leg to stand on, including a former believer of the claim who when he checked it out realised that the claims in the conspiracy does not have a leg to stand on and rests on the sum total of a forged mediaval document, forged photographs, three lines in a minor US magazine in the 1910s (which then admitted it had its facts wrong, twice) and a couple of words in a two or three books out of the millions written about Catholicism. That is the sum total of the "evidence". Pickle promotes the claim of a Catholic Church-wide conspiracy (including a Catholic conspiracy <i>on Wikipedia</i> to supress the evidence without his (or the promoters of the claim) being able to point to a single independently verified piece of evidence, produce the photograph that supposedly "proves" the conspiracy theory's truth despite a century of searching (naturally the Catholic Church destroyed the photograph! lol).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyone who doubts Pickle's supposed "newbie status" (ie. just an ordinary contributor) should simply look at his contributions, which are about promoting this claim (and his website) and little else!!! Or notice how in asking for mediation (which no-one but himself supported) he asked that only neutral admins (ie, not those under the sway of the Catholic Church and its Wikipedia conspiracy) get involved. That pretty much sums up his antics here. He is here to promote his POV agenda, his own POV website and his own POV opinions and to push a conspiracy theory even dismissed by most mainstream Protestants and now disowned by its own authors in Seventh-day Adventism. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 21:23, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Even if some of the above diatribe were true, it does not justify including erroneous material in Wikipedia. Either <i>Our Sunday Visitor</i> disowned the 1915 statements in 1917 and 1941 or it did not. Either the 1832 source said "tiara" or it said "miter."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The authentic and accurate quote I provided clearly said "miter." It says nothing about a "tiara." And scans of the 1917 and 1941 statements in question, scans which have been available on the internet for years, clearly show that OSV NEVER stated that VFD was not on the miter. Thus Jtdirl is lying (a venial sin according to his theology) when he makes his claim about the 1832 source and about those 1917 and 1941 issues, and he cannot provide any evidence to the contrary.</dd>

<dd>To the contrary, I have never engaged in researching this topic to this depth. I have never read Gregorovius before, and thus did not know that part of the coronation ceremony of the popes was based on the Donation of Constantine.

Not once do I ever recall them accusing me of being anti-Catholic because of my views on papal supremacy. I therefore think it inappropriate for anyone reading these exchanges to assume that Jtdirl's actions and words reflect the attitudes of Catholics in general. --DrPickle 16:38, 23 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Dispute Resolution with <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a></span></h3>
<p>I have been undergoing a dispute with <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">User:Striver</a>. The user has <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Striver_fe2e.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Striver">already undergone an RFC</a> last July (of which I had not participated because I had not contacted the user at that point). Recently he has been making a variety of articles which I felt were either not notable or violated POV Fork/Fork, thus I listed many of them with AFD tags. The user has since created an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Jersey_Devil_9628.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Jersey Devil">RFC on myself</a> claiming that I was "stalking" him. I feel that this is untrue and that the Rfc was solely created to try and stop me from rightfully putting AFD tags on his articles many of which I feel hurt the Wikipedia project. In addition to this, the user has created entire Wikipedia projects with the sole purpose of salvaging his articles from afds, has broken with <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a> by cursing at another user, has falsely called vandalism in page history summaries, and has broken with <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> by putting up afd tags on articles for the sole reason of revenge at other posters for putting up an afd tag on his article. I document this all in detail in <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Jersey_Devil_9628.html#Response" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Jersey Devil">my response to the RFC</a>. From reading "Dispute Resolution" I understand that disputes should be first tried to be resolved between the parties involved directly, that had failed. From then on there are four options we could take of which an Rfc on the user was taken. This however seems to have failed because as of now this dispute is still active. So from here on we could try Mediation, however I feel that Mediation would not help in this dispute. I feel that the case against this particular user is so aggregious that it warrants either a long-term block or an outright ban and am strongly considering a Request for Arbitration. I would like to have some understanding of what I should do from here and also some further information on how the Arbitration process works.

This edit is several paragraphs long and has its own top-level section heading. The edit has been discussed at great length in the Talk page, and everyone except Parkinsons himself agrees that it is irrelevant, makes no clear point and doesn't belong in the article. At least 7 different editors have either removed Parkinsons' edit at various times or have disagreed with its content in the Talk page. Parkinsons has argued in defense of his edit in the Talk page, but isn't able to do so clearly, much less convincingly. His defenses often consist of telling people who disagree with him that they are biased and are censoring historical fact. It's clear that there is a consensus against his edit, but he seems impervious to appeals to reason.</p>
<p>Parkinsons has vowed to replace this edit 3 times a day, regardless of how often or quickly it is removed. He's held good on this promise for 10 days now.</p>
<p>This person isn't breaking any WP guidelines that I know of. His edit (in its current form) isn't non-neutral, and it's well cited. It is simply irrelevant to the article and makes no point.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Clay Aiken dispute regarding the John Paulus story</span></h3>
<p>I'm requesting an advocate to help with a situation I've run into on the Clay Aiken page. In my opinion I feel that a handful of his fans have hijacked the page in several instances; firstly they violently refused that any mention be made regarding his sexuality in the article and a compromise was reached only after extensive, extensive argument on their parts. I came into the "fray" when I tried to insert reference to the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Paulus_895e.html" title="John Paulus">John Paulus</a> allegations after seeing a report about it on CNN television. My efforts have been greeted by these reactionary fans and I had to request that the page be locked because any edit I attempted to make was immediately reverted. I feel that the majority of those against inclusion of a brief summary of the issue are against it solely because they feel protective of Clay Aiken's reputation and are trying to censor the story. The range of arguments they provide lack merit or substance and I feel that some of them have resorted to sock puppets in order to further their "majority" opinion. While I'm not the only person who feels that the Paulus story belongs on the page (the same as similar stories are on the articles for many other celebrities, many of whom lack even more basis than this one) I'm certainly the most vocal in favor and I wouldn't find the situation so frustrating if I had help. I want to point out my interest in this isn't because I feel the Paulus story is true (I could care less) or because I think Clay Aiken's gay (could also care less). Rather I feel that those who lurk on the article and have argued in both debates do so because they're trying to suppress information that, though extensively available and mentioned even in late night talk shows, they feel tarnishes their "idol." I personally won't stand idly while such a travesty of free speech is perpetrated. - <a href="../../../m/i/x/User%7EMixvio_ba2d.html" title="User:Mixvio">mixvio</a> 03:42, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll gladly help you, but please understand that the issue here isn't "free speech" (Free speech simply means government cannot punish you for the content of what you say) but rather Wikipedia's goal of including all relevant and verifiable information available on the subjects it covers. 13:02, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the help Kurt, I appreciate it. I apologise, when I said free speech I meant it in the sense that the issue is being crushed by fans of Clay Aiken's who are pushing a very stubborn POV goal to disregard the story because they feel like it tarnishes his image. Any attempt to insert this story has been destroyed by these fans and I feel that they've hijacked the article and are completely censoring it. I truly feel that there wouldn't be so much opposition to inclusion if Paulus had been a woman, frankly. The article is being controlled by POV fan editors and that's what I meant when I said free speech.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">WZTV, Nashville, Tenn. (television station)</span></h3>
<p>A user has taken it upon himself to refuse my referral to a more reputable source concerning the year in which WZTV, a FOX television station in Nashville, Tenn., was started. He has complained that I have repeatedly changed his date of 1968, which I did because the date is not accurate (my source: www.nashvilletv.org); it is rather 1969. He espoused an arrogant attitude when I informed him that the operators of the site I recommended were more likely to have knowledge of the fact at first hand, dismissing my recommendations. I think he utterly disregards the warning not to submit work unless he wishes it "mercilessly edited;" that is, he wants complete control over this article, something noboby, myself included, has a right to demand. I suspect he is eligible to be banned in some way, but I would like to know if it is even feasible to pursue this. Mtstroud, 20:05, 6 March 2006, (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't understand the angle of disregard or disrespect. The site Mtstroud cites, nashvilletv.org, I have collaborated on in the past. Unfortunately, in this instance, there are other internet sources that suggest its date of 1969 is inaccurate. <a href="http://www.chillercinema.com/lucifer.html" class="external text" title="http://www.chillercinema.com/lucifer.html" rel="nofollow">This one</a> speaks of an employee of the station that appeared on-air as early as October 1968.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Continued Factual References, Concerningly Uncivil Behavior</span></h3>
<p>I have a dispute with a user who continually asserts information that is either biased, unreferenced or factually untrue. He becomes extremely hostile when I raise these concerns. My attempts to engage in civil discussion have met with extremely resistance and blatant hostility (e.g. statements such as "stop bugging me", "this is my talk page and I do not reply if you vandalise it"). His behavior towards other Wikipedians is also concerning and rude. I indicated that I would direct our continued discussion to the AMA, but he does not want to engage in the mediation process, as he does not believe that a problem exists. Unfortunately, the mediation process is voluntary. I believe that his behavior warrants some kind of administrative review, but I am not completely intimate with the judicial processes of Wikipedia.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Is there an advocate with courage, given public boasts of being able to murder people</span></h3>
<p>Is there an advocate with courage, willing to monitor and correct the ongoing criminal fraud by hired goons for President Bush's friend and contributor Patricia Cornwell? W. Guy Finley at first volunteered, but then wimped out, quite understandably because of Cornwell's public boasts that she can have people murdered, combined with court documents proving Cornwell has gotten away with felony crimes under US gov't protection. Finley asked some curious questions, then backed away with a silly suggestion to try and contact filmmaker Michael Moore for further assistance, declining to answer further e-mails.</p>
<p>The Cornwell hired goons are not only maintaining a totally fake and fraudulent pro-Cornwell biography on Wikipedia, but are also using the page for a fraudulent and deceptive attack on Cornwell's biographer Sachs. See the online "Patricia Cornwell Biography: Crime, Bribery, Scandal and Mental Illness", for the facts about Cornwell's life that Cornwell's thugs are hiding. Cornwell's scandals are well documented in print documents from the pre-internet era, though Cornwell's political contributions have insulated and protected her among the corporate media that now controls general discourse in the US. Alternative media are afraid to write about her criminal scandals, given Cornwell's past success in criminal attacks on others who dared to question her.</p>
<p>Wikipedia moderators have timidly and slightly corrected the fraudulent material in the past, but the Cornwell hired goons just wait a little and then put their bogus material back online.</p>
<p>The question here is whether Wikipedia is oriented toward wealthy criminals who can afford to hire staff maintaining fraudulent Wikipedia pages and attacks on others. Does a victim have no recourse other than in engaging in daily posting combat on Wikipedia? When wealthy criminals hire staff to make fraudulent attacks on Wikipedia, is the victim thereby sentenced to monitor Wikipedia every day for the rest of his life, just to protect himself?</p>
<p>Wikipedia seems to be a significant fraud and failure, oriented to benefit wealthy criminals. It's quite hard for a new victim, who is not oriented to playing the "Wikipedia game", to even figure out where to post complaints of abuse, as if the Lords of Wikipedia are trying to make it hard for victims. Victims find pages warning them not to post complaints here, or here, or warnings of other Wikipedia "rules", without clear directions where else to go. Wikipedia treats victims as if they have signed up for the Wikipedia game, when they perhaps just want to stop Wikipedia being used for criminal purposes against them.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Small Issue about Article writing</span></h3>
<p>I have been enjoying wikipedia and began to notice stubs about past companies, and mildly famous friends of mine popping up. I had begun to mildly contribute to stubs and thought it would be nice to add an article for me. I am not Madonna, but I have done quite a bit of work in the design world. I wrote a small piece (unfinished) about some of my schooling a few collections I have done. My work for Betsey Johnson, Triple five Soul, Akademiks, PRPS, Candies, Kelly Clarkson, The Gorrillaz, Eric West, Koneko (my old band boy george likes) etc. and before I knew it (minutes) an administrator had erased the whole thing (after I noted it was unfinished). Thinking I just needed to link it to some of the other stubs I began to do that and reload it. But then I was told I would not be allowed to edit anymore for doing so. I find this hostile. It is one thing to just write "hi im rob and I have a big thumb", but I am a little known designer, and just thought it would be nice to share my info, especially being from Ohio.... I figure it might be neat for kids to see you CAN become something NOW and go somewhere. My impression of Wikipedia is the ability to offer randomn &amp; valid information that would be hard to find otherwise. say the guy who picked the alligator for Lacoste, or the person who invented Aqua net. I understand that is could be considered tacky to write about oneself, and I could easily hire someone to do it......but I just thought it would be fine.</p>
<p>Anyhow I just found the reply to be hostile and rude, especially since I was writing a professional and responsible piece. I am not Madonna, but I assumed being linked to all these people and doing valid work makes it ok? ( I was not trying to do some myspace type profile) I have noted the forum for being listed and I do fall under.....</p>

I have read the afforementioned article. I find being more well known than a professor to be a bit of a strange concept. I can't think of any famous professors offhand. But I sure can find other people mentioned on here that I have no knowledge of. I feel that this action is a bit hostile... especially after noting that the article is unfinished.</p>
<p>I have found the following:</p>
<p>1. Multiple features in popular culture publications such as Vogue, GQ, Elle, FHM or national newspapers</p>
<p>Which I have done. and as stated I planned to finish the article. ( My Work has been presented in VICE magazine, Elle girl, Teen Vogue, numerous publications of Fader, and Complex, etc. and I will be happy to show tears verifying this.) It is also published on billboards for akademiks, prps is worn by the gorillaz (a band) for their videos, and is currently being requested by Eric West, among other names. Is this not enough?</p>
<p>Also. I have styled Kelly Clarkson for Candies ads.</p>
<p>ALSO. I contributed work to the band Koneko, Who has a cd out (Yes I doubt it has sold 50,000 copies), BUT it is an interest of Theo of the Luna chicks, and Moby. And Boy George himself has expressed enthusiasm in the band. Is this not enough?</p>
<p>I have also noted. this article located under "autobiography"</p>
<p>2. "It is a social faux pas to write about yourself", according to Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia's founder. [1] You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest.</p>
<p>I can easily hire someone else to write it for me if that is all that is required. I know certain other "famed" people on here who have done so.</p>
<p>Finally, personally, I would be interested in knowing who chose to stick the Crocodile on a lacoste shirt. Who Chanel's right hand girl was. Or who invented Aqua Net. I thought the point of Wikipedia was valid &amp; randomn information. Not having to be Madonna in order to plant a flag. I planned to finish my small piece in a professional manner, as I started.</p>
<p>If Wikipedia does not desire my profile that is fine. Thank you. Joshua S. Amos</p>
<p>ps. you CAN also google some of my work."</p>
<p><br />
I guess I was just curious as to if I am way out of line for putting this up. Or If there is just hostility in the wikipedia environment. I just did not realize the amount of notoriety necessary to be in wikipedia? If I am out of line I apologize. Thanks, Josh xtruthlovex</p>

<dd>Josh, Wikipedia has a rule about not including your original research, but you could reference other people's research for your article. It's not generally good form to write an article about yourself, but if you make an article that is encyclopedic, well researched and well referenced, it's possible to write about almost any subject. Try writing a few articles on other people first, to get the hang of it, and wait a while on the Joshua Amos article. Maybe someone else will start one in the meantime. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 05:11, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">"Global Warming" (GW) article problems</span></h3>
<p>The following is an edited version of my previous request, because I understand better now how this forum works...A "<a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabal.html" title="Cabal">cabal</a>" of editors is not allowing the article on <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, and to a lessor extent, related articles such as <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming_controversy.html" title="Global warming controversy">global warming controversy</a>, to be made more neutral in spite of repeated and very reasonable efforts by other editors. The group that is blocking these efforts appears to be advocates of the theory of human-induced global warming. The editors who believe the current articles are unnecessarily biased appear to be on both sides of the issue. In spite of community dicussion, any edits to the main articles or placement of the "POV" tag are usually immediately deleted. Furthermore, the censoring editors often respond to the discussions with pejorative, personal, emotional, or other types of inappropriate comments (for example, see James S' response below). One of the primary offendors, in my and at least one other editor's opionion (see <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a> discussion page) is a Wikipedea administrator named William Connelly.</p>
<p>Specific request: Please review the discussion pages and edit histories for <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming.html" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming_controversy.html" title="Global warming controversy">global warming controversy</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_Fear_532b.html" title="State of Fear">State of Fear</a>, and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Crichton_1cc6.html" title="Michael Crichton">Michael Crichton</a>, and any other related pages to see if my objection has merit. If you believe that it does, please ask William Connelly and the other censors to allow the community of editors to make the article more neutral in line with Wikipedia policy and standards. If this fails, request that the administrator in question and the other complicit editors receive appropriate sanctions.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Irish censors</span></h3>
<p>There are several censors/revisionists on Wikipedia who are determined to delete or gut anythign they personally do not agree with or like. One of these is an editor named <b>Demiurge</b> whose relentless attempts at censorship, blocked only when he is caught red-handed by third party Wikipedians, continues unabated. Please review his attempts to delete my additions to the Tim Pat Coogan wikipage. Evidently he is not the only one.</p>
<p>Demiurge is an Irish censor and a Catholic apologist who has attempted to delete edits to pages as various as <b>Ante Pavelic</b>, <b>Tim Pat Coogan</b>, <b>pre-Code</b> (related, ironically, to movie censorship in the USA by the Catholic church), <b>Eamon de Valera</b> (refugee policy during WWII), and many others. Is this individual going to be permitted to censor, delete, edit, sanitize, gut, or whatever he cares to do, with no one stopping him???</p>
<p>This is a very black harbinger for Wikipedia, and its helplessness to block abusive editors, and certainly administrators (which Demiurge is not yet, fortunately, but he will certainly attempt to become one). 70.19.67.28 22:23, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Do to me heavy work load at my job I have to pass this one off I'm afraid. Here is the request from my talk page and an e-mail that was sent to me.</p>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I thank you very much for your help offer. I didn't know I had a talk page. I prefer communicating by email because I all ready have to many places to check for messages each day. Don't you. I don't know if I need to look here for your response, or my talk page or someother place else. If you respond to me you might send me an email letting me know where to find your reply. I apologize for being such a pain in the ass. But it really would help newcomers if there was a single Wikipedia FAQ that newcomers to Wikipedia couldn't miss. I think I am going to post this suggestion on Mr. Wales' talk page.</p>
<p>I have a lot of patience, a lot of time, and a lot of determination--a lot more than the average person. Wikipedia loses a lot of talent by being so esoteric.</p>
<p>Warmest and kindest regards, Michael D. Wolok</p>
<p>The E-mail sent to me</p>
<p>Hi Aeon,</p>
<p>Thanks for emailing me back, and for offering your help. I need to get other editors involved in the Wikipedia entry "Many Worlds Interpretation." And I need someone to help walk me through the process for requesting mediation. Lethe deletes in entirety whatever I add to the entry. And he tells everyone else to do the same.</p>
<p>Even if you know nothing about physics, you can understand what I am trying to do, and why I am trying to do it. In the 1920s, Neils Bohr and Warner Heisenberg created a theory we know today as Quantum Mechanics. Quantum Mechanics seemed to have some queer features that made it different from all previous scientific theories. For example, every other scientific theory is completely deterministic. Quantum mechanics is not a deterministic theory. According to quantum mechanics certain things seem to happen randomly such as the exact moment particles decay. In response to this randomness, Einstein said, "God does not place dice with the universe." Another strange fact of quantum mechanics is sometimes light acts like a wave and sometimes it acts like a particle. Likewise according to quantum mechanics, sometimes electrons act like a wave and sometimes they act like a particle. Einstein argued with Bohr and Heisenberg. He said, quantum mechanics is likely an incomplete theory, that with better understanding of the universe we would eventually eliminate the randomness of quantum mechanics. The theory that Bohr and Heisenberg created had other problems. Together Bohr and Heisenberg came up with an interpretation of quantum mechanics that addressed these issues. This interpretation by Bohr and Heisenberg became known as "the standard model" or "the Copenhagen Interpretation." This interpretation by Bohr and Heisenberg had a few problems. One, it proposed there is no such thing as objective reality between measurements. Einstein was very critical of this contention. He said the moon exists whether people look at it or not, that humans are not necessary for the universe to exist. The Copenhagen Interpretation had many other problems as well such as how to define the concept of measurement, why measurement should effect reality, where to draw the line between the microscopic world where quantum mechanics appears true, and the macroscopic world where it doesn't. The Copenhagen Interpretation led to a famous paradox called "Schrodinger's Cat Paradox." In the end, Richard Feynman a famous physicist who refined quantum mechanics said, "You are not going to be able to understand quantum mechanics, nobody can." But as time went on, physicists stopped looking at the philosophical problems the Copenhagen Interpretation seemed to present. The theory worked, and as far as most physicists were concerned that is all that mattered.</p>
<p>At this point, somebody by the name of Hugh Everett came up with another interpretation of quantum mechanics. According to the Copenhagen Interpretation our universe is the only universe, and nature just takes one quantum pathway out of a near infinite number of equally good quantum pathways. According to the Copenhagen Interpretation, when the universe comes to a fork in the road, it randomly takes one path or the other, it doesn't take both. According to Hugh Everett's Interpretation, when the universe meets a fork in the road with two equally good quantum pathways open to it, it takes both pathways, not just one pathway. This implies the universe splits at each quantum juncture. That is why Hugh Everett's theory is called: "The Many Worlds Interpretation." Now, if Hugh Everett's theory just predicted the existence of countless extra universes we can't ever detect, it would violate Ocaam's razor and it would be a silly theory.</p>
<p>However, a remarkable thing happens if Hugh Everett's theory is true: all the philosophical problems created by the Copenhagen Interpretation automatically evaporate. It is not so much that Hugh Everett's theory proposes an alternative answer to these problems, but rather the philosophical problems don't arise in the first place. If Hugh Everett's theory is true, it answers Einstein's main objections to the theory, it makes theory deterministic like all other scientific theories including special and general relativity. If Hugh Everett's theory is true, it restores objective reality between measurements. It eliminates the need to define what constitutes a measurement. It eliminates the need for the universe to have observers. It does away with the need for human consciousness. It solves the Schrodinger Cat Paradox. It more simply and naturally explains the double-slit experiment. It does away with the need for the "principle of complimenatrity" and simply and naturally explains wave-particle duality. Just about every physicist agrees with these claims. Max Tegmark a famous proponent of Hugh Everett's theory agreed with these claims. I want to put them in the article in the form of a list, because these are the reasons why those who favor Hugh Everett's theory do so.</p>
<p>Lethe doesn't like Hugh Everett's theory. He sees no problem with the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics. A lot of physicists agree with Lethe. The philosophical problems Einstein, Schrodinger, Dirac and Feynman had with the theory don't bother them. Einstein said, Bohr and Heisenberg brainwashed a generation of physicists.</p>
<p>So we are at an impasse. I think the article needs to do a better job explaining what I wrote here. I think the article should include a list of all the advantages proponents of the theory claim for the theory. And I think the article should note that Hugh Everett left the field of physics because the Many Worlds Interpretation was at first ridiculed and rejected by all who saw it. I think the article should include the fact that his theory started gaining popularity in the 1980s. As time passes it has gained more and more adherents. Today most cosmologists favor the theory. Today, it is considered a mainstream interpretation of quantum mechanics. Lethe doesn't want readers to know about this trend because it favors the theory, and Lethe opposes it.</p>
<p>I need your help to request moderation. As the article stands, now, it is essentially incomprehensible to the layman. No layman would gather the above from reading the existing article. I can't improve the article with Lethe deleting every single word I add, and disputing every single claim I make even though I supply ample support for all my claims.. If you read the article's talk page you will understand the hostility I am up against. As it stands now the entry is biased against the Many Worlds Interpretation because it does such a poor job listing the reasons why those who favor it do so.</p>
<p>Presumably, you can help me by bringing in more editors, and by helping me request moderation.</p>
<p>Warmest and kindest regards, Michael</p>
<p>PS. If I had the support of other editors I would completely rewrite the article so it could be understood by everyone. I would like to note, that the article does not need to contain a single equation, since every equation found in Hugh Everett's Many Worlds Interpretation is also found in the Copenhagen Interpretation and vice versa. Of course, physics students may be curious how Everett interprets various equations in quantum mechanics, so they can be left in for physics students. But any bright physics student ought to be able to read my explanation of Hugh Everett's theory, and figure out for himself how to interpret the standard equations of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>I have a special interest in this article because in the 1980s, I independently discovered Hugh Everett's theory. I had never heard Hugh Everett or his theory. I imagined the nascent universe being in the exact same situation as Buridan's ass. I asked myself, how could a perfectly logical universe devoid of free will choose one single path over a near infinite number of equally good paths. I then asked myself what would happen if the universe took every branch open to it like electricity takes every branch open to it. I immediately realized if this was the case, then all the philosophical problems posed by the Copenhagen Interpretation would automatically disappear. Many years later I learned Hugh Everett had proposed this exact idea in 1958. I discovered this by stumbling across Michael Clive Price's famous Internet Hugh Everett FAQ. It just so happens that Michael Clive Price is another editor involved in trying to edit this Wikipedia entry. I think by-and-large, Price and I agree on just about everything.</p>
<p>The user is Michael D. Wolok. Sorry about passing the buck this but my work load has increased for the next two weeks ar so amd as a result I wont be able to help him with this. <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006">Aeon</a> 22:55, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">A Request for an Advocate</span></h3>
<p>In the <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falun_Gong_9fb1.html" title="Falun Gong">Falun Gong</a> article, a user blanked an entire section without warning. <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">As defined on the Wikipedia vandalism page, blanking a section in that manner without explanation is vandalism</a>. I restored the section, and the user in question continued removing it, albeit with an ex post facto explanation. Restoring vandalism is not a violation of the Three-revert rule.</p>
<p>I tried to move the discussion about retention of the section onto the talk page; however, before that could be resolved, I was blocked by <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Samuel Blanning</a> who clearly had not investigated the matter before doing so. Mr. Blanning seems to have his own personal rules for deciding whether something is vandalism -- as can be seen in his comments on my user page -- notwithstanding his personal rules directly contradict with written Wikipedia rules. The <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falun_Gong_9fb1.html" title="Falun Gong">Falun Gong</a> article is in the midst of a great deal of partisan back-and-forth, and I was only trying to prevent some of the incessant vandalism and blanking which has gone on there. (I, personally, have no interest in the topic and knew nothing about the organization until the incident at the White House the other day.)</p>
<p>I think Mr. Blanning has overstepped his authority -- rather than resolving the matter, which could have been done so simply by leaving a comment on my page, he chose the more showy and self-inflating route of blocking me. Additionally, he posted a pejorative comment about me on my user talk page. Quite simply, I think Mr. Blanning has let a little bit of authority go to his head, and I believe he should be cautioned to be more circumspect and work towards a resolution in the future.</p>
<p>I was merely trying to follow the rules to prevent vandalism and, in my opinion, Mr. Blanning needlessly assumed the role of the martinet while violating the rules in the process.

User "Mahogany" is completely inappropriate to involve him/herself in this process, as that user has posted comments on my talk page like "you were perfectly in the wrong" and "you shouldn't complain"; "Mahogany" is showing a patent lack of objectivity with comments like that and thus demonstrates why he/she is completely wrong to step into this process.

<p>Im writing this under a sockpuppet for another account. Ive a user who appears to be picking on me. I think this behaviour has developed into wikistalking as laid out at <a href="../../../h/a/r/Wikipedia%7EHarassment_9843.html" title="Wikipedia:Harassment">Wikistalking</a>. I'm a new user but have made a lot of edits, seemingly on this persons "territory". This appears to be where the problem originated.</p>
<p>There are a few problems in my view:</p>
<ul>
<li>The problems raised by this user with my work do appear on face value to have merit, but are a result of my inexperience. This user doesnt subject anyone else to the same scrutiny or same standards.</li>
<li>Since making my edits to "his" articles, (which arguably raised the articles to a higher acedemic standard), he has been on my back constantly. He has discovered "problems" with spelling, grammar, capitalisation of filenames uploaded, "copyright infringement", my "plagarism", my personality, etc. This has all been played out on the respective talk pages.</li>
<li>As part of this behaviour he has introduced two deliberate errors into articles. One I challenged him on, generating work for myself in doing so, the other remains in the article.</li>
<li>He is constantly hovering over edits I make, clearly watching my contributions page. For example he had reported "copyright infringement" in the images I uploaded yesterday within thirty minutes.</li>
<li>He had threatened me with "you'll have some editors down on your back once they pick up on it [the supposed copyright infringement](and they usually do without being told as they monitor what's uploaded."</li>
<li>Despite me asking him why he is picking on me, and involving an admin, he refuses to explain or stop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken individually these actions may seem reasonable on their own, but as part of a campaign to harass it is becoming old and making my experience editing wikipedia a nightmare. I would like arbitration or something to make him stop this. Please help, thanks. SockPuppetFluffy999 10:55, 25 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Assistance/guidance is requested on this article. The problem relates to linking to a blog that is, IMO. clearly unsuitable for use as a source, according to wikipedia guidelines. I removed the parts of the article that relied on unreliable sources, precipitating an edit war and evenutal page protection (the reverting had been happening for months before I got involved), and a huge discussion... not the first either... as a glance through the talk page article will show. The problem site is <a href="http://www.xenisucks.com" class="external text" title="http://www.xenisucks.com" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and the site owners/users are aware of the Wikipedia article, as can be seen <a href="http://xenisucks.com/comments.php?y=06&amp;m=05&amp;entry=entry060505-054150" class="external text" title="http://xenisucks.com/comments.php?y=06&amp;m=05&amp;entry=entry060505-054150" rel="nofollow">here</a>, which is an article created right after my first edit. The nature of the site is obvious, as is the attitude of its inhabitants. The justification for keeping a link to it appears to be that "it shows she is criticised on the internet". I consider this unacceptable, since it can be used to justify the inclusion of any grudge blog or hate site run by anyone at all. I have repeatedly asked for the statements in the article to be backed up by more reliable sources... none have been forthcoming. The discussions on the talk page are going nowhere (and have gone nowhere in the past from the Talk Page archives), and I need advice on how to handle this situation. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 22:53, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I am a disabled user who feels that another user is bullying me, following me to areas I work on and reversing anything I do without comment or consideration.</p>
<p>This is getting me down. Whatever I do, there he is. And he will not answer my appeals to stop or to answer my questions. Indeed his suggestion was that I do not use Wikipedia. I know he will be reading this because I can only assume he uses my User Page to track my work.</p>
<p>In desperation I am using my User Page to identify this user, as I am so frustrated by what he does. I am resisting the frustration to follow him around deleting his work, but it is time to decide whether Wikipedia is the right place for me, or whether it is home to people who feel right to push others around.</p>

<p>There has been a dispute over a nickname for <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_Atlantic_University_1a87.html" title="Florida Atlantic University">Florida Atlantic University</a>. Some people are arguing for the inclusion of the nickname, while others are arguing that the nickname of the university doesn't belong on this page, but another page or the <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickname.html" title="Nickname">nickname</a> page. The dispute centers around "Find Another University." The issue has been discussed on the talk page for what seems like weeks now, and we have been unable to come to a consensus. Everyday someone new deletes the nickname and then it is reverted. The discussion is actually starting to get a little hostile. I believe both sides agree that we need to proceed with the next step in the dispute resolution process, but nobody seems to be sure what that is or how to accomplish this. I would really appreciate an outsiders help to put us on the right track to solving the dispute.

<p>I'm not sure that this is the right place to take this problem, but if it isn't, I'd appreciate a nudge in the right direction. There's a dispute at <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Summer_Rain_a04d.html" title="Operation Summer Rain">Operation Summer Rain</a> on whether the correct title of the article is <i>Operation Summer Rain</i> or <i>Operation Summer Rains</i>. One administrator El_C continues to insist there <i>is</i> a concensus when there is not, and is moving the article to <i>Operation Summer Rains</i> when the name was <i>Operation Summer Rain</i> before the dispute arose. I believe that under <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7EConsensus_8a50.html" title="WP:Consensus">WP:Consensus</a> the article should remain at <i>Rain</i> until a concensus is reached, but El_C has made it clear he will ban me if I correct the situation. Since my overriding concern is seeing the situation handled properly, I'd rather stick around and see what can be done, though I'm not sure there's anything. I must admit, I'm tempted to revert it on the principle that I'm doing the right thing, but I fear on an ethical level that may violate <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">don't disrupt wikipedia to make a point</a>. I have personally disavowed a position on whether the article <i>should</i> be moved, only insisting that it not be moved without concensus. I'm really lost on this, I guess I'm a bit of a n00b.

<p>User: LionO is taking out clear facts from the <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Lieberman_34c5.html" title="Joe Lieberman">Joe Lieberman</a> page-- basically anything that paints Lieberman in anything other than the light JL would want. He seems uninterested in negotiation and definitely uninterested in consensus. The mediation cabal apparently has a long wait, and even if I end up using it, an advocate for my position would be useful.</p>
<p>Basically, he needs someone to convince him that it is wrong just remove things that numerous editors have found appropriate, and that are factual, just because he doesn't like them.</p>
<p>I'm asking here rather than in mediation because there may be a shorter wait here, and having someone knowledgeable on my side would be very, very useful in finding a way to solve this quickly. The edit war that's going on should not be occurring, but I feel that if I cease and he continues that the JL page will look like it was written by JL's press secretary.

When a particular editor respectfully disagreed with Amerique's arguments, he/she filed a RFA against him that was ultimately rejected by 4 arbitors. More recently, Amerique's language has become increasingly more hostile as he/she is attempting to assemble a team editors bent on pushing a biased POV for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Riverside_00b7.html" title="University of California, Riverside">University of California, Riverside</a> article (see <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">user:Amerique</a>TALK).

<p>There are two editors to this article, UCRGrad and Insert-Belltower, possibly alumni, who insist on their own entirely negative POV presentation of most facts associated with the university. There is ample evidence on the article's talk page<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:University_of_California%2C_Riverside" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:University_of_California%2C_Riverside" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> showing how it is impossible to reason with them, as neither will budge and both support the other's sophoric arguments for keeping the article as negative POV as possible. They have, in effect, established ownership of their edits, as even attempts to save some information but change its wording have been met with adamant and uncompromising resistance. A few weeks ago I filed an RFARB on one of them but this was dismissed as no prior attempts at formal dispute resolution were made. The ARBCOM also pointed out there was an obvious history of contention on "both sides," although to the extent there are "sides" I would say there is the pov of those two editors and everyone else who ever commented on the neutrality of the article. I kept away from the article for awhile, but have returned to it to council others on how to approach those two editors. Since then, I myself have re-engaged with them on the article's talk page, and request 3rd party advocacy in articulating a more neutral point of view for the UC Riverside article.--<a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmerique_6b89.html" title="User:Amerique">Amerique</a> 21:45, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Of course, these allegations are seriously untrue. FOUR Wikipedia arbitrators (admins) reviewed the article formally, and wrote:</dd>

<li>"besides, a quick read of the talk pages and article history shows that a number of editors on all sides [that is, including Amerique] have been stubborn, hard to work with and contentious"</li>

<li>"the UC Riverside article is "a pretty decent college article"</li>

<dd>UCRGrad, please don't take this the wrong way, but it is not very appropriate for you to post this here. People come here to get in contact with volunteers who will help them better understand their options and where they stand within a conflict on Wikipedia. When an Advocate takes on a particular case, their #1 priority is to understand where their Charge is coming from, and then to investigate what they can do per Wikipedia policy. It does not matter whether or not their allegations are "seriously untrue." If they are then it will come out in the end, and either way they will be better in tune with what they can and cannot attain under policy.</dd>

<p>I am in a dispute with LarryMac about the Sonicstage Wiki. Please help! I have added an external link <a href="http://www.42hours.org" class="external text" title="http://www.42hours.org" rel="nofollow">42hours.org</a> which he insists on deleting. I argue that the link is extremely relevant to users of Sonicstage -- it describes a critical flaw in the product which has affected many users. He argues that it is not NPOV and is original research. We are having a debate on his talk page <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarryMac_8295.html#Why_do_you_keep_deleting_a_relevant_link_on_Sonicstage.3F" title="User talk:LarryMac">User_talk:LarryMac#Why_do_you_keep_deleting_a_relevant_link_on_Sonicstage.3F</a>. I think this problem is a fundamental flaw of the Wikipedia model -- a product can be described on its Wiki, and links can be made to the company website, but links to critical websites are not allowed. Surely that rule would turn Wikipedia into the friend of major corporations rather than a tool for users?--~~~~darianb</p>

<dd>Please note that many others have also deleted this link, so this dispute is not simply with me. Additionally, the topic was addressed on the article's Talk page, which most contributors indicating "not relevant." --<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarryMac_6ce3.html" title="User:LarryMac">LarryMac</a> 14:41, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>page in question <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice#Criticisms" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice#Criticisms" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice#Criticisms</a> And almost all other Democratic or Republican official wiki's where there does appear to be, in the words of HRC, "A vast right-winged conspiracy."</p>
<p>The main issue is that there was some attempt to introduce the opinions of the Black Community view of Condi Rice to the article. At every edit there has been reverting, name calling, racisim, and even more reverting. The article has lost all reason but it can be said it never had a NPOV. How can "Anyone" in the Bush Administration not have "ANY" criticism which is how the article was when it opened evidently. I don't care how loved you are by the people, if you are a political figure, folks are going to have issues so to not have any listed was clearly a POV issue that needed to be addressed. At this point the matter has dissolved rapidly into reverting back and forth and the matter seems hopeless.--216Cali 03:32, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
