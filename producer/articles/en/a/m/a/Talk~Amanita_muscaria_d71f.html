<p>In "Plants of the Gods" (Hoffman, Schultes, et al) it is claimed that the Fly Agaric has a long tradition of cultural use in Japan; supposedly, its use is connected with the tengu deity. And then I remember reading in "Soma" that Wasson first ingested the mushroom in Japan with some native mycologists. I'm a little too lazy to re-order the books from the library, but I think this line needs to be investigated more throughly. At the least, it would help to make sense of the whole Mario Bros. thing...</p>

<p>Reply to above: That's because the ibotenic acid is converted to muscimol by cooking. Muscimol doesn't produce the toxic effects of ibotenic acid. Also, I wonder if amanita var. guessowii is mistaken for amanita var. formosa in the US?

<p>I've just procured myself a nice specimen of amanita and all this talk of people dying and stuff is kinda starting to give me second thoughts about trying it! I've taken psilocybe shrooms on several occasions and would like to know if anyone can give me some sort of comparative description of the effects?

<p>==&gt;You can detoxify this mushroom by boiling it in water 7-10 minutes and then discarding the water. This also removes any hallucinogens.&#160;:) Failing to detoxify the mushroom will cause liver damage! You can get high on these but the damage you do to yourself with the associated toxins make it unrecommended for that purpose. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebivort_3273.html" title="User:Debivort">Debivort</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/b/User_talk%7EDebivort_810f.html" title="User talk:Debivort">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__Debivort_924a.html" title="Special:Contributions/ Debivort">contribs</a>) 05:18, 7 March 2006.</small></p>
<ul>
<li>This statement "Failing to detoxify the mushroom will cause liver damage!" is given without reference and is contradictory to properly cited information. I suggest this information is therefore incorrect, and the author Debivort has made the mistake of confusing the liver-damaging effects of the toxin Amanitin, which although found in other members of the Amanita genus of mushrooms such as Phalloides (death cap), is not found in Amanita Muscaria. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKev_0919.html" title="User:Kev">Kev</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/v/User_talk%7EKev_5fe8.html" title="User talk:Kev">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__Kev_1746.html" title="Special:Contributions/ Kev">contribs</a>) 11.49, 4 March 2007.</small>

<li>Um, I'm pretty sure I never wrote that.

<p>Don't believe Strahlenberg understood the problem right. The reason for drinking urine of an Amanita-Eater is not that the mushroom can't be afforded (in fact they can be found everywhere). The reason is, that its quite dangerous to eat the mushroom, but it isnt dangerous to drink the urin. Plus: in a way which isnt exactly clear the hallucinogen effect of the urin is even stronger. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForeigner_7848.html" title="User:Foreigner">Foreigner</a> 14:49, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>espacially: <i>... Eine Variante bei indigenen sibirischen Völkern besteht darin, den Urin des Schamanen zu trinken, nachdem dieser Fliegenpilz konsumiert hat.

Ibotensäure ist giftiger und hat eine geringere Rauschwirkung als Muscimol. Dieser Vorgang kann drei bis vier mal wiederholt werden. Das Urintrinken gilt als weniger gefährlich als der Konsum des Pilzes selbst, da die enthaltenen Gifte wie Muscarin vom Körper erst abgebaut und dann ausgeschieden werden.</i></p>

<p>My own interest in Amanita muscaria is culinary. My interest was piqued many years ago when I read a field guide that said that while the mushroom is poisonous, in Japan it is pickled and eaten as food. After reading this I called my mycologist friend, David Arora, author of Mushrooms Demystified, and All the Rain Promises, and more. David lists AAmanita muscaria as poisonous in the current editions of his books. The first reference book David turned to after I called him said that the mushroom is poisonous, but that the author had a friend who eats it regularly with no ill effects. Stating that Amanita muscaria is poisonous, but that it is commonly eaten as food by a friend or by people somewhere else, is a recurring feature of books on mushrooms. As early as 1900, George Atkins wrote in his book, Studies of American Fungi, that while the mushroom is “deadly as ordinarily found,” it is eaten “. . . as food in parts of France &amp; Russia, and it has been eaten repeatedly in certain localities in this country without harm.”</p>
<p>Foreign authors write in the same vein. A recent Lithuanian field guide states that the mushroom is poisonous, but that it is eaten in the mountains of France and Austria. The most popular Italian field guide, Bruno Cetto’s I funghi dal vero, volume 1 says that muscaria is poisonous, but that it is eaten cooked and pickled in Russia, France, and in the Lake Garda region of the Italian Alps.</p>
<p>So, what is going on? First, there is the old semantic problem that by custom all mushrooms are labeled poisonous, whether they might make you a little sick or whether they might send you to your grave. Also, no effort is made to clarify whether a mushroom’s ill effects are countered by cooking — which they often are. While field guides are accurate guides to classification, in the area of edibility, they can be more of a guide to local preference and prejudice than scientifically accurate.</p>

<dd>There are some Amanitas which are edible, and maybe some geographic variations which are edibel too, however for the most part teh fly agaric is hallucinogenic as well as moderately poisonous unless you spend a deal of time preparing it (which can be done), however why would you bother unless you wanted to hallucinate?

<p>Hi All - I've rearranged the images a bit: 1) keeping at most one, right-justified photo per section. Ideally all of these should be relevant to their sections, and are currently not, except for the variety americana image which shows color diversity. 2) I removed the gill image which because of color ballance issues, fallaciously suggested that A muscaria has orange gills. 3) All other images I moved into a gallery a the bottom of the article. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebivort_3273.html" title="User:Debivort">Debivort</a> 19:29, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Fair enough. I have been working in other areas and been informed that galleries are discouraged on pages. I agree the old bit started to look messy. I figure the 4 images showing progression in shape would be good to put under description, where they are realted to the prose there rather than way down the bottom. cheers <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasliber_bea8.html" title="User:Casliber">Cas Liber</a> 20:16, 7 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know about whether galleries are discouraged or not, but the gallery cannot go there - it overlaps with the taxonomic boxes on even high res browsers. I would be completely happy if it was deleted also. It also was placed under a section name that had no associated text, and these images, without better annotation cannot stand on their own as a growth series. It can stand on its own if labeled "image gallery." I'm not a big fan of the image of the lady with the basket - she distracts from the mushrooms - but it seems fitting in its current section.
<dl>
<dd>I find the boxes which go underneath the taxoboxes frustating as they crowd the pages. Alright then. Realistically if you also agree the gallery should go then go it should. One of the photos displays Fly agarics in various stages of growth and as a single most discriptive piccy should stay somewhere.

<p>Not sure what's been happening here over the last few days, but I'm afraid I don't find it an improvement. The layout of the images on 5th Oct looked pretty good, with some visual interest. Now, after an abortive attempt at a gallery, several good images have been taken off without discussion in favour of some that aren't so well composed (eg the 'troop' image), and most are now simply plonked down the right hand side. I agree that a gallery ought to be discouraged, but would much prefer to revert the layout to something like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amanita_muscaria&amp;oldid=79614002" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amanita_muscaria&amp;oldid=79614002" rel="nofollow">this</a>.

<dd>I initiated the image reformatting when 4 new ones appeared left-justified in a floating div right at the top. It was cluttered and interfered with readibility. The version you link to is OK, w.r.t. images, but frankly, while they are all nice images, they do very little to increase the information content on the page. Wikipedia is not a picture archive, and at some point, an article should reach a steady state in its number of images per word of text, if the new images are redundant to each other. What is the argument against galleries? <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebivort_3273.html" title="User:Debivort">Debivort</a> 09:10, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry Michael, I agree with Debivort, the images on the version you have there are all of the same thing; mature flattened Fly Agarics. Thus where image space is at a premium we have severl images doing the job of one. I know the troop one isn't great but it shows the caps in various stages of development nicely from 'button' to semi-mature.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<p>Maybe the best thing is for everyone to list here the priority of images and how many they'd like to see on the page. I like the page as is now but would like to find some other colour variant images or iconic/religious ethnographic depictions and a mix of right and left justified. To do this the varieties bit will need to be beefed up.</p>
<p>Also the best thing in terms of galleries, I think, is a link to Wikipedia Commons gallery of Amanita muscaria (where there are <i>loads</i> of photos), this promotes Commons. Anyway, it is good to see we're all keeping up the dialogue here as there are no easy answers. cheers <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasliber_bea8.html" title="User:Casliber">Cas Liber</a> 10:03, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>"Amanita muscaria is widely thought to be the Soma talked about in Rig Veda of India"</i></p>
<p>"Widely thought" by whom? One reference – to Wasson. Does that constitute "widely thought"? In fact, there are quite a few Vedic scholars who disagree with Wasson on this, so the above statement really needs to be qualified and better referenced.</p>
<p><i>"John Marco Allegro argues in The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross that the Christian religion is derived from a sex and psychedelic mushroom cult."</i></p>
<p>This isn't quite as egregious, however, it leaves out the fact that Allegro's theory is considered to be a fringe idea among the vast majority of biblical scholars.

<p>I have removed this section because it contains misleading/unsourced information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Part of the reasons behind the medical misinformation surrounding A. muscaria is due to the fact that many people who have presented to physicians with stated "mushroom poisoning" were generally thought to have ingested Amanita phalloides. They then usually promptly administer atropine, which would be fine if one had indeed ingested this toxic mushroom. But it only exacerbates toxic effects of the raw A. muscaria several hundredfold, sometimes resulting in the death of the patient (and this only infrequently). Known deaths recorded from it are rare. These have usually been children who have eaten large amounts of the raw mushroom. One child died only after eating almost two dozen large raw specimens.</p>

<li>iconic toadstool, loads to write on toxicity, religion, taxonomy etc. Though article a bit unwieldy currently. <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasliber_bea8.html" title="User:Casliber">Cas Liber</a> 03:10, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>definitely iconic, and much of the article is in pretty good shape, with copious references. Some of the sections could use a rewrite to make them more clear and concise. Still some missing into in a few places. More on biology and classification is called for – so far, the taxobox is the only place where the mushroom's mycorrhizal nature is even mentioned! Some of the statements about the hypotheses of Wasson and Allegro definitely need to be balanced, as these are actually highly controversial among Vedic and Biblical scholars, respectively. Also needing to be mentioned are a couple of reports of indigenous <i>Amanita muscaria</i> use in the New World Subarctic, among the <a href="../../../o/j/i/Ojibway.html" title="Ojibway">Ojibway</a> and the <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogrib.html" title="Dogrib">Dogrib</a> (though the latter report is questionable).</li>
<li>The article has gotten into much better shape in the last 6 months or so now that the edibility aspect has settled down. <a href="../../../d/e/b/User%7EDebivort_3273.html" title="User:Debivort">Debivort</a> 05:08, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'll help out with as much of this as I have time for. Specifically, I'll redo the description and classification sections. I'll add some discussion of its microscopic characters and its place as part of <i>Amanita</i> section <i>Amanita</i> (<i>A. muscaria</i>, <i>A. pantherina</i>, <i>A. gemmata</i>, and the like). The section on mythology and religion is in strong need of a rewrite (right now, its just a glorified list). I should note also that the only region in the world where there's been documented and confirmed observation of indigenous use of <i>Amanita muscaria</i> is in the Arctic and Subarctic regions of the Old World (mostly Siberia, but also Lappland). Also, some unconfirmed observations from the New World Subarctic. All the rest is basically speculative and controversial. Finally, I think there should be a short section on the legal status of <i>A. muscaria</i> in different countries, but not restricted just to American law the way the section was previously. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 03:41, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Stuff similar to the following keeps sprouting in the article:</p>

<dd>Deaths from A. muscaria are extremely rare. A historical journal article reported 2 fatalities occurring in North America. Although it is unlikely fatalities would occur with modern medical treatment.</dd>

<p>Which is probably true. I'm having trouble finding sources for the statement, though. The referenced paper is from 1897, which means it doesn't provide support for the first sentence, makes the second one a bit misleading, and provides no support for the third.

<p>The February collaboration on this article resulted in some definite improvements. However, I still think its a B-class article, as it has some significant gaps. The section on psychoactive properties really needs expansion (there's been plenty published on the <i>A. muscaria</i> "experience"), there should be something on its legal status (and not just in the USA), and the part on popular culture could use some expansion too (since only <i>contemporary</i> popular culture use is mentioned, and its use in popular art and symbolism is long-standing). Cultural history could also use a bit more fleshing out and the more dubious passages could use counter-balancing or even outright deletion. Even with these gaps, some good work was done over the last month. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 19:58, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
