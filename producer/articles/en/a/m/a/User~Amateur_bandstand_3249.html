<p><b>GarageBand</b> is an amateur musical punk rock band from <a href="../../../s/o/u/Southern_California_3bf5.html" title="Southern California">Southern California</a> consisting of Chris Amparo (<a href="../../../g/u/i/Guitar.html" title="Guitar">guitar</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lead_vocals.html" title="Lead vocals">lead vocals</a>), Delilah Koehler (<a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass.html" title="Bass">bass</a>), and Nick Friend (<a href="../../../d/r/u/Drums.html" title="Drums">drums</a>). The band was formed by Amparo in <a href="../../../o/c/e/Oceanside%2C_California_ce91.html" title="Oceanside, California">Oceanside, California</a> during January of 2006. According to Amparo, the name GarageBand comes from two sources: the fact that they started out in a garage and from the music editing computer program the band uses to produce their songs - <a href="../../../g/a/r/GarageBand_026a.html" title="GarageBand">GarageBand</a>, distributed by <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Computer_f26c.html" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a>.</p>
<p><br />
Ironically, the group does not perform shows or gigs. The whole idea behind the formation of the band was merely to record and produce Amparo's songs, thereby coming into an agreement within the trio that playing in venues of any kind was unnecessary. This idea worked out for the three since they were also uninterested in activites almost all bands take part in as far as touring and putting on shows. The fact that the three do not live in the same area also explains the reason why they do not perform shows or hardly get together to practice or <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jam.html" title="Jam">jam</a>. Amparo resides in <a href="../../../o/c/e/Oceanside%2C_California_ce91.html" title="Oceanside, California">Oceanside, California</a> and both Koehler and Friend reside in <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Bay%2C_California_206c.html" title="East Bay, California">East Bay, California</a>. Recording songs is a matter of simple colaboration with each other through the Internet. Each member records their respective music track and songs are finalized once Amparo collects each track and edits them together.</p>
<p><br />
In May of 2006 the band released their first album, <i><b>14 Area</b></i>. It consisted of 10 songs with tracks as <i><b>Jenny</b></i>, <i><b>Adam &amp; Eve</b></i>, and <i><b>Rules of Attraction</b></i> being frequent favorites from their small group of listeners. The band is known to freely distribute copies of the album at no charge to anyone requesting one. Because GarageBand has become an actual band in their own unique definition, they have not developed a reasonable sized audience. Albeit the fact, a small fan base is progressively developing within the listeners from their <a href="../../../m/y/s/Myspace.html" title="Myspace">Myspace</a> website where they originally debuted several songs from their album. This slow growth of listeners is known partly due to Amparo's way of songwriting. His songs have been linked with similarities of bands such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ramones_d4f9.html" title="The Ramones">The Ramones</a>, <a href="../../../%2B/4/4/%2B44.html" title="+44">+44</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/s/Dashboard_Confessional_df52.html" title="Dashboard Confessional">Dashboard Confessional</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simple_Plan_5b15.html" title="Simple Plan">Simple Plan</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blink-182.html" title="Blink-182">Blink-182</a>, (for most of their pop punk songs) and most notably the early albums of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Day_5412.html" title="Green Day">Green Day</a>.</p>

<p><b>Prior to Formation (2003 - 2006)</b></p>
<p>In 2003, Amparo collaborated with several friends to form a three person band, 14 Area. That name was chosen as sort of an homage to the place in which Amparo wrote several of his songs that now appear on GarageBand's <b>14 Area</b> album.</p>
<p>Amparo had worked in the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marine_Corps_50a5.html" title="Marine Corps">Marine Corps</a> base <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camp_Pendleton_ca56.html" title="Camp Pendleton">Camp Pendleton</a> for a small Navy Exchange Service (NEX) station that was located in the 14 area of Camp Pendleton. During work hours, Amparo would hum various melodies to himself and then translate them on his guitar that he usually stored in the break room. He would then write portions of songs with his guitar during his lunch break. Songs like <b>Jenny</b> (which at that time was named <b>Battle Scars</b> but then changed to "Jenny" in reference to a girl with that name of which the song was written for) and <b>Adam &amp; Eve</b> were supposedly written in the break room of the 14 area NEX station within 30 minutes, which was the amount of time allowed for lunch breaks.</p>
<p>The band regularly gathered in Amparo's garage or one of the other members' garage to practice his songs and cover songs. They did not perform shows, rather the formation was more motivated because of sheer boredom. Reflecting on that period, Amparo stated, "After I wrote those songs I really wanted to hear them live so I asked a couple friends if they would be interested in being in a band. They didn't really know how to be in a band let alone play the instruments of their choice so I had to mold them in that way. But honestly, I think I was just bored at the time and wanted something different so I thought that being in a band would be nice."</p>
<p>Being that his members were new to the whole experience and not quite musicians in their own right, the band slowly decayed and eventually broke up. "After a while we just didn't practice anymore. And when we did, we never played any of my songs mainly because the drummer couldn't keep up and there was a lot of goofing off with all of us. There was really no time where I was like, 'hey, I don't think we should be a band anymore.', you know? I think the point in which we never really mentioned about band practice was the point where we quietly said 'we're breaking up.'".</p>
<p>In 2004, Amparo had purchased a copy of <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Computer_f26c.html" title="Apple Computer">Apple Computer</a>'s <a href="../../../i/l/i/ILife_5448.html" title="ILife">iLife</a> which was the version that introduced <a href="../../../g/a/r/GarageBand_026a.html" title="GarageBand">GarageBand</a> - a software application that allows users to create a piece of music. With this, he recorded and produced most of his songs using his guitar and bass and prerecorded drum loops that the software provided.</p>
