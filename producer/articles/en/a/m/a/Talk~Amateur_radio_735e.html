<li>Sourcing and citations: while many facts quoted in the article may seem self-evident to Wikipedians who hold amateur licenses, they need to have their sources cited in order to meet WP:V. FCC amateur regulations, ARRL publications, etc. are all good resources to obtain such cites from.</li>
</ul>

<li>Future expansion: Need information on digital modes. This would also seem to lead to where the future of the hobby is headed, such as the potential for pmail and an RF amateur packet net.</li>

<p>I just noticed a troubling part: "...Hams led the development of packet radio, which has since been augmented..."</p>
<p>We hams have justly been accused of too much chest-pounding, and I fear it's being done in this claim. The AX.25 protocol, which was the first one used by hams, was extracted from the commercial X.25 protocol, which was already used on the air for commercial datacomm services for many years before hams started using it. It might be less of a fabrication to claim "hams were early adopters of packet radio, and derived the AX.25 protocol from the commercial X.25 protocol." We might be able to do some accurate chest-pounding with APRS, which I believe represents a tracking capability not otherwise available to the ordinary citizen.192.65.41.20 01:30, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It strikes me as a missed opportunity not to take advantage of the category mechanism is wikipedia for Hams to identify themselves on Wikipedia. I created a category Category:Amateur Radio Operator and stuck a link into this article as a way for people to find the category. I'd like to keep the category somewhere in the article as a way of familiarizing people with it. I looked for other categories that did something like this, such as hams, ham radio, and other terms, but didn't find any.

<li>As much as I find the history of amateur radio interesting, I don't think it's the best way to start this article. I also agree that it is very fragmented. Before working on it, I'd like to suggest that this section be split into a seperate article History of amateur radio, with the important moments in history briefly outlined in this main article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewjuren_cd32.html" title="User:Andrewjuren">Andrewjuren</a> 23:43, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>An article on the History of amateur radio may not be a bad idea. My concern is that the History section now is pretty much an outline as it is and could be expanded. As it stands now you could even get away with calling the History section a time line. If we make another article it will need to be expanded quite a bit. I would like an History of amateur radio article but not if its just going to be what we already have in this article. I do believe something on the history does need to be said in this article and I would not be against moving the History section to a better place within this article. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonym1ty_c12e.html" title="User:Anonym1ty">Anonym1ty</a> 15:47, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I put the smackdown on this whole passage. The last change in the history caught my eye and, in reading the changed passage, I also came across the "out of band" stuff.</p>
<p>The VFO bit, to me, aside from being elitist (IMHO) isn't the nut of the matter; it's that hams are NOT assigned a particular frequency as are users in other services (licensed or not).</p>
<p>As to out-of-band operations being "legal", well, MARS ain't out of band! MARS is MARS and has its own frequency assignments - could the editor be confusing MARS and the Armed Forces Day Communications Test?</p>
<p>As to the other part, yes, the US FCC does grant licensed amateurs the privilege of communicating with other FCC-regulated services <i>in an emergency</i>, but that's not spelled out by the editor. It's all in 97.111(a) ...</p>
<dl>
<dd>MARS and CAP are separate services, but don't they require the participants to hold amateur licenses? Regarding out of band operations, in at least one country I know of, certain frequencies out of band are permitted to be used by radio amateurs. This is in Trinidad and Tobago, where local amateurs are allowed to use a repeater on 148.800 MHz (-600kHz offset). This frequency is outside of the 2 meter band and normally assigned to commercial fixed and mobile services. In fact the local police operate on 148.300 MHz! The repeater is owned by the local emergency management agency (NEMA). No other authorization is required other than a ham radio license. However, other non-hams are allowed on that repeater - NEMA staff and registered REACT volunteers. So there is at least one case of out of band operations being allowed. <a href="../../../r/j/a/User%7ERjairam_b035.html" title="User:Rjairam">Ryan</a> 05:43, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>This is interesting (and I think should be mentioned somewhere in the article), but I don't think it's representative of most amateurs worldwide. It's IMO quite an exceptional cirumstance, and should if it's discussed, I think it needs to be phrased as such. I don't know of any other countries where out-of-band transmissions are authorized, except in an emergency. --<a href="../../../k/a/d/User%7EKadin2048_74a5.html" title="User:Kadin2048">Kadin2048</a> 18:02, 24 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I will put it as an exception. I agree, it is certainly not the norm. In fact there was quite some controversy when this new repeater was introduced. It was often seen as a ploy for the Government to see who modified their amateur equipment to transmit out of band. It was also seen as a means to justify allowing REACT members (who mostly don't have ham licenses and who use commercial land mobile radios on a fixed frequency) on a NEMA repeater in the 2 meter band. None of these came to pass, of course, it was all just a conspiracy theory. <a href="../../../r/j/a/User%7ERjairam_b035.html" title="User:Rjairam">Ryan</a> 21:30, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A distinguishing privilege of amateur radio is the ability to use a <a href="../../../v/a/r/Variable-frequency_oscillator.html" title="Variable-frequency oscillator">Variable-frequency oscillator</a> (<i>VFO</i>) for controlling the frequencies of communications. Usually, the only other radio services granted the use of a VFO are the military. All others services including <i>aircraft, police, fire, Citizens' band, and business radio services</i> are restricted to designated channelized frequencies. Amateur radio operators gain the privilege to use a VFO only after they have demonstrated the understanding of the frequency ranges under which the license is granted by taking an examination at the time of licensing. Amateur radio operators also are allowed to operate "out of band" in certain situations. For example, facilitating emergency communications or participation in the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_Affiliate_Radio_System_200f.html" title="Military Affiliate Radio System">Military Affiliate Radio System</a> (<i>MARS</i>) to exchange radio telegrams on military frequencies.</p>

<dd>I think the VFO part is actually wrong. Nearly all modern radios use a VFO, including standard AM/FM broadcast receivers. In particular, airports use frequencies, not channels, so even the channel distinction is wrong. And, as you say, most amateur radios are restricted to only transmit in the amateur band. The only distinction I see is that nearly all commercial amateur radios can RECEIVE a bit out of band, and amateurs are allowed to build their own radios without the FCC looking over their sholder too much. (Many MARS radios are home build mods, rather than commercial.) --<a href="../../../s/s/d/User%7ESsd_e9c6.html" title="User:Ssd">ssd</a> 11:40, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree this VFO-as-privilege business just seems wrong. Amateur operators have the privilege of transmitting on certain frequencies, not of using a VFO. Most receivers today use VFOs as part of their tuning circuits, at least as I understand them, and there's no rule that says you can't build a VFO as long as it doesn't emit anything. (Anything else would be a bit silly.) Perhaps the writer was thinking of how amateur equipment doesn't (sometimes) have provisions that keep it from transmitting out-of-band, while almost all commercial/CB/unlicensed-tx equipment does? Or maybe the comment is somehow true in other countries? (I can't imagine how it'd be enforced...) Without more information I think it should just be removed. --<a href="../../../k/a/d/User%7EKadin2048_74a5.html" title="User:Kadin2048">Kadin2048</a> 18:02, 24 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see it differently than either. The VFO versus channelized contention does not apply to receivers. Perhaps that is why the original entry caused confusion. In all other radio services, the users are restricted to transmitting on a specific list of frequencies. This is, per the FCC the definition of "channelized" operation. Whether the frequencies are listed by frequency or channel number is of no relevance. What is relevant is that the operation is confined to specific, designatied frequencies. Only within amateur radio is the operator allowed to select any frequency within an upper and lower boundary.</dd>

<dd>While this may seem a minor distinction, it in fact points out a crucial differentiation between amateur radio and every other radio service: amateurs must possess enough technical knowledge to be able to perform such frequency selection and in fact, understand enough about signal bandwidth to predict that they can use a given frequency without their emissions going out of band.</dd>

Rather, the "any frequency within upper and lower boundary" would be a way to represent the fact that hams have to pass a theory exam, therefore they are allowed more lattitude in how they operate as a result.192.65.41.20 01:24, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I believe due to it's length it should be split into it's own article, too much information on a single page can overwhelm not only a human but it can also make some computers slow.(<a href="../../../k/e/5/User%7EKe5crz_574b.html" title="User:Ke5crz">Ke5crz</a> 05:23, 13 February 2007 (UTC))</p>

<dd>I don't know. I'm not sure its a good idea. If you take what amateur radio operators do out of this article, what's the point of this article then? I mean really without what we do in this article it kinda defeats the point of this whole article. I understand that it's big and hard to work with... but in the end it is the content of this article. if you split it off there is no point to this article. I think maybe an overhaul of how it's put on the page is in order. I have no idea what it should look like. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonym1ty_c12e.html" title="User:Anonym1ty">Anonym1ty</a> 17:11, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you are on to something. Rather than split out "Amateur radio activities and practices" those sections that are merely links to other articles don't need such detailed summaries. We could probably stand to remove the G0RTN shack photo, the 4S7AB and that impossible to discern what it is picture of the radio bike. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonym1ty_c12e.html" title="User:Anonym1ty">Anonym1ty</a> 22:46, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Each entry (Emergency Communications, QSL Cards, DXing, etc.) can easily have photos removed and text be edited down to 2 or 3 sentences, including in each case, links to the articles. That will save a lot of space. However some entries do not have separate articles and the entries are rather detailed. In those cases, stubs should be created and linked to. --- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuckyLouie_ff26.html" title="User:LuckyLouie">LuckyLouie</a> 03:51, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>OK. I took a stab at it. I moved lots of content and photos to separate articles, and merged some trivial content into the main intro. Anyone who's personal specialty interest (Space comms, etc.) who feels they are not getting enough ink, please see the sub-articles, or feel free to create a new stub. --- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuckyLouie_ff26.html" title="User:LuckyLouie">LuckyLouie</a> 00:05, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I like it. i get a feeling that the list of Specialized Interests and modes should be located more towards the bottom of the article. To me this would be more visually appealing and also make more sense as a place where people will "branch off" into those articles.

<p>Let's try to avoid having "fact" tags plastered all over an otherwise good article. While many facts quoted in the article may seem self-evident to Wikipedians who hold amateur licenses, they need to have their sources cited in order to meet WP:V. FCC amateur regulations, ARRL publications, etc. are all good resources to obtain such cites from. All citations should be done using the inline method when possible. -- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuckyLouie_ff26.html" title="User:LuckyLouie">LuckyLouie</a> 16:20, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think describing ham radio <i>primarily</i> as a "public service" is POV pushing. I understand that the hobby is fighting to justify itself, but defining it as a public service first and a hobby second is a little over the top. The lead para. mentions public service three times. -- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuckyLouie_ff26.html" title="User:LuckyLouie">LuckyLouie</a> 16:39, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think you will find that the USA is the only country in the world that treats amateur radio as a public service. Certainly not so in the UK. <a href="../../../d/s/e/User%7EDsergeant_3069.html" title="User:Dsergeant">Dsergeant</a> 17:22, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Ham radio is described in the terms of a public service in many places throughout the world.... That being said, the opening paragraph is misleading. Ham radio is indeed a hobby first, with some public service aspects to it. Public service is a big part of Ham radio both officially or in practice, but defining ham radio as a public service before defining it as a hobby is not right. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonym1ty_c12e.html" title="User:Anonym1ty">Anonym1ty</a> 17:35, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agree. I made the edit to reflect what I believe is the correct weight for the definition. Public service is mentioned now only two times in the lead. -- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELuckyLouie_ff26.html" title="User:LuckyLouie">LuckyLouie</a> 17:43, 4 April 2007 (UTC)

<p>the problem i've always had with it being called a hobby is that few hobbies that i know of are sanctioned and licensed by the government. for example i don't know that there is a golf license, gardening license or photography license. maybe in areas outside of the US there is. personally, i'd like to see "public service" in the lead sentence, but i do not have a problem with how it exists now.</p>
<p>im not complaining and not going to change it&#160;:) but this is one of those discussions i've gotten into a lot and wanted to jump in to it.</p>
<p>btw louie, nice work with the Specialized Interests and modes box, i like it. 73 <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_hombre_de_haha_ddba.html" title="User:El hombre de haha">El hombre de haha</a> 23:21, 4 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Nah...it's not the hobby that is licensed. It is access to the airwaves that is licensed. The government agencies are licensing the right to use the airwaves as a service. Whether you choose to use that service as a hobby, to serve the public, or other usage is up to you...the only prohibited usages are that of making money or broadcasting.</p>
<p>As an example of another "hobby" that requires a license: driving. You must obtain a driver's license before driving on the road. Once licensed, you may use the privilege to drive as a part of your job...or as entertainment, like driving to relatives' homes for vacation, or going on a Sunday drive with the family. 192.65.41.20 01:25, 6 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This (below) sounds like an educated opinion, however opinions can't be cited as fact. We need to source these facts if it to stay in the article:</p>
<p><i>In some countries, however, amateur radio licensing is very bureaucratic (for example in <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>) or challenging because some applicants must undergo difficult security approval (as in <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a>). Currently only the nations of <a href="../../../y/e/m/Yemen.html" title="Yemen">Yemen</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Korea_2774.html" title="North Korea">North Korea</a> do not permit their citizens to operate <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_radio_station.html" title="Amateur radio station">amateur radio stations</a> at all, although in both cases a few visiting foreign amateurs have been granted temporary operating authority.</i></p>
<p><i>In some developing countries, licensing fees can be prohibitive in terms of local incomes. This is a particular problem in <a href="../../../a/f/r/Africa.html" title="Africa">Africa</a> and to a lesser extent in poorer parts of <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asia.html" title="Asia">Asia</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_America_2c96.html" title="Latin America">Latin America</a> and the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caribbean.html" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. Small countries or those with weak administrative structures may not have a national licensing scheme and may require amateurs to take the licensing exams of a foreign country in lieu.</i></p>
