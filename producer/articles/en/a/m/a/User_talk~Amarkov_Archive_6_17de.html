<dd>Um... yeah. Encyclopedias don't thrive from just article writing. They need behind-the-scenes stuff too.

<dd>Um... No I couldn't. It would be nice if everyone could just write the encyclopedia, and everything were fine, but in reality, there has to be removal of the bad things, because there is no requirement of expertise, or even intelligence, to edit Wikipedia. And even if there were, well-meaning intelligent people can still be biased on whether an article they wrote is actually notable or verifiable. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 16:32, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Spending all of your time at AfD and RfA doesn't really help the encyclopedia. Sure, you're voting on the status of some articles, but I think you can spend more time writing articles (contribute to <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a> for example!) than engaging in forum-style discussion with others in the project namespace. Also, the people who actually do spend their time on AfD's and RfA's also spend time on editing <b>articles</b>. Most other people would far more appreciate editing the encyclopedia than voting in some discussion. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 21:18, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I probably agree on the whole with Nishi, but I should observe, I think, that the <i>notable edits</i> and <i>significant edits</i> metrics suffer from some deficiencies (toward which, see, e.g., <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoice_of_All_History_analysis_JS_Definitions_and_FAQ_5622.html" title="User:Voice of All/History analysis JS Definitions and FAQ">VoA's FAQ page</a>); across <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions%26limit%3D2000%26target%3DJahiegel_0f25.html" title="Special:Contributions&amp;limit=2000&amp;target=Jahiegel">my last 2000 contributions</a>, for instance, I have created no fewer than fifteen non-stub articles and have rewritten entirely at least fourteen non-stub articles but am "credited" with having made just three notable and six significant edits. I don't mean to suggest that Nishi's point is in any way invalid, and I don't mean to suggest that the numbers the tools provides for Amarkov are wrong; I mean only to discourage our treating the <i>notable</i> and <i>significant</i> tallies as exact. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 05:16, 1 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, the numbers seem pretty good for me. I'm well aware that I don't contribute very much to article writing, but I really just find that... boring. I see your point, but I am not going to follow it. Wikipedia always has been, and always will be, something fun for me to do. I am not going to force myself to do boring things in service of the encyclopedia. If that makes me a worse contributor, I'll have to live with it, because it won't change. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 06:59, 1 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yeah, Joe. It is inaccurate. I made over 12 articles (6,000KB+ each) in the last week or so, and it still says I don't have that many significant article edits. However, it is still a good general indicator of the type of editing a user does. The other point is valid, though. 11.2% to the article namespace is not that great. Whatever, suit yourself, Amarkov. I'm just trying to give friendly advice. <b><a href="../../../n/i/s/User%7ENishkid64_5481.html" title="User:Nishkid64"><span style="background:#009;color:#7FFF00">Nish</span><span style="background:cyan;color:#009">kid</span></a><a href="../../../n/i/s/User_talk%7ENishkid64_b4d4.html" title="User talk:Nishkid64"><span style="background:orange;color:navy blue">64</span></a></b> 18:43, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry for my somewhat terse response earlier. I was in a very <a href="../../../m/c/l/McLean_County%2C_Illinois_d237.html" title="McLean County, Illinois">rural</a> area and did not have very good access to technology. Technically, you are correct that TfD is the place to bring templates for deletion discussions, the name of the place makes that obvious. However, the issue I was referring to in terms of the Click template was the issue of metadata in articles in general, the inclusion/removal of which seems to be lacking consensus. Another thing I was hitting on in my closing statement for the TfD was that no one admin could remove all of those transclusions competently and without problems if acting unilaterally. The template had over 1000 transclusions, which is a lot even for an account enabled with AutoWikiBrowser, which I usually use when deleting heavily transcluded templates. It just seemed to me that the sheer number and variety of the template's transclusions made it an inviable TfD nomination.</p>
<p>Now as for what alternatives we may have, there aren't many, they aren't likely to be simple. The template is transcluded in many places, from numerous articles to the markers for Featured Articles. It seems to me that one TfD nomination was not sufficient to justify deletion in all of those senses, that consensus must be achieved to remove the template in cases of type A, then in cases of type B, and so on, until the template has few transclusions and be deleted by one admin via TfD. I hope this clarifies my position in closing the TfD, and addresses your concerns. Also, I hope that my thoughts lay out al least some way to proceed with this deletion, which I do believe needs to take place. Sorry for the delay, and then the deluge of words in reply.

<p>I have a comment to make on your RfA views, as seen on BostonMA's nomination amoung others. For a long time now I've been watching RfA and never commenting, but while your point is true I can't help feeling you are making it out to be more of a problem than it really is. When I ran for admin I had very rarely participated in XfD and never requested protection for a page. Presumably this means you would have opposed my nomination? Fair enough; you would have had no idea how I understand protection policy and XfD procedure.</p>
<p>My point is, I don't <i>need</i> to understand protection policy or XfD procedure because I never do those things. I've been an admin since March and I've never protected a page and haven't even visited XfD since then. I just have no interest in those areas, at least not at the moment, so where is the danger?. I like to think that people should be made admins not because they show familiarity with every aspect of the admin tools, but because they show responsibility enough to have them. If I ever wanted to protect a page, or developed a sudden interest in AfD, I'd read up on them first; I'd become familiar with the policies and procedures before doing anything. My feeling is that you should trust admin candidates to do the same. You don't need to ask "are they familiar with this area?", just "do I trust them to <i>become</i> familiar with this area before jumping in?" <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaven4x4x_5184.html" title="User:Raven4x4x">Raven4x4x</a> 08:22, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I will occasionally trust long-standing editors to do that. For instance, if you have like 15,000 edits, and have been here for a year, I'm unlikely to oppose you just for not having XfD participation. Also, I want XfD participation because that shows understanding of policy in general, which I believe any admin candidate needs. I don't trust answers to questions, it's too easy to decieve yourself on what you'll really do. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 16:17, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Articles for deletion/Andrew Gower (2nd nomination) I did some ressearh this afternoon and found what might be independent sources establishing him as notable as the creator of the game and CEO of the company which produces it. I posted my links at the AfD discussion. I'm not sure how crdible the sources are, but one seem to be the London Times website, and the others seem to be outside of potential influence by the subject. I'm happy to rewrite the article if it appears that we will keep the article. I'm not a gamer but I saw the conversation at today's AfD log. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 22:31, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Is the deletion review process a good way to go about doing that? <a href="../../../g/i/s/User%7EGisele_Hsieh_103a.html" title="User:Gisele Hsieh">Gisele Hsieh</a> 09:16, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi, I only individualized some of the messages I sent out, because it is difficult to determine who has the inclination to discuss. I thank your for your willingness. Like a number of <b>oppose</b> votes, you say that my answer to Question 6 is a bit troubling. It would really help me if you could clarify what you find troubling. Also, I agree with you that when someone is made an admin they are given a variety of tools and need to be trusted with <i>all</i> of them. Accepting for the moment your position that I have insufficient experience with XfD, is there a reason why you would not trust me to avoid using tools in situations in which I might not be qualified? Perhaps you feel that it is a question of prudence to avoid giving such tools to someone who hasn't <i>demonstrated</i> their style, because it is much harder to take the tools back than to withhold them in the first place.(?) Anyway, I would very much like to hear more from you. Sincerely, --<a href="../../../b/o/s/User%7EBostonMA_1634.html" title="User:BostonMA">BostonMA</a> <font color="blue"><sup><a href="../../../b/o/s/User_talk%7EBostonMA_e998.html" title="User talk:BostonMA">talk</a></sup></font> 15:52, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>For the second, it's just prudence; it's not like we have a huge shortage of admins, so while "we don't need admins" shouldn't be a reason not to support, we can be picky. And with the first, my problem is the "admins <i>may</i> delete" part. Speedy criteria are supposed to be things which are unambiguously reasons why something should be deleted (except maybe G11 and A7, those can just use cleanup), so the answer gives the implication that speedy criteria are wider than they really are. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 15:56, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for your explanation. I think that is a communication problem on my part. What I intended was not to imply that the speedy give greater latitude to deletion than they do, but to imply that they give latitude to admins to <b>not</b> delete articles even if they meet the standards for speedy deletion. The standard for G11 states:
<dl>
<dd>Blatant advertising. Pages which exclusively promote a company, product, group or service and which would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become encyclopedic. Note that simply having a company, product, group or service as its subject does not qualify an article for this criterion.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This standard allows, under specific conditions, the deletion of articles that could have been rewritten, provided that these articles "would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become encyclopedic". If the business is notable, I would much prefer to reduce the article to a stub than delete it. That is what I was trying to convey with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FBostonMA&amp;diff=96741842&amp;oldid=96739225" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FBostonMA&amp;diff=96741842&amp;oldid=96739225" rel="nofollow">my answer to Q6</a>, but I think I clearly failed to communicate that message clearly. Is it clearer now?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Regarding your comment <i>"Just do not even think of bringing up desysopping."</i>: I'm not looking for a removal of his admin authority. Occasionally even good admins need a "reset" to recognise when they might be inappropriately using the powers granted them. Not even the most conscientious individuals always realise when they might be in falling into a conflict of interest, letting their personal opinions get in the way of fair judgment.

<p>Hi there. I just had a look at your monobook.js and you're calling akeytt a lot of times that you don't need to. When using addOnloadHook(), the runOnloadHook() function that actually executes the hook functions calls akeytt itself. The only time it needs to be done again is if new links requiring access keys are added after runOnloadHook executes. You can remove it in every case that you're currently calling it and probably want to do so because it's one of the slower site-wide functions. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Dillon_27e0.html" title="User talk:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 20:07, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You won't break anything. Just remove all the calls to akeytt() and your page will load faster. The akeytt() function changes the tooltips for links are in the <code>ta[]</code> array and the "access key" is a keyboard shortcut that allows you to "click" the link without clicking it (it shows up at the end of the tooltip as something like "[alt-t]"). <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Dillon_27e0.html" title="User talk:Mike Dillon">Mike Dillon</a> 20:19, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
