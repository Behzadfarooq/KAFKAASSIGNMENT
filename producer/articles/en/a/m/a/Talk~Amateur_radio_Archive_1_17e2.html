<p>According to the <a href="../../../p/e/j/Pejorative.html" title="Pejorative">Pejorative</a> page, Ham was originally a perjorative term. But beyond that I know not. Anonymous 00:17, 17 Dec 2005 (AEDST)</p>

<dd>That's very misleading as the origin of the word ham has been lost. You can't say it was originally expressing contempt or disapproval. It may have, but we really don't know. There have been many legends as to the meaning of the word and it's origin all of which have been debunked. HAM may just be a shortened form of the word AMATEUR itself. I don't know, and in my investigations no one else does either. Does anyone have a real source on any of this? I am not convinced by the ARRL that it evolved out of G. M. Dodge's definition. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonym1ty_c12e.html" title="User:Anonym1ty">Anonym1ty</a> 16:31, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just for fun... According to CQ India, "HAM stands for The first letter of 3 pioneers in the field of Radio communication viz., Hertz Armstrong and Marconi".

<dd>Where can we find Amateur Radio in popular culture today? Well we all know ad nauseum that we can find it in TV and movies. We can also find it in Music. Such as RUSH's song YYZ and a Group called "The Ham Band".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What might be more interesting is something about how and why these little bits of ham radio end up in our popular culture. Minor references are all around us if we happen to see or hear them. I have seen episodes of Jeopardy where i could faintly hear morse code in the background sound track.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When on the 2005 QCWA convention I listend to Chip, K7JA discuss how he ended up on the Tonight show sending morse code against some text messengers - In this case the interesting point here is that many of the staff at the Tonight Show are hams.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What about some of the experts brought into your local news broadcasts? Many times there is something related to Amateur Radio and you will find HAMs on TV or (BC) Radio talking about something.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Other hobbies too... Remote Control planes, cars, boats etc. seem to be very popular and a place where people are exposed to Amateur Radio. Same thing for model rocketry, SWL and Weather aficionados. Computer Networking is an other place you see regular people being exposed to amateur radio.</dd>

<dd>Well I do believe Amateur Radio is essentially a grouping of 40,000 different hobbies with a common thread. I think that because of the scope of ham radio, a larger article is warranted. That being said, some of the aspects of Amateur radio in this article, should be farmed out to articles in their own right. We can then keep to an overview of Amateur Radio in this article and include the appropriate links. I will take a look at the new article...<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonym1ty_c12e.html" title="User:Anonym1ty">Anonym1ty</a> 14:53, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

We'll all just have to take little bites.. report here on which section went where... then we can check up on the work and keep each other honest&#160;:) I have actually made pages on my clubs that were once listed here... But i haven't included a link in this section as it is not appropriate, but should we start a club page, then I will put it there. But I think we are getting a good working outline of how we want to present this stuff, I wouldn't mind hearing from any others, if someone has a good idea let us know so we can all try to work towards the same end!

<h2><span class="mw-headline">My Two Cents</span></h2>
<p>Quite noticeably the entire article is very POV, but is that a big deal on wikipedia because this is a hobby? Furthermore, something should be said about the telecommunication industry's and the ham's main problem: Broadband over Power Lines which creates massive interference in the ham bands.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheloniouszen_4d16.html" title="User:Theloniouszen">Theloniouszen</a> 11:44, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with you entirely on the POV situation. Despite the up-beat tone of this article, there <i>is</i> a great deal of technological stagnation in amateur radio, and in many areas highly sought-after bands <i>are</i> grossly underutilized. In fact, ignoring a few refinements here and there, amateur radio does not seem to have evolved much since about 1978. (Compare <a href="../../../p/a/c/Packet_radio.html" title="Packet radio">packet radio</a> to <a href="../../../w/i/-/Wi-Fi_fa52.html" title="Wi-Fi">Wi-Fi</a> to get a sense of what I mean. And yes, I am a licensed amateur myself.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not motivated to start an edit war over this but I do think Wikipedia deserves a more illuminating treatment of the subject.</dd>

<dd>If you think Amateur Radio has stagnated, you've got your eyes closed. Software Defined Radio is being experimented with by hams, and that's pretty bleeding edge. Hams still hold the lead in satelite experimentation. Those are just two areas. --<a href="../../../s/s/d/User%7ESsd_e9c6.html" title="User:Ssd">ssd</a> 04:10, 23 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Fair points, but my perception is that only a tiny portion of the amateur radio community is involved in the "bleeding edge" experimentation you describe (which is significant because it is a revolutionary shift from the hobby's earlier days). Nowadays, few amateurs seem aware of advances in radio technology until it becomes an object of mass production by <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenwood_Electronics_b9f0.html" title="Kenwood Electronics">Kenwood</a>, <a href="../../../y/a/e/Yaesu.html" title="Yaesu">Yaesu</a>, et al. This is not an indictment of these operators; at the same it does <i>not</i> constitute "a unique research and development environment", the actions of a few exceptional individuals notwithstanding. I believe a more balanced article would reflect this.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To make the article more NPOV, I would suggest it detail both the nature of the pressures on amateur radio from industry and, as fairly as possible, the extent to which industry's claims are valid. This can then be countered with a description of the research and community service currently being performed by amateur radio operators, plus an assessment of the participation in these activities by the amateur community at large. The reader can be left to decide which group has a greater claim to spectrum allocations.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Amateur radio clubs</span></h2>
<p>Do people really think that this article is going to end up listing <i>every</i> regional, local, and specialty radio club in the world???</p>
<p>On that score, even a listing all the world's national associations really ought to be moved to a separate "List of..." page, if we need it at all. Think about how many countries there are in the world...</p>
<p>While we're at it, what happened to the Wikipedia policy of trying to internal-link, before jumping readers straight to external links? I <i>know</i> there's an <a href="../../../r/s/g/RSGB_28c3.html" title="RSGB">RSGB</a> stub because I created it for this purpose - whose idea was it to revert all national associations to external links and cut out all the (potential) Wiki pages?</p>
<p>And what are all those <i>find a club near you</i> links about?! This is an encyclopedia, not a "find-a-club" service.</p>
<p>Sorry to rant, but whoever's gone-to-town on this page is not following Wikipedia style or guidelines and it's going to be SO MUCH work to sort it all out. It might be better just to delete all the link-spam and undifferentiated listing that makes up most of this section, and then rebuild what's really needed, in an encyclopedic style, over the course of a few weeks or months. --<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENigelj_f250.html" title="User:Nigelj">Nigelj</a> 22:33, 7 September 2005 (UTC), MJ0AQJ</p>

<dd>I totally agree, and I just removed the whole section. National ham radio organisations <b>might</b> be put back in, but minor clubs should be on a "List of ..." page, if at all. External links outside of the "External links and references" section is also a bad idea. <a href="../../../a/r/j/User%7EArj_a0cf.html" title="User:Arj">arj</a> 13:15, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree wholeheartedly - that's why I tried organizing them as I did back in June. Once organized, it's easier to identify what doesn't belong! How about this: List national societies that have Wikipedia articles. I also detest the ever-lengthening movie list - another candidate for deleltion or at least made into a new article. --<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlaws_d66e.html" title="User:Plaws">Plaws</a> 18:24, September 8, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But we are now stuck with an article which doesn't help when someone wants to find out how to become a ham. I do think looking in wikipedia, someone just might actually expect to find that in this article. Granted, zillions of clubs are not helpful, and linking within Wikipedia should be done, but I do think we need a very generic list of major organization is essential.I also agree that any links should go to wikipedia articles on such organizations. I can't see why we would not have listings of the ARRL, RAC, RSGB, DARC and WIA at the very least. Where to draw the line? I don't know! I'd rather have too many than none! Currently, though your heart was in the right place, the removal of all club and organizations arbitrarily was more harmful than helpful. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonym1ty_c12e.html" title="User:Anonym1ty">Anonym1ty</a> 19:48, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well perhaps a differnt way of presenting information altogther. The Movie listing was neat... for a while but has become overgrown. I don't think movies are entirely the right way to present what should be more a section on "Amateur Radio in Popular Culture" section which could not only include SOME movies or TV shows but other ways the public comes in contact with Ham radio. It should definately not be presented as a list. Perhaps a writeup with one or two examples, more of an article on how Amateur Radio can be found throughout popular culture rather than a list of places to find it. As for the clubs section, Renaming it organizations and resources or something may be in order.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">What does one do with amateur radio?</span></h2>
<p>I don't really like the section name "What does one do with amateur radio?" I don't like it because it is a question and also because it is cumbersome and akward sounding. I brought it up here because I thought it might be better to have some others' suggestions rather than to just start chaning everything. My suggestion is it may be better as "Avocation, Pursuit &amp; Practices" (or something).</p>
<p>I also feel the section is too big and too detailed. perhaps we should cut down the individual sub sections to a brief description of each with links to related article, much the was as was done with Amateur Radio in Popular Culture.</p>

<dd>We should probably do this with just about everything in the article. Once we whack it all up into little pieces, then we just have to make sure it flows well when reading what's left over in the main article. I was thinking about an article on Amateur radio licensing or something to cover the topics of Amateur radio requirements, responsibilities and how to become a ham. I'm kind of thinking it over because I suspect we could use 3 sections of the main article to make one new article. -- <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonym1ty_c12e.html" title="User:Anonym1ty">Anonym1ty</a> 20:25, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">New Section: Vintage Radio</span></h2>
<p>Hello to all. I today have added a section under "What can you do" entitled Vintage Radio. Included are two famous hams who directly contribute to the body of the text by virtue of their participation in this facet of the hobby. I envision a reader seeing the "celebrity" nature and imagining they could actually talk with these people, hence their inclusion. I also have uploaded an image of an AM Special Event Station, but am not yet sure I've formatted the page version (at 300px) and the thumbnail that is supposed to get you to the fullsizer. Editing help appreciated if that didn't turn out. If there is a revision that cuts down the size of this overall entry (as discussed here), I would be glad to re-write an introductory paragraph and link it to a more comprehensive version elsewhere. Drop me a line or post it. Tnx es 73 --Paul/WA3VJB 27 Dec 2005</p>

<dd>Vintage Radio should be made into an article of it's own. Right now it's just more of a smattering of too much detail on a very specific aspect of Amateur radio. It really shouldn't be so fully detailed as it is within the main Amateur radio article. However, it does have some good information, and could verywell be a good start to a new article. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonym1ty_c12e.html" title="User:Anonym1ty">Anonym1ty</a> 23:46, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">General criticisms</span></h2>
<p>I've been mostly contributing to ham radio-related articles other than this main one. As I'm reading through this atricle, there are a lot of things that should be fixed:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's too long for an encyclopedic article. <i>done: 25KB</i></li>
<li>There's too much detail that should properly be spread out into other articles. For instance, instead of trying to cover USA-Canada reciprocal licensing agreements in the main amateur radio article, why not have an article about <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_radio_license.html" title="Amateur radio license">amateur radio licenses</a> that covers those sorts of things? <i>done</i></li>
<li>Directly quoting FCC regulations in the lead section of the article is bad form. For one thing, it's US-centric, and for another, it's a level of detail way beyond what the lead section should cover. <i>fixed</i></li>
<li>Why is there a "How to Become a Ham" section at all? That seems very promotional and not at all encyclopedic. Coverage of topics like examinations, requirements, etc. should probably be spun off into an article on the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_radio_operator.html" title="Amateur radio operator">amateur radio operator</a> or the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_radio_license.html" title="Amateur radio license">amateur radio license</a>. <i>fixed</i></li>
<li>"What does one do with amateur radio?" is too casual and also sounds promotional. <i>fixed</i></li>
<li>The Past, Present, and Future section is very speculative and doesn't actually address the history of amateur radio at all. A brief description of the history of amateur radio is something that should be included in the main amateur radio article. Some of what is in amateur radio innovations and technology would be appropriate in a history section. <i>fixed</i></li>
<li>We need an article on amateur radio satellites. <i><a href="../../../o/s/c/OSCAR_c961.html" title="OSCAR">OSCAR</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/s/AMSAT_2c2f.html" title="AMSAT">AMSAT</a> already exist, but could use more work, or have a general article on both topics</i></li>
<li>There are too many external links of dubious relationship to the main article. For example, a link to the DX Zone web site should properly belong on an article about DXing. <i>fixed</i></li>
<li>There are no references or citations. <i>Okay, still have work to do here. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewjuren_cd32.html" title="User:Andrewjuren">Andrewjuren</a> 18:39, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</i></li>

<p>Major Changes and reorganization. Article size cut. New section History Created. Hoping someone might add a few historical things from places other than the US to it.</p>
<p>The Article is smaller now, it can be made smaller. I tried to address some of the many criticisms and hope others will follow my lead.</p>
<p>I did do a lot of cutting, I tried to preserve the intent, however I do not believe I am the only authority and would appreciate a peer review and revisions as needed. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonym1ty_c12e.html" title="User:Anonym1ty">Anonym1ty</a> 16:48, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Do we still need the advertisement tag on the article?</b> I did a lot of cleaning in hopes of fixing many of the problems with this article. DO we still need the ADVERTISMENT / NPOV tag or can we get rid of it? After all the editing I just did I don't think I am in a postition to stand back and look at the article and and make that decision. I would appreciate someone looking at it and either removing it, or discussing some more problems here. Yes I know I suggested two splits, but that type of clean-up isn't the same as the advertisement tag or the NPOV.<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonym1ty_c12e.html" title="User:Anonym1ty">Anonym1ty</a> 21:55, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>NPOV</b> The article looks good, except "A good way to get started in amateur radio is to find a club in your area to answer your questions and provide information on getting licensed and then getting on the air. If you are in the U.S., you can find a club near you by going to the American Radio Relay League's Affiliated Club Search page."</p>
<p>This is quite clearly a direct advertisement, because encyclopedias very rarely tell "you" how to contact an organization and join a hobby. Perhaps rewording like "most people enter the hobby by contacting a local amateur radio club" would be more appropriate. Personally, I would like to move this whole section to its own article. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewjuren_cd32.html" title="User:Andrewjuren">Andrewjuren</a> 22:51, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Licensing Structures</span></h2>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I suggest a more succinct discussion of licensing structure worldwide. For example, perhaps there could be a comparative table built along the following concept.</p>
<pre>
Class    US           UK     France   China     Japan   etc....

1      Technician     ?        ?        ?         ?  

2      General        ?        ?        ?         ?  

3      Extra          ?        ?        ?         ? 
</pre>
<p>Then, on a separate page discuss the requirements for each <s>class</s> <u>country</u> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewjuren_cd32.html" title="User:Andrewjuren">Andrewjuren</a>) worldwide. With this change/addition, the existing page could be shortened to a table with details on a linked page.</p>
<p>To me, this sounds like a cool project for someone who knows the topic.</p>

<p>I think this would be a great way to reduce the size of this article (many agree that it has become too long). Unfortunately, I'm a Canadian Amateur and don't really know the US licensing scheme all that well, but I could certainly write an article on the Canadian system.

<dd>I think it's a great idea. In a seperate article, we could explore this subject in far better detail than in the main article on <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_radio.html" title="Amateur radio">Amateur radio</a>. I do think the general section on licensing that is currently in the main article is good and may only need minor changes, however it would be an impossible goal to try and include so much information in the main article on <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_radio.html" title="Amateur radio">Amateur radio</a>. If you want to start out the Article on Amateur radio licensing and enter the info for Canadian licensing, I will follow up on the info on Licensing in the United States. I think we should take care how we write this article with the assumption that once we have a few countries licensing requirements, the article will probably need to be split. We should write it in such a way to make splitting it up later a bit easier. We should start out with only one new article, this will help us keep a consistant look &amp; feel accross several articles after we split them.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>I think we'll still need a section on Amateur radio licensing in the main article, I don't want to remove too much info either, but of exactly how much should stay and how much should go, I'm unsure. Perhaps we should make the new article at first without removing anything from the main article and see what makes sense to put where.<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonym1ty_c12e.html" title="User:Anonym1ty">Anonym1ty</a> 16:51, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The term Simplex is a long accepted usage. Calling it half duplex is not consistent with amateur practice. I would still call it simplex for that reason.

And limited all private (read <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_radio.html" title="Amateur radio">Amateur radio</a>) stations to wavelengths of 200 meters or shorter (1500 kHz or higher).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">30 MHz or 50 MHz for Morse code requirement question</span></h2>
<p>I thought that Morse code was required to work frequencies below 50 MHz, but now I see references to bands below 30 MHz. I was looking through part 97 rules and couldn't find a definitive stament. Is there a difference between ITU and US rules on this? <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 18:46, 11 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's because the 30MHz limit wasn't in American law, but international agreement. This had to do with treaties and the ITU, not the FCC. The limit was 30 MHz. The FCC never needed to codify it, rather the FCC license classes were made to comply with the international agreements (The creation of the Tech No-Code License). In the US it doesn't matter if it's below 50 or 30 MHz as there are no ham bands in that range. Now that limit does not apply due to any international agreements, effectively it exists in the United States as all ham licenses that allow for operation under 30 MHz currently require morse proficiency. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonym1ty_c12e.html" title="User:Anonym1ty">Anonym1ty</a> 17:56, 13 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There was a comment in the article already about morse code and operating below 30 MHz. The article talked about the ITU decision to drop the Morse requirement. I added that the US is in the middle of deciding. My comment was about the US status. I like the idea of having international flavor (especially since I am looking forward to getting on HF when the US goes no-code). When I was reading this article it is about amateur radio, but I don't get a sense that it speaks to an individual about how to become a ham. <s>Do we need a series of articles about getting a ham license with details for each country?</s> Steve <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 02:51, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I believe that I have see at least the US and Japanese numbers are in the "Now You're Talking" book and maybe also the others. If that's true then I don't think it's as of 2004 either.

<dd>I think famous hams are important, but your question "How does that add value to the article?" or more properly, "How does that add value to THIS article?" is a very good one. The answer simply is that is doesn't help this article one bit. If someone would like to start an article on famous hams, that would be far more appropriate than cramming all of that content in here. We also need to keep looking at what is already in here that ought to be farmed out to other articles.

<p>A little promotion is not a bad thing. Seeing famous people participate is a great way to promote amateur radio. Wikipedia is helped if it is fun to read. A fun article on a hobby does contribute to the success of Wikipedia. I wouldn't want a glossed over piece of fluff, but there is a place to talk about amateur radio being fun. If a person comes away from this article thinking amateur radio would be a nice hobby to pick up and they got a realistic idea of the sort of fun one can have with amateur radio that is then good promotion. Wikepedia has become such a great source of often accurate information that it may be a place where people come to to find out how to become a ham. <a href="../../../k/d/4/User%7EKd4ttc_9614.html" title="User:Kd4ttc">Kd4ttc</a> 18:23, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, actually, promotional information is explicitly against an <b><a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">official policy</a></b> of Wikipedia. This is supposed to be an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>, not some sort of online promotional brochure pushing a particular point of view or agenda.--<a href="../../../k/h/a/User%7EKharker_c115.html" title="User:Kharker">Kharker</a> 18:36, 14 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>We have many lists of people, by ethnicity, occupation, hobby, crime, sexual orientation, political affiliation, religion, manner of death, etc. Those lists are not necessarily promoting anything in particular. The category automatically creates a listing, but an article-list has the advantages of being able to annotate entries and being able include people who don't have an article yet.

<dd>A famous hams list in this article is an EXTREMELY BAD IDEA. I truely understand the point of view you are coming from and yes it does have its merits, however the list would be a wild unruly monster of a mess to keep up. It would be far better to create a wikipedia article on each individual person and then add them to a category. Or Maybe... <i>and I think it's a stretch</i>, put it in the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_radio_in_popular_culture.html" title="Amateur radio in popular culture">Amateur radio in popular culture</a> article. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonym1ty_c12e.html" title="User:Anonym1ty">Anonym1ty</a> 22:10, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
