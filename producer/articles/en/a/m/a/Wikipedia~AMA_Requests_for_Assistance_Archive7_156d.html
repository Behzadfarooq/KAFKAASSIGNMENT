<p><b>Brief:</b> An anonymous user (i.e., one not signed in) has twice within several days deleted an external link to an archived newspaper article pertaining to the subject of racist singer Johnny Rebel. I wish to know how to proceed: For example, is this is a case of vandalism (since the user is anonymous/not logged in, and has deleted the link on more than one occasion, even though I posted a note under the discussion section asking that the link be retained)? And if it is not vandalism, how should I proceed? (I will in the meantime restore the external link.) I have not been in contact with this anonymous user, I should note. Sincerely, --<a href="../../../s/k/b/User%7ESkb8721_f1f8.html" title="User:Skb8721">Skb8721</a> 19:29, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks to RoyalGuard11 for advising me on this issue. I'd like to keep my request open while the matter is unresolved. In the meantime, I did post a warning (using an official template) on the talk page of the user, who is an anonymous AOL user . . . so I doubt they will ever actually see the warning. I also posted a warning (again, using a template) on the talk page of <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Rebel_%28singer%29_1b29.html" title="Johnny Rebel (singer)">Johnny Rebel (singer)</a>. Also, because the anonymous AOL vandal had again deleted the same external link since I reverted it yesterday afternoon -- at least the third time they have vandalized the site -- I locked the site to edits by anonymous users. I assume I have the ability to do this; I've never done it before, and merely copied the lock-site mark up from other sites that are locked to anonymous edits.--<a href="../../../s/k/b/User%7ESkb8721_f1f8.html" title="User:Skb8721">Skb8721</a> 16:30, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Brief:</b> There is no information provided on this page about the metaphysical healing properties of crystals. I believe the people that primarily edit this page are scientists who simply don't accept 'metaphysical' properties of crystals. People have been using crystals for their 'healing' properties for centuries, since the beginning of time. I tried to add a link to my website, which provides this type of information, and they keep deleting my link. They do have a link that goes to another person's website for 'mythology' of crystals..but that website is more of a crystal store, than an informative site. So I am not sure why they would allow that link, but not mine. My website is not spam. Please advise, or help.

<dd>ReikiEssentials has minimal edits, a significant percentage of the user's edits are those where the link in question is added. The link is to ReikiEssentials' commercial website. Website is full of unreferenced primary source information of a scientifically controversial nature, some would say dubious, and appears to add little value to the article on <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystals.html" title="Crystals">Crystals</a>. I have advised the user that I don't recommend pursuing this further, as they would be likely to appear to everyone to be in the wrong, unless they can make a really good case for the link's inclusion on its own merit. I'm closing this, as I think a <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">user in good faith</a> would not pursue this. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">User:Pedant</a> 23:36, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Finally as per Wikipedia's policy I merged/redirected his two line entry on <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mina_Khel_19a2.html" title="Mina Khel">Mina Khel</a> (a sub clan of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marwat.html" title="Marwat">Marwat</a>) with the main article of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marwat.html" title="Marwat">Marwat</a> but he recreated the same and which is now pending for a decision by the editors for deletion/merging/redirecting. He was also requested to discuss his additions on the discussion page on <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marwat.html" title="Marwat">Marwat</a> but he turned personal. He has been consistently trying to produce vanity pages and it is my humble opinion to block this user from Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarwatt_1f61.html" title="User:Marwatt">Marwatt</a> 23:11, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comments on Marwatt's Paragraph</b> First of all, I am not Ghazni Khel, he is some one who supported my editings. Yes, I am the user who uses 203.175.64.10 but I never un-siugned deliberately. I always sign-in whenever I see that instead of my User Name my I.P was mentioned. This reminds me to sign in later. In simplewords I affirm that I am the one, so no need to blame me about this.</p>
<p>When, I came to know that deletingAFD tag that was posted by Marwatt shouldn't be removed, I never did it. I was unaware of knowing the policy about AFD Tag and providing a personal I.D.</p>
<p>Marwatt above wrote about me not about the Article. I think we are here to discuss and to seek justice. If I am right, I won't become negative and start leading personal attacks on someonme.</p>
<p>For a moment, If we all even agree that I am a negative and be black-listed, this still has nothing to do with my application for justice that is mentioned above.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I opposed Administrator's i.e. RexNL decission and that's why I am here for Justice.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The edit-war started when I started editing, upgrading, updating and posting facts and truths. I can alsoprovide proofs against the user Marwatt for allthe htings he blamed over me. He even deleted my link-provided materials from some articles, just because I was writing somehting truth here that was about someone of his tribe. <b>Anyhow, in short, I would like an advocate to go through my case briefly and see who righteous and who is wrong</b>. As I am having faith that "Truth wins, lies dies", I have nothing to worry about. As then I feel I am on right things. Please, come on andresolvethe issue with justice,after analyising facts and lies.</dd>

<p><b>Brief:</b> A user who disapproves of the Equality Ride continuously removes the majority of the Equality Ride article. All information in the article can be verified in publications like The Advocate, Sojourners Magazine, The LA Times, The Washington Post, the St. Petersburg Times, etc, etc, etc. This user, however, has changed this verifiable information repeatedly in order to cast a negative light on the Equality Ride. Furthermore, he adds unverifiable opinions criticizing the Equality Ride without even bothering to write it in Neutral Voice. I have reverted this article several times now and it's getting old. He has not responded to me on the discussion board, either. I believe he's using two or three different usernames on Wikipedia. Please help.

<dd>The abuse claim is ludicrous, and so is the poll. I added material to the protected page that DPeterson and his allies specifically requested to be added - I had previously objected to this material, but in a spirit of cooperation, agreed to disagree and replaced it per their wishes. This settled one of the problems under dispute - in DPeterson's favor. Would DPeterson rather I <b>not</b> have put it there? If so, why did DPeterson request that it be put back? The poll is equally absurd - it consisted of three people, including DPeterson, all of whom are DPeterson's editing allies on related pages. Such a "poll" clearly doesn't represent any sort of community consensus. I did not protect the page - it was done by a third-party admin at my request to stop the edit war. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 01:21, 6 September 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Brief:</b> User Bignole continually insists on including a sentence stating that Smallville is based on the DC character Superman. This seemingly obvious statement is actually in dispute because of the lawsuit by the heirs of <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Siegel_46be.html" title="Jerry Siegel">Jerry Siegel</a>, who say that Smallville is really based on Superboy, who is legally a distinct character. NPOV would require stating the two competing claims and not taking a position on which one is correct; Bignole refuses to let me do that. I tried getting a third opinion (who agreed with me about NPOV) and I also tried a RFC, which resulted in no comments whatsoever. I have absolutely no idea what to do at this point. <i>(<a href="../../../k/e/n/User_talk%7EKen_Arromdee_3302.html#AMA_request" title="User talk:Ken Arromdee">read full description</a>)</i> -- <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKen_Arromdee_cac5.html" title="User:Ken Arromdee">Ken Arromdee</a> 05:17, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Brief:</b> Two users (Amoruso and Chevdo) are posting their own politically motived opinions in a section which cites incorrect articles, I have discussed it with them in the talk page, and I added lines in the section highlighting the information was false, however they removed my edits, and I removed the section after posting considerable amount of proof that it was false and pointless. However, Amoruso has restored it once again, and he keeps making up his own "highly disputed" topics.

<p><b>Brief:</b> I am involved in a dispute with an admin, <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a>, over the sourcing and compliance of <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Gannon_c068.html" title="Jeff Gannon">Jeff Gannon</a>, a <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">biography of a living person</a>.

The sources, however, fail to meet the extra stringent sourcing criteria of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, being editorials and political pieces that fail to provide any real proof that Gannon is indeed a prostitute.

There are several other articles, for example, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_famous_prostitutes_and_courtesans.html" title="List of famous prostitutes and courtesans">List of famous prostitutes and courtesans</a>, which also make this allegation. In the example case, there is no sourcing at all, simply a wikilink back to <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Gannon_c068.html" title="Jeff Gannon">Jeff Gannon</a>, which the admin in question asserts is good enough sourcing. I have removed these statements several times, citing <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, only to have my edits reverted by the admin in question.

<p><b>Brief:</b> Dispute over a pop culture section featuring games that feature weapon in article. I say it should be removed for being fan/list cruft and being non-relevant and/or non-notable in relation to the historical weapon.

<p><b>Brief:</b> User Branchout continues to add the line "The album sales for this cd have been very low and is concidered a flop by producers and fans" to <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Day_Has_Come_2048.html" title="The Day Has Come">The Day Has Come</a>. However, this is clearly his/her personal opinion as he has no solid proof/links from credible sources that either producers or fans consider this album a "flop".</p>
<p>The first time he proceeded to place a link to a message board (which is not a credible source for citations as far as I understand) with the passage above. After this incident, I removed the comments from the page and added a note in his profile -- it stated until he finds a proper source which clearly states that anyone considers this album a flop, he should refrain from adding the passage in. This time, he/she decided to not log-in (only the IP number was showing), but still added in the exact same line. As this is his/her OWN opinion (as far as I can see), I don't think that the passage is acceptable for inclusion into the page unless BranchOut can find a credible source. <a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVikramsidhu_c629.html" title="User:Vikramsidhu">Vikramsidhu</a> 03:08, 20 August 2006 (UTC) <i>(<a href="../../../v/i/k/User_talk%7EVikramsidhu_65f8.html#AMA_request" title="User talk:Vikramsidhu">read full description</a>)</i> -- <a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVikramsidhu_c629.html" title="User:Vikramsidhu">Vikramsidhu</a> 03:08, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Brief:</b> I've been involved in a bit of a dispute over the placement of a link on <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Colbert_e40e.html" title="Stephen Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> related pages. I haven't pursued dispute resolution yet, but would simply like if someone could look over the case and offer their "legal" advice on how (or whether) to pursue it. One editor is repeatedly adding a link to a site, www.tekjansen.com, where the site's author strongly implies, but does not directly state, that he is Stephen Colbert. I'm uncomfortable with this because the site apparently sells memberships to access content supposedly written by Colbert. The user who keeps adding link is a user of their forum, and s/he seems to be interested in adding the link to generate traffic there. What makes this complicated is that I'm not sure the site <i>doesn't</i> belong to Colbert. I'm just not sure what the correct thing is to do. <b>Note: I've moved my full description location to a <a href="../../../l/e/e/User_talk%7ELee_Bailey_AMA_request_e28c.html" title="User talk:Lee Bailey/AMA request">subpage</a> of my talk</b> because I'd like to handle this semi-privately until I've figured out what to do.

<p><b>Brief:</b> It is my humble opinon that the recent editing on this page is very bias. Futher more, one of the active editors also edits on the Tammy Duckworth pages as well and is less agressive in adding negative spin on that page vers on Roskams page. Both Roskam and Duckworh are now running for Nov 2006 for this hotly contested seat for the Illinois 6th house distict. My edits get wiped with mumbo jumbo and theats to me. I can read and these guys are spinning this article in a negative way. There is also a wiki admin, a self described Democrat, over see this right now. I need help with the wiki process to make sure this article is truly NPOV which, in my humble opinon is not right now. thanks <i>(<a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoehazelton_be25.html#AMA_request" title="User talk:Joehazelton">read full description</a>)</i> -- <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoehazelton_cc1a.html" title="User:Joehazelton">Joehazelton</a> 05:23, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Brief:</b> A malicious and extremely uncivil vandal, that's continually editing anonymously under a changing IP address (usually starting with 84.44.*.*), has been purposefully removing factually sound information from the listed Wiki-article. I've tried amicably engaging said user/IP address numerous times regarding the dispute, but to no avail -- the only responses I get are insults and excuses as to why they won't logically engage me on the issue at hand. This back-and-forth has gotten nowhere, instead becoming worse -- the user's only grown increasingly hostile (to the point of actual threats against me).

<p>In brief I wanted to make the article of the band Keane, much simpler, to trim in my opinion highly redundant and highly overcumbant information on it. I wanted it to be as informative, as short and as good as possible. I wanted it be like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Keane&amp;oldid=71246171" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Keane&amp;oldid=71246171" rel="nofollow">this</a>. Well, an ultra-fan of Keane, called <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluence_1c59.html" title="User:Fluence">Fluence</a> doesn't want that. He wants his article to be his vehicle. That's why he is reverting my edits, saying that Wikipedia is "a place that storates all human knowledge" and apparently can't give any kind of justification for his edits. That's why I am refering here. I try to assume good faith and try to explain as thoroughly as possible to <a href="../../../f/l/u/User_talk%7EFluence_b36c.html#Keane" title="User talk:Fluence">Fluence</a>, but apparently to no avail and he with indifferent tone say that we will probably revert each other till the end of time. That's highly annoying for me, really. I know it's hard for the guy to see his own material, cut out of the band's article, but as far as I'm concerned I as well as many people are not aiming for for biography/books or publicity pages about these bands,but rather extensive, informative and well-formed articles. Thus I really need someone's help, because things get to blows too quickly. I am trying to be as amiable as possible, but my patience also has it limits.</p>

He returned from a long block and an arbCom case and started straight on with aggressive comments. His talk page was protected due to past trolling, I unprotected it to allow dialogue, but I did block him pending some kind of assurance that he intends to actually contribute rather than just arguing, which was the problem before. If I thought this was a lost cause I would not waste your time, I do feel that this is someone who might have a contribution to make but whose past issues with an admin have left him bitter. Some kind words and support would maybe help him to start showing some kind of willingness to work in a more collegiate manner, and respect his restrictions per <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_8bitJake_4a40.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/8bitJake">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/8bitJake</a>, at which point I will happily lift his block, or you can ask any other admin to do so with my full blessing.

<p>(disputant counteraccuses advocee of linkspam), advocee appears to be acting in good faith and feels that rejection of this material is biased. We do have an article on the subject of <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiritual_science.html" title="Spiritual science">spiritual science</a>, and I am researching a resolution that will suit the needs of all parties and the wikipedia.

Problem seems to stem from biting a newcomer who was not familiar with policy re: reliable sources. Advocee states he will purue this at own pace. I have recommended no further action (re mediation or other formal procedure) Closing this case, really nothing else to be done. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">User:Pedant</a> 20:22, 20 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
