<p>I have re-inserted the offending material subtitled as: "Athletic Focus" due to a lack of any sort of discussion on the talk page concerning its deletion or validity. 75.32.63.111 01:26, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The belief that the school focuses more on athletics than academics is untrue and unfounded. While the schools athletic department continues to excel ( this school year marks a second consecutive victory in the state volleyball championship, naming the school 2nd (I believe) in the nation. ), the academic focus is there as well. Almost half of students enrolled are in the AP or IB program, and last year the school graduated 98% of the senior class. 68.89.91.60 23:12, 22 January 2007 (UTC)Hackabusa</p>

<p>The article states that "The intensity of the school rivalry is second in the nation only because no one has died yet." Yes, there is an intense rivalry between AHS and Tascosa, but what does this sentence mean? Second to what? "Second in the nation?" By whose account? I fail to believe that high school rivalries across the nation can be compared, as the author of this sentence seems to imply, on the basis of mortality rates or on any other basis. Any thoughts about this? --abl 10:39, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I have heard of a study which determined the Amarillo High School/ Tascosa High School rivalry to be the 2nd most intense in the nation. Though I regretably do not remember its name. Perhaps someone could find and cite it so that the comment could remain. Mordecai121 17:57, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This section needs to be deleted. The cell phone policy of the AISD is not unique to AHS, and there is NEVER a "student trial" regarding AISD policies "recognized" or not. There is no purpose to this section other then non NPOV criticism of AISD policies. MerrimacVI 17:22, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Though I do agree with Wafulz that Wikipedia should not be used as a means to convey personal opinion, don't Wikipedia guidelines communicate that unproperly sourced material should at first be flagged, not deleted? Though I myself do not know how to insert a citation flag, I would appreciate any other user who took the time. Having been raised in Amarillo, Texas I can attest to the validity of at least some of the material in question. I'm not sure if that aids any sort of informal citation though. Mordecai121 05:25, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I did insert a citation tag on the point of view section but some anonymous contributor deleted. I lost of faith of this article (and a lot of Wikipedia ones) long time so I decided not bring it back. The tag is called {{Not verified}} if you wanna know. --<a href="../../../j/2E/_/User%7EJ._Nguyen_e461.html" title="User:J. Nguyen">J. Nguyen</a> 21:09, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Students are not generally aware of the monitoring and security which takes place before, during and after the pep rallies. Therefore I am certain their edits in this area are not NPOV and lack basic information. Attendance is checked by teachers at the beginning of every class, both before and after the pep rally. Class "roll call" is state law in Texas. The study hall is treated as a separate class, but has no roll sheet for the teacher in charge to check. This is why students are required to sign a roll sheet when attending the pep rally study halls.</p>
<p>This entire section was originally written with bias, trying to make it look like students who chose not to or couldn't attend the pep rallies were segregated and punished. All AISD schools follow the same policy regarding attendance counts for pep rallies, and follow the same policies for study halls, where talking and moving about is NOT allowed.

<p>I've added the POV tag again- many points in the article are strongly biased, leading me to believe this was written by a teenager upset with the school administrators. While many of the comments are generally true, they carry an overly-implied criticism of administrative policy. (I might also mention there are several typos... and the article's not particularly well-written...) --<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstone8824_5493.html" title="User:Sandstone8824">D. Guinness</a> 02:15, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I fully agree with the above, this article is really a tremendous disservice to the school, and the AISD in general. MerrimacVI 15:44, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I agree with this statement, and while I will not go through and fix all said statements, something must be done. This article is atrocious. 68.89.91.60 23:13, 22 January 2007 (UTC)Hackabusa</p>
