<p><b>Amar Singh Chamkila</b> was born as <b>Dunni Ram</b> on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_21.html" title="July 21">July 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1961.html" title="1961">1961</a> in the village of Dugri near <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludhiana.html" title="Ludhiana">Ludhiana</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punjab_%28India%29_6b45.html" title="Punjab (India)">Punjab</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>. The youngest child of Kartar Kaur and Hari Singh, he was educated at Gujar Khan Primary School in Dugri. His aspirations of becoming an <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electrician.html" title="Electrician">electrician</a> were unfulfilled and he found work at a <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludhiana.html" title="Ludhiana">Ludhiana</a> cloth mill. <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surinder_Shinda_4ca9.html" title="Surinder Shinda">Surinder Shinda</a> has said that in 1979, he saw Chamkila for the first time and he was on an old cycle with chapatti in a tea towel. Shinda says that later on he heard him sing in his raw talent and had finally found the protege that he had been looking for.</p>
<p>With a natural aptitude for music, he learned to play the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harmonium.html" title="Harmonium">harmonium</a> and <a href="../../../d/h/o/Dholki.html" title="Dholki">dholki</a> and won himself the opportunity to play alongside Punjabi folk artists such as K. Deep, Mohammad Saddiq and <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surinder_Shinda_4ca9.html" title="Surinder Shinda">Surinder Shinda</a>. He wrote several songs for Shinda and accompanied him as a member of his entourage before deciding to pursue a solo career. It is rumoured that Chamkila was happy enough writing songs, but he wasn't earning enough money to look after his family, so had to start singing.</p>
<p>He was married and subsequently divorced. He had two daughters.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amar_Singh_Chamkila_b13f.html" title="Edit section: Rise to Fame">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Rise to Fame</span></h2>
<p>Adopting the name Amar Singh Chamkila – Chamkila in Punjabi means <i>one that glitters</i> – he partnered up with the female vocalist Surinder Sonia and recorded eight duets. The record was released in 1979 and was produced by Charanjit Ahuja. The cleverly worded songs, which he had written himself, became hits across Punjab and paved the way for the unique lyrical mastery his fans would come to expect.</p>
<p>In 1980, Chamkila left Sonia and established a short-lived stage relationship with Miss Usha. He left Miss Usha in the same year in favor of teaming up with a female folk singer named Amarjot. She would become Chamkila’s permanent singing partner providing the female vocals for his duets, that is, the majority of the songs that he wrote.</p>
<p>Chamkila wrote his own lyrics, the majority of which were boyish, suggestive and titillating, and yet fluent, commentaries on extra-marital affairs, alcohol and drugs. The couple’s appeal grew not only in the Punjab, but they quickly raced to international stardom among Punjabis abroad. By the early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, Chamkila and Amarjot had recorded hugely successful LPs on the <a href="../../../h/m/v/HMV_faa8.html" title="HMV">HMV</a> label and they toured <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dubai.html" title="Dubai">Dubai</a> and <a href="../../../b/a/h/Bahrain.html" title="Bahrain">Bahrain</a>. They were also commonly booked for wedding parties, charging a reported Rs. 4000 per performance, an unprecedented amount for the time.</p>
<p>Much of Chamkila’s success may be attributed to the fan-base he acquired performing in free, open-air <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concerts.html" title="Concerts">concerts</a> (known as <i>akhade</i> in Punjabi) around Punjab. Accompanying the couple would be a harmonium and dholki player and Chamkila would play the <a href="../../../t/u/m/Tumbi.html" title="Tumbi">tumbi</a>, an instrument that he had mastered. The concerts served as a medium for gaining exposure and testing people’s response to new songs that were planned for future recordings. In addition to singing his own songs, Chamkila wrote several songs and sold them to other artists. Some of his songs include 'Main Digie Tilak Ke (Surinder Shinda), 'Nit Banke Patola Aundi-E' (Shinda) and 'Munda Pat Da (Deedar Sandhu).</p>
<p>Starting in 1985, Chamkila and Amarjot released three religious LPs: <i>Baba Tera Nankana</i>, <i>Talwar Main Kalgidhar Di Haan</i> and <i>Naam Jap Le</i>. While the LPs were highly successful, none of the songs featured on them were written by Chamkila. The profits made from these LPs were reportedly donated to charities. His religious album were huge hits and allowed him to be able to sing at religious function and in front of women.</p>
<p>Chamkila’s song <i>Pehle Lalkare Naal</i> was featured in the soundtrack of the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1987.html" title="1987">1987</a> Punjabi film <i>Patola</i>. He also recoreded the song 'Mera Jee Karda' for the Punjabi film 'Dupatta'. Both films faired averagly at the box office, but still increased Chamkila's popularity. He also recorded a music video for one of his songs for the state-owned 'Doordarshan' channel, but after his death his video was taken off the air.</p>
<p>Chamkila and Amarjot recorded in excess of ninety songs before they were killed in Mesumpur, Punjab in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>. At the time of his death, he reportedly had 200 songs that had not been sung or recorded. Of these some were sung on stage shows including 'Dhee Mar Jai Badkar Loko', 'Jatt Di Dushmani' and 'Tere Hik Te Amli'. He also had many solo songs which have been sung in recent times by artists such as Chamak Chamkila, Amar Arshi, his teacher <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surinder_Shinda_4ca9.html" title="Surinder Shinda">Surinder Shinda</a> and songs have featured on Panjabi By Nature's album called 'Ranjha'.</p>

<p>Having arrived to perform in Mesumpur, <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punjab_%28India%29_6b45.html" title="Punjab (India)">Punjab</a>, both Chamkila and Amarjot were gunned down as they exited their vehicle on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_8.html" title="March 8">March 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1988.html" title="1988">1988</a>. A gang of motorcyclists fired several rounds fatally wounding the couple and other members of the entourage.</p>
<p>No arrests were ever made with connection to the shooting and the case was never solved. The reason for the murder is the subject of speculation and is shrouded in mystery.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amar_Singh_Chamkila_b13f.html" title="Edit section: Music">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Music</span></h3>
<p>The appeal of Chamkila’s music prominently lay in both the content of his lyrics and the delivery of those lyrics. The majority of Chamkila’s songs were about extra-marital or other taboo relationships. Chamkila came under frequent criticism citing his work as offensive.</p>
<p>It would be controversial for a current singer to say that they are a fan of Chamkila's work, but a few singers have said this on Punjabi television namely Amrita Virk and <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazzy_B_cce0.html" title="Jazzy B">Jazzy B</a>.</p>
<p>Chamkila had introduced the paradigm of modern day relationships into Punjabi folk music which had, up until then, restricted itself to singing about legendary heroes, warriors and lovers from Punjabi folk-tales. His energetic singing style and the provocative nature of his lyrics are often considered to be the reason for his colossal success.</p>

<p>It is widely reported that Chamkila had been the victim of several death threats. The nature of those threats or the reasoning behind them still remains a mystery. The high-profile murder sparked a frenzy of controversy and speculation. Some of the most prominent theories explaining the killings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to the public’s declining interest in other Punjabi singers in favor of Chamkila, one or more of these artists may have planned for his killing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The taboo content of Chamkila’s lyrics may have led one or more offended individuals to arrange for his death.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Amarjot’s caste, <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tarkhan_%28tribe%29.html" title="Tarkhan (tribe)">Tarkhan</a>, was commonly viewed to be higher than Chamkila’s caste, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chamar.html" title="Chamar">Chamar</a>. Disgraced by Amarjot’s involvement with Chamkila, her family or other individuals may have arranged for the couple’s killing.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Chamkila may have been murdered by an individual whom he rejected to perform for due to a scheduling conflict or otherwise.</li>
