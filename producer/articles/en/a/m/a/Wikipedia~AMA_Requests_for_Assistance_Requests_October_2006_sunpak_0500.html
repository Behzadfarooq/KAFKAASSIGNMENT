<p><b>Have you read the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_FAQs_e346.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA FAQs">AMA FAQ</a>?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Answer:</li>
</ul>
<p><b>How would you describe the nature of this dispute? (policy violation, content dispute, personal attack, other)</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Answer:</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been seeking assistance for weeks, or rather a few months by now. I was blocked yesterday as I attempted to post this and it was deleted today as I am attempting to resolve.</p>
<p>The purpose of my request is immediate assistance to separate username and all references that lead back to users' private life and career from the defamatory comments of a few users. I have repeatedly and publicly requested assistance with this issue, continue to remove a few letters from names that may through search engines lead back to these defamatory comments, and request that this request be left here as I continue to seek assistance in resolving this issue.</p>
<p>Yes, I do talk like a sailor at times. It's the rebel and rocker and artist in me. I don't find profanity as profane in most cases of expressiveness, I am slowly understanding the relatively ,or in my book, extremely conservative nature of wiki rules of civility and profanity. I have yet to understand the power given to a few or one admin. or editor to stop or block and threaten users. I am privy to a much more expressive lifestyle without hindrance, censorship or warnings, . Such is the freedom of the arts by now, though I did get a big Rodney King-type beating for grafitti some 17 years or so ago. I think you will find more unacceptable comments by me in earlier posts, some strongly expressive use of cuss words, and some harsh responses to what I found to be hypocritical and ignorant actions and comments by experienced users. Others googled me, viewed my project and website, and I had no idea how widespread and archival wiki is. So, when I felt hypocrisy early on, I retorted, was blasted, I attempted to remove myself and my project from view, drop that username and establish a new user name. Others involved removed posts that they didn't like, requested that I remove personal info., and then continued using my personal info. As search engines work, I wanted to expunge my name, username and project name from what I considered to be by then libelous and defamatory comments. I walked from this more than a month ago hoping it had blown over, but upon returning from a trip to the eastcoast to perform and paint and shoot new video for above project for nat'l mags, and a trip to vegas and the grand canyon, I find a persistent use of my name, project, etc. by a few users after my repeated request for anonymity. As I said, I see no issue with cuss words, but I will refrain if that will help. I am happily married now to a Japanese lady for 13 years, I have traveled the world for 17 years as a full-time working artist and shown and performed internationally. I have been a white minority overseas for almost 7 years, called a whitenigger repeatedly and understood why and was not offended. I was in ROTC in university, am an eagle scout, etc.., and believe in diversity and freedom. SOme may find the word fuck offensive. I find threats of blocking , deletion of relevent or notable info. moreso offensive. I was in the process of working through this issue over the past few days and was finally at the point of writing to AMA when I think unjustly and without due process blocked. I will email you our string of emails if you'd like. As a public and well googled artist, there is defamatory and libelous content linking to my initial article, project and usernames. Before there is any further damage, I reiterate my request to establish anonymity, as provided&#160;:</p>
<pre>
"Such posting can cause offence or embarrassment to the victim of the
</pre>
<p>&gt; posting, not least because it means that their name, and any personal &gt; criticism or allegations made against them can then appear on web &gt; searches. If you have posted such information, please remove it &gt; immediately. Please then follow the link to this page and inform people &gt; there that the information was posted (but crucially, do not repost it on &gt; that page). An admin or developer can then remove the information from the &gt; archives of Wikipedia." &gt; - &gt; - "Wikipedia operates on the principle that every contributor has a right &gt; if they wish to remain completely anonymous. Wikipedia policy on that &gt; issue is strictly enforced. Posting private information about a user, &gt; specifically their (alleged) name and/or personal details, is strictly &gt; prohibited as harassment, and users who do that are often immediately &gt; blocked from editing Wikipedia." How is it vandalism to attempt to remain &gt; anonymous?! and to attempt to separate personal and professional &gt; reputation from libelous attacks?</p>

<b>What methods of <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">Dispute Resolution</a> have you tried so far? If you can, please provide wikilinks so that the Advocate looking over this case can see what you have done.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Answer:</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been seeking assistance for weeks, or rather a few months by now. The purpose of my request is immediate assistance to separate username and all references that lead back to users' private life and career from the defamatory comments of a few users. I have repeatedly and publicly requested assistance with this issue, requested that the offending users remove all personal info. and info. that leads to my personal info., and continue to remove a few letters from names that may through search engines lead back to these defamatory comments.</p>
<p><br />
<b>What do you expect to get from <a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">Advocacy</a>?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Answer:I request that my comments here remain throughout the course of review and that the deletions of a few letters of my name, usernames and project remain deleted. Yesterday, InShaneee knowingly blocked me as I was attempting to seek assistance from AMA. I have now posted there seeking assistance in this matter, and now include her in my complaint of libel and defamation.</li>

<p>Once this issue is resolved, it is my intent to create and edit articles of artistic nature. As to not editing otherwise other than attempting to avoid further damage due to defamation, I have been out of town for six weeks on two trips with said project and have not visited wiki since my last posts in late Sept.</p>
