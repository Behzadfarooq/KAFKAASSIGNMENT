<p><b>"Amazon Women in the Mood"</b> is the first episode in season three of <i><a href="../../../f/u/t/Futurama.html" title="Futurama">Futurama</a></i>.

When Zoidberg fails to react as expected, the crew conclude that he is dead. Moments later, a pale, squishy Zoidberg enters and explains that he had simply <a href="../../../m/o/u/Moult.html" title="Moult">molted</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Wong_ace1.html" title="Amy Wong">Amy Wong</a>'s cell phone rings, but when she answers it she can only hear panting and gasping. These noises are actually <a href="../../../k/i/f/Kif_Kroker_7593.html" title="Kif Kroker">Kif Kroker</a>, who is consumed by love for Amy but unable to speak to her due to nervousness and shyness. Kif tells his dilemma to his captain, <a href="../../../z/a/p/Zapp_Brannigan_07ab.html" title="Zapp Brannigan">Zapp Brannigan</a>, who provides little in the way of sympathy or useful advice. Spying a picture of Amy, however, Zapp realizes that she and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turanga_Leela_e38c.html" title="Turanga Leela">Leela</a> know each other. Still infatuated with Leela, Zapp "generously" agrees to go on a double date: Kif with Amy and Zapp with Leela.</p>
<p>Leela agrees only as a favor to Amy, but insists that it is only a "half-double-date." The four go to a fashionable restaurant on board a space liner. When a nervous Kif takes Zapp's idiotic advice about seducing women, Amy storms off from the table. Forlorn, Kif takes to a nearby <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karaoke.html" title="Karaoke">karaoke</a> stage and sings a heartfelt rendition of "<a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_Eclipse_of_the_Heart_308f.html" title="Total Eclipse of the Heart">Total Eclipse of the Heart</a>." The gesture clearly touches Amy, but Zapp hijacks the stage and launches into a performance that sends the passengers and crew of the ship fleeing in terror. Zapp insists he can steer the restaurant-ship (claiming that the restaurant is "built like a steakhouse, but she handles like a bistro") and proceeds to crash it into planet Amazonia. All four of them are captured by the giant native women, a species first seen in the episode "<a href="../../../b/r/a/Brannigan_Begin_Again_edeb.html" title="Brannigan Begin Again">Brannigan Begin Again</a>".</p>
<p>After hearing about the restaurant-ship crash when trying to call ("The number you have dialed has crashed into a planet, please make note of it"), <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_J._Fry_06d6.html" title="Philip J. Fry">Fry</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/n/Bender_Bending_Rodr%C3%ADguez_830a.html" title="Bender Bending Rodríguez">Bender</a> take off in the <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet_Express_Ship_1fef.html" title="Planet Express Ship">Planet Express Ship</a> to find Leela and Amy. After a rough landing, they make their way to the Amazonian's city. Due to an unfortunate choice of hiding place, they end up captured as well. The Amazonians resolve to take the men to their leader, the Femputer (voiced by <a href="../../../b/e/a/Bea_Arthur_00d5.html" title="Bea Arthur">Bea Arthur</a>).</p>
<p>The Femputer sentences the men to death by "<b>snu-snu</b>" (i.e. sex, with death resulting from exhaustion and/or crushing of the <a href="../../../p/e/l/Pelvis.html" title="Pelvis">pelvic</a> <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bone.html" title="Bone">bones</a>), which causes some mixed feelings for Fry and Zapp. Bender is released, as he is not technically a man, but rather a man-bot ("Check the crotch—see, nothin'!"). Fry, Zapp, and Kif are taken off to the snu-snu chambers and <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stripped.html" title="Stripped">stripped</a> to their underwear. Kif is taken first because the Amazon women find him the most attractive. Kif then tells Amy that Zapp was the one who gave him the lecherous pick-up lines and confesses that he was the one who kept calling Amy in the past few months. Leela sends Bender to try to reprogram the Femputer (although he only agrees when Amy scolds him in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantonese.html" title="Cantonese">Cantonese</a>). Bender begins "reprogramming" by repeatedly hitting the machine with a lead pipe, and finds that the Femputer is a front for a fembot.</p>
<p>Amy sneaks into Kif's snu-snu chamber dressed as an Amazonian on a pair of stilts, finding him hanging from the ceiling to get away. She grabs him, fleeing with Kif in Amy's arms, but the Amazonians chase them back to the Femputer's chamber. Bender is inside, making out with the fembot. The two voices coming from the Femputer confuse the Amazonians; the Fembot and Bender (posing as Femputer) have everyone released, and Bender throws in a command that they gather lots of gold for him. Back on Earth, Fry and Zapp receive treatment for their severe pelvic injuries. After Fry and Zapp comment about their experience, Kif then asks Amy what they could do next. Amy whispers something (presumably "snu-snu") to Kif and the episode fades out with the heavy panting and gasping that he had made to her in his phone calls.</p>
<p>A minor subplot of this episode involves Dr. Zoidberg trying to get a replacement for his molted shell. The <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet_Express_60fd.html" title="Planet Express">Planet Express</a> insurance plan will only allow him to buy a cheap gray one with a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_code.html" title="Bar code">bar code</a>. Later on, he mysteriously finds a shell identical to his old one, in the very same <a href="../../../d/u/m/Dumpster.html" title="Dumpster">Dumpster</a>, but with a live <a href="../../../r/a/c/Raccoon.html" title="Raccoon">raccoon</a> inside (at this point he slurps disturbingly).</p>

<ul>
<li>When Zap says "The spirit is willing but the flesh is spongy and bruised," it's a reference to the phrase "The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak." This idiom was first recorded in the New Testament (Matthew 26:41)</li>
<li>The title of this episode comes from the 1987 <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedy_film.html" title="Comedy film">comedy film</a> <i><a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazon_Women_on_the_Moon_f738.html" title="Amazon Women on the Moon">Amazon Women on the Moon</a></i>.</li>
<li>The Femputer being just a false front operated by a hidden, non-omnipotent operator is a reference to the title character in the film of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Wizard_of_Oz_%281939_film%29_b6ac.html" title="The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)">The Wizard of Oz</a></i>, down to the hand-operated controls and outdated microphone. The hidden operator also appears in Ijon Tichys eleventh Voyage from <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanis%C5%82aw_Lem_c9b6.html" title="Stanisław Lem">Stanisław Lems</a> <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Star_Diaries_02d2.html" title="The Star Diaries">The Star Diaries</a></i>, in which Ijon Tichy travels in disguise to the planet Circia to attempt to bring an end to hostilities coming from its robot population. See also the reference in <i><a href="../../../f/e/a/Fear_of_a_Bot_Planet_58d3.html" title="Fear of a Bot Planet">Fear of a Bot Planet</a></i></li>
<li>Several of the electronics on Amazonia are named <b>Sonya</b>, a parody of electronics companies <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sony.html" title="Sony">Sony</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanyo.html" title="Sanyo">Sanyo</a>, as well as the comic strip warrior princess <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Sonja_b3e4.html" title="Red Sonja">Red Sonja</a>.</li>
<li>In one of the scene where Kif has his shirt off, we see that he has a third nipple.</li>
<li>When searching the jungle, Fry and Bender find a large empty can of <a href="../../../t/a/b/Tab_%28soft_drink%29.html" title="Tab (soft drink)">TaB</a> cola.</li>
<li>Zapp Brannigan's spoken-word rendition of "<a href="../../../l/o/l/Lola_%28song%29.html" title="Lola (song)">Lola</a>" by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Kinks_a7b7.html" title="The Kinks">The Kinks</a> (with "Leela" replacing the title character) is reminiscent of similar performances by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shatner_9433.html" title="William Shatner">William Shatner</a>. Although Zapp appears oblivious to the implications of the original song's lyrics, (which is about a man who is attracted to a woman who turns out to be a man) this might be considered a reference to the earlier episode "<a href="../../../w/a/r/War_is_the_H-Word_c01e.html" title="War is the H-Word">War is the H-Word</a>" (in which Zapp is attracted to Leela while she is disguised as male soldier "Lee Lemon") or "<a href="../../../p/u/t/Put_Your_Head_on_My_Shoulders_e0fa.html" title="Put Your Head on My Shoulders">Put Your Head on My Shoulders</a>" (in which Zapp's date at the restaurant is clearly a man dressed as a woman).</li>
<li>Bea Arthur, who provides the voice of the Femputer, was an outspoken women's rights activist for much of the 70s.</li>
<li>The plot of this episode bears several similarities to that of the 1970 film <i><a href="../../../c/a/r/Carry_On_Up_the_Jungle_378a.html" title="Carry On Up the Jungle">Carry On Up the Jungle</a></i>.</li>
<li>Zapp says the restaurant-ship is 'built like a steakhouse, but she handles like a bistro,' a possible reference to the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bistromathic_drive.html" title="Bistromathic drive">Starship Bistromath</a> from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_539c.html" title="The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></i>.</li>
<li>The restaurant, called "Le Palm D'Orbit", is a reference to the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palme_d%27Or_2709.html" title="Palme d'Or">Palme d'Or</a> awarded at the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cannes_Film_Festival_715f.html" title="Cannes Film Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>. The building itself strongly resembles the "Theme Building" (home to the "Encounter Restaurant") at the <a href="../../../l/o/s/Los_Angeles_International_Airport_1053.html" title="Los Angeles International Airport">Los Angeles International Airport</a>.</li>
<li>The impact tremors of the approaching Amazon women causing ripples in a cup of water and a puddle is a reference to the film <i><a href="../../../j/u/r/Jurassic_Park_%28film%29_8414.html" title="Jurassic Park (film)">Jurassic Park</a></i>, in which the approaching <i><a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyrannosaurus.html" title="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a></i> causes the same phenomenon.</li>
<li>The punishment of "death by snu-snu" is similar to the well-known joke involving two male explorers who find a jungle tribe, and are subsequently condemned, being given a choice of death or "oonga-boonga". One chooses Oonga-boonga and is sodomized by all of the male tribe members. The second declares that to spare his dignity, he would rather choose death. And the tribe declares "Death...by Oonga-boonga!"</li>

<li>In Kif's flashback to the night he and Amy met, Bender drops something in the trash on his way into the Planet Express building. This is likely the bracelet that had belonged to the Countess de la Roca (see "<a href="../../../a/_/f/A_Flight_to_Remember_4199.html" title="A Flight to Remember">A Flight to Remember</a>"), which Bender had just learned was junk jewelry.</li>
