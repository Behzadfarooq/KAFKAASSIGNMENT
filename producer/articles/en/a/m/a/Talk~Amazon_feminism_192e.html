<p>I find the end of the first sentence somewhat confusing:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Amazon feminism is dedicated to the image of the female hero in fiction and in fact, as it is expressed in art and literature in the physiques and feats of female athletes, martial artists and other powerfully built women, <i>and in gender-related and sexual orientations.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Isn't there something missing, and/or shouldn't "gender related" and "sexual orientation" be somewhat expanded?

<p>No! Just kidding.</p>
<p>~Author</p>
<hr />
<p><br />
Just out of curiosity, a few weeks ago I did a google search on amazon feminism.</p>
<p>The results were not what I had expected.</p>
<p>The sole expression of amazon feminism I found on the net, including the newsgroups (this article did not show up in a google search, I saw it when I followed a feminism link from another article) is in Cindy Tittle Moore's soc.feminism FAQ. It is replicated and mentioned many places on the net, but there is no trace of Amazon Feminism anywhere on the net other than the soc.feminism FAQ and it's clones and derivitaves. Cindy Tittle Moore is one of the soc.feminism moderators.</p>
<p>Since feminism is well represented on the net, in blogs, and in the newsgroups, I find the lack of any basis for amazon feminism other than the soc.feminism FAQ inexplicable, unless amazon feminism has no other existance beyond the soc.feminism FAQ.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that there is no such feminism, or that if it exists in theory, there are no groups of women who identify as such in reality. Your mileage of course will vary.</p>
<p>When time allows, I plan to research the other feminisms listed in the FAQ. I suspect that amazon feminism is not unique in this regard.</p>
<p>One more note, the article lists the origins in an anthology dated 1999.</p>
<p>It's been part of the soc.feminism FAQ since it's origin near as I can tell, which I would guess to be somewhere around 1992-1993.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Well, off the top of my head, I can't remember if the next word after "amazon" is "feminism" in <a href="../../../d/2E/a/D.A._Clarke_1346.html" title="D.A. Clarke">D.A. Clarke</a>'s "A Woman With a Sword" essay, but that does certainly discuss this amazon phenomenon. Original version of that essay's from 1991. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 20:15, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p><br />
I'm not sure how an article by a radical feminist, one who supports violence *by* women (which, come to think of it, is no longer radical feminist thought) translates into a phenomenon.</p>
<p>If you can show me that said "amazon feminism" exists, in fact, rather than as an aspect of feminist theory and rhetoric, I'd love to see your evidence. I looked the first time I saw Cindy Tittle Moore's FAQ, and found nothing. I searched again a while ago, and found numerous versions of the soc.feminism FAQ on the net, but not one shred of evidence for an amazon feminism.</p>
<p>BTW, if you are asserting that feminism is pro-violence *by* women, I agree. Violence by men they have a different take on. As a victim of violence by a woman I find the outright hatred of men and support for the worst crimes by women to be matters of great concern. Feminism is a hate movement. No hated of men, violence by women against men, murder of men, or theft of men's lives and family will upset feminists, or women in general. The radical feminism of yesterday is the unremarkable plain vanilla feminism of today. Valerie Solanis would be proud. Her manifesto has become reality for many many women, including apparently your feminist source above, D.A. Clarke.</p>
<p>But insofar as the existence of anything called amazon feminism, it seems to exist as an idea, as words on paper (or the modern equivalant, text on a screen). While this is a kind of existance I'll grant, amazon feminism not being portrayed as an idea. Xena is not real.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>If the idea's sufficiently discussed, even if just in an academic context, that an identifiable concept coalesces, I see no reason to consider that conept unencyclopedic simply because noone self-references themselves that way. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 01:34, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p><br />
I think it important for encyclopedias to not refer to unicorns as real animals, no matter how well defined the idea. That is, if it's a real encyclopedia, and not an advocacy source for which reality is not only undesirable but actively discouraged.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>You've lost me. What in particular is the change you want made? I'm having trouble figuring out what specific edits to this article you're proposing, which makes it difficult for me to agree or disagree with you. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 06:02, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p><br />
I don't understand the confusion. Look, here's the very first sentance from the wiki entry for unicorn.</p>
<ul>
<li>The unicorn is a legendary creature embodied like a horse, but slender and with a single — usually spiral — horn growing out of its forehead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless you can show that this amazon feminism exists as other than an invention of the human mind, why not refer to it accuratly and honestly?</p>
<p>Is amazon feminism real? It exists as a concept, obviously. But is it real, are there real women who pray at this altar? I've not been able to find any. All the references I've been able to find are either direct copies of Cindy Tittle Moore's soc.feminism FAQ, or clear derivative works of the same source.</p>
<p>Is there any real movement of Amazon feminists? No that I can find. Somewhat contrarily they (feminists) all seem to have jumped on the victim bandwagon and are claiming to be the victims of violence by those iccky men. Now there is massive evidence for this everywhere. Read the VAWA for starters. No one pushes Xena around, but American women mostly wallflowers who faint if a dirty joke is told at work.</p>
<p>Xena, if I have to say it, is fiction. Not even good fiction IMHO, but women seem to like it. So, apparently, is this Amazon feminism. Why not refer to it as such?</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/a/Talk%7EAmazon_feminism_192e.html" title="Edit section: Amazon feminism exists">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Amazon feminism exists</span></h2>
<p>I identify as an Amazon feminist, someone who seeks physical expression of feminism, seeks to strengthen the physical world of women and supports female heroism. Certainly, the rise of women in sports, military combat and other expressions of female strength are an expression of Amazon feminism. We are really only now starting to evolve after thousands of years of oppression. I don't think it's going to happen overnight, but if you compare women now to women a few hundred years ago, you'll see we're evolving into stronger beings. I think in the next few hundred years we'll evolve even more. It's already started and gained good momentum, I'm proud of it and honored to be part of it. All feminists do not cringe at jokes in the workplace, but many do like to treat people with respect and expect the same in return. That is not weakness, but strength and I'm tired of hearing slurs hurled toward feminism when the things people criticize are actually great virtues. The liberal value of speaking to people with some respect is a strength and a discipline. Anyone who's studied martial arts knows that honor and respect for other people is one of the highest virtues you can aspire to.</p>
<p>The idea of strengthening our physical selves would solve a lot of problems for women - domestic violence, sexual assault and give us the arsenal to protect our children and families. Also physical strength and the confidence to express it, does something to your mental world. It gives you confidence even in non-combative situations to express yourself and defend your deepest truths freely with the security of your physical strength to back you up. I do believe that there's an instinctive fear that women are accustomed to, and this fear is the cause of many women who tend to adapt rather than fight for what's important to them. Those of us who gain the confidence of inner and outer strength, feel freer to express difference of opinion without instinctive recitince or fear. It's just been my personal experience that it lifts the habitual carefulness in the way women move in the world. Amazon feminism is the exciting possibility for a future direction of feminism. We've accomplished some goals, this is one of the frontiers we could further explore. I think it's an inspiring branch of feminism.</p>

<dd><i>I identify as an Amazon feminist</i>...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore you posit the existence of a movement? Either it exists or it does not and no single woman makes a movement (of any kind).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Feminism today is composed of perpetual victims of the evil male heteropatriarchy, not heroines.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And even the Amazon feminists endorse and support violence against men. Let's face it, you feminists see violence by women as good and violence by men as evil.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The idea of strengthening our physical selves would solve a lot of problems for women - domestic violence, sexual assault and give us the arsenal to protect our children and families.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ignoring the fact that without steroids women don't gain muscle mass like men from excercise, who's gonna protect your children and families from your violence? I'm sure you see female violence as a positive thing. That women who killed her lesbian lover's son because he would not call her father must be a feminist heroine. But there are some radical dissadents (like me) who won't sugar coat and excuse any and all violence by women.</dd>

<p>Wait, I don't get it. How does "Amazon Feminism" differ from Misandry? Also, why is this associated with Ayn Rand? Did anyone here read Atlas Shrugged or the Fountainhead? Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to the idea of "Amazon Feminism"... Why is there no link to Camille Paglia? Why is there no mention of the New Left (which Ayn Rand opposes)? Is there any connection between forms of Lesbianism and Sappho with Amazon Feminism? Also, why is Valerie Solanas not mentioned? I mean, has anyone read her SCUM manifesto? Pure "Amazon Feminism" Rhetoric... Unlike Ayn Rand... Dante the Bard 07:56, 22 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
