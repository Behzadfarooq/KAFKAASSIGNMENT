It focuses mainly on electronic, information, and communication technologies. It is one of the brands of the AMA Education Group. It uses a trimestral calendar where a typical four year collegiate education program under a semestral calendar is completed in only 3 years and 3 months.</p>
<p>The AMA Education Group is considered as one of the fastest growing educational institutions in the Philippines with an annual completion rate of 3000-4000 graduates. However this institution is also one of the lowest in terms of student loyalty with less than 100 participants attending the alumni homecoming and other extra-curricular programs.</p>

<p>AMA Computer University was founded by Dr. Amable R. Aguiluz V, who named it after his father, Amable M. Aguiluz, Sr. Dr. Aguiluz resolved to educate the computer market based on his experience in computer sales. Aguiluz founded the AMA Institute of Computer Studies with first computer school along Shaw Boulevard on <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_20.html" title="October 20">October 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>. At that time, AMA Institute of Computer Studies offered short-term courses in Electronic Data Processing Fundamentals, Basic Programming, and Technology Career. Only 13 students enrolled at the AMA Institute of Computer Studies during the first semester.</p>

<p>AMA Computer College came into existence in June 1981. It extended its services through a four-year <a href="../../../b/a/c/Bachelor_of_Science_1c0e.html" title="Bachelor of Science">Bachelor of Science</a> degree in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Computer_Science_86f4.html" title="Computer Science">Computer Science</a>. With only a handful of students in its first year of administration, the AMACC student population rose dramatically from 600 in 1983 to 2,000 in 1985 in its first official campus in <a href="../../../m/a/k/Makati_City_423e.html" title="Makati City">Makati City</a>. Shortly after, it established its main campus in <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quezon_City_6fb6.html" title="Quezon City">Quezon City</a>. Two provincial campuses were then founded in <a href="../../../c/e/b/Cebu_City_3bc2.html" title="Cebu City">Cebu</a> and <a href="../../../s/i/l/Silicon_Gulf_d475.html" title="Silicon Gulf">Silicon Gulf</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/Davao.html" title="Davao">Davao</a>.</p>
<p>With the passage of the Philippine <a href="../../../h/i/g/Higher_Education_Act_a409.html" title="Higher Education Act">Higher Education Act</a> of 1994, privately controlled educational institutions' academic fees were deregulated. AMA solved the problem of low student population by embarking on an aggressive marketing, advertising and information campaign. With this type of strategy, profit-oriented schools started to grow.</p>
<p>The emergence of AMACC also led to the birth of AMA Computer Learning Center (ACLC) in 1986 and AMA Telecommunication &amp; Electronic Learning Center in 1996. The former engages in offering short-course programs for professionals and two-year technical/vocational courses for those who wish to acquire employment skills. The latter is the one of the first schools in the Philippines to concentrate on telecommunication, electronics, and related technology.</p>
<p>AMA has adopted a principle of being the first to do things. It was the first school in the country to fully integrate Internet in its curriculum. Internet services were provided to all its campuses. Since 1987, all major AMA colleges have been interconnected through a <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_area_network.html" title="Local area network">local area network</a> (LAN), which virtually converted them into one nationwide school system. AMA is also the first and only school in the country to have successfully held a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teleconference.html" title="Teleconference">teleconference</a> between its <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school.html" title="High school">high school</a> students and another high school class in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> in 1994.</p>
<p>In 1991, Aguiluz was able to gain full accreditation for AMA Computer College in the American League of Colleges and Universities (ALOCU), thus, making AMA the first Filipino and non-American school to be so honored. Moreover, AMACC became an official member of the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_F._Kennedy_9798.html" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> Educational Institute in Japan. AMACC is also accredited by the National Computer Center of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.</p>

The certification was given formally by SG-ICS in March 1999.</p>
<p>This means that AMACC’s quality Management System has been assessed and registered as it fulfills the requirements of <a href="../../../i/s/o/ISO_9001_07ef.html" title="ISO 9001">ISO 9001</a>. The ISO certification is being maintained. It is also monitored by assessors every six months.</p>
<p>AMACC Quezon City was conferred with University Status by the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commission_on_Higher_Education_1efa.html" title="Commission on Higher Education">Commission on Higher Education</a> (CHED) on August 20, 2001. AMA Computer College of Quezon City became AMA Computer University.</p>
<p>Sometime in 2004, AMA Computer University inked a partnership with <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carnegie_Mellon_University_d56e.html" title="Carnegie Mellon University">Carnegie Mellon University</a>'s <i>iCarnegie</i> to use its curriculum and courses through e-learning. As stated by iCarnegie President and CEO Allan Fisher, "the academic relationship between STI and iCarnegie went well, the business side of the agreement did not go as planned". <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1999, a student from AMA Computer College Makati named Onel de Guzman submitted a thesis proposal for the creation of a program that will hack into computer systems and extracting vital information, particularly Internet Service accounts. <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> The proposal was unanimously rejected by the College of Computer Studies academic board.

<p>On November 12, 2004, 23 Philippine nursing schools were disqualified, including AMA Computer College, Makati. CHED chairman Rolando dela Rosa ordered these schools to close. The 23 schools were not granted permits (upon recommendation of Technical Committee for Nursing Education (TCNE) and regional offices) because they failed to comply with these requirements: a qualified dean, a compliant curriculum, a faculty staff with masteral degree in nursing, a base hospital where students can hold their actual training.

It draws its inspiration from old universities in the western world that spurred rapid development in the Host Township and created neighborhoods that are safe, liveable and walkable. It adopts the Telepolis Concept that will create a township which is a translation of the Information Age Technology in built space instead of cyber space.<sup class="noprint"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The University Town will serve as another type of multi-use development, a primary institutional complex in a park-like setting.</p>
<p>A network of open space and walkable distances from once destination to the other is laid out primarily to encourage the end-users to walk instead of using motorized vehicles.</p>
<p>Another design concept is the integration of technology and nature.</p>

<dd>A network of open areas and sheltered places supports IT Activities through utilities that allow hooking up to the internet service and power supply for computer notebook users. The hub also pertains to other areas like the Internet cafes, bars, clubhouses, cooperative houses or student joints.

<li><b>Town Center.</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>A township in itself, the town center will serve the more commercial needs of the university such as retail, entertainment, neighborhood services and computer-related activities which can be found within a walking distance from any point of origin. The idea is to achieve a self-contained development and at the same time to service the other neighboring communities in the vicinity.</dd>
