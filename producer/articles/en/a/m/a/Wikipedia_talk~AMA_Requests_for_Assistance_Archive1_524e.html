<p>My reading of the arbit judgment was that you have been banned from editing there for a period of one year starting in March 2005. Are you seeking an appeal of that decision?Gator(talk) 17:08, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I guess that's what I'm seeking. Is there some sort of procedure for parole or time off for good behavior, or something? This ruling was slightly more than 7 months ago, and I don't think I've caused any problems since then, so it'd be nice if we could just lift this ban now rather than waiting 5 months. <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Anthony_DiPierro_017e.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> 18:56, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I would still ask the ArbCom it they would mind changing their decision first. If they say no, then we could appeal. Izehar 19:39, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I just moved your request. Normal procedure in these cases is to appeal to <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> who can veto arb com decisions. Or, I could informally ask the arb com to consider amending their decision because you have sincerely repented and will not be disruptive again and their decision is too harsh etc. Izehar 17:14, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I guess I could try talking to Jimmy Wales again. I contacted him a few months ago (July 11, 2005) about this, and he said he'd get back to me (in a week or two), but he must have forgotten, cause I didn't hear from him again. But I'd rather go to the arb com directly rather than go over their head like that. <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Anthony_DiPierro_017e.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Anthony DiPierro">anthony</a> 18:59, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I see. I'll write something to give the ArbCom saying that you have behaved impeccably for the past seven months and that you would like to be able to edit Wikipedia project pages again, under supervision at first if necessary. Call it "time off for good conduct". I wouldn't play the "Jimbo Wales card" yet, but save it in case the ArbCom refuse. I'm sure Jimbo Wales would allow you to edit project pages again, I mean seven months is long enough and you have behaved well in the meantime. I'll post the ArbCom letter here once I have written it, and if you say it's OK, I'll post it on the Clarification Section of the RFAr. If you like though, you could write something for them.

No, I am not asking anyone else to be my advocate, Sam Spade, although, you really should have read my own honest response to "Texture"'s typical slanderous and "false-witnessing", first, and before your own posting of that comment. -Paul Vogel</p>

PS-BTW: Actually, some of those "criticisms" links for <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> were actually your idea, Sam Spade, remember? The actual and only point of my posting these "criticisms" links to <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> was only to NPOV have the two very false and slanderously pov links to <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmotheism.html" title="Cosmotheism">Cosmotheism</a> that were posted by "David Gerard" deleted, both for NPOV and to demonstrate that no such pov biased and to protest that no such pov double-standards should be allowed to stand within ANY religious Wikipedia articles.&#160;:D</p>
<dl>
<dd>That's just it: we <i>want</i> political correctness. That's part of NPOV. NPOV is not puttingin one POV section and balancing it out with another, it's keeping the whole article neutral. The Anti-Semitic site you linked to is insane nonsense about how the Jews secretly control the world, while the Cosmotheism criticisms were about Cosmotheism. That site had no information to contribute about the Jews and Judaism, it was just saying that they're all evil (well, no <i>true</i> information).</dd>

<p>That’s a POV of your own, Calmy. I dislike PC about as much as Paul does, to be honest. Your statements about his site are also POV, but I have to say, it’s not a particularly coherent site, and all the broken links and other foolishness make me rather skeptical myself, despite the high Google rating. And now that your case is pretty much decided, I feel comfortable pointing out why I recused myself from your case, Paul. It was because you personally were making sure it was unwinnable, and I would assume you were doing so consciously. From what I saw on the mailing list, you managed to provoke Jimbo himself, much less the various arbitrators involved. With that sort of a deficit to work with, I really didn't feel able to justify continuing on.</p>
<p>I would like to point out to you Paul that since Cosmotheism see's God in every one of us, that would include Black folks and Jews. Heck, even Commies exist, and are therefore an aspect of God. If, as a white person you feel closer to God, I would hope that we could judge that by your fruits. Rather than being angry and yelling at commies, I find it best to focus on doing what good and charity that we can, assisting those we love. And in the end, when God is All, we should have some basic good will and charity towards everyone. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Spade_ae8e.html" title="User:Sam Spade">Sam</a> <a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESam_Spade_3418.html" title="User talk:Sam Spade"><b>Spade</b></a> 02:51, 8 May 2004 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Organizing the requests page</span></h2>
<p>I altered the format of the requests page from horizontal lines to level-3 headers. I dunno about anyone else, but I found it tedious to have to carefully scroll the page to find the particular issue I wanted to look at. Now the headers are prominent, and TOCed to boot.</p>
<p>I wonder if we should consider an organization scheme for open requests, a la the table at Requests for Arbitration, and track whether the request has been rejected as invalid (a la "fix the poetry page"), currently being researched, currently in mediation or arbitration, resolved, etc.</p>

<p>The improvement of organization is good, although I would prefer to avoid the "vs." formulation if at all possible. It could foster combativeness, and I think of the AMA's purpose as helping people deal with disputes, not propagating them. The "re:" formulation would generally be better, I think.</p>
<p>As for archiving matters, I don't know that it's terribly necessary. I don't see this as quite so formal and legalistic a venue as Requests for Arbitration, and people can always look at the page history for older material. As long as there has been communication on the matter, if possible, with the person making the request, that seems like enough. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 18:12, 22 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree, I think we should be responsible to the requests that have been made of us, and catalog and track them until their issue has been resolved.</dd>
<dd>As for the "vs." format, I don't know why you would object. AMA is specifically here to assist with the Wikipedia:Dispute resolution|]] process, so any valid request of us is going to be related to some dispute between two members.

<p>This requesting page needs a reorganization urgently.

<p>Hi, can someone explain me what's the difference between a Request and an Open Request and the difference between Closed &amp; Responded?

<dd>No one has seemed to object&#160;:) so I've tried to come up with an organization method to this page to better let us prioritize our current requests. I've refined it a bit. Unassigned/untaken requests are at the top, where requestors enter them. An issue where an advocate has agreed to start a discussion with the requesting user I've been putting under "Responded issues". If an issue has been resolved, or advocate involvement has halted, then I move it to Closed issues, which will eventually presumably move into an archive page. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Changing request titles</span></h2>
<p>Originally on the AMA requests page, requestors added a simple paragraph about their request, and we asked them to separate their requests with a horizontal line.</p>
<p>IMO this made the page hard to follow and even harder to find a particular request. So, I started adding meaningful titles to each request, so that they would be easily identifiable (as well as available quickly via the TOC).</p>
<p>Since I've done that, new requests have come in with their own titles. Since my intent of putting titles on requests was so that they could be easily identified with a brief but comprehensive summary of the nature of the dispute and the parties involved, I've changed some of those titles to fit a regular and clear pattern.</p>
<p>This practice has upset one user, who argues that by chaning the title of his entry, I've misrepresented his words. (In fact, I don't believe my title misrepresents the dispute he raises at all.)</p>
<p>But above all, this is a request page for the AMA, which serves a dual role as a tool for communication as well as an organization tool for advocates to identify cases where they are needed.</p>
<p>So, what is the AMA's opinion on my practice of adding/altering titles to requests for better identification, and how does WP convention relate to it?</p>

<dd>I believe the practice at Requests for arbitration, and Requests for mediation as well, has been that the arbitrators/mediators do sometimes edit these section headings for clarity. That may not necessarily dictate practice for the AMA, but I don't see why you shouldn't continue.

<ul>
<li>This is not a space for dispute resolution. Arguments or other discussion between litigants does not belong here. Individuals referred to in requests may add one opposing statement if they also intend to request advocacy.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Reqeusts for advocacy should state the nature of the dispute, any participants, and what sort of advocacy they desire (any details such as full representation, co-representation, procedural advice, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Advocates (when in this space, acting as advocates) do not perform mediation or arbitration; though if accepted as advocate they can aid the member in initiating the process through the proper channels.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This is not a talk page; all requests are informational submissions to the AMA, and the AMA will summarize, organize, and otherwise manage requests and their content to further their ability to perform their work.</li>

Cases are referred to as In re &lt;USERNAME&gt; instead of the adversarial &lt;USER 1&gt; vs. &lt;USER 2&gt;. A brief statement of the issue is placed on the Request page. When the request is picked up by an individual advocate, the advocate moves it into its own project page with talk space and would move the summary into the Answered Request section with a link to the actual project page, thus keeping the clutter on the main page to a minimum. Closed cases with summary of the dispute and resolution move to the Closed Requests section and an appropriate template flags the individual case page as 'Closed'. I will work on a proposed format somewhere and will update this page when I have it ready. <a href="../../../k/c/9/User%7EKc9cqj_c586.html" title="User:Kc9cqj">KC9CQJ</a> 22:42, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Robert the Bruce vs ArbCom</span></h2>
<p>I wish to place on record my thanks relating to the efforts of Advocate Wally with regard to my Request for Arbitration it was sincerely appreciated. Arising out of the RfA experience I would suggest the AMA consider a few points with regard to arbitration. Firstly there is no doubt that despite the structured legalistic template used during a RfA the committee itself discharges its duties more like a Roman Emperor with a thumbs up or down than producing any coherent judgement. The time and efforts of advocates are then really meaningless where the evidence is not seriously considered. I notice Keith Tyler has been putting in a lot of work in reorganising the AMA and good luck to him too. I would suggest however that before you go much further you extract an undertaking from the current ArbCom that they are indeed going to take their role as arbitrators seriously and going to really consider the evidence and issue a judgement of sorts rather than just a thumbs up or down. - Robert the Bruce 06:26, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>IMO an advocate should do everything they can to ensure arbitrators are examining evidence. To that end, advocates also need to examine the evidence, and be sure to comment on any that are being ignored or are suspect -- and not just on the Evidence page. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<ul>
<li>When I realised the problem was the ArbCom through the cavalier manner the motions Advocate Wally presented were dismissed there was little point in continuing with the AMA support when ArbCom does not even bother going through the motions of some sort of respectable process.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There is an issue which maybe is worthy or discussion here and that relates to recusal. It is quite clear that Raul654 was involved with the complainant in the lead up to the second RfA request and as the first acceptance that there was a conflict of interest. It was to be expected that Raul would not voluntarily recuse himself as that would be/could be seen as an admission of complicity but the ArbCom did nothing. It is therefore necessary to add a process where should an “affected party” call for an arbitrator to recuse himself and he declines that a vote by the remaining active members of the ArbCom be mandatory. A ruling with explanation must be published with the result of the vote (with all the provisions for minority views etc etc) and ArbCom must have the power to remove the particular arbitrator from the case.</dd>
</dl>

<dd>This and other checks and balances are required to address the issue of “quis custodiet ipsos custodies”.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree with Robert. It's a hole on the ArbCom rules that must be fixed. Obviously, some could say that the affected party can always contact the arbitrator by his talk page, but doing that it's a kind of pressure on the arbitrator. Arbitrator should know they <b>have</b> to recuse if they were involved on the dispute somehow and it's a shame if this is not respected. --<a href="../../../i/m/a/User%7EImaglang_ddb6.html" title="User:Imaglang">Neigel von Teighen</a> 23:14, 13 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While I thank Robert for his kind words (at the same time acknowledging that my style of presenting the case was not exactly the sort the ArbCom found preferable, and that I'm afraid I did some harm for that reason), I disagree that, in general, the ArbCom itself was wrong on this case. I very much believe in both of the preliminaries I offered, and still do, and believe Raul654 was wrong not to recuse himself (especially considering the ban which the ArbCom is not considering in his case, which to be perfectly fair Raul has not voted upon). However I am not convinced that the ArbCom as a whole was at fault. Recusal is a personal decision. Failure to do so appropriately might be grounds for appeal. Anything else is irrelevant, to my mind.</dd>

<p>In these circumstances, could Raul654's failure to recuse have prejudiced Robert's chance of a fair hearing? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 04:05, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Tony, If Raul654 has not voted because he feels a twinge of guilt then perhaps there is some possibility of redemption. But sadly he has shown both poor judgement and a lack of integrity in getting involved with EB in the first place and then to do a "Bill Clinton" and try to brazen it out. It has happened and he will get away with it ... but it should not be allowed to happen again. That is what the point of this is ... to close this particular loop hole and begin to hold members to a higher standard intergity than is currently being displayed. - Robert the Bruce 16:58, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well maybe there are points in which Raul's vote would have affected the decision. It's difficult for us to say that at present because voting is ongoing and the above tallies may shift (apart from the acceptance and the temporary injunction, which are final). However it looks like Raul has been very wary of playing much role in the case since acceptance. If his vote is subtracted from any of the above, the decisions made (provisional as they are) would not be affected. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 04:24, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I am not attempting to draw discussion of the merits of my ArbCom case. All I wished to raise was the issue of recusal ... for the rest there is nothing one can do about the kangaroo court process. The issue of recusal should be a reasonably "soft" issue to discuss and a matter which can remain at a level of principle and not draw defence of certain ArbCom members actions (or the lack thereof) through a proxy. My point again is that there should be a mechanism entrenched into policy where the ArbCom itself can review requests for recusal (should the applicable member refuse to recuse themself and either declare it "frivolous" or "excuse"that member from further proceedings. Personally I doubt whether the ArbCom would be up to making such tough choices (as it is a very clubby type of setup) and would recommend that third party (people [say three] with some legal background) review the evidence and make a determination. This would take the pressure off the ArbCom where they may have to make a decision "against" one of their own. Interestingly if one observes the arbitration proceedings of one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#User:WikiUser" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration#User:WikiUser" rel="nofollow">WikiUser</a> at least four ArbCom members have grounds to recuse themselves. This of course tells another story but it is the explanation of one Fred Bauder who states: "Accept, I could recuse myself based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=5001621#Request_for_the_dismissal_of_Fred_Bauder_from_the_arbitration_committee_and_the_permanent_banning_of_him" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=5001621#Request_for_the_dismissal_of_Fred_Bauder_from_the_arbitration_committee_and_the_permanent_banning_of_him" rel="nofollow">this attack</a> but we cannot all recuse ourselves in a case like this but must hear the case if needed." The rationale is quite bizarre. Perhaps a minimum understanding ethics should be a prerequisite for standing for ArbCom election. - Robert the Bruce 05:10, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I looked at what your own former advocate has written: <i>I am not convinced that the ArbCom as a whole was at fault. Recusal is a personal decision. Failure to do so appropriately might be grounds for appeal.</i></dd>

<dl>
<dd>It was this question that I was trying to get some kind of comment on. Wally mentioned the possibility of an appeal--and you know from my comments on your user talk page that I've been thinking about the same thing myself. So the intent of my post was to ask Wally to elucidate, by quoting the voting at him and asking the kind of questions that would be asked by someone considering an appeal.</dd>

<li>An appeal? You are joking surely. There is absolutely no point in an appeal iro of anything. I would like to hear the case being made how the appeals process can be functional when just about everything else is broken. Your argument I suggest is coming from the wrong side of the issue. Two simple questions is all that needs to be asked; was there personal involvement, and was there even a hint of impropriety? The answers are obvious ... he should have recused himself. Case closed ... no further discussion needed. Where your point may have value is if and when he is called to account for not having recused himself ... then in mitigation he can claim that he played little or no part in the proceedings. That might just get him off being banned for a year&#160;;-) - Robert the Bruce 03:19, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>As I read more of this, what I'm hearing is that I could effectively prevent all arbitrators, or any I didn't like, from being involved in a potential arbitration, merely by making a personal attack at them on their user talk page. That seems like an unacceptable loophole. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<ul>
<li>How so? It is more evident that a number of the current arbitrators willingly get involved in "exchanges" with people in the run up to and during ArbCom proceedings. This is the strongest indication that the "wrong" people are being elected to the ArbCom as the sheriff later becomes the judge (and jury). If one views a definition relating to recusal it is pretty simple really: "To disqualify or seek to disqualify from participation in a decision on grounds such as prejudice or personal involvement." It always leave a bad taste in the mouth when someone with 'personal involvement" in an issue refuses to recuse themself as it gives the impression that they have malevolent intent. This simple fact (personal involvement) should be enough for most to recuse themselves without having to even raise the possibility of "a hint of impropriety" etc etc. Like many such arguments the principle is simple and it only starts to get complicated when personalities and specific instances are introduced to to the discussion. - Robert the Bruce 03:00, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well then you choose bad examples. The only example you've given is of Fred Bauder's refusal to recuse himself based on a personal attack made against him: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=5001621#Request_for_the_dismissal_of_Fred_Bauder_from_the_arbitration_committee_and_the_permanent_banning_of_him" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=5001621#Request_for_the_dismissal_of_Fred_Bauder_from_the_arbitration_committee_and_the_permanent_banning_of_him" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> (your link, from above). You were upset at his reason for not choosing to recuse, but his statement was certainly expressing the same concern I am.<br />
And this discussion is rapidly leaving the scope of the AMA Requests page. Shouldn't this discussion be being held over at RfA or ArbCom pages? - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<dl>
<dd>When the <a href="../../../a/r/b/Wikipedia%7EArbitration_policy_10cb.html" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration policy">arbitration policy</a> was being adopted, I argued that grounds for recusal are based on the conduct of the arbitrator, not the conduct of other people who may be involved in the case. Using that logic, there is less of a problem. CheeseDreams tried to request arbitration against the whole arbitration committee, but they didn't all recuse themselves, they just rejected the request. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichael_Snow_0396.html" title="User:Michael Snow">Michael Snow</a> 01:34, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>At the centre of this discussion <b>is</b> the conduct of the ArbCom members. It is evident that many want to play the roles of sheriff, judge and jury (at the same time). So my point remains that either civilised rules need to be made and enforced or the current pretence of due process should be dispensed with and people just being banned willy-nilly as the spirit moves the ArbCom. - Robert the Bruce 03:00, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>If anyone could assist, I would be very grateful. -- <a href="../../../e/g/i/User%7EEgil_938c.html" title="User:Egil">Egil</a> 10:27, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree with Egil about this being a problem. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 14:59, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also agree that this is a problem; I don't think that the problem editor is committing vandalism, but like Egil, I believe that he's sincere in his belief in the pseudoscience he's adding.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let's try this. Pick something I said that you think is false and let's</dd>
<dd>discuss it like grownups. You go get your source material together</dd>
<dd>and I'll get mine and we'll debate the issue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The editor in question is, among other things, writing at least partially in the first person, something which I normally only see in original research. On the VfD pages for the various articles, he seems to be trying to confuse the voting by pasting rather large amounts of text from one vote into the others, or pasting entire sections of the articles in question into the votes, rather than engage in actual discussion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm trying to show that when someone calls a table a list and</dd>
<dd>says it has no useful application or merit that's simply false.</dd>
<dd>In the long run false allegations won't help you</dd>
</dl>
<pre>
He also seems to be inclined to engage in Wikilawyering and personal attacks (see the third paragraph of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Standards_of_measure_in_the_Medieval_East&amp;oldid=20516868" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Standards_of_measure_in_the_Medieval_East&amp;oldid=20516868" rel="nofollow">this version of this article</a>).
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>So how would you characterise everything else written here?</dd>
<dd>Personal attack or no?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will say that I think some of the material the problem editor wants to add <b>may</b> have merit, i.e. it may be possible to get a useful, and encyclopedic, article out of some of it after the pseudoscience has been extracted.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And you are qualified to make this determination because of your</dd>
<dd>Education? Training? Experience? Interest in the subject?</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm certainly not an expert in the subject matter, but it seems to me that a table comparing various systems of weights and measures, without original research as to their interrelatedness, would be very useful.</p>
<dl>
<dd>That would seem to be the case , yes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, I feel that the way the material is presented, and the stridency of the editor that it be presented in a particular way, make these articles unworkable at this time.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I thought I was doing a pretty good job of keeping my cool.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Egil began asking for the deletion of these articles all together</dd>
<dd>the day I began stubbing them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>That has meant I had to do a lot of work in a short period of time</dd>
<dd>to get them to the point where they were presentable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I had to make tables, collect data and put it in the tables,</dd>
<dd>collect references, put them in the articles and keep an eye on Egil</dd>
<dd>who has been reverting and deleting everything I put up faster</dd>
<dd>than I can footnote it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Because Egil does this unilaterally with Bush like confidence</dd>
<dd>in his right to attack and never look back and no attempt</dd>
<dd>to discuss anything I have difficulty thinking of him</dd>
<dd>as benefiting the process.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Ken, I was also, to begin with, under the impression that perhaps 10% of the material could be used. Problem was, everywhere I probed, it turned out to be bogus. So I've given up. -- <a href="../../../e/g/i/User%7EEgil_938c.html" title="User:Egil">Egil</a> 21:49, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Why not discuss which parts you think are useful</dd>
<dd>or for that matter give a specific instance of what part</dd>
<dd>is not useful?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>All this handwaving makes me suspect you have all been</dd>
<dd>foist by your own petard</dd>
