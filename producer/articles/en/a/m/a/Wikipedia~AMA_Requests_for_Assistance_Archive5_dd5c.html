<p><a name="Request_for_Assistance_with_making_complaints_about_a_large_group_of_self-identifed_Masonic_Editors_on_Freemasonry_and_Related_Pages" id="Request_for_Assistance_with_making_complaints_about_a_large_group_of_self-identifed_Masonic_Editors_on_Freemasonry_and_Related_Pages"></a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline">Request for Assistance with making complaints about a large group of self-identifed Masonic Editors on Freemasonry and Related Pages</span></h3>
<p>I have been attempting to edit the Freemasonry page but I and other non-masonic editors have run into a solid wall of masonic editors who use their numbers to delete in total any edits made by non-masons by using their large numbers to bypass 3rr rules.</p>
<p>Additionally same group demands talk discussion before any non-masonic editor makes edit then promptly ignores discussion when it occurs. Other editors have pointed out NPOV content of page and forking problem, masonic editors belittle effort and continuously delete npov tag at top of page.</p>
<p>Basic problem is group of masonic editors acts as a co-ordinated block by using back channel e-mails, or openly on occasion, to turn Wikipedia entries related to freemasonry into a sort of private masonic web site.</p>
<p>This is a persistant problem that has been unable to be resolved by discussion. Request editors who have self-identified themselves as being members of Masons to not be allowed to make any further edits to Freemasonry related pages because of their POV bias and abuses of Wikipeida rules and spirit.</p>
<p>I and small number of other non-masonic editors are at point of giving up making further contributions to Freemasonry related pages.</p>
<p>If Wikipeida does not assist non-masonic editors in some way the Freemasonry related pages will remain little more than defacto private masonic websites, basically no-go area's for non-masonic editors. Surely this is not a situation that Wikipedia could want to continue.(David Gerard tried to get involved two days ago and had his edits deleted similarly with no explanation.)<a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasil_Rathbone_9abb.html" title="User:Basil Rathbone">Basil Rathbone</a> 13:07, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>One thing you could do is to hold yourself to the same standards you hold me to. That would be a great start. Oh, and it would be just super if you stopped edit warring and abusing process.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Assistance with Price Anderson</span></h3>
<p>The ArbCom has agreed to hear a case involving the safety of nuclear electric plants. We argue that the risk is greater than all the insurance companies in the world can insure - thus the need for "Price-Anderson" Indemnity - which holds taxpayers liable for nuclear safety issues - even when safety regs are repeatedly ignored. The complainants want to Censor many facts in support of such a conclusion by attacking the editors involved in an omnibus fishing expedition. Anyone in favor of defending unpopular facts is invited to assist. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Gatti_fee8.html" title="User:Benjamin Gatti">Benjamin Gatti</a> 02:33, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Help with RfC and RfA</span></h3>
<dl>
<dt><i>What's going on?</i></dt>
</dl>
<p>I would like help dealing with some administrators and also with the Arbitration Committee. I was involved in a dispute with an admin on the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_Design_39cd.html" title="Intelligent Design">Intelligent Design</a> talk page. I acted out of order, violating the 3RR unintentionally (I thought it was a day, not 24h) and I was acting confrontational and made a personal attack (telling an admin to "Get a grip"). The admin I was having a dispute with blocked me, and I filed a RfA <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_arbitration#Ben" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_arbitration#Ben" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I believe he, and others, are acting as owner of the article. Right after that, the admin filed an RfC against me, even though I had already asked him to participate in an RfC (against him though), and even used this as an example of how I had tried to resolve the dispute. The majority of their accusations seem to me to be heavily spun just to cast me in a bad light. They make very libelous accusations about me and whenever I defend myself they say it is a personal attack. They rely on people not examining the issue closely enough. It seems whatever I say is called a personal attack and I am having a very difficult time expressing my point of view. If, for example, I say they are spinning things they will call this too a personal attack. Another administrator also keeps posting on my talk page telling me not to make "personal attacks." The RfC at this point though has basically stalled and the person who filed it against me does not really seem that interested in pursuing it, mainly interested in spinning anything I say to defend myself into a personal attack and just adding it. The thing is, there are votes on my RfA that are "reject until RfC is concluded" or "reject until other dispute resolution is pursued". So, until the rfc is "concluded" I can't file my RfA. Another problem is with some of the votes on my RfA (currently 2 Accept, 1 reject until RfC is concluded, 1 reject until other resolution is tried, and 4 rejects). One of the votes is "Reject with great prejudice. One need only take a cursory look at Talk:Intelligent design to see that FeloniousMonk's actions are EXACTLY what we expect our admins to do." with one concurring. I named three administrators in my RfA. One of the administrators, right in his statement to ArbCom, said very rude things and in no uncertain terms violated No Personal Attacks (calling me a lowly troll, a pathetic individual, etc.), yet two of the Arbitrators seem to think this is "exactly what we expect our admins to do." The admins are very rude and are so set against me that they will grab at anything I say or do and some members of ArbCom are condoning this behavior. I think they are very biased and have fallen into <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confirmation_bias.html" title="Confirmation bias">confirmation bias</a>. They seem to think the article is NPOV, and therefore anyone who criticizes it is, in one of their words "the latest in the long line of religiously-inspired creationist POV warriors." I think maybe it is a bad case of <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_think.html" title="Group think">group think</a>. All I want to do is make the topic easier to understand so there will be less disputes on the talk page (there is at least one major dispute over POV and content per day on that page). Personally I am a <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weak_agnostic.html" title="Weak agnostic">weak agnostic</a>, I think <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolutionary_theory.html" title="Evolutionary theory">evolutionary theory</a> is sound and scientific, and that <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">creationism</a> is an interesting allegory, but I cannot disabuse them of this notion that I am a some sort of creationist propagandist.

<p>For an AMA to intervene on my behalf to stop the libelous accusations and advise me on how to proceed with my RfA, and how to deal with this situation. I am not interested in someone simply arguing their perspective for them. I am interested in help defending myself against what I see is a campaign of harassment. This is very frustrating. Please someone help. There are quite a few people, a few admins included, where it seems all they want to do is basically stand on my windpipe because they are so upset by vandals or something. I really don't know. This is very confusing, and I think they even like it when I am confused by what they say. I even put a poll on the RfC page to suggest concluding the RfC. I signed that I support closing the RfC. The admin who filed the RfC against me? He just changed the heading and didn't sign anything.

<dt><i>What's going on?</i></dt>
<dd>Ongoing edit war over the existence of JT Leroy. Well researched recent NY Magazine article puts forth compelling evidence this is a scam/hoax with Leroy actually the fabrication of a woman named Laura. Whenever someone tries to write this up with citations in a neutral POV, someone (presumably? possibly?) associated with Laura reverts the entry. These reverts feature Original Research in the form of assertions by the editor that he knows JT quite well. JT's offical bio is presented as fact without citation instead of as "his" official bio with a relevant citation. The article reverts to a constant use of the word "he" to describe the author. Instead of presenting citations to evidence that Leroy exists, an attack is made on the author of the magazine's motives, an ad hominem with no citation, no basis in fact, and no relevance to a logical evaluation of the evidence presented in his article.</dd>

<dt><i>What would you like from the AMA?</i></dt>
<dd>Please get involved as those of us who are trying to follow the guidelines have little energy to expend on this whereas those who benefit from this fraud have enough of an investment to revert forever.

I need an advocate to help also make it correct in form. I have purposely been a loner and not participated in any coalitions and cabals, because I think as a matter of principle one should be able to both edit and get justice on the merits and not by smoozing, lobbying or conspiracy. I know I am taking the hard road by doing this. I also purposely don't sugar coat my analyses and others have considered this abrasive. I also am persistent unless someone shows on the merits that I am not right, and people don't like to be shown up, so I guess I have made enemies among the intellectually insecure and hypocritical. In any case, this means that I don't even have someone else to certify, although I have asked Ryan Delaney to do so, since he admitted the violating the letter if not the spirit of the policy. So, I need advocate assistance, not merely on the process, but also to certify the dispute.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Third Millennium Dispute/Catholic Church</span></h3>
<p>A remark that the Catholic Church opened its Millennium Year on December 24, 1999 has been deleted/is not allowed by the gatekeepers to be included under the 'Millennium' heading on the Year_Zero page. Talking via Talk pages has not lead to a resolve. According to me, the fundamental difference is how to approach this matter. I consider their edit standards to belong to science, while the subject matter is a man-made creation, and find therefore that their reasoning is based on standards not set out by Wikipedia. Meanwhile I claim to fulfill the Wikipedia standards of supported information, and feel that I should be able to have this information included. I do not harm the information for Wikipedia users: I enhance it. I have no problem mincing words to come to a mutually satisfying solution.</p>
<p>As a side note, this dispute does not involve disputing the general statements as found on the Year_Zero page, but since this was a hot topic a few years ago I feel the gatekeepers are over-sensitized to anyone trying to see anything any other way. Without outside help, they will not accept the sources (from the Catholic Church) that I gathered, and purposefully twist these sources (in my eyes unsuccessfully) to fit their views of the matter to still come to the singular outcome they diligently guard.</p>
<p>I included links for the — and I am the first person to admit it — peculiar point of view, but since these dates are confirmed by reliable sources as the starting point of the Holy Millennium year (and by the way: the ending point of the year is not stressed by the Catholic Church, most likely to avoid a clash), I see no reason why it cannot be mentioned. I believe that this information satisfies the standards as set out for Wikipedia for man-made structures, and should therefore be included. Again, the specific written outcome can be discussed to accomodate all sides.</p>

There are several posters involved, including Askolnick, Siqueira, Lumiere, Dreadlocke (myself) and others.</p>
<p>Askolnick is the journalist who works for CSICOP-CSMMH and is one of those responsible for the testing of Natasha Demkina, a Russian paranormal called "The Girl with the X-Ray Eyes" which was shown in a documentary by Disccovery Channel. Aksolnick wrote an article for Skeptical Inquirer and wrote articles posted on the csicop.org website. He then edited the Wikipedia article and added several links in the "References" section to his writing on the csicop website.</p>
<p>Askolnick is disputing the inclusion of the web pages of one of the better known critics of the test, Nobel Laureate Professor Brian Josephson, who posted a critique of the test on the University of Cambridge website.</p>
<p>Also, a majority of the article seems to be an attack on Natasha, and I don't think it meets NPOV.</p>
<p>I believe the inclusion of Professor Josephson's web page in the "References" section is crtical to the NPOV of the article on Natasha Demkina and I would like to see the article rewritten in a manner that presents both sides of the story. Failing the inclusion of Prof. Josephson's website in the References section, I presume it would be allowed inclusion under a "Further Reading" or "External Sites" section, if it were not cited in the main body of the article itself. I am also wondering if most of the CSICOP material can be moved to it's own Wiki article at <a href="../../../c/s/i/CSICOP_c20d.html" title="CSICOP">CSICOP</a></p>

<dd>FDuffy (and probably kwami) would like a non-involved individual having neither the views of IZAK, Jayjg, et.al, nor detailed knowledge of the information from the academic community, to become involved, and assist FDuffy's assertion that NPOV requires that fact that certain information is the majority view of the academic community should be respected, and included in articles.</dd>

<p><s>====JDW's comment====</s> <s>::Francis does indeed give his sources: some names. Never on the article page itself but in edit summaries and on talk pages. And never with a book title, let alone page number. That's annoying, especially after requesting this information several times.</s></p>
<p><s>::Presently Wikipedia contains a fair bit of "pro-Jewish-POV" material, because there have been a number of Jewish contributors around who have kindly contributed this information long before Francis arrived. There is no problem with inserting "academic viewpoints", but there <i>is</i> a problem when this distinction is not discernible. An example: academics believe the traditional <a href="../../../t/e/n/Ten_Commandments_716e.html" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a> were predated by an older set of ten instructions that is found in Exodus 34; this is termed the <a href="../../../r/i/t/Ritual_Decalogue_9707.html" title="Ritual Decalogue">Ritual Decalogue</a>. Francis insisted on making <a href="../../../t/e/n/Ten_Commandments_716e.html" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a> a disambiguation page between the "Ethical Decalogue" (what the whole world knows as the Ten Commandments) and the Ritual Decalogue, even though these subjects vary greatly in prominence.</s></p>
<p><s>::On <a href="../../../6/1/3/613_mitzvot.html" title="613 mitzvot">613 mitzvot</a> he has insisted on pushing a colour-coding scheme to facilitate the attribution of each commandments to each of the "proto-sources" of the JEDPR hypothesis. This colour-coding is considered by myself and several others as intrusive and pushing a POV, yet Francis insists on reverting to his version without any compromise<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=613_mitzvot&amp;oldid=27533626" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=613_mitzvot&amp;oldid=27533626" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.</s></p>
<p><s>::I value Francis' contributions to the Torah-related articles, and wish there could be a somewhat more open discussion about the merits of all POVs, but I also wish he would have a closer read of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and to understand that the Torah to several contributors is indeed sacred. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 22:43, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</s></p>

I'm pretty new at Wiki, but if what is going on at the <a href="../../../j/o/h/Talk%7EJohn_Lott_f0fd.html" title="Talk:John Lott">Talk:John Lott</a> page is any example, this grand social experiment has serious problems. I see someone else complained about this page last summer.</p>
<p>I was accused of not being me a user within two hours of my first post. Look at my user profile to see the evidence: <a href="../../../c/b/a/User%7ECbaus_489d.html" title="User:Cbaus">Cbaus</a></p>
<p>After reading the long discussion page history and learning what a sockpuppet is (that's what they were calling me), I told these bullies there that there was no more reason to suspect me of not being me than there was for me to suspect them of being sockpuppets for a man who is known across the world for trying to discredit John Lott.</p>
<p>Today I see that they tried to delete that entire exchange from the discussion page! Check the history of discussion, because I'm sure they'll do it again.</p>
<p>It is not right that a few people should be allowed to gang up on and refuse to work with others. It is clear that their effort here is to hurt John Lott's reputation, not to present a balanced article. The history of this goes back months and months and months. They just do it until people give up fighting them and go away.</p>
<p>If this is what this website is all about, it is shameful. If it is not, then I really wish someone would do something about it.---<a href="../../../c/b/a/User%7ECbaus_489d.html" title="User:Cbaus">Cbaus</a> - December 21, 2005 5:11 p.m. EDST USA</p>

<p>I was hoping that someone impartial could go there are help get some fairness restored. They don't even accept my status as an actual person. It is how they treat anyone who goes there - I did a quick scan and found at least seven different people whose proposals for the article were cast off simply by accusing the person of being not a real person. No matter what they do on the main article page, I have no idea how this little gang can possibly justify censoring the discussion page, and yet they continually do this. They have edited out much of someone else named Al Lowe's extensive discussions and whatever else they find inconvenient they have moved to another archived discussion page.

<h4><span class="mw-headline">STOP CENSORSHIP</span></h4>
<p>The [<a href="http://www.truthroom.com" class="external text" title="http://www.truthroom.com" rel="nofollow">Truthroom.com</a>] website does not make false accusations but rather presents research based on bibical prophecy. The Hashemite Kingdom is a major player in end time prophecy. This is not the opinion of Truthroom it is the conclusion of many researchers. The information is interesting and does not speak negatively or disrespectful. If some are offended that is ok, but continuing to censor this information should not be tolorated. Wikipedia allows external links I have posted the rule below. Please stop people like cyborg from censoring information that is well researched and well footnoted. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:67.135.235.10" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:67.135.235.10" rel="nofollow">dicussion</a>]</p>
<p>====External links are certainly allowed.==== Properly used, they increase the usability of Wikipedia. Keep in mind, however, that Wikipedia is not a web directory; external links should support the content of the article, not replace it. An article should be more than a container for external links, and the content should not require the reader to leave the site to understand the subject. Please do not place advertising links in Wikipedia. Commercial sites are obvious, but this prohibition usually includes links to fansites and discussion forums as well unless the site is a notable one in the field. As a general rule of thumb: if you wish to place the link in Wikipedia in order to drive traffic to a site, it probably doesn't belong here. The current convention is to place external links in a separate "External links" section at the bottom of the article. Sites used as references for the article should be listed under a "References" section, or sometimes placed within the article as a footnote. See Wikipedia:How does one edit a page for different ways to create external links.</p>

<p>Well, a little more information. I have been trying very hard to deal with a creationist movement in a fair way. I have tried to let their theology speak for itself. I am a professional scientist, so I have also been pointing out cases where this movement makes statements that would be contested by mainstream science (without claiming that mainstream science is the superior methodology).</p>
<p>Today we had several edits in the space of around an hour by an anonymous user who removed around 50% of the article (mostly parts that appeared criticial of the movement). We asked to move the discussion to the talk page, which resulted in the anonymous user writing (what I consider to be) insults over various places throughout the discussions. I was accused of being highly NPOV and being ignorant, which I found quite upsetting given the hard work I've put into sourcing my statements to make sure they properly represent the Answers in Genesis group.</p>
<p>I have decided to come here. I don't want to get into an edit war in which we each revert eachother's edits. I consider the actions of the anonymous editor to be close to vandalism in her/his disregard for the laws of etiquette. Ideally I would like today's edits reverted and a temporary freeze placed on the edits. Most of all though I need some guidance. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristianjb_bc9d.html" title="User:Christianjb">Christianjb</a> 00:53, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

Just look at Nikola's user page, and read his mission (<i>"My interest is in spreading knowledge about Serbs, Serbia, Serbian culture and history."</i>). Then look at his contribution. Serb nationalists are constantly mocking international institutions, <a href="../../../i/c/t/ICTY_337a.html" title="ICTY">ICTY</a>, official documents and courte decisions.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">New Wikipedian unsure what to do about dispute</span></h3>
<p>I have not been posting to Wikipedia for very long, but I made a couple of edits to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greek_Reconstructionism_88ad.html" title="Greek Reconstructionism">Greek Reconstructionism</a> correcting what I had reason to believe was a factual inaccuracy, and came back a month later to see that my edit had been attacked at length on the article's Talk page by this person who never seems to sign his/her posts and who had gone and somehow discovered my full name and apparently dug up every article I ever wrote to any Hellenic mailing list. This person is making all kinds of untrue statements about me, my group affiliations and my personal biases, and refuses to back up these statements with references or links. He/she keeps referring to past disputes I knew nothing about because they happened long before I was involved in the organizations in question. I have stated that I really don't care about the issue any more and they can edit the page to say whatever they want, but I really would like it if there were some way to remove all the references to my real name, permanently, because it makes me VERY uncomfortable to have my real name published on Wikipedia by someone who obviously thinks the very worst of me and will continue to make negative comments about me on the Talk page. I feel like I am being stalked, and I'm scared. Seriously, I edited like two lines of this article and I have already told the person that they should by all means fix it to say whatever they think is accurate, but they won't leave it (or me) alone!
