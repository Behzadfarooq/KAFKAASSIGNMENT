<h3><span class="mw-headline">Speedy deletion</span></h3>
<p>I am going to be leaving wikipedia but I wrote an article on wikipedia that I am not happy with. I think only one other user has edited it, and it was for the most part, a minor edit. I would like it to be speedy deleted, but I don't want to draw attention to it. I'd like it if someone (hopefully a sysop) could help me explain how or if I can speedy delete it. I don't want to say which article in public because, as I say, I don't want to draw attention to it. Also, I would like it if someone could reply to me in e-mail, since I am leaving wikipedia but want to do this last thing first. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 23:07, 3 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sorry, I think I should be a little more clear with my request. I created an article a while back that I regret making. It is not that there is anything "bad" about it, just that it is a highly controversial topic and I am uncomfortable with it. I read in wikipedia's speedy deletions policy, "Any page which is requested for deletion by the original author, provided the author reasonably explains that it was created by mistake, and the page was edited only by its author." I don't know if my situation qualifies as a "mistake" by the original author. This is what I would like help with: I would like to know if it qualifies as a mistake or not for speedy deletion and I'm not sure who to ask. I worry about putting a speedy deletion tag that it might draw attention to what I am uncomfortable with. I would not mind at all if someone else wrote an article about the same topic. I would not even mind if they used what I already wrote. I think I am most uncomfortable about my name appearing in the history window for such a controversial topic. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 11:34, 4 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">User:Stevertigo</a> keeps removing the VFD notice from an article he created. He contends that to nominate his article for VFD is a "misapplication" of the deletion policy, and cites this as his reason for removing the tag. The entire point of VfD is to get consensus from a number of users on how the deletion policy should apply to an article; Stevertigo is claiming instead that because his interpretation of the deletion policy is that it shouldn't be deleted, it entitles him to unilaterally make a "keep" decision and end the discussion. His intransigence on this issue can be seen by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAntaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=12063220&amp;oldid=12061547" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAntaeus_Feldspar&amp;diff=12063220&amp;oldid=12061547" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> to my User talk page, just after removing the VFD tag for the third time, stating "I have again removed it.

Feldspar contends that the "do not remove" rule on the notice supercedes the "Problems that don't require deletion" stipulation on the original <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">deletion policy</a>. <b>As it stands,</b> there seems to be some much broader misunderstanding of VFD policy, judging by the votes against: there is a popular consensus for deleting the article, on POV basis alone, in direct contradiction to the rules of WP:DP. The criticism of "POV fork" is likewise baffling, as there does not appear to be any similar treatment with the same scope. Even if the issue is scope of the article - VFD listing is in violation of WP:DP. The VFD notice was added quite quickly after the article was started, interfering with normal editing processes of renaming the article. -<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevertigo_b55d.html" title="User:Stevertigo">==S</a><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7EStevertigo_fad2.html" title="User talk:Stevertigo">V</a> 03:48, 9 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As a general rule, deletion notices can be added by anyone, and they're allowed to stay. I've seen much worse faith deletions stay and go through VfD. Your best bet is probably to go to the VfD page and explain why the page should be kept. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Snowspinner</a> 22:10, Apr 9, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, nobody asked for it. I just happened to witness that revert war and I felt very bad for the people investing their time in what seems to be an absurd waste of energy. I don't think it's good for Wikipedia, and I'm afraid it might turn away reasonable editors and confuse innocent readers. I don't know what to do about it, but I feel like we ought to do something. I'm sorry if my above post was unclear â I realized I wrote "this" where I meant "that". So far, my post on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiquette_alerts_4982.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikiquette alerts">that page</a> has not born fruit yet. â <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastianHelm_63db.html" title="User:SebastianHelm">Sebastian</a> 22:39, 2005 Mar 26 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">re:User:Instantnood</span></h3>
<p>This is a little different from your normal appeal, first of all because I am making the appeal for someone who I think needs your help, and second because I think that this particular individual really needs two individuals if that is possible. One person will hopefully be one of your most experienced and effective Advocates for help with the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Wikipedia:dispute resolution</a> processes. The other person needs to be a good counsellor who is very patient and diplomatic and who can help with editing articles and with general Wikipedia policy-making issues. I also think this case is important because one part of the dispute involves an attempt to write, or more accurately rewrite, Wikipedia policy (specifically the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28Chinese%29_0623.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Chinese)">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Chinese)</a> related to the naming of China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan-related articles, categories, and templates. There also seems to be an ever widening number of articles where this dispute is fought on (as well as multiple user's Talk pages), so just for the sake of the Wikipedia there needs to be an attempt to lower the heat in this dispute.</p>
<p>The person I am making the appeal for is <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">User:Instantnood</a>. I believe that this individual is a very sincere, but also a very head-strong individual. Unfortunately he has run into a couple of other head-strong individuals. Even though the results of their recent <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Instantnood_cfd1.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Instantnood">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Instantnood</a> are mostly in Instantnood's favour, they have now filed a <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_1b83.html#User:SchmuckyTheCat_.26_User:Instantnood" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration">WP:RFAR</a> against him. That arbitration is currently still in the fact-finding stage while the arbitrators try to decide if it is just a content dispute that they will dismiss. Instantnood needs help with both effectively countering the changes that have been made, as well as turning some of the focus onto the accusers (since it takes at least two to have an edit war).</p>
<p>Because of the <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28Chinese%29_0623.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Chinese)">China-naming issues</a>, Instantnood should get some help publicizing the issue ((<a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Village Pump (Policy)</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/r/Wikipedia%7ECurrent_surveys_7ea5.html" title="Wikipedia:Current surveys">Current Surveys</a>, notifying the appropriate <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_751e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject">Wikiprojects</a>, etc.) so that there are more people involved than the current very small group (for example, look at the number of people that voted in the <a href="../../../g/d/a/Gdansk.html" title="Gdansk">Gdansk</a>/<a href="../../../d/a/n/Danzig.html" title="Danzig">Danzig</a> <a href="../../../g/d/a/Talk%7EGdansk_Vote_6c4c.html" title="Talk:Gdansk/Vote">referendum</a> for example). Instantnood also probably needs some tutoring on both how to work towards <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a>, and how to <a href="../../../c/o/m/Compromise.html" title="Compromise">compromise</a>, because if things have degenerated into an edit war on an article, then the desired way of writing Wikipedia articles has failed.</p>
<p>One final note of warning before anyone wades into this potential quagmire: The <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_status_of_Taiwan_f3d7.html" title="Political status of Taiwan">Political status of Taiwan</a> is deliberately ambiguous, and the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_Administrative_Region_820b.html" title="Special Administrative Region">political</a> status of <a href="../../../h/o/n/Hong_Kong_6282.html" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> is anomalous, so almost everybody's arguments will be half-right and half-wrong. Plus the <i>de facto</i> status of anything related to China, and especially Taiwan or the Republic of China, can be considered just as much "POV" as any other position. The best way to handle the China-related articles (but unfortunately probably not article titles) is to try to best describe everybody's POV on the issues and then find a "solution" for the rest of the article that everyone is equally unhappy with.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">The use of "<a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainland_China_7f88.html" title="Mainland China">mainland China</a>"</span></h3>
<p>I would like to have assistance from people who are familiar with East Asian politics.</p>
<p>According to the article <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainland_China_7f88.html" title="Mainland China">mainland China</a> it is a term to refer to territories administered by the People's Republic of China (i.e. Communist) government, with Hong Kong and Macao excluded. The <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28Chinese%29_8f6a.html#Political_NPOV" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Chinese)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (Chinese)#Political NPOV</a> section clear states that <a href="../../../m/a/i/Mainland_China_7f88.html" title="Mainland China">mainland China</a> is a valid, acceptable and NPOV term to refer to PRC's territories other than Hong Kong and Macao.</p>
<p>Nevertheless some users have actively been moving articles from <a href="../../../m/a/i/Category%7EMainland_China_b666.html" title="Category:Mainland China">category:Mainland China</a> to <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople%27s_Republic_of_China_5766.html" title="Category:People's Republic of China">category:People's Republic of China</a>, and put many categories titled ..of mainland China to <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a>. Massive editing and reverting have taken place in many articles all across Wikipedia to replace the words "mainland China" with "China" or "People's Republic of China".</p>
<p>Articles, categories, templates, etc. involved: <a href="../../../e/a/s/Template%7EEast_Asia_5535.html" title="Template:East Asia">template:East Asia</a>, category:Airports of mainland China, category:Companies of mainland China, category:Cities in mainland China, category:Laws of mainland China, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html#Category:Laws_of_mainland_China" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion#Category:Laws of mainland China</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html#Category:Companies_of_mainland_China" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion#Category:Companies of mainland China</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_b940.html#Category:Cities_in_mainland_China" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion#Category:Cities in mainland China</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Secession_Law_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China_b424.html" title="Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China">Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/n/Ministry_of_Commerce_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China_606a.html" title="Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China">Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_national_parks_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China_034e.html" title="List of national parks of the People's Republic of China">List of national parks of the People's Republic of China</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/a/Road_Traffic_Safety_Law_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China_0ff4.html" title="Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China">Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Republic_of_China%27s_trademark_law_1c36.html" title="People's Republic of China's trademark law">People's Republic of China's trademark law</a>, <a href="../../../w/o/r/Category%7EWorld_Heritage_Sites_in_China_ddc0.html" title="Category:World Heritage Sites in China">category:World Heritage Sites in China</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_economic_zone_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China_b3b0.html" title="Special economic zone of the People's Republic of China">Special economic zone of the People's Republic of China</a>.

<p>In fact there is an ongoing discussion at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_%28Chinese%29_0623.html#..of_China_or_..of_the_PRC_.E2.86.92_..of_mainland_China" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Chinese)">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (Chinese)#..of China or ..of the PRC â ..of mainland China</a>.

<p>I need some help. Arbitration is being pursued against me even though I am open to mediation and to compromising about anything in dispute; I am willing to concede any point after reasonable discussion. Nevertheless, <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">User:Snowspinner</a> wants me banned from editing articles on a particular topic. I need someone to help me argue against the case being accepted, and if it is accepted, to help me argue against a ban. I am planning to leave Wikipedia if the ban is imposed, so that should indicate how seriously I take this. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 13:18, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I request an advocate to represent me with regards to what I see are perpetual and outstanding conduct issues on the part of User:Sam Spade. I would like to note that this is a culmination of collaboration in several articles throughout several months. It does not directly relate to content (though not independent from these issues, either), but rather what I percieve (and argue, have evidence to substantiate) as the inappropriate conduct of the aboevmentioned user. Unlike myself, Sam Spade is very familliar with the innerworking of official Wikipedia policies and channels, and in general, the procedural details of the Wiki. This places me at a disadvantage with respect to evaluating suitable courses of action (including but not limited to <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDispute_resolution_d69e.html" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Wikipedia:dispute resolution</a>), and I think I could greatly benefit from an advocate to better aid me in establishing a frame of reference for these as well as for any consultative purposes pertaining to this case.

<h4><span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../d/n/a/User%7EDnagod_c0a5.html" title="User:Dnagod">User:dnagod</a>'s complaint</span></h4>
<p><a href="../../../d/n/a/User%7EDnagod_c0a5.html" title="User:Dnagod">User:dnagod</a> added 8 links to the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holocaust_denial.html" title="Holocaust denial">Holocaust denial</a> article, each of which were to holocaust denial sites which question the generally accepted belief that Jewish people were executed at Nazi concentration camps during <a href="../../../w/w/i/WWII_688e.html" title="WWII">WWII</a>. An edit war ensued in which these links were deleted, mainly by <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">User:jpgordon</a>, an admin, as well as <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">User:SlimVirgin</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, this is the recent stage in a pattern of abuse by <a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">user:jpgordon</a> who repeatedly excludes the addition of links and content which are contrary to a pro-Jewish standpoint. This practice is not compatible with the WP principle of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/n/a/User%7EDnagod_c0a5.html" title="User:Dnagod">User:dnagod</a> desires that these links be reviewed by the powers that be and be confirmed to be valid and contributory to the topic, and thereafter reinstated to the page.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/n/a/User%7EDnagod_c0a5.html" title="User:Dnagod">User:dnagod</a> further feels that there exists a cabal of pro-Jewish interests at WP which conspire to exclude anti-Jewish sentiment from Wikipedia, especially articles on topics related to Jews, Judaism, or Zionism. Additionally, this cabal conspired to have the article Jewish ethnocentrism deleted. <i>(<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Jewish_ethnocentrism_ccdc.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Jewish ethnocentrism">vfd</a>)</i> The existence of this cabal is obvious to anyone who researches the history of these cases.</p>
<p>Holocaust denial is a valid belief and worthy of both coverage as well as inclusion, on equal footing with other viewpoints, in Wikipedia. In many countries, holocaust denial or even holocaust agnosticism <i>(summarizer's term)</i> is illegal and persecuted.</p>
<p><a href="../../../d/n/a/User%7EDnagod_c0a5.html" title="User:Dnagod">User:dnagod</a> would like to see Wikipedia administrators and arbitrators engage in an ongoing and organized practice of constant close monitoring of jewish supremacist, jewish, pro-jewish, and jew-sympathising users, to prevent them from adding Jewish-biased material to articles or develop pro-Jewish slants in articles. Ideally, he would also like to see close monitoring of Jewish-related articles as well as of any article on any emotionally controversial topic.</p>
<p>He has been the target of terms of personal attack including "nazi", "white supremacist", and "racist". Personal attacks are not acceptable on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, though, his current issue is that the 8 links referred to above <i>(see full text on subpage)</i> be reviewed, confirmed, and readded to the article in question. He furthermore does not feel that adding these links this would cause the article to become a directory.</p>

<p><a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Garcia_d523.html" title="User:Mike Garcia">User:Mike Garcia</a> is repeatedly editing the article with an incorrect release year for "The Ingredients EP" of 1989. I have attempted in the talk page to try and provide some evidence for the correct year of 1990, but he continues to claim i am wrong, citing only two poor and unreliable sources (both in fact show entirely different years, making at least one of them wrong regardless.) He has made no effort to defend his own sources after i pointed out their inconsistencies and ignored any of mine, including my mention of the 1990 copyright notice on the release (which i provided a link to scans of for verification) - his only reply to this was simply telling me to "Leave it the way it is now and don't come back". Apparently he is simply 'right' and that's all there is to it, and has threatened to ban me. I now have absolutely irrefutable evidence of the exact date in the form of the december 1990 t-shirt which provides all events and tour dates for the whole year, including the ingredients release on april 30th. Unfortunately, the only image i have available is a little rough, or i would have posted it immediately, but i am concerned he will simply ignore me once again (as he has already done with the copyright notice - which i thought was pretty irrefutable in itself), especially without a decent picture. I also see from his profile he has been banned from the site before - and is mentioned further down this very page regarding similar behaviour - and didn't think the issue should go unnoticed if he is returning to a pattern of destructive behaviour. 02:01, Mar 19, 2005</p>

<p>Request for help. Someone continues to add a flagrantly libelous statement to the entry on the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. An editor, who seems to be an administrator of some sort, continues to say that the newspaper attacked a prominent politician's wife by calling her a "lesbian." There is no proof, either in the newspaper's internal library nor the internet (nor any other fee-based document retrieval service) that such a statement was ever made. Other erroneous statements about the newspaper were made but were deleted by an anonymous contributor. While issues have been raised in the talk section about this behavior, the organizers of Wikipedia should know that libelous statements are being made. They have no basis in fact and seem to stem only from the imagination of the poster. To my knowledge, neither the newspaper's publisher nor the other person libeled have knowledge of this editor's work. I appeal here because he seems to be an administrator.</p>

<li>I just discovered this request by chance.

Since then we have found the correct facts of the incident, along with a great deal of aditional (referenced) info which has improved the article. The Anon was deleting large chunks of this new info, and making repeated threats of libel suits against editors and Wiki. The talk page is hard to follow because the Anon refuses to use Wiki norms, like adding comments at the bottom, indenting them, or signing them. He recently volunteered that he worked for the Tribune-Review's competition, and I responded that evidence (his IP addresses) showed the opposite. <s>Since then he has not made further edits.</s> I am proud of the work that I have done on <a href="../../../p/i/t/Pittsburgh_Tribune-Review_6a17.html" title="Pittsburgh Tribune-Review">Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</a>, and would be open to any suggestions on how to make it better, or on how to improve my editing. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 22:33, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>Mr. Tyler, these issues were resolved. An earlier poster had continued to print that the newspaper had accused a political candidate's wife of lesbianism. This was easily proved to be false, with citations provided, but the person continued to deface the correction and reprint the lie. In law, this is known as an "intentional lie." When it continues to be uttered, even in the face of evidence that strongly disputes it, the act of repeating an "intentional lie" is conduct that proves the element of malice necessary in a libel case brought by public figures. I could not make a "legal threat," in your words, because I can't possibly be a party to the suit. I wasn't either of the wronged parties. The potential plaintiffs would be either the candidate's wife or the owner of the newspaper.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pittsburgh_Tribune-Review&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=10779108" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Pittsburgh_Tribune-Review&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=10779108" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></dd>

<dd>Since his I.P. address indicates he may be an employee of the newspaper, his disclaimer about lawsuits seems to be a technicality. In any case, it appears to me that he has explicitly withdrawn his request for an advocate. I continue to think that an advocate or mediator would be helpful. If there are further problems with this editor, I assume the RfC would be the appropriate place to raise them.

<dd>Thanks for the comments. I noted the anon's response and I was planning to respond, specifically on his refusal to abide by my request that he follow standard WP Talk page conventions. Unfortunately I recently became mired in a tough case. However, the anon stated that he felt the dispute was resolved, so it's not a big deal now IMO. I do recommend RfC for further content disputes as a first course after Talk page discussion fails to reach an agreement. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<p>There is a side issue that should be resolved. I discovered that search engines routinely will pull up the erroneous, libelous and frankly offensive material that was once ginned up about the Tribune-Review. Only this time it appears in the "Discussion" section.</p>
<p>I have sought to remove what wasn't good enough for primetime from the "backdoor" of the discussion page, but an administrator named Gamaliel, who has agreed to "tag team" me on these issues with Willmcw (see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Gamaliel/Archive_3).</p>
<p>I'm not sure how one can "tag team" a knowledgeable source into advocating what is wrong, instead of what is right, but perhaps an outsider can decide?</p>

<p><i>Original title: <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality_and_Christianity_4e22.html" title="Homosexuality and Christianity">Christian views of homosexuality</a>: dead links or no?</i></p>
<p><b>Background</b>: Recently, a vote about deleting an entire Wikipedia entry (<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_John_20%7E16_8122.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/John 20:16">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/John 20:16</a>) devoted to a single Bible verse was negative -- Wikipedia did not delete the Bible verse. This precedent would, as its goal, involve an eventual entire integration of the 1,000-page, 30,000-verse Bible into Wikipedia. While I don't think that this form of commentary is encyclopedic, it is not up to me to choose what the Wikipedia includes. However, the administrator of the debate seems to be <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldakQuill_3b15.html" title="User:OldakQuill">User:OldakQuill</a>, who was not particularly neutral as an administrator. Perhaps, though, he knows Wikipedia better than I.</p>
<p><b>The Issue</b>: <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> has changed all of the Bible links on the <a href="../../../h/i/s/Homosexuality_and_Christianity%7E_History_b798.html" title="Homosexuality and Christianity: History">Christian views of homosexuality</a> page to redirect to the pages on the actual passages. These pages don't exist, so all the user is confronted with is a bunch of dead links. Originally, all of the links went straight to the books of the Bible; documentation of these exist, but it is not particularly thorough. My personal opinion is that <i>some</i> data is better than <i>no</i> data, so we should link to the pages on each book of the Bible until such time as the actual passages exist. I just really don't think that having broken links for the next 4-5 years (heck, this might just be a fad that never gets completed) is helpful to anyone.</p>
<p>SimonP seems to want to turn this into a revert war; <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> has responded in kind, and I've avoided joining the revert war on Angr's side. The revert war is the reason I'm bringing it to the AMA. SimonP's last edit's description seems to indicate that he views the John 20:16 keep vote as a mandate from Wikipedia to keep these dead links.</p>
<p>It doesn't look like long-term resolution will come out of mediation, but it could be tried.</p>
<p><b>What I Need</b>: I'm still a relative beginner to Wikipedia, I need to know what actions can (and, more importantly, should) be taken.</p>
<ul>
<li>First off, should the Bible verses query that started all this be relayed to Arbitration? Does the issue of explicating an entire work needs a binding solution from them?</li>
<li>Secondly, does Wikipedia advocate making broken links in the hope someone will create the pages they're referring to?</li>
<li>Third, am I right in thinking it better to have a broken link over a fixed link?</li>
<li>Fourth, should this be relayed to Mediation and/or Arbitration? Which should it go to?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you guys very much for your time; you have no idea how much it is valued by the rest of us.</p>

<dd>IMO:
<ol>
<li>No, I don't think so.</li>
<li>Actually, generally yes. But this smells like a slightly extreme case of redlinking. Frankly, I would be inclined to wait and see if a WikiProject for bible verse is created and actively contributed to, and it very well may, and which leads to more thorough population of bible verse articles, decimating the red sea of links. (heh, heh.) Now on the other hand, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28links%29_308c.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)">Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(links)</a> suggests that if more than 10% of the links on a page are dead, it would be generally considered "overlinked". That page looks like 1/3 of links are red.</li>
<li>You mean that the other way around, don't you? Either way, I'm not sure how to answer that question; I don't think there is a clear consensus. Certainly links with content are better than dead links. And the general convention seems to have been that you link to the most fitting <i>existing</i> article on a topic, and then once a more detailed page exists, someone will update the link to the more detailed article. This happens all the time.</li>
<li>I doubt it. One avenue may be to encourage SimonP and those who voted Keep in the VfD (as a group via the VFD page or <a href="../../../j/o/h/Talk%7EJohn_20%7E16_bd72.html" title="Talk:John 20:16">Talk:John 20:16</a> talk page, <i>not</i> via a mass commenting on all their user pages) to form or contribute to a WikiProject on bible verses and start filling them in.</li>
</ol>

<dd>Thanks, Keith.
<ol>
<li>Cool. I'm glad I didn't go rushing there first, then.</li>
<li>I'll bring up the overlinking issue on the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Talk%7EChristian_views_of_homosexuality_ee42.html" title="Talk:Christian views of homosexuality">Talk:Christian views of homosexuality</a> page if the debate continues.</li>
<li>Yeah, I meant the other way around. I'm thinking that perhaps, as a show of mediation, I should do both: <a href="../../../l/e/v/Leviticus.html" title="Leviticus">Leviticus</a> 18:22 ... I'm hoping that this form of help would satisfy all users in question.</li>
<li>Do you think I should start this WikiProject myself without a goal of maintaining it? Or should I just write in the Talk pages for the verses that a WikiProject should be formed?</li>

<dd>I would only create the project if you're willing to coordinate it. IMO it should be SimonP that creates a WikiProject, since he is basically intending to kick off a project of sorts. That would be the established way to kick off and organize a series of articles of such a scale. And he ought to know that. - <a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeithTyler_1a57.html" title="User:KeithTyler">Keith D.

<p>I'm getting into an edit war since I have already deleted and been reverted twice. The issue is as follows: The Mestizo article cites "official" statistics regarding the percentage of mixed race populations in Latin America that seemed phony to me since I am familiar with research in this area. After requesting a reference three times, the poster in question answered that they came from the CIA. I went to the CIA web site and nowhere does it indicate who, where and when these statistics come from, that is, there is no primary source. Furthermore, I have googled and can't find any other reference to these statistics or even something similar. I can provide links to researchers who state that race statistics in Latin America are limited to estimates of indigineous communities and more recently, and only in five Latin American nations, to the descendants of Blacks. I would be grateful if someone familiar with the issue of the validity of statistics would be so kind as to mediate.</p>
<p>I am having the same problem in the Spanish version because it has been regarded that changing "official statistics" to "estimates" solves the problem of citing phony numbers.--<a href="../../../l/u/p/User%7ELupita%C2%BA_e75f.html" title="User:LupitaÂº">LupitaÂº</a> 16:08, 12 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I replied to this user indicating that a request for comment is what she is looking for where getting answers to her questions is concerned; I did notice she was having a problem with an abusive user on that page's talk section, however, and offered my assistance if she felt dispute resolution necessary. Alas, an examination of her contributions shows that filing this request was one of the last things she did on Wikipedia, so she may be gone for good. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWally_e20c.html" title="User:Wally">Wally</a> 03:49, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Wikipedia page being used for criminal purposes and libelous statments, for right wing extremist</span></h3>
<p>A Wiki page that is supposedly a biography of a right-wing extremist celebrity, is being used for criminal purposes and deception. Most significantly, a large part of the page is being used to conduct a libelous malicious attack upon the celebrity's biographer (myself), and provides false statements of recent felony crimes by the celebrity that may be prosecuted. The Wiki page is thus a felony act of obstruction of justice. This celebrity pays a lot of money to control public image, and it appears that the Wiki page controller is on the celebrity's payroll. The real facts of the celebrity's life are omitted and deleted, NPOV warning has been deleted, false statements are being made and re-inserted. Seems like a scheme to use Wiki's neutral image to help cover up for felony crimes. I am not a Wiki veteran. Request assistance on this blatant violation of Wiki policies.

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Sister project templates</span></h3>
<p>I've been in a long-standing dispute with <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItai_a5d4.html" title="User:Itai">Itai</a> (<a href="../../../i/t/a/User_talk%7EItai_5482.html" title="User talk:Itai">talk</a> Â· <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Itai_7815.html" title="Special:Contributions/Itai">contributions</a>) over his creation of <a href="../../../s/i/s/Template%7ESisterproject_9331.html" title="Template:Sisterproject">Template:Sisterproject</a>, and subsequent use of it as a "meta-template" (a template-within-a-template that provides formatting). Over the course of this, I've gather input from the developers describing the negative server/database impact of such practices, and documented it at <a href="../../../m/e/t/Wikipedia%7EMeta-templates_considered_harmful_c554.html" title="Wikipedia:Meta-templates considered harmful">Wikipedia:Meta-templates considered harmful</a>. Even after that, Itai continues to revert over this issue (and has been blocked for two 3RR violations over them). As one can see from his <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Itai_7815.html" title="Special:Contributions/Itai">contributions</a>, almost all of his recent edits have been to continue this. Because these are obscure templates, and there is a good deal of technical background to this, I've been unable to locate anyone willing to help convince him to stop, or even someone who could co-sign an RFC on the matter. Recently, evidence of my reverts has been presented against me in an <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Netoholic_2_Evidence_731d.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Netoholic 2/Evidence">Arbitration case</a>, but I feel that it is this user, who does almost no other editing, that has caused this to be ceaseless. Even after I gathered the technical information, he seems more intent on getting his way than discussing.</p>
<p>In short, I ask someone to help first assist me in getting him to stop his reversions (since there is a definite server impact), and then also to help with the associated section of my arbitration case. I do not want to be punished for reverting in order to reduce the load on the servers. -- <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">Netoholic</a> <a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetoholic_549c.html" title="User talk:Netoholic">@</a> 18:56, 2005 Mar 24 (UTC)</p>
