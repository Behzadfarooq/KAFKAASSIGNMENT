<p>While we share a disagreement over photos&#160;:), I nonetheless value your wine knowledge and contribution to the <a href="../../../z/i/n/Zinfandel.html" title="Zinfandel">Zinfandel</a> page. I would love if you consider joining the <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINE_d58a.html" title="WP:WINE">Wikipedia Wine Project</a> to help expand Wikipedia's quality of wine articles. In particular are several discussions on the talk page (one of which you inspire&#160;:p) that you may find interesting and want to contribute to. As you can probably tell there is a lot of groundwork that needs to be laid. I hope you join! <a href="../../../a/g/n/User%7EAgne27_b326.html" title="User:Agne27">Agne</a> 18:59, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I dont agree with your reasons for deleting this article. While much of the text comes from the MBA article, I feel that this is reasonable, as it gives the pros and cons of ranking programs. I feel that this is relevant information that people who go to the MBA article would want to read.</p>
<p>I chose the FT rankings for two reasons,</p>
<p>1. It is one of the two most respected rankings of Business Schools, but it includes global schools unlike the other big list Business Week, which only ranks American schools.</p>
<p>2. The rankings are published online, unlike the business week rankings which they charge for. I did not think it was right to publish the BW rankings on wpedia, as the list is their IP, and they do not wish to give it out for free online.</p>
<p>I will remove the tag you added for these reasons, and I feel that this article if left online should be useful, and edited by many other users. Thus if you question the NPOV of my piece, that should change. I must also add that as a graduate (PhD) from a business school, my Alma Mater is not included in those rankings, so I have no vested interest in publishing it.</p>
<p>Please feel free to nominate it for deletion, I hope other users will find it useful and vote to keep it.</p>

<dd>Looks to me like he just blanks his talk page when a conversation becomes old, relying on the page history as his archive. How's that make him a sockpuppet?

<p>Hi Amatulic,</p>
<p>Rather than getting into a revert war on the MBA rankings article, may I suggest that you nominate it for deletion again, and this time allow the nomination to run to completion. The prior run was too fast to give me a chance to respond, and did not wait until a moderator could decide on the outcome.</p>
<p>I do not wish to appear argumentative, but I feel that this piece is a sidebar to the central MBA page, and thus should be a separate article. I also feel that over time it allows a history of rankings to be preserved, which the sites linked to do not store.</p>
<p>I wrote a full piece on why I feel the article should be kept on its archived articles for deletion page, which I hope you will read and consider.</p>
<p>Best wishes, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaviegold_6838.html" title="User:Daviegold">Daviegold</a> 11:26, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The article is out of control. I don't believe that it is of any encyclopedic value at all. They are filling it with irrelevent material. He is a D-grade disc-jockey and yet they have padded out his article with information right down to children's names, his tertiary history, and the changing names of his radio show. I doubt his qualification for an article here, and I fear that it has degenerated into a fan-page.</p>

It looks like I'm going to be using it often. Any places to prevent people -- who appear to be WikiStalker, who come out of nowhere and start attacking for the edits I make -- from reverting everything I do whould be nice as well.

<p>Hello Mr. Matulich. I'm wondering if you can clarify your third opinion(?) on the Georg Cantor discussion page with us. Your sentence of "keep the relevant assertions in place" was interpreted by some people to mean "leave the Jewish categories despite the sources that say he was not Jewish." I interpreted it to mean "leave, in the text, both POVS that say he was Jewish and not Jewish 'but' displease both POVs by not asserting one over another." In my opinion, adding Jewish categories asserts that there's more validity in the POV of the biographers that say he was Jewish as opposed to those biographers that say he wasn't. We can't have Cantor in both a Jewish category and NOT in a Jewish category in the way we can have a person who's French or German heritage is in conflict be both in a German category and French category. However, not being in a Jewish category doesn't automatically mean the person isn't Jewish, just like Georg Cantor isn't in a Danish category, that doesn't mean he's not Danish. Putting him in a Jewish category, in my opinion, is implementing a POV over another. Can you clear up the confusion? ----Tellerman</p>

<dd>You can use images from <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="commons:">Wikimedia Commons</a> just like normal images on Wikipedia, ie: [[Image:Some Image on Commons]]</dd>
<dd>To upload an image on commons:
<ol>
<li>Create an account on commons. For some reason you need an account for every different <a href="../../../s/i/s/WP%7ESISTER_80bb.html" title="WP:SISTER">MediaWiki project</a>.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/special:upload" class="extiw" title="commons:special:upload">commons:special:upload</a></li>
<li>Upload it (you have to save it to your hard drive first, you can't grab it streight from the website). There's good instructions on the page, but it's the same as Wikipedia's image upload stuff.</li>

<dd>Thanks. I take it, then, that there's no "clean" way to reference an image directly on the Italian Wikipedia?

<p>Hi Amatulic, I have great friends in Croatia (I'm referring to your personal page)&#160;:) And they've promised to take me yachting in the beautiful (I'm told) islands off the southern coast. I cant wait!</p>
<p>Thanks for your third opinion on the IIPM article. Honestly, you're right that both sides could do a better job of witing NPOV statements. However, I'm open to re-writing, whereas all MakrandJoshi does is revert. I'd appreciate it greatly if you could spend some time (a few days, perhaps), on the IIPM article talk page, to keep both sides honest, so to speak.</p>

<p>PS - So blogs are not citeable sources, nyet? And if a magazie is published and edited by the same person, it becomes self-published and also not citeable? That was my understanding from Wikipedia:Verifiability.</p>
<dl>
<dd>You will enjoy Croatia. If you get a chance to go inland, you must also visit <a href="../../../p/l/i/Plitvice.html" title="Plitvice">Plitvice</a>. And definitely <a href="../../../d/u/b/Dubrovnik.html" title="Dubrovnik">Dubrovnik</a> is a place to stop if you're yachting. Cruise ships stop there. You can spend half the day walking Dubrovnik's city wall.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are times when it's sensible to cite a blog, such as if the blog is run by an "official" source of information for the article. One example would be an article about a notable person who runs a blog. Another example might be a Microsoft developer working on a particular Microsoft product, who runs a blog related to that product. He would not be able to publish information about his employer's product without permission from his employer. I would say that's a citable source in an article about that product because this person involved with product development can be considered an official source of information.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to a magazine published and edited by the same person, it may not be a problem in some situations. Many magazines and newspapers start out that way. Citing an article in such a magazine may not be a problem if the article was written by a reporter on the magazine staff, <i>or</i> if the magazine itself can be considered "notable" in some way. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 17:47, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm fairly certain that there is an error in the formula you posted for the solid angle subtended by a rectangular pyramid in the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solid_angle.html" title="Solid angle">solid angle</a> article. The formula does not reduce to the correct version in the limit of small angles (where it should simply be <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/d/1/2d1dc88200d501549f9d6edae3d6c195.png" alt="a \times b" />; your formula reduces to <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/f/b/9fb8f09f35764ab24af9357bc7d05984.png" alt="a \times b^2" />). The error, I believe, arose in the limits that were used in integrating over the polar angle. These limits should be <img class='tex' src="../../../math/2/f/d/2fd04a627b32d520e08c93ea1eec69ff.png" alt="\left( {\pi \over 2} - {b \over 2}, {\pi \over 2} + {b\over 2} \right)" />, not <span class="texhtml">(0,<i>b</i>)</span>.</p>
<p>Also, I had simplified the formula for the special case of a square pyramid (I do not understand the source of the current formula; can you explain?) and had placed it below the more general case of the rectangular pyramid, as this seemed more sensible.</p>
<p>I notice that as I was writing this you removed the rectangular pyramid formula. Before I re-enter the correct version, I'll wait for your reply. I'm happy to provide a more detailed derivation if you like.</p>
<p>By the way, I believe your previous formula for the rectangular pyramid is actually correct for a triangular pyramid.</p>

<dl>
<dd>I know it's an error. I inadvertantly put in a version of a formula for a triangular wedge or something similar. Also, my description is wrong: A true rectangular pyramid consists of four planes that would intersect the sphere forming great circle arcs. That's not what I was trying to define. Instead I described a latitute-longitude rectangle (lines of latitude aren't great circle arcs). The derivation can be done by double-integrating the area element given on <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalCoordinates.html" class="external text" title="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalCoordinates.html" rel="nofollow">Mathworld</a>, or it can be derived algebraically as shown on <a href="http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/63767.html" class="external text" title="http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/63767.html" rel="nofollow">Dr. Math's forum</a>.</dd>
<dd>I'm not sure how to do the true rectangular pyramid yet. If you want to add it, feel free.</dd>
<dd>Also, I didn't create that square pyramid formula. It looks too messy to be real. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 18:50, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>1. For what we were both <i>trying</i> to compute, the formula I posted was correct, I think. I derived it by integrating the solid angle element near the equator of a unit sphere.</p>
<p>2. You are right that this was not actually a rectangular pyramid; I had made the same mistake. That is the formula I was seeking when I first started this process, and I'm pretty sure I can derive it. I'll do so now and post it later.</p>
<p>3. I'm new to editing Wikipedia. Is there some provision for sidebars or footnotes where I can put up a more complete derivation of these things? It seems a useful thing to do so long as it's not cluttering up the main article. It also seems worthwhile to add a note pointing out the difference between a pyramid and a lattitude-longitude rectangle.</p>
<p>Bgerke 19:54, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There's a way to put footnotes in an article (you enclose your footnote in &lt;ref&gt;...&lt;/ref&gt; tags, and put a section called ==References== at the bottom of the article, containing one line: &lt;div class="references-small&gt;&lt;references/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;). You'll see that in other articles with footnotes. However, that may not be appropriate here. It's probably enough to put your derivation in the talk page, so that anyone who questions the formula in the article can see where it came from. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 20:14, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It was trickier than I expected, but I worked it out. Will post it later tonight or tomorrow. Incidentally, the regular-pyramid formula is correct but can be simplified somewhat. Bgerke 02:46, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Great! I look forward to seeing it. By the way, there is a prohibition on posting original research on Wikipedia (see <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>) but after reading it over, I don't think it applies to posting mathematical formulas derived using common well-known mathematical procedures. It might qualify as "synthesis" but it isn't being used to advance a position, so it's probably OK. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 18:55, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's posted, and I linked to my derivation from the talk page as you suggested. Thanks for your guidance. Bgerke 20:52, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I meant linking to them on your request.

<p>The reason I asked was to check how many edits you had in other projects. After the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/SUL" class="extiw" title="m:SUL">single unified login</a> transition, if there's several accounts with the same name across several projects, the account with most edits gets assigned the global account, and receives the login everywhere. If that is the case, then it may not be necessary to request for an usurpation right now, if it is going to be done automatically later on. (Although, keep in mind that SUL has been promised for a while, and only until recently work has been done on it, so no one knows how long it is going to take to finish.) <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito<span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 18:16, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, my Anachronist account has more edits in Wiktionary and Commons than the same name account here on Wikipedia (which has 1 edit, in 2002). So what do I do, put redirects on all my user pages, redirecting to the Anachronist Wikipedia account, which isn't mine? That seems rather subversive. Also, all my edits as 'Amatulic' wouldn't change to the new name. I'd have to abandon this Amatulic account, no? -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmatulic_b5b8.html" title="User:Amatulic">Amatulic</a> 18:43, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for trying to keep the Talk:Robert Prechter page in good shape, you made the edit when I was also working on it.
