<p><b>Have you read the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_FAQs_e346.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA FAQs">AMA FAQ</a>?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Answer: Yes</li>
</ul>
<p><b>How would you describe the nature of this dispute? (policy violation, content dispute, personal attack, other)</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Answer: Unilaterally locking an article from recreation!!! Bureacracy, Wrongful deletion, Article subject biase, Christians opposed to anything remotely heathen such as Anal stretching.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What methods of <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">Dispute Resolution</a> have you tried so far? If you can, please provide wikilinks so that the Advocate looking over this case can see what you have done.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Answer: First the article 'Anal stretching' was brought up for deletion here:<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Anal_stretching" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Anal_stretching" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Anal_stretching</a><br /></li>
</ul>
<p>I objected. Consensus was to delete, but I found this very biased, the article just needed work, amendments, not deletion!!!<br />
The article was then deleted by Yomangani for being a 'how-to' guide (disagree), also dicdef (disagree), and badly referenced (possible).<br />
I then brought the article up on deletion review:<br />
<a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html#Anal_stretching" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a><br />
The user Guy (JzG) said the deletion was for valid reason, but that I am free to recreate the article so long as it is properly referenced, etc. So I begun to redo the article, but it was then promptly deleted by Guy (JzG) and <b>locked</b> from recreation!<br />
Not only was that a <b>unilateral</b> action, but it means that nobody (not even me) can recreate the article better.<br />
Back on the Deletion Review, everybody seems to think the article wasn't up to scratch because it was badly referenced -- which is why I put a template tag saying the article should be better referenced.</p>
<p><br />
<b>What do you expect to get from <a href="../../../a/m/a/WP%7EAMA_ced1.html" title="WP:AMA">Advocacy</a>?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Answer: 1) The article Anal_Stretching should be unlocked and recreation allowed. There has been no actual objection to the existance of the article, just heavy-handed admins deleting as many articles as they can.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>2) An admin needs to help me understand precisely what is wrong with the article that was deleted. Some insist its like a 'how to' guide, others say it isn't. My attempt to recreate the article ensured it wasn't -- it was deleted and locked. Others say it's badly referenced. I believe there are decent references, but they need to be wikified and edited appropriately, and as such I put in a template saying so -- they ignored and deleted nonetheless.</p>

<p>Hello Rfwoolf, I'm <a href="../../../d/f/r/User%7EDfrg.msc_c6f9.html" title="User:Dfrg.msc">Dfrg.msc</a> (<a href="../../../d/f/r/User_talk%7EDfrg.msc_187f.html" title="User talk:Dfrg.msc">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dfrg.msc_2c84.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dfrg.msc">contribs</a>) and I'll be your advocate for your case: <strong class="selflink">Wikipedia:AMA Requests for Assistance/Requests/December 2006/Rfwoolf</strong>.</p>
<p>Firstly, I see what you want to do, unfortunately I can't see what it looked like before ans subsequently why it was deleted. However, what I could discern from the Deletion article was that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read like a how-to guide</li>
<li>It was unverifiable</li>
<li>It was unsourced POV</li>
<li>It was a howto and a place for dicdefs</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Positively:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Subject matter did not come into question</li>
<li>"Legitimate concept that needs to be referenced"</li>
<li>Could be referenced properly</li>
</ul>
<p>I've no idea about these actions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The user Guy (JzG) said the deletion was for valid reason, but that I am free to recreate the article so long as it is properly referenced, etc. So I begun to redo the article, but it was then promptly deleted by Guy (JzG) and locked from recreation!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it doesn't matter. I have had previous dealings with JzG before. He is not unreasonable. I understand that you can't edit the article, but it shows promise. What I suggest you do is construct the article here or in a test page, and then upon completion take it to JzG. If it is decent article then I'm sure he will unlock the page so you can paste it in.</p>

<dd>The following is my response, as posted on Dfrg.msc's user talk page:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Hi Dfrg.msc, thank-you for your response to my AMA issue, as posted on my talk page. Note for starters that the history of the Anal Stretching article has been made available thanks to my concerns, here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anal_stretching&amp;action=history" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anal_stretching&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anal_stretching&amp;action=history</a> (you can find this link on the Deletion Review page in the Anal Stretching node)</p>
<p>Your suggestion about the article being locked for recreation, that I recreate the article on my usertalk page and then call Guy to review it, is rather problematic. Firstly, Wikipedia should be a collaborative effort, and it is unfair to ask me to rebuild an article from scratch all by myself, and, if you review the history of the article before it was up for deletion orginally, you will see that it was never that bad at all, in fact only 1 paragraph in the entire article could even be accused of being a how-to guide, and as for the bad referencing, I think it just needed to have a small referencing cleanup -- I was all for <b>amendment</b> as opposed to <b>deletion</b>.<br />
Let me conclude with these two points and please let me know your response:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Surely Guy's decision to lock the article from recreation is unfair -- I remain fully reasonable and don't think I abused the recreation process -- but if I did I was unawares. The article should be unlocked so that <b>multiple</b> users can try recreate the article, not just me. When the article was up for deletion debate, at least one user said that Anal Stretching seems like a legit concept that could be referenced properly, i.e. the article <b>should</b> exist, just properly.</li>
<li>Aside from the recreation lock being unilateral and inappropriate, I would value your opinion -- looking at how the article looked before deletion -- on whether there was good grounds to delete the article to begin with. Maybe I am ignorant on deletion policy, but I currently <b>insist</b> the article just needed to be amended, not deleted, even if it was left as a stub. Deletion is a lazy solution to an article problem, and it seems that many admins are just amendment-lazy, and deletion-happy. It seems some admins may be offended by the subject matter of the article -- Guy is a significant christian -- and he made a comment to another admin that "he just wanted to see the article deleted". What do you think? Maybe you can help me understand why the article needed to be deleted instead of amended. There is even a wiki template that says "this article is being cleaned up to comply with deletion debate"</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>That said, I thank you for your input whenever you are ready.</p>
<p>I am in no mood to re-research an article that was nearly good before it was deleted. That's just stupid.<br />

<dd>I'll thank you for being highly professional about this. It will make the process run much more smoothly. You remind me of me when I first joined, I really wanted to give it to those deletion-happy or as I once said: "trigger-happy deletionists". And I didn't get very far. I learnt my first and hardest lesson: <b>Wikipedia is not a democracy</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, I have to agree with you. You raise valid points which deserve to be answered:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is a collaberative effort and ideally, everyone should be able to edit it.</li>
<li>I have viewed the article and although is was not perfect, it seemed decent enough (better by far, than most articles out there).</li>
<li>Guy's decision to lock the article from recreation <i>seems</i> unfair, though talking to him may shed some light.</li>
<li>I see no reason for the article not to exist (first though, it needs work).</li>
<li>I'd hope that Guy's religion would not influence his decision, and I have confidence that it didn't.</li>
<li>It does not matter that the article was deleted, it can be remade very easily. Just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anal_stretching&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=95113669" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anal_stretching&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=95113669" rel="nofollow">view the source</a> and copy it into the new article.</li>
<li>You'll find that there is no need to re-research the article, most all of it can be salvaged. <a href="../../../d/f/r/User%7EDfrg.msc_c6f9.html" title="User:Dfrg.msc">Dfrg.m</a><a href="../../../d/f/r/User%7EDfrg.msc_EA_8dac.html" title="User:Dfrg.msc/EA"><font color="green">s</font></a><a href="../../../d/f/r/User%7EDfrg.msc_c6f9.html" title="User:Dfrg.msc">c</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../d/f/r/User_talk%7EDfrg.msc_187f.html" title="User talk:Dfrg.msc">1</a> . <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_climbing_the_Reichstag_dressed_as_Spider-Man_5db1.html" title="Wikipedia:No climbing the Reichstag dressed as Spider-Man">2</a> . <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Dfrg.msc_78dc.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Dfrg.msc">Editor Review</a></sup></small> 22:17, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>What follows are my rebuttles and response to Guy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The article was deleted by consensus at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Anal_stretching_78a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Anal stretching">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Anal stretching</a>.<br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>--Nope, near-consensus. I agree that there was near-consensus on <i>issues</i> with the article, but those issues shouldn't necessarily be grounds for outright deletion. Also, nobody (including yourself or Dfrg.msc) have been able to adequately explain why it was better to eliminate an entire article instead of <b>amending it</b> -- that is to say that you thought the entire article was useless -- and yet all over wikipedia are dozens of stubs that get to stay, far worse articles that get to stay, but with <i>anal stretching</i>, some unclear referencing and a small paragraph that was slightly <i>how-to</i>ish, and it's grounds for absolute deletion -- without a scrap being saved. <i>...cos that's what we do in wikipedia, we take hard work, and if there's a few problems we scrap the whole thing!</i> No admins even once tried to put up 'bad referencing' templates or 'reads like a how-to guide' templates, not even once, instead you simply clicked and deleted! Do you agree with that philosophy, delete instead of improve?&#160;:(<br /></dd>
</dl>
Rfwoolf was told he was free to create a new article. What he did was to repost <i>three times</i> an all-but-identical article which was therefore deleted under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G4" title="WP:CSD">criterion G4</a> of the criteria for speedy deletion. The deletion was <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_Log_2006_December_18_8591.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review/Log/2006 December 18">reviewed and endorsed</a>.<br />
<dl>
<dd>Please note well, that while I admit the repost may have occured <i>three times</i>, I must stress that this happened in one <i>repost attempt</i>, while I was trying to <i>fix the article</i> (look up <i>amendment</i> in the dictionary) but deletion-happy admins kept on deleting the article. I ask you, how else am I to amend an article if people keep deleting it? One of the first things I did was read through it to fix the <i>how-to</i> complaint, which you must admit I seemed to do. So now you will see that your apparent <i>good-faith</i> wasn't misplaced. I was trying to fix an article <i>three times</i> and it was deleted, <i>three times</i>.</dd>
</dl>
As to it being a "unilateral" action, here are the logs:
<dl>
<dd>-You have mis-read. I said your <i>blocking</i> of the article was unilateral not its deletion, and so far, <b>it was</b>. The original article deletion was closer to consensus views, but nobody has managed to rationalise why deletion of every word in the article was better than amendment. Furthermore your <b>unilateral</b> blocking of the article has meant that <b>nobody</b> can recreate the article, decently or otherwise.<br /></dd>

Rfwoolf told me he had a new, different, fixed version - when I checked the deleted history I found it was almost word for word the same article.<br />
<dl>
<dd>Well, that's because no drastic changes were necessary, ie. the main complaint of the article was that it was too <i>how-to</i>ish, which is what I tried to fix, along with improving the referencing and putting up a <i>bad references</i> template. That is why the article was <i>almost word for word the same article</i> -- and I hadn't finished yet. Nor had the wikipedia community which you have banned from the article.<br /></dd>

<dl>
<dd>In short I say to you that your <b>deletion</b> of every word of the article seems unfair given that the deletion review complained of a <i>how-to guide</i> -- and the entire article was not a <i>how-to guide</i>, complained of bad referencing -- which a simple wikitemplate would have rectified. But then, as if that wasn't unfair enough, your outright unilateral blocking of the article from recreation serves only to further prove bad will to the article and bad faith.<br /></dd>
<dd>We can put all of this disagreement behind us, if you'll unblock the article, and allow me (and 6 billion people) to try fix the article up, add in some tags about bad referencing and reading like a <i>how-to guide</i>, and let the article exist, even in a stub form, for the sake of knowledge and the vision that wikipedia and its community share.

<p>The article was deleted through process, the deletion was reviewed and endorsed. Your own behaviour in repeatedly reposting all but identical content is the reason the article was <a href="../../../s/a/l/WP%7ESALT_ca07.html" title="WP:SALT">salted</a>. Your other contributions to the project are few, which raises legitimate questions regarding your motivation for obsession about this particular subject. <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">Policy</a> states that articles deleted through process and re-created in substantially similar form may be <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G4" title="WP:CSD">speedily deleted</a> and if necessary locked to prevent re-creation.

Your chances of getting me to remove the protection other than through that preocess are slim, since you already abused my trust once by reposting substantially identical content. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 09:17, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Assuming there was perfectly good grounds for deletion, the locking is unnecessary, and as Dfrg.msc even agrees, Wikipedia is a collaborative process, i.e. if the article on Anal Stretching should exist, it should be open to all, not just me. By your own comments it seems that the article has been locked <i>because of me</i> which is arguably unfair, but, ultimately needs to be unlocked to allow recreation by a variety of people. You of all people understand that wikipedia is a collaborative place, and new articles don't just appear in full -- but instead most of them appear as <b>stubs</b> which get built on and developed by various people. By your rationale that I recreate the article on my usertalk page, would you therefore accept a stub? Surely you can't expect me to take Anal Stretching on as a research assignment? Dfrg.msc even said that most of the deleted article is usable. This indicates that a) the article should exist, even as a stub, and b) that I can recreate the article on my usertalk page as a stub and you will accept it. If not, then you're being rather rediculous.<br />
I should also point out that it is usually not wiki policy to lock articles from recreation permanently, you are only justified in locking it from me -- and even then you should have now read my reason for recreating it 3 times and my attempts to fix it which should restore good faith. Unlock the article, work with me so that it doesn't get speedy-deleted again, and I'll see what I can do. <a href="../../../r/f/w/User%7ERfwoolf_6c5c.html" title="User:Rfwoolf">Rfwoolf</a> 09:42, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It's not over surprising that your advocate takes your side - that's rather the point. But having re-created substantially identical content several times, protection absolutely is warranted, as noted at deletion review.

<dd>I am being civil. I am also being firm. Rfwoolf previously said he had a new, different article, but it turned out to be an all-but-identical reposting of the same content (<a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G4" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#G4</a>). Several admins deleted it as such. I <a href="../../../s/a/l/WP%7ESALT_ca07.html" title="WP:SALT">salted</a> the title, but I don't do that unless there has been serial re-creation, which there was ni this case. There was a deletion review, the deletion was endorsed <i>as a re-creation of content deleted by AfD</i>. If Rfwoolf wants this article he can do it through process, which is to take the <i>new an different</i> article to deletion review. I would be more inclined to help if it weren't for Rfwoolf's previous abuse of good faith, the sub-trivial nature of the subject and his lack of substantive contributions to the encyclopaedia. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 17:23, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>1) <b>Re: <i>"...his lack of substantive contributions to the encyclopaedia"</i></b><br />
is absolutely 150% irrelevant. My contribution to this encyclopedia shouldn't make a difference to whether or not I am in the wrong or in the right. You are trying to use a straw-man approach. My contributions to Wikipedia have no merit in your argument whatsoever. Why do you avoid the issue by making irrelevant attacks against me?<br /></dd>
<dd>2) <b>Re: <i>"Rfwoolf previously said he had a new, different article, but it turned out to be an all-but-identical reposting of the same content</i></b><br />
is inaccurate. All I ever motioned to do was to fix the problems found by Deletion Review, <b>namely 'reads like a how-to guide</b> and <b>bad referencing</b> -- that isn't much. <b>More over</b>, before I even had a chance to fix the article, it was continuously deleted by G4, before being protected from recreation -- <b>I never even had the chance to fix the article -- even though on some level I did fix it!</b> So instead of <b>working with me</b> or <b>communicating that my recreations of the article were invalid</b> you instead <b>bit the newcomer</b> (see <a href="../../../n/e/w/WP%7ENEWBIES_6840.html" title="WP:NEWBIES">WP:NEWBIES</a>), accused me of ill-will, and protected the article from recreation. As Dfrg.msc says -- and I agree -- try work more <b>with me</b>. The article should exist -- in its rightful form -- and your protection from recreation has no respect for that.<br /></dd>
<dd>3) <b>Re: <i>"I SALT the title, but I don't do that unless there has been serial re-creation, which there was ni this case.</i> "</b>,<br />
and, I have appealed this, saying that I only recreated the article <b>3 (three) times</b> -- which is hardly serial recreation -- and explained I did so within the space of an hour or so because I kept on trying to fix it before admins deleted it on grounds of G4. <i>In other words</i> your assumption of 'ill-will' is inaccurate. Unsalt the article.<br /></dd>
<dd>4<b>) Re: <i>if it weren't for [...] the sub-trivial nature of the subject</i></b><br />
is also irrelevant. There are plenty of trivial subjects on wikipedia, including an article on mugs for example -- this is no reason to disregard the merits of my case. And, as it happens, I suspect there are plenty of people out there (I'm one of them) that would be interested in reading an article on Anal Stretching -- it's why I looked it up in the first place -- as well as sexologists in general. The article should exist! Don't be biased. <a href="../../../r/f/w/User%7ERfwoolf_6c5c.html" title="User:Rfwoolf">Rfwoolf</a> 12:47, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><i>Any questions/comment/disagreements/new proposals go here.</i></p>
<p>While it is refreshing that you have a remotely feasible proposal, it still seems like the long way round, and forces me to research and recreate an article all by myself, collaborating with only myself. It seems you (and Guy) leave me no choice, but I will try recreate the article on the Anal_Stretching talk page -- so that on some level it will be a collaborative effort where other sexology editors or passers-by can assist. <a href="../../../r/f/w/User%7ERfwoolf_6c5c.html" title="User:Rfwoolf">Rfwoolf</a> 05:51, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Perhaps you should have thought of that before you serially re-created deleted content in clear defiance of policy, and abused my good faith in doing so. Had you rewritten rather than simply reposting after I userfied the content for you, we would not even be having this conversation. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 12:37, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Rfwoolf will be allowed to continue to edit this User talk:Rfwoolf/Anal stretching uninterrupted and without persecution. It will not be deleted or degraded in anyway.</p>
<p>Upon completion, the article will be reviewed by myself and Guy. Pending that, the article will be restored.</p>
<ul>
<li>The correct venue for review is <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a>, as stated numerous times. I can't guarantee that edits will be uninterrupted (Woolf has dragged enough other admins into this that there may well be interruptions). Persecution? Begging the question. Rfwoolf has been disruptive and rude, many editors have eben blocked or banned for less. Nobody is or ever was persecutring him. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 11:23, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I don't mind the venue of review being <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">Deletion Review</a> (my original bone of contention was the Guy protected the article from recreation which stopped a collaborative effort on fixing the article). To that end, don't you think the article should be allowed to be rewritten in the Anal Stretching talk page? Mel Etitis <b>may</b> have expressed the possibility for that.
