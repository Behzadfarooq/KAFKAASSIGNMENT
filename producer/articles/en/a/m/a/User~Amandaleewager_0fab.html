I did not wanna wear it so My friend Theresa and i walked out and she walked to her house and I went to mine. I was watching tv when all of the sudden I get a phone call from Samantha's teacher telling me she was hitchhicking up on 9N. i went to the school to tell my mom she told me to go get her, i was not gonna run all over town for her so i called the cops and they came to the school and told me to get my mom and Theresa and I both went to get her. The cop told me to go find her while he talked to my mom. I was half way down the road when My mom told me to come here. Theresa and I walked up to her and asked her waht's wrong? Because she was crying, So here we are drivin off and she told me he could of turned her in for Samantha not being with us and Samantha could have gotton takin away. My mom told us "for now on you's guys need to stay with me at all times" WE did not know if anything happend to her or not. But we found her and we told Sam what the cops told her. I said "They have no right yelling in your face mom it's not your falt!" He's a freaking bastred anyways mom we could turn him in for yelling in your face. He has no right doing that!</p>
