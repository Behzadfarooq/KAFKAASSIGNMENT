<p>hi I have been using Wiki for over 3 years and have never had any problems until this new user came along and changed everything I have done as soon as I do it, I will admit I did have a few things wrong and that was fine and sorted the worst area at the movement is in the Electoral district of Thuringowa and Townsville every ref on this page (except 1) says Townsville is one electoral district and Thuringowa is one electoral district but he keeps changing it to say that it is a Townsville based electoral due to one ref saying Townsville at the top and this ref is from a reporter im sure the Government know the facts. plus he now changes everything I do eg the Townsville ring road is not called that any more and I added (now known as the ring road) and it got changed, on the Townsville page he listed all the schools from Thuringowa in it under schools in Townsville so I added (Townsville and Thuringowa) and again changed but yet he goes on about it being a Townsville page and he list the Thuringowa schools and shops as part of Townsville this is part of the problem please see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_Townsville%2C_Queensland_10a5.html" title="List of schools in Townsville, Queensland">List of schools in Townsville, Queensland</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThuringowacityrep_1306.html" title="User talk:Thuringowacityrep">User talk:Thuringowacityrep</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/w/Talk%7ETownsville%2C_Queensland_d0da.html" title="Talk:Townsville, Queensland">Talk:Townsville, Queensland</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThuringowacityrep_1306.html" title="User talk:Thuringowacityrep">User talk:Thuringowacityrep</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/u/Talk%7EBruce_Highway_a433.html" title="Talk:Bruce Highway">Talk:Bruce Highway</a> and my talk page <a href="../../../t/h/u/User_talk%7EThuringowacityrep_1306.html" title="User talk:Thuringowacityrep">User talk:Thuringowacityrep</a> I think I have done everything correct seeing how I have never had any problems before hope that you can help stop this silly dispute. I have all the facts before making any changes and I did place Thuringowa in one page a few to many times on one day but I pointed out that I have and even said sorry about it but this still goes on thank you<a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuringowacityrep_8bf0.html" title="User:Thuringowacityrep">Thuringowacityrep</a> 04:43, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I offered mediation and you started with the personal attacks again, so I decided that the best approach for me to take would be to disengage from Wikipdia for a little while, to demonstrate to you that this wasn't personal and that your POV edits would be reverted with or without me, which they were, by several users, not one Wikipedian has said anything that supports you in this dispute. At no point has this dispute been over, you just declare it to be over periodically (while continually using personal attacks and threats). I have on numerous occasions asked you to reference your edits, which you have refused to do, although you constantly refer to resources you are using, so I don't see why you can't reference the sources.</p>
<p>As for the current dispute regarding the Electoral districts, both articles specifically refer to the electorates being in the City of whatever, then they say they are one of four electorates of the Townsville-Thuringowa urban centre in North Queensland, which is fact. When you say that every reference refers to Townsville and Thuringowa Electorates as separate... of course they are! but they are located within the Townsville-Thuringowa urban centre. Just like the Noosa, Maroochydore, Glass House, Pumicestone, Nicklin, Kawana and Caloundra Electorates are all located in the district referred to as the Sunshine Coast, that's not to deny that the Electoral district of Noosa is also in the Noosa LGA, no one would have a problem saying that it is one of seven electoral districts located on the Sunshine Coast.</p>
<p>I find it laughable that you attack me using an ABC reference as a bias source and then you turn around and use a real estate agent as a news source! And then you used a media release announcing that Thuringowa is a finalist in the Customer Service Institute of Australia's Service Excellence Awards as a source for the 'fact': 'Thuringowa was again named the NQ tidest town for 2005-06'. and you've removed several maintenance tags without seeking consensus or even contacting the people who placed the maintenance notices. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=City_of_Thuringowa&amp;diff=89621442&amp;oldid=89383507" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=City_of_Thuringowa&amp;diff=89621442&amp;oldid=89383507" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=City_of_Thuringowa&amp;diff=94457434&amp;oldid=94454609" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=City_of_Thuringowa&amp;diff=94457434&amp;oldid=94454609" rel="nofollow">[2]</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=City_of_Thuringowa&amp;curid=1128683&amp;diff=94869081&amp;oldid=94722902" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=City_of_Thuringowa&amp;curid=1128683&amp;diff=94869081&amp;oldid=94722902" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> it seems to me you're just deliberately being sneaky and devious to promote your bias. Even if you’re right and Thuringowa is a completely separate city which is not generally identified as part of greater Townsville or Townsville/Thuringowa the tactics you have employed to get your point across have been down right hostile to Wikipedia policies.</p>
<p>Most of your edits do not contribute towards the expansions or improvement of articles. Their only purpose is to promote your point of view that Thuringowa is not part of the same urban conglomerate as Townsville, or at least that the two cities have conurbated (grown into each other). These 'facts' are simply not true and you have provided no supporting evidence other than the fact that there are several references to 'Thuringowa' existing both presently and historically… which no one is disputing.</p>

<p>There will of course be many references also to Thuringowa and Thuringowa localities being in the City of Thuringowa, which is not an issue, no one has disputed at any point that Thuringowa exists as a city or LGA, the point is that there are also many many many common references to these localities as being within Townsville or Townsville/Thuringowa, just as there will be many references to the localities being within the region of ‘North Queensland’.</p>
<p>This is not to belittle Thuringowa as a city/LGA, but these references demonstrate that Thuringowa is often if not commonly referred to as part of a greater urban centre called either Townsville/Thuringowa or just simply Townsville. As far as Local Government Authorities go I, of course, do not have any problems with Thuringowa, but with the continual distinguishing it from Townsville in articles which relate to the greater urban centre. Continually adding unnecessary references to Thuringowa is akin to continually stating in any article about Queensland that it includes the North Queensland region. Or even to exclude North Queensland statistics from the Queensland statistics and claim the figures as its own and not belonging to Queensland. It’s just silly, instead I can contribute to Wikipedia by further defining North Queensland and adding articles about NQ, but I don’t advance NQ in any way by vandalising Qld pages with continual references to NQ.</p>
<p>I know that [User:Thuringowacityrep|Thuringowacityrep] will not understand this as I have extensively made these points already to him/her. I have tried compromising and negotiating, but this user continues to push and try to be deceptive to advance his/her cause.</p>

<p>I really have tried to work in good faith with you but I feel that I have received a huge amount of personal attacks and grief in return for my attempts to help you understand the policies of Wikipedia.
