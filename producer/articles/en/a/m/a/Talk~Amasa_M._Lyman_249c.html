<p>This article was recently renamed <b>Amasa M. Lyman</b>. The Wikipedia Manual of Style for biographies (<a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSBIO_b227.html" title="WP:MOSBIO">WP:MOSBIO</a>) recommends using the name by which the subject is most commonly known. It's traditional in the LDS movement to use middle initials, particularly to avoid confusion with common names, but in this case, the subject is more commonly known by his full name. There are now 979 Google hits for "Amasa Mason Lyman", 971 for "Amasa Lyman", and 580 for "Amasa M. Lyman". In most scholarly and historical texts, the full name is used. Is there any evidence suggesting that "Amasa M. Lyman" is the name by which he was more commonly known? - <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuthalic_d607.html" title="User:Authalic">Justin (Authalic)</a> 17:22, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

Your "Google survey" is faulty. Google counts the number of pages on which a term appears, <i>not</i> the number of times the term appears on the Internet. Many of the entries that contain "Amasa M. Lyman" will also include "Amasa Mason Lyman", because they are commonly biography pages that include a person's full given name at the start of the article. Such a page would count 1 hit for "Amasa Mason Lyman" and 1 hit for "Amasa M. Lyman", even if the page uses "Amasa M. Lyman" 25 times and "Amasa Mason Lyman" once. Just because the full given name is included on a biography page doesn't mean it is commonly used. So why are we using Google surveys as the standard?? I suggest we find a more reliable method of determining most commonly used name. I would note that when he was alive, it appears that he was most commonly referred to simply as "Amasa Lyman" (see e.g., History of the Church, vol. 5, pp. 120, 255). <a href="../../../s/e/s/User%7ESesmith_3640.html" title="User:Sesmith">SESmith</a> 19:40, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm aware of the problems with citing the number of Google hits on a search term. You are correct that Google counts the number of pages on which a term appears and that many pages about Amasa M. Lyman will likely include his full name. I'm just saying that this is a peculiar case in that references to this individual usually include his first and last name only, or his full name, not a middle initial.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>With all of the faults inherent in a Google search, if the "Amasa M. Lyman" usage were the most common, the highest number of pages would be returned under that search term. If there is a better standard, I'm completely open to what it might be. I have done some research on this person, and most contemporary references to him use his full name or just "Amasa Lyman". It wasn't until later (after his lifetime) that the abbreviation began to be used, and that was mostly to be consistent with every other name which traditionally used a middle initial.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For comparison, look at the number of hits for "Parley P. Pratt" (57,000) to "Parley Parker Pratt" (2,540) and "Richard R Lyman" (491) to "Richard Roswell Lyman" (129). The abbreviation is clearly more widely used in those cases. "Amasa Mason Lyman" happens to be more widely used than "Amasa M. Lyman". - <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuthalic_d607.html" title="User:Authalic">Justin (Authalic)</a> 20:41, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We are confusing the issues a bit. Are we trying to determine what name he was most commonly known by when he was alive, or the name he is most commonly known by today? You suggest that we need to know the most common name when he was alive. If so, I think we'd have to go with "Amasa Lyman". -<a href="../../../s/e/s/User%7ESesmith_3640.html" title="User:Sesmith">SESmith</a> 20:46, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That gets difficult. I can't provide any examples just now, but it seems that "Amasa Lyman" is the more familiar, informal name, which was used during his lifetime. His full name seems to be used more often in an official and formal sense. But, he is referred to as "Amasa Lyman" in the Doctrine and Covenants twice. I would prefer to go with the more formal <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amasa_Mason_Lyman_b6cf.html" title="Amasa Mason Lyman">Amasa Mason Lyman</a> as the title of the article, with <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amasa_M._Lyman_354c.html" title="Amasa M. Lyman">Amasa M. Lyman</a> and <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amasa_Lyman_320a.html" title="Amasa Lyman">Amasa Lyman</a> being redirects. I'll see what I can come up with to try to resolve it either way. - <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuthalic_d607.html" title="User:Authalic">Justin (Authalic)</a> 22:32, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm open to either moving it to "Amasa Lyman" or back to "Amasa Mason Lyman". I think we have decided that "Amasa M. Lyman" is indeed inappropriate as that seems to only be used as a means of conforming his name with current LDS Church General Authority naming practices, and does not seem common then or now. - <a href="../../../s/e/s/User%7ESesmith_3640.html" title="User:Sesmith">SESmith</a> 22:50, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
