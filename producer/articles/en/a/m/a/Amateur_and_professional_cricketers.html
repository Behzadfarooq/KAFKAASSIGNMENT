	    <p>Since the early Nineteenth century, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cricket.html" title="Cricket">cricket</a> has gradually developed from an amateur recreational sport in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> into a fully professional international sport from which leading players can earn a large income.</p>

<p>For many generations there was a formal divide in English cricket between amateurs and professionals, or "Gentlemen and Players" as they were known at the time. Although amateurs and professionals often played together in the same team, they would use separate dressing rooms and on some grounds went on to the pitch through different gates. The amateurs referred to the professionals by their surname only, but the professionals called the amateurs "sir". However, this was not specific to cricket, but was the normal nomenclature used between middle and working class associates at that time. The "Gentlemen and Players" divide was a reflection of the divide between officers and other ranks in the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Army_7e21.html" title="British Army">army</a> and it seemed perfectly natural to most English people of all classes in the <a href="../../../1/9/t/19th_Century_16f1.html" title="19th Century">19th Century</a>.</p>
<p>An amateur would often be appointed as the captain of a team despite being one of the worst players, or even not good enough to belong in the team at all on the basis of his cricketing skills. This even applied to international <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_cricket.html" title="Test cricket">Test cricket</a>. After the 1870s and 1880s, when some touring teams to Australia were all-professional, England did not have a professional captain again until <a href="../../../l/e/n/Len_Hutton_0c27.html" title="Len Hutton">Len Hutton</a> was appointed in <a href="../../../1/9/5/1952.html" title="1952">1952</a>. In the 1930s, <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Hammond_456d.html" title="Walter Hammond">Walter Hammond</a> switched from professional to amateur so that he could captain his country.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../2/0/t/20th_century.html" title="20th century">20th century</a> the position gradually changed in cricket as English society became more egalitarian. There was also a mounting problem of <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shamateurism.html" title="Shamateurism">shamateurism</a> as the number of men who could afford to play cricket full time for several months each year without being paid to do so decreased. Some "amateur" players were given a largely nominal job as "club secretary" and there were sometimes allegations that a few were paid surreptitiously. The old distinction became increasingly out of step with social conditions after the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> and amateur status was abolished in English cricket at the end of the 1962 season.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_and_professional_cricketers.html" title="Edit section: Earning a living from cricket">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Earning a living from cricket</span></h2>
<p>The earliest professional cricketers were the members of early nineteenth century touring teams. When <a href="../../../c/o/u/County_cricket.html" title="County cricket">county cricket</a> began to formalise in the late 19th century, the counties also employed professionals. The better supported and therefore richer counties such as <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surrey_County_Cricket_Club_c790.html" title="Surrey County Cricket Club">Surrey</a> often had teams made up largely of professional players with an amateur captain, while poorer counties such as <a href="../../../s/o/m/Somerset_County_Cricket_Club_d243.html" title="Somerset County Cricket Club">Somerset</a> relied much more heavily on amateurs to allow them to field a team without going into the red. However, early professionals were paid a low weekly wage and during the off season, which could last for nearly eight months, most were left to fend for themselves and had to take whatever work they could get. A few played professional <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">football</a> in the winter. In order to provide cricketers with some financial security after their playing careers, the <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benefit_season.html" title="Benefit season">benefit system</a> was developed, but this was generally a poor substitute for good wages and a pension.</p>
<p>By the post <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_World_War_e58d.html" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> period, most cricketers were on a fixed salary, but only for the summer months and until the 1970s, the earnings of professional cricketers were low. In England many cricketers needed to find other jobs over the winter to make ends meet, and in other countries with less demanding domestic cricket schedules most cricketers fitted their cricket in with study or a regular job. Things began to change in 1977 when cricket was shaken up the Australian <a href="../../../n/e/w/News_media.html" title="News media">media</a> tycoon <a href="../../../k/e/r/Kerry_Packer_9dd2.html" title="Kerry Packer">Kerry Packer</a>. By offering cricketers higher wages than had ever been known in the sport before, Packer induced many of the world's most famous cricketers to abandon the official cricket competitions and play solely in a new competition called <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Series_Cricket_6ff0.html" title="World Series Cricket">World Series Cricket</a> which was broadcast by a television network which he owned. This was one of the biggest crises in the history of the sport, but it was patched up after a couple of years, when Packer's channel was granted the rights to official matches. The earnings of top cricketers from "official" cricket then began to escalate.</p>
<p>In the early <a href="../../../2/1/s/21st_century.html" title="21st century">21st century</a> cricket is still not as lucrative as some other sports, but international cricketers typically earn several times the average salary in their country. Regular members of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_cricket_team.html" title="English cricket team">English cricket team</a> earn several hundred thousand <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Pound_4f32.html" title="British Pound">pounds</a> a year. However, the highest paid cricketers in the world are the star members of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indian_cricket_team.html" title="Indian cricket team">Indian cricket team</a>, who make most of their income from <a href="../../../s/p/o/Sponsorship.html" title="Sponsorship">endorsement contracts</a>. Cricket is the main sport in India, and the players are front rank celebrities, especially <a href="../../../s/a/c/Sachin_Tendulkar_ea66.html" title="Sachin Tendulkar">Sachin Tendulkar</a>, who is the world's highest paid cricketer, with an income estimated by the <a href="../../../t/i/m/Times_of_India_92b2.html" title="Times of India">Times of India</a> in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a> to be in excess of five million <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_dollars_5178.html" title="US dollars">US dollars</a> a year, nearly all of it from endorsements.</p>
<p>It is also possible to earn an adequate annual income from domestic cricket in some countries, especially in England where the eighteen first class counties each employ about twenty players, most of whom earn at least the national average salary for the six month season, and some considerably more. Nonetheless many cricketers use the offseason to prepare for a post-cricket career.</p>
