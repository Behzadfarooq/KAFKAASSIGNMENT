<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amandala.html" title="Edit section: The name">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The name</span></h2>
<p>Amandala was adapted from the Swahili word "amandla", which means "power." Editors felt that Belizeans might mispronounce the word, so they added an extra "a" after the "d". Amandala editors often like to say the word means "power to the people", although the correct term for that is "Amandla, Ngawethu." Various versions of the above occur throughout the newspaper, most often in the Editorial and in Publisher Evan X Hyde's column.</p>

<p>Amandala began as a stenciled spreadsheet given out by members and supporters of UBAD in the streets of Belize City. After the third issue was published, it was decided to begin selling the paper for five cents a copy. The newspaper was published on Thursdays and dated and sold on Fridays. The first publisher and editor of the newspaper was Ismail Shabazz, a <a href="../../../m/u/s/Muslim.html" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> and member of UBAD; Hyde, the eventual publisher of the newspaper, acted as editor at the time.</p>
<p>Much of the newspaper's first issues were dedicated to promoting the affairs of its parent organization, advertising meetings, celebrations and protests, and containing articles on topics considered important to Belizeans as well as criticism of the ruling <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_United_Party_efaf.html" title="People's United Party">People's United Party</a> and its leader, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Cadle_Price_1cab.html" title="George Cadle Price">George Price</a>.</p>

<p>In October 1969, UBAD merged forces with a similar movement, the People's Action Committee (PAC) chaired by Assad Shoman and <a href="../../../s/a/i/Said_Musa_7e82.html" title="Said Musa">Said Musa</a>. Their newspaper, FIRE, joined Amandala to create "Amandala with FIRE", and this was the newspaper's byline for the rest of 1969 and into January 1970, when RAM dissolved. Thereafter, Amandala reverted to its original name.</p>

<p>A none too pleased PUP administration charged UBAD president Hyde and publisher Shabazz with sedition for the text of the article, which they claimed "meant that the administration of justice was a farce and that ... (those) who participated in it were participants in a childish game of amusements." (Shoman, 13 Chapters)</p>
<p>The case went to trial in June 1970, with former colleagues Shoman and Musa representing Hyde and Shabazz. For the next month, the fate of Amandala and UBAD hung in the balance as Attorney General V.H. Courtenay tried to prove that the Amandala had in fact committed sedition by lampooning the event and the defendants tried to exonerate themselves and improve the credibility of the fledgling newspaper. Shoman, perhaps showing some partiality, calls it the "most exciting trial in Belizean history," right down to the verdict, delivered on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_7.html" title="July 7">July 7</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1970.html" title="1970">1970</a> and clearing both Hyde and Shabazz. Amandala had survived its first broadside, but there were many, many more to come.</p>

<p>A relieved Amandala staff began making moves to develop the newspaper's technology. First, in 1971, Amandala purchased a Chandler and Price letter press to replace the <a href="../../../g/e/s/Gestetner.html" title="Gestetner">Gestetner</a> stencils used on the paper to that point. This technology lasted, with many trials and errors, to 1977, when it was shelved in favor of modern <a href="../../../o/f/f/Offset.html" title="Offset">offset</a> technology being favoured by competitors such as <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Reporter_%28Belize%29_62f2.html" title="The Reporter (Belize)">The Reporter</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Belize_Times_bb42.html" title="The Belize Times">The Belize Times</a>.</i> Despite ravages from <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Greta_89e6.html" title="Hurricane Greta">Hurricane Greta</a>, Amandala became the nation's leading newspaper by 1981 by using offset printing.</p>
<p>As euphoric as Hyde and Shabazz must have felt at their acquittal, they had no way of knowing that soon the Association would crumble around them as faithful members went their own way: some to the U.S., some to England, some to the newly formed UDP and some to who knows where. It remained for UBAD to be permanently dissolved, and the occasion came after Evan X Hyde's loss at the polls in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belize_legislative_election%2C_1974.html" title="Belize legislative election, 1974">elections</a> of <a href="../../../o/c/t/October_30.html" title="October 30">October 30</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>. In the <i>Amandala</i> of <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_8.html" title="November 8">November 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/7/1974.html" title="1974">1974</a>, Hyde formally closed down UBAD, quoting <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Sinatra_d0f7.html" title="Frank Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> and explaining why the time had come for the Association to be shut down. But <i>Amandala,</i> he said, would move in the direction of being a "community newspaper" rather than a political one.</p>
<p>For the remainder of the 1970s, <i>Amandala</i> tried to avoid controversy. Indeed, publisher Hyde ran unsuccessfully for the PUP in City Council elections of 1977, and the paper generally toed the line with government policy, although reserving its usual candor for certain situations. Joining the paper in this period was the "Ros'lin" serial about Belizean adolescents, a special "Jumble" word puzzle, columns by the publisher's father Charles B. Hyde and "The Old Man", a forerunner of today's "Smokey Joe" column.</p>

<p>As <i>Amandala</i> entered the 1980s, it had improved its technology, expanded its scope of writing and was reaching more people. The often impassioned editorials of the UBAD days gave way to more refined writing and greater discussion.</p>
<p>In 1981, Belize exploded into internal turmoil with the Heads of Agreement uprisings in March, and <i>Amandala</i> offered full coverage of events as they unfolded, making its name well-known throughout the nation. Toward the end of 1981, it published an article linking Prime Minister Price and Minister Louis Sylvester to a report from Mexico about drugs in Belize. For the second time in its publishing life, <i>Amandala</i> went to court on the wrong end of a lawsuit for <a href="../../../l/i/b/Libel.html" title="Libel">libel</a>, and was hit with separate judgements for BZ $10,000 and BZ $7,500 in 1982 and 1983. These debts crippled the newspaper but <i>Amandala</i> fought on. Relief arrived briefly with the ascension of the UDP to power in 1984, but the UDP and <i>Amandala</i> soon found themselves at loggerheads and <i>Amandala</i> kept to itself thereafter.</p>
<p>Popular columns during this period included "Far and Near" (before it moved to rival <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Belize_Times_bb42.html" title="The Belize Times">The Belize Times</a></i>), "Bill Williamson" (before it moved to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Reporter_%28Belize%29_62f2.html" title="The Reporter (Belize)">The Reporter</a></i> as "Roving Eye") and "Smokey Joe" (the first appearance).</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amandala.html" title="Edit section: The 1990s: maintaining dominance">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The 1990s: maintaining dominance</span></h3>
<p>The 1990s for <i>Amandala</i> really began on <a href="../../../n/o/v/November_17.html" title="November 17">November 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, with the establishment of Belize's first commercial radio station, <a href="../../../k/r/e/KREM_FM_dd31.html" title="KREM FM">KREM FM</a>, on the compound at Partridge Street. <i>Amandala</i> dedicated much of the next three years to weaning the young radio station and protecting it from its rivals, the now defunct <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radio_Belize_3434.html" title="Radio Belize">Radio Belize</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/v/LOVE_FM_d6f2.html" title="LOVE FM">LOVE FM</a>. UBAD celebrated what would have been its twenty-second anniversary in 1991, and <i>Amandala</i> publisher and former UBAD president Hyde wrote a reminisce of the UBAD glory days in the "From the Publisher" column of <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_8.html" title="February 8">February 8</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1991.html" title="1991">1991</a>. In addition, Amandala became the chief sponsor for local semi-professional team "The Raiders", which would win five national titles in the 1990s out of a total of seven. Through KREM and the Raiders, Amandala's name remained well-known. However, it did not escape criticisms of partisanship from rivals including the defunct <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_%28Belize%29_d2a3.html" title="The Guardian (Belize)">People's Pulse</a>, which derided all things Amandala for much of the 1990s until its closure in 1998, its sponsor the UDP being in power for much of that period. Amandala eventually admitted to a partnership with the then Opposition PUP established in 1994 and dissolved ten years later. There was also a claim of sensationalism, bias and overhyping of events ascribed to the newspaper. Things got so bad there was an attempt by foreign nationals to buy out the newspaper that was only turned down at the last minute, and KREM Radio even briefly shut down. Despite <i>Amandala'</i>s troubles, Belizeans faithfully bought the paper, which by this time dated its weekend issue for Sunday instead of Friday.</p>
<p>Popular columns included Cordel Hyde's sports columns in the mid and late nineties (prior to his joining the House of Representatives); brother <a href="../../../e/v/a/Evan__Mose__Hyde_3063.html" title="Evan &quot;Mose&quot; Hyde">Evan "Mose" Hyde</a>'s entertainment column "Chat Bout", educator and activist Silvana Woods "Weh A Gat Fi Seh" (What I Have to Say), Belize's first column written entirely in <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belizean_Kriol_language_54b3.html" title="Belizean Kriol language">Belize Creole</a> (prior to its moving to <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Reporter_%28Belize%29_62f2.html" title="The Reporter (Belize)">The Reporter</a>),</i> and Los Angeles-based Pam Reyes' "Caribbean Pulse", in addition to Glenn Tillett's "Between the Lines" and Russell Vellos' "Viewpoint".</p>

<p>There has been discussion about a possible Spanish-language version of the paper; however, this has yet to be detailed. Amandala moved closer to endorsing a Spanish-language version of its newspaper in a recent editorial which explained what a Spanish-language Amandala would have to overcome in order to achieve success.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the issue for October 22, 2006, Colin Hyde appeared to be closing his column "Sixes and Sevens", saying he would move on to other projects, including new novels, but that he would continue contributing to the Amandala. Hyde has since written numerous letters and occasional short columns dedicated to sport and politics.</p>
<p>New additions to Amandala include "The Tip of the Iceberg" by veteran Arthur Belisle, discussing veterans' affairs in Belize and halted after complaints from fellow veterans; frequent correspondence from Denzil Jenkins of Dangriga and Clinton Uh Luna of Corozal; and frequent excerpts from books detailing black and indigenous history, which had taken a break to the issues pressing Belize.</p>
