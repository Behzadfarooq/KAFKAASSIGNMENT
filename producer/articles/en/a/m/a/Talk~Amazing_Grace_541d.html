However, these are the six stanzas that appeared, with minor spelling variations, in both the first edition in 1779 and the 1808 edition, the one nearest the date of Newton's death. It appeared under the heading Faith's Review and Expectation, along with a reference to <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1chr+17:16-17" class="external text" title="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1chr+17:16-17" rel="nofollow">First Chronicles, chapter 17, verses 16 and 17</a>.</p>

<p>According to this article,</p>
<dl>
<dd>John Newton (1725–1807) was the captain of a slave ship. On 10 May 1748 returning home during a storm he experienced a "great deliverance". In his journal he wrote that the ship was in grave danger of sinking. He exclaimed "Lord have mercy upon us". He continued to traffic in slaves thereafter, nonetheless.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This seems on the face of it to clash with the assertion at <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Newton_99ab.html" title="John Newton">John Newton</a> that he did give up slave trading:</p>
<dl>
<dd>John Newton (24 July 1725–21 December 1807) was an English clergyman and writer who wrote the hymn "Amazing Grace" after converting to Christianity and abandoning his participation in the slave trade.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Can anyone clarify?</p>
<dl>
<dd>According to "Bury the chains: The Brittish struggle to abolish slavery" by Adam Hochschild Newton did not give up slave trading after his conversion but continued with it for many years. When he finally did give it up he did not do so out of any moral conviction that slavery was wrong. (Basically he had had a minor illness which he interpreted as a sign from God that he should not go back to sea.) He still did not have any moral problems with the slave trade when he wrote the hymn.</dd>

<p>Is there a source that we derived these lyrics from? I have been reviewing a couple of Hymnals and see that some words are shortened differently, and some not at all. Also one of the verses that are listed as being a part of the original work, are not found in the Hymnals that I reviewed. The verse that my hymnals lack is the 6th "official" verse.</p>
<p>My hymnals have the hymn in question, "Jerusalem My Happy Home", listed within them, but they lack the verse that this article says came from that song. The verse is "When we've been there ten thousand years." This verse was supposedly added from Uncle Tom's Cabin.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I have one Hymnal checked and it includes the UTC's verse, but not the verse in question, verse 6 from the "official" lyrics.</p>
<p><br />
I would like to see evidence that this is what John Newton actually wrote, and not some ones speculation. Also I have found another unofficial verse to be added to the lyrics, as soon as I write down the actual words that are sung.</p>

<p>Consensus is that the final verse was not part of the original song, however it's being attributed to "jerusalem my happy home" appears equally erronious. Cf. <a href="http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/j/m/jmyhappy.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/j/m/jmyhappy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/j/m/jmyhappy.htm</a> No such verse is in this copy. Notably the verse is in the same metre, so it could have been sung to it, but is there any evidence that in fact it does originate from this text? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThanatosimii_7061.html" title="User:Thanatosimii">Thanatosimii</a> 19:52, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>What is the point of saying that many popular artists have recorded it in the history section, especially where that sentence is? I see the point behind the Indian recordings, but not the stating of the popular recordings before that. I was also thinking it would be good to add in the sheet music. And I might be wrong, but isn't it one of the songs played on pipes at the funerals of NYPD and Boston cops? If so, that should be put into that section. Like: "The song sounds particulay moving when played on the pipes and is commonly heard at funerals and memorial services, especially at the funerals of New York City police officers." I think that it should also be stated in the Recordings section that it appeared in the movie Braveheart, although the song didn't exist at that time, or it may be did exist, but as the tune by itself, which would show its Scottish roots.<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillsketch_b4fd.html" title="User:Willsketch">Will</a> 18:54, 28 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think this article suffers from a bit too much trivia. The cultural impact is important, but the specific examples are not. The fact that it is popular on the bagpipes is important, that the bagpipes played it in Star Trek is not. It's use in funerals and such should be reported, but not specific instances. Wikipedia isn't an indescriminate collection of information. Generalize, generalize, generalize! With this in mind, I'm about to trim things down a bit. Yeah, it'll remove information but that'll just leave us room to re-add it back in in a better format. Trivia, I've noticed, tends to attact more trivia. 69.243.84.31 20:06, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Popular Culture seems the most likely place, but i'm not really sure. -- <a href="../../../s/d/f/User%7ESdfisher_d82c.html" title="User:Sdfisher">Steven Fisher</a> 18:37, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The lyrics don't belong on this page, if someone transwiki's them to wikisource (An example: <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Greensleeves" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Greensleeves" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>), we can link to there, but for now we'll remove it. The list of artists recording the song is silly. We'll mention that its commonly recorded even today, and leave some note about how the melody lends itself to this and that. Allmusic.com kinda has a list of artists recording the song, so if someone wants to link to that, that is fine, too. I also removed the external links to the movie site, as they already exist from the movie's page, which is linked at the top of the article. <a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_e3bb.html" title="User:Smmurphy">Smmurphy</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/m/User_talk%7ESmmurphy_5e09.html" title="User talk:Smmurphy">Talk</a>)</sup> 00:05, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I guess I didn't fully address what to do with mentions of popular recorded versions of the song. Many articles about popular songs exist, and popular versions of this song could have mention in the article, but probably only if the version is for some reason notable (released as a major single, or something like that). The mention of any particular version, then, must include why that version is notable. <a href="../../../s/m/m/User%7ESmmurphy_e3bb.html" title="User:Smmurphy">Smmurphy</a><sup>(<a href="../../../s/m/m/User_talk%7ESmmurphy_5e09.html" title="User talk:Smmurphy">Talk</a>)</sup> 00:19, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is probably best to wait until the editors have a chance to discuss this before you make such major changes to an article. I'm reverting the changes until we can talk about this some more.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I have mixed feelings about the lyrics. For the most part, Wikipedia doesn't include song lyrics in the articles about those songs, but that's usually due to copyright restrictions, and there are no such limitations with a song written in the 18th century. Also, including them seems in-line with at least some other hymn pages (examples: <a href="../../../l/i/f/Lift_Up_Your_Hearts%21_bfb1.html" title="Lift Up Your Hearts!">Lift Up Your Hearts!</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corpus_Christi_Carol_8806.html" title="Corpus Christi Carol">Corpus Christi Carol</a>, <a href="../../../o/_/s/O_Sacred_Head%2C_Now_Wounded_a6c4.html" title="O Sacred Head, Now Wounded">O Sacred Head, Now Wounded</a>) Also, <a href="../../../l/y/r/Wikipedia%7ELyrics_and_poetry_a5f5.html" title="Wikipedia:Lyrics and poetry">Wikipedia:Lyrics_and_poetry</a> states "You should include lyrics and poetry whose copyright has expired." And <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_include_copies_of_primary_sources_e36f.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't include copies of primary sources">Wikipedia:Don't include copies of primary sources</a> uses <a href="../../../o/z/y/Ozymandias.html" title="Ozymandias">Ozymandias</a> as an example of acceptably including lyrics or poems from shorter, non-copyrighted works. So I vote to keep the lyrics, although they require a citation of some sort.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As far as the list of artists who have recorded the song, I disagree that it's silly. It's actually kind of useful. Wikipedia has plenty of articles of the discographies <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Discographies" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Discographies" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> of various recording artists. This is entirely analagous. So it doesn't qualify as "silly". But it's almost completely uncited, and it will get very long very fast, quickly dwarfing the size of the main article. I propose breaking it off into a separate article if someone feels upto the task (maybe I'll even get around to it myself), but it requires a citation for every recording artist on the list. I agree that a link to the allmusic page might be a fair compromise in the meantime. It would also be appropriate to mention highly significant recordings of the song. For example, "It was first recorded by blah blah blah." Or, "the song faded from popularity until the 1980s, when it was brought back into the spotlight when it was recorded by blah blah blah".</dd>

<dd>The popular culture section has to go. As much as I enjoy them, they seldom work well in Wikipedia articles. See <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIV_4692.html" title="WP:TRIV">WP:TRIV</a> for more info.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The movie should be mentioned in the main article. I mean, it's pretty much a movie ABOUT the song, right?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Lastly, the article needs LOTS more citations. As it stands, it has only one.</dd>

<dd>I like the lyrics in a box a lot more. In this form, it does feel like it belongs. The two lists (trivia and recordings) are still sore thumbs in the article. A separate article List of artists who recorded Amazing Grace might be difficult to get through afd these days, but creating such an article would be no problem if you are interested. I removed them both, the first because the trivia tag has been there for three months <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amazing_Grace&amp;oldid=102950018" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amazing_Grace&amp;oldid=102950018" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and nothing has been integrated into the article from it. The popular recordings I removed, mostly thinking of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>/<a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> (the list seems over directory-ish, and if we tagged the entries with a cite tag, most would not get a citation within a "reasonable" amount of time, and thus their removal under snow is appropriate). I figured that doing so would prompt the interested to add back their favorite version with a citation. I would agree that versions which include the name of the album or the concert are in a way cited, however. I have less a problem with keeping those. Mention of the movie is fine, linking to the movies site seems like spam. Looking at those sites, there is content on them. Most of it is related to <i>Amazing Grace Sunday</i> <a href="http://www.amazinggracesunday.com/uk/resources/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazinggracesunday.com/uk/resources/index.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, but even that is a bit flimsy for an article on the song itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I'm sorry if I overstepped. With the WP citation revolution seemingly in full swing, and with the movie gaining in popularity, I felt that by starting a cleanup of this page, we could focus future editors on adding content. Hopefully we can agree to cut some of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7EListcruft_3123.html" title="WP:Listcruft">WP:Listcruft</a> and move this article along from there.

<p>Agreeing with 69.243.84.31's trivia entry above in this talk page, and the discussion above, I've removed the "trivia" section and very briefly summarized its points. The section was a long and unsourced list of television episodes and movies in which the song appeared. My new edit notes the song's importance in television and movies, and certainly the importance in memorial services. The disambiguation at top the page lists other movies the name Amazing Grace is used in. The 2007 movie is mentioned at top of the article, but I left it in the Pop culture section to further help those searching for information on the movie. If anyone disagrees, feel free to revert, but the list was extremely long and is difficult to blend with the rest of the article. Also removed the trivia tag --<a href="../../../c/s/o/User%7ECsodennc_847e.html" title="User:Csodennc">Csodennc</a> 00:30, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
