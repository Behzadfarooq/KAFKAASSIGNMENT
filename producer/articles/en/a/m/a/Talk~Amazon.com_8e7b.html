<p>I hadn't been on amazon for a while and when I went there today I noticed that they no longer have their own Amazon audio player for sampling albums. Anyone know why this happened? That audio player was good, it loaded much faster than Real or WMP. Was the amazon audio player removed because of a legal issue or something? e- Furthermore, I just realized I can't get either the WMP or Real audio samples to work in their respective players, grrrrrrrr.

<p>Amazon was one of the pioneers in using collaborative filtering to create links on its site. The article probably should mention these. The features I'm thinking of show up on product pages as "customers who purchased" and "customers who shopped for". The former was invented for Amazon by Greg Linden of Findory, and the latter was invented by me. Both are on USPTO, and I think Greg and co-worker Brent Smith wrote up the former for the <a href="../../../i/e/e/IEEE_472a.html" title="IEEE">IEEE</a>. --<a href="../../../z/i/p/User%7EZippy_339a.html" title="User:Zippy">Zippy</a> 08:12, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Probably, but if there are other stated opinions out there (or even a rebuttal by the company), it should be added as well. I have moved the link to the bottom, as in an encyclopedic article about Amazon.com, it's simply not the most important link. Eike 04:28, Feb 21, 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The boycott has ended, in fact it ended almost two years ago. The link should be preserved, in my opinion. I'd update the description, but it says the page will be locked in a few minutes (presumably to prevent the link to amazon.com from being replaced with "affilate" links). --<a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexasDex_c4f8.html" title="User:TexasDex">TexasDex</a> 19:46, May 1, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>This edit is odd to me. First off, I don't think I've ever seen a company be identified with its neighborhood before. (Except for Wall Street, but that isn't a neighborhood, and most of the companies "on Wall Street" are actually somewhere else in Manhattan, or even in Jersey City.) Secondly, why Beacon Hill? That Amazon.com is based in Seattle I don't dispute, but more <i>workers</i> work in the International District than in Beacon Hill. What controls? Jeff Bezos's office? I'd like to see it go back to just Seattle. --<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreyHarris_636a.html" title="User:TreyHarris">TreyHarris</a> 03:07, 18 Jun 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The location of the corporate headquarters appears in some other articles, e.g., <a href="../../../s/a/f/Safeco_Corporation_7e74.html" title="Safeco Corporation">Safeco Corporation</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/d/Todd_Pacific_Shipyards_58e8.html" title="Todd Pacific Shipyards">Todd Pacific Shipyards</a>. It could certainly be moved out of the introductory sentence, though (which I'll do). As for why Beacon Hill, doesn't CEO's office location control?

<dd>There is a site that does exactly this comparison (price at every one of the 6 amazon international stores), it even add shipping costs and calculates the currency depending on the user country, and that's a useful site for international amazon users, really. It's called Pricenoia.com. I updated it on the wiki page but was removed with a link spam comment, so up to you. Alarmen 13:12, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I typed in "Amazon bookstore" in the search box, looking for that famous original feminist bookstore, and was redirected to the Amazon.com page. I understand that in spite of the use of the same tradmark in the same industry, that they are totally different entities.

<p>Turking is still relatively low-profile, but I think enough interest has been generated in it, and I know I have seen enough independent media coverage of it, to cover it here with references. However, considering that <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazon_Mechanical_Turk_ada3.html" title="Amazon Mechanical Turk">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a> is a relatively sizable and thorough article, I believe a link to the full article would be sufficient for inclusion in the <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amazon.com.html" title="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> article.

<p>I would like to know what Amazon.com's cumulative customer account quantity. I have found it as about 1.5 million in 1999, and 20 million in 2001 and 35 million in 2003, but that's the last number I have found on the web. Even on documents dated as 2006 they still list 35 million cumulative customer accounts. Has their ccustomer base stopped growing? Also, I'm curious about their active customer base. It would be very interesting to have some idea of how many people have remained active buyers on Amazon and how many accounts haven't been used in, say the last two years.</p>

<p>I know that recently a fulfillment centre for amazon.co.uk was added in Ireland, but I'm not so sure its Cork. I realise the new call centre is in Cork, but I believe the new fulfillment centre is in Dublin. The reason I think so, is that I have ordered a few things off amazon.co.uk recently, which had the "Postage Paid" thing with a Dublin mark (an indication it was delivered to a post office in Dublin by amazon). Also, on ones which bear the Dublin postage paid mark, it also has the return address if undelivered, as:</p>

If undelivered please return to:
Amazon

<p>I've seen ironically biased rhetoric across a few forums alleging Amazon.com bias and censorship. Aside from the use of language, are any of the claims true or is it just spam? I'm not dismissing this without review because increasingly I've seen large companies have institute leftist or rightist POV policies, be they subtle or not so subtle. Just checking if anyone knows if its got a shred of truth, if so it can be mentioned under controversy, if not then its obviously just a scummy libel. Here's a copy-paste with most of the heated POV cut out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On July 4, Amazon spammed its customers with advertisement of Norman Finkelstein's virulently anti-Semitic book, Image and Reality of the Israeli-Palestine Conflict. On May 30, Amazon similarly advertised Beyond Chutzpah: on the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History. I have never received any other ad from Amazon. On April 4, in an unprecedented move, Amazon deleted all reviews of Obadiah Shoher's Samson Blinded: A Machiavellian Perspective on the Middle East Conflict. A few days later, Amazon forced its subsidiary Booksurge to terminate publishing contract with Shoher whose book is now available for download from a place that won't be linked. Google earlier banned advertising of the Samson Blinded for "unacceptable content."</p>
