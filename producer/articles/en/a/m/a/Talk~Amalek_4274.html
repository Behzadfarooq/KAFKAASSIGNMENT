	    <p><i>Amalekites were a tribe, predating Amalek the son of Eliphaz, who existed in the Roman province Arabia Petraea[1] as early as the time of Abraham (Gen. 14:7)</i> This is why it's so hard to square real history with Bible history. There is no way to edit this. Where would you begin? In what way does a tribe <i>predate</i> its eponym? What does 'date' mean in such a context, anyway? What does the 'time' of Abraham mean? How about 'in the time of <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theseus.html" title="Theseus">Theseus</a>...' How about Abraham in the Roman province of Arabia Petraea? Could one suggest perhaps that the m-l-k of Amelek is the root for 'king' not 'valley'? that Amelek is Amelech, a 'king' ...but I don't even read Hebrew... The confidence of this Sunday School stuff is just daunting <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 09:41, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Bible history and real history are one. The bible is a book of tremendous historical signifigance, and is known for its striking accuracy. The time line is pretty clear, to me. Maybe the tribe of amalek was known by some other name, and later was given the name of amalek. Your conjectures would require alot of evidence before being included. Also, I'm very certain that your wrong about the definition of Amalek, its extremely well documented as "valley dweller" <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 10:07, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If someone would document these perfect certainties about the significance of Amalech's name in the entry, that would be a start, for those of us who lack certainty. The Bible is actually a library, not a 'book,' and indeed of tremendous historical significance. To return to the entry: <i>In Babylonian inscriptions they are called Sute, in Egyptian Sittiu, and the Amarna tablets refer to them as Khabbati, or "plunderers.</i> (cribbed here at this entry, word for word from <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary" class="external free" title="http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary" rel="nofollow">http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary</a> ) Now, what connects the Sute, Sittiu, and Khabbati in inscriptions with these people? That would be helpful too. "However, modern scholarship does not accept as proven the identification of the Amalekites with any group known from extra-Biblical sources and the majority opinion is that they are mythological." I just found this sensible statement at <a href="http://www.tutorgig.com/encyclopedia" class="external free" title="http://www.tutorgig.com/encyclopedia" rel="nofollow">http://www.tutorgig.com/encyclopedia</a> What do you suppose it is based on? Nothing that would convert the ignorant, we can agree. It does seem curious that the "Khabbati" reference on Amarna tablets <i>only</i> appears at websites run by religionists, any not on websites run by specialists in the Amarna period of Egyptology. Why is that, one wonders? A link would help here too. <a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 10:49, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I didn't like that sentance either actually. Now its gone, along w any references to any non-Amalek names for the Amalekites (unless you count "atheism" that is&#160;;) <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 11:10, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I removed this sentence: "This last is particularly popular within modern <a href="../../../r/i/g/Right-wing.html" title="Right-wing">right-wing</a> <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism.html" title="Zionism">Zionist</a> groups." It is factually incorrect, and even if there are some extremists who make the identification, it is certainly not popular. In fact, I have seen America called Amaleka more than I have seen Arabs identified as such. As for the Romans, they are identified with Edom (Esau) in Talmudic and post-Talmudic literature, though not specifically with Amalek.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 11:22, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Danny, I got the Amalek-Rome identification from the Jewish Encyclopedia <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1351&amp;letter=A" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1351&amp;letter=A" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 11:47, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Yeah, I've got references out the wazoo these as well. Cripes, I came opon the concept of Amalek in reference to the palistinians. Anyways, I agree with rewording what you took out, but it needs to go back, in one form or another. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 12:24, 18 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>First of all, the etymologies suggested above are incorrect. It cannot come from either <i>king</i> or <i>valley dweller</i>: neither term shares the same root. In fact, Amalek is problematic in that it does not have a distinguishable three letter root, indicating that it is probably some loan word. I am not very happy with the Jewish Encyclopedia article either, in terms of the identification with Rome. I am pretty convinced that the one case it cited is metaphorical--I can cite several others that identify Rome with Edom (Esau). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 03:13, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I don't agree with your recent edits (other than the spelling correction of course!). I have always heard it translated as "dweller in the valley". And IMO you did a diservice to the portion about Arabs and nazis and so forth, reducing clarity and installing POV. Lets try to back things up with citations, and leave our own personal positions out of the article. BTW, if anybody would like to know what I <b>really</b> think, feel free to IM me, and you'll get a jackhammer of POV&#160;;) <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 03:30, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Obviously, I disagree. Hebrew and other related Semitic languages are based on roots. There are rules for how these roots can be manipulated into new words. Amalek is spelled עמלק while the word valley is עמק. While they are similar, the relationship you are suggesting would have to account for the insertion of the ל into the word. That just cannot be done, indicating that the word Amalek is not from the word עמק. As for the disservice and supposed POV insertion, I have spent a lot of time living with and studying the Israeli far right. The statement made it seem as if the far right identifies the Arabs/Palestinians as Amalek (or the Nazis, for that matter). Yes, in the sense that they are using the term as a metaphor. If it were anything else whatsoever, there would be distinct halachic ramifications. For example, if the Nazis (i.e., the Germans) were Amalek, it would be incumbent on them to kill them all. No exceptions would be made (see I Samuel 15). It would certainly be forbidden to enter into any kind of negotiations with them, purchase goods from them, speak to any of them, or even spare their pets. While the command to exterminate them would be lifted because of practical reasons, until the coming of the Messiah (see Maimonides, Laws of Kings, chap. 10), all contact with anyone or even anything German would have to be avoided. There is no one in Israel who says that. Furthermore, on the far right of Israeli politics there is, as yet, no one who calls for the extermination of the Arabs because they are Amalek. Kahane never said it (and I spoke with him several times when he was alive), Yisrael Ariel never said it (in fact, I have heard him say specifically that it is not a mitzvah to kill Arabs), nor did Michael Ben Horin (I have heard him state explicitly that Arabs are Ishmael. Dov Lior said the same thing many times. Baruch Marzel is a student of Kahane and Ariel and would not contradict them (he was also there in the room when Ariel said there is no mitzvah to kill Arabs). This accounts for the most extreme leadership of the far right in Israel (I have never heard Yehudah Etzion on the topic, but I can assume, based on his writings, that it would not be different). If they did identify Arabs with Amalek, they would not have been able to make the statement that a) Arabs should not be killed; or b) that Arabs are Ishmael. Sorry. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 03:54, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm not sure as to the need for an apology. You might well be right about the actual meaning of Amalek, I'm no expert on hebrew. I do know that it is overwhelmingly interpreted as that however on the references I have viewed (I'll compile a few later on). As far as this israeli far right stuff, all I can say is what I know. I have a Jewish friend who is a far right extremist, who makes statements like "everytime an arab dies, a rose grows in his place" and so forth. Also, in conversations with the Rabbi's on askmoses.com I have been told that while the Jewish community at large disagrees with the use of Amalek to refer to any current racial group, and disagrees that the Palistinians are the remainder of the amalekites, some do indeed hold that view. The view that Hitler was amalek is much more commonly held, and even more so the view of it as symbolicalism for atheism. I actually find your comments and edits informative and a benificial part of the process, even if I do not agree with the changes being the final result.

<p>I don't think that mentioning the Israeli govt. or Israeli politics is useful at all in this article in regards to use of the term Amalek. I don't know of them doing it, and the reference I made was based primarilly on an american friend of mine who was quite extreme in his views and actions (he told me of fistfights with neonazi's he had confronted) as well as various websites I have read <a href="http://www.ortzion.org/Amalek.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ortzion.org/Amalek.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://yesha.homestead.com/politics28.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://yesha.homestead.com/politics28.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/mort/zuckerman032102.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/mort/zuckerman032102.asp" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>(just google "amalek" and read a few). <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackLynch_c3a9.html" title="User:JackLynch">Jack</a> 06:58, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am not going to get into an edit war over this, however, I would like to see some of the etymological sources of this interpretation of Amalek. Based on the comments above, it is clearly not Semitic (and I am somewhat of an expert on Hebrew). I did look up some Akkadian roots and came up with <i>emugu</i>, meaning <i>power</i> or army, and <i>malku</i> meaning <i>prince</i>. While these meanings would seem a lot closer, <i>emugu</i> also does not account for the medial <i>lamed</i> (<i>l</i>) and malku does not account for the initial <i>ayin</i> (a guttural consonant), so I am very suspect, but I am no expert on Akkadian. As for "valley dwellers," exactly which valley. i checked a popular source, <i>Reader's Digest Almanac of the Bible</i> (1991, ed. Geoffrey Wigoder), which says "An ancient nomadic tribe that roamed the northern Sinai desert and the Negeb." Not a great source, but there was considerable research put into that article (I know, because I was the one who wrote it). That is not an area known for its valleys--in fact, it is rather flat. As for those sites you bring, it is important to understand how rhetoric plays in halachic speech. I'll start with the Baal Shem Tov because that is easiest. While he could certainly have made the statement, it could not be used to override the halachic position of Maimonides as stated in Laws of Kings. It is not a denial of the commandment to eradicate the people of Amalek, but rather a recognition that in these days it is impossible, so here is something folksy and cute that people can do instead (a tad cynical, admittedly, but essentially that is what it is). Similarly, since there are no more sacrifices, he would also say that the table at which three or more Jews eat is like an altar, and the meal at which words of Torah are spoken is like a sacrifice. Very sweet, but it does not override the rules of sacrifice, which are inactive because the format with which to offer sacrifice does not exist. As for your friend, sure, he made some crazy statements. I've heard plenty. But the "rose" bit does not lead to identification with Amalek. I am convinced that when pressed on the issues from a halachic perspective (the determining factor in far-right Judaism), these people you quote would admit that these identifications are not Amalek. For example, if a Palestinian willingly leaves the land of Israel and recognizes Jewish sovereignty there, would it still be necessary to kill him and his entire family? Would you have to kill a three-year-old whose great-grandfather was a Nazi? If they were halachically Amalek then yes. I wonder whether they would say that. I know of no halachic source that would. In other words, their statements reflect the hyperbole of Jewish speech within certain communities and little more. One last, interesting source is Kook's small work, <i>Mussar Avicha</i>, in which he claims that the eradication of Amalek must be done out of love. If you hate Amalek, you cannot kill them, because killing them is a correction for their soul. Obviously, a very bizarre piece, and one that is little known at that, but Kook is regarded as authoritative by the far right. Try quoting it with your friend. Well, gotta run to work. I am meeting with the former Chief Rabbi of Israel today. I can try and ask him. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 12:50, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Fascinating. I was clearly right to compliment your involvement in this article. To be honest the primary reason why I edit at the wikipedia is to learn from the process. This is not going to be an easy edit tho, because the points you bring up are subtle, and providing the distiction in a NPOV manner is not going to be easy, especially if we are striving for "prose"&#160;:). Trust me that I am not interested in excessive emotionalism, but rather what is best for accuracy in the article. The way to avoid an edit war is to discuss things in talk, and to provide a different (even if only subtley) edit each time, rather than reverting. I have found this to be a vital peice of policy and diplomacy here at the wikipedia.

<p>Hi Jack. I would suggest that you find some source for the etymology or remove it until you have one. The one thing I came up with is that it may be a contraction of two words: <i>am</i>, meaning <i>people</i>, and the Assyrian <i>ilku</i>, meaning corvee. It would then imply that the Amalekites were a band of nomadic mercenaries, wholly in keeping with the text. The problem is that I have not been able to verify whether it is <i>ilku</i> or <i>ilqu</i> (k and q are two different sounds in Semitic languages, even though they are not currently distinguished in contemporary spoken Hebrew), which would imply a different root. Amalek is more properly 'Amaleq. I can ask an Assyriologist I work with tomorrow--my own Akkadian dictionary is rather limited and often inaccurate. It was fun to get back into it though. <i>Shuma awilum awilam ubbir</i> ... (the opening line of the Code of Hammurabi). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 23:35, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>In terms of the history and etymology, Danny is totally correct. In terms of the issue of whether or not some right-wing Israeli zealots identify Palestinians as Amalek, he is somewhat correct, but in another way he is incorrect. As regards the <i>specific individuals</i> that Danny mentions, yes, they do not claim that all Palestinians should literally be regarded as Amalek; they do not want to exterminate the Palestinians. As regards most Israeli right-wingers (both religious and secular), they too do not not claim that all Palestinians should literally be regarded as Amalek; they do not want to exterminate the Palestinians. Thus, we are in 9o% agreement. But there is a small minority of right-wingers who repeatedly do refer to Palestinians as Amalek; they are not claiming that this is a biological fact, and they may not even be claiming that this is a halakhically valid identification. However, they use the word, and they approve of violence. To be fair, they do not advocate extermination or genocide; looking at their worls most of them appear to be asking for the right to self-defense, even if it means pre-emptive attacks that will kill. But enough right-wingers who use the term exist to merit a breif discussion. (And of course, one must also note that this would be the few of the small minority at best, and that this is view is totally rejected by the Israeli majority, both religious and secular.)</p>

<p>Also, we need to realize that a mainstream strand within rabbinic Judaism holds that Amalek is not a people, in the narrow sense that Danny and others are using. Other Jewish points of view exist. For instance, Rabbi Moshe Amiel 1883-1946) ruled that one should not understand Amalek as being a particular ethnic group. Rather, he viewed Amalek as the symbol of armed might. In Rabbi Amiel's view, a permanent war prevails between the sword and the book, and "one can only be built on the ruins of the other". [Derashot el Ami, 3.132, 3 volume set, Tel-Aviv, 1964.] This is also the view of many non-Orthodox Jewish rabbis. So we cannot just claim that "Jews today do not identify the Palestinians as Amalek". Some Jews <i>do</i> make this identification. This <i>does not</i> mean that they are making a biological identification, nor does it mean that they are advocating genocide. (They certainly are not.) The term has ideological uses beyond the literal meanings of the word. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 00:12, Jan 20, 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, when it comes to the far right of the Israeli political spectrum, I basically do know everybody, some of them quite well, but that's a long story. I do not deny that the term is used metaphorically. I think that overall we agree, <b>but</b> I reject the notion that there is a halachic equation being made. Paradoxically, just because people are called Amalek doesn't mean that they are believed to be Amalek, with all the implications such a statement would contain. From what you said above, I think you agree with me on this point too. Essentially, the term Amalek has been neutered to some degree in popular discourse to mean "the epitome of evil." Compare, for example, with the statement by the Besht above. I do not know it, but assuming it is accurate, does that mean that the Baal Shem Tov held that all atheists and their descendants should be killed. Similarly, I admit that the far right uses it as hyperbole, but not as halachah (and I don't want to get into a discussion of the ramifications of violating one of the Sheva Mitzvot Bnei Noach, which is an entirely different story that does not relate to Amalek per se, nor do the mitzvot associated with Kibush Ha'Aretz). One of the sources you quote, for example, is Ariel, who I do happen to know very well (he was a neighbor of mine, and I served with his son in the army--I also studied under him and his brothers Yaakov and Yigal). In a semi-private conversation with him, I heard him say distinctly <i>Ein mitzvah laharog Aravim</i>, with a caveat that I will not repeat here. (Interestingly, that same night he was arrested). As for Amiel, he will have to answer the Rambam (see Hilchot Melachim, 10:1). Again, Amiel is using metaphor, as did the Besht, but there are strict halachic considerations that he is not addressing, such as <i>Lo tichayun</i>. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_4e16.html" title="User:Danny">Danny</a> 00:21, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>First of all about the meaning of the word: the references given for "valley dweller" are not adequate. They have just copied the theory from somewhere else, probably an earlier compendium which is no better. What is needed is citation of a named respected scholar. After asking a few people who know about stuff like this, I'm pretty sure that the scholarly consensus is "foreign word of unknown meaning". As for traditional imaginative "translations", there are several. As an example, in Midrash Tanhuma, portions Yitro and Ki Tetze, there is the claim that Amalek comes from <i>am leq</i> "the licking people," with the explanation that the Amalekites were called so because "they came to lick the Israelites' blood like dogs." Such doubtful speculations are taken seriously by very few, but the very fact they exist is proof that there was no generally accepted translation. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 14:01, 21 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Regarding modern groups called Amalek: Sometimes it is hard to tell whether a particular identification is intended to be taken literally or not. However, my contacts agree with Danny that a literal identification of a modern group with Amalek is halakically almost impossible. Special mention was made of the statement in the Talmud (Berakhot 26a) that the gentile peoples of the Torah were mixed together beyond recognition, and (critically from a practical point of view) the complete lack of an identification of Arabs with Amalek by any of the traditional authorities. On the other hand, there have been examples where a metaphorical identification with Amalek has been used to excuse violence (by supposing that the mitzvah of extermination refers to Amalek in a metaphorical sense). Examples involving Arabs include some supporters of <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baruch_Goldstein_ddb1.html" title="Baruch Goldstein">Baruch Goldstein</a> and a former rabbi of Bar-Ilan University named Israel Hess. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 14:32, 21 Jan 2004 (UTC)</p>
<p>Example of a metaphorical identification: "And Jewish self-respect and honor must be resurrected with an end to the humiliating obscenity of carefree political relations with the Amalek of our times, Germany."

<p>Firstly the Bible does not mention any Amalekites in the days of Abraham. When discussing the invasion of Chederlaomer in the days of Abraham it talks about the "land of the Amalekites". Bearing in mind that the description of this battle is written not earlier than Moses even from the point of view of Biblical literalists, there is no mystery here. Its like saying that Julius Caesar traveled as far as York in England even though it wasn't called York or England in the time of Caesar. Its called England and York now and it was called "land of the Amalekites" at the time the Bible was written.</p>
<p>A Jewish tradition recorded by Nachmanides claims that Amalekites did exist before Amalek the grandson of Esau. The tradition states that Amalek the grandson of Esau was named after an Amalek who had been the founder of the Amalekites. Arab traditions claim that the Amalekites originated in Arabia. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuratowski%27s_Ghost_768e.html" title="User:Kuratowski's Ghost">Kuratowski's Ghost</a> 00:43, 8 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is quite a bit of information from Arab history about the Amalekites that I am reading up on and will add to the article.

<p>According to Friedman's <i>The Bible with Sources Revealed</i>, Genesis 14 is an independent source document (not belonging to J,E,P, or D), and hence could simply represent a variant tradition of the Amalekites' origins.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob117_1059.html" title="User:Rob117">Rob117</a> 04:44, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>According to the rules of logic, the use of different names for an individual in a single document <b>does not</b> logically entail that the document was woven together from separate sources each of which only used one name. One need only look at a Star Trek episode in which the same individual is addressed as "Captain", "Kirk", "Jim" and "James". (Documentary Hypothesis proponents presumeably feel that such an episode must be a combination of separate C, K, Ji and Ja scripts that were woven together.) In fact no known instance of a document using several names for individuals having originated in such a manner is known. Nor has a J, E, P or D document ever been uncovered by archaeologists. So yeah, ok for completeness the Documentary Hypothesis view should be mentioned but please people, <i>think</i>.

<dd>Pjacobi is exactly right. If this were any less than genocide, they would have spared the innocent. This is the kind of thing that is occurring in various regions of Africa; idividual tribes and ethnic groups are attempting to eliminate another. It's called genocide by the whole world. There's nothing "sacred" about a war of extermination, Jewish doctrine aside. It's genocide no matter who commits it. The Jews of history do not have some special right to exterminate a people and then have it defined by a different noun than every other such act in history. Calling it anything other than genocide is POV.</dd>
<dd>"Biblical tradition" is to glorify the surviving group and to advance their own POV, so is non-encyclopedic. In an encyclopedic view, we have to review the evidence and refer to actions by their contemporary definitions and apply modern meanings. This is an encyclopedia, not a "bible review." The fact that the available evidence comes from the bible does not restrict our definition of events to the POV definitions contained within. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused">focused</a> 12:24, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>There are two issues here. One is whether the events satisfy some definition of "genocide", and the other is whether that word should be used here. On the first issue, I think it is completely obvious that the events described in the Bible would be judged as genocide by an international court sitting today. Statements like "The Lord will be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation" and references to the "seed of Amalek" were taken as commandments to eliminate the biological descendants of the Amalekites for all time. There is no "unless they start to behave themselves" qualification to be found. More euphemistic interpretations are a modern development. As to whether the term "Amalekites" referred to a racial group, it rather refered to a tribe in a time period when the whole of humanity was regarded as being divided into tribes. The second issue is whether it is necessary to use the word "genocide" here. I was content with "extermination", which is literal and does not seem to me at all euphemistic. Somehow the word "genocide" feels like it is intended to make a point that isn't openly stated and I'm not even sure what the point is. So I prefer "extermination". --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 02:04, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Whereas en.wikipedia generally is not shy using real life terms to fictional events (see <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endorian_Holocaust_b1a7.html" title="Endorian Holocaust">Endorian Holocaust</a> for a bad example); I agree to some point with Zero's reasoning.
<ul>
<li>The <i>to make a point that isn't openly stated</i> caveat, while true, should be used only with extreme precaution to decide an article's wording. If some term is the most exact, it should be used.</li>
<li>If happened in historical times and verifiable by the standards of the historical science, there would be no way around using <i>genocide</i> in the article.</li>
<li>But the historical evidence is meager, and so the article should just concentrate more on the point, why this story is told and what it may transport. The German article <a href="../../../../de/a/m/a/Amalekieter.html" class="extiw" title="de:Amalekieter">de:Amalekieter</a> tries to follow this path, but I'm not competent to judge, whether it succeeds.</li>

<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><u>First</u>; there is no doubt that the events satisfy every reasonable definition of genocide.</li>
<li><u>Second</u>; genocide is clearly the "most exact" term available for the events <i>as described by the records of those who committed the act.</i></li>
<li><u>Third</u>; whether is is a true tale or not doesn't matter. Historical verifiability is completely irrelevant; if the events belong here, the events deserve to be described as accurately as possible. If it is true history, it is historical genocide; if it is fiction, it is a fictional account of genocide. The historical accuracy may be debated for years, but won't change the very definition of what the account describes.</li>
<li><u>Fourth</u>; encyclopedia articles should describe things in the most accurate terms available, bar none. Whatever it is worth to the Jewish and Christian communities as a moral tale is only tangentally relevant to the value here as an encyclopedia article. Depicting this in gentler terms is use of weasel words to advance a sympathetic POV. Since this is an encyclopedia and not a biblical text, if someone searches for the term "genocide", this article should appear somewhere in the results. If there is a "Category:Genocides" on Wikipedia, then this article should be classified there as well. The article shouldn't be hidden or obscured by using less accurate terms and failing to classify it properly.</li>
<li><u>Fifth</u>; the article doesn't have to concentrate on the genocide, it could concentrate on the rest of the information we have, and the lesson meant to be taught by the retelling. However, not describing the fate of the Amalekites as victims of genocide somewhere in the article would be a grave error of omission. If the section header was changed to "Fate of the Amalekites" and the content clearly described them as "victims of genocide", I would not object.</li>
<li><u>Sixth</u>; use of the word "extermination" dehumanizes the victims, as if they're nothing more than bothersome insects worthy being crushed and nothing else. It is a euphamism that has been used numerous times in history to excuse genocidal conduct. "Extermination" is the biblical POV, but the POV of an encyclopedic article should be independent of the source texts it draws upon in order to remain neutral.</li>
<li><u>Finally</u>; I'm not trying to make a some sinister hidden point, I'm trying to make an accurate, NPOV encyclopedia. &#160;;) My reasons for making this change are outlined here. Instead, is there a point being made by trying to <i>avoid</i> the most accurate term for the events? <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 09:27, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The way I see it the word "exterminate" carries no connotation and is objective, I don't see how it dehumanizes.

<dd>Use of the word genocide in this article is merely the application of modern language to historical events. The word itself was created in 1944 (or 1943, depending on what source you trust). Certainly we cannot limit its use to events following that date, as it was specifically created to most accurately describe events such as these that had already occurred. We wouldn't even translate old texts if not for the need to put things in modern language that the people of today understand, so application of modern language to historical events is clearly the normal and proper thing to do.</dd>

<dd>I <i><b>really</b></i> didn't want to <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_law.html" title="Godwin's law">Godwin</a> the talk page, but here goes. The Nazis chose to use words such as "exterminate" very carefully and deliberately in order to dehumanize their victims and make it easier for their less dedicated and enthusiastic operatives to follow their orders. Nazi propaganda and Hitler's own writings referred to Jews as a "human virus" to be exterminated, denying them the diginity and value of their humanity. They didn't refer to the killing of Jews as "murder" and they wouldn't have used the word "genocide" either, because those words would confirm the humanity of the victims and underscore the unjustness of their fate. (Certainly we all knew that, right?) Exclusive use of the word "extermination" in this case, when "genocide" is clearly the more accurate term, does the same injustice to the Amalekites. Genocide should not replace every instance of every other similar word that appears, but it most certainly should appear prominently. (Technically I didn't Godwin the talk page, but I really didn't want to bring up the comparison.)</dd>

<p>The article now states: "The Biblical relationship between the Hebrew and Amalekite tribes was one of unmitigated enmity." and goes on to describe Jewish hatred of the Amalekites, but gives no example or even suggestion of Amalekite hatred of Jews. I don't find anything to suggest the hatred was mutual.</p>
<p>Shouldn't we rephrase this sentence to reflect the true meaning of the cited texts until we can find and cite an example of Amalekite hatred of Hebrew tribes? As it's written now, it looks like a justification, or worse, an excuse for the genocide. I'm sure that's not what we want. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused">focused</a> 05:07, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There is no account of hatred of the Jews as such, the Biblical account describes how the Amalekites attacked the Jews without provocation and had attacked the weakest in particular i.e. just plain banditry and a general contempt for mankind. The Midrash also describes Amalekite contempt for God: Amalek cut off the penises of the Jews and threw them in the air to shove them up the nose of God. <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuratowski%27s_Ghost_768e.html" title="User:Kuratowski's Ghost">Kuratowski's Ghost</a> 13:28, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with KG that "extermination" is better than "genocide" and I don't understand Unfocused's argument on that. As for the other issue, it should be made more clear that there is no information whatever about the Amalekites except what the Hebrew Bible says. History outside the Bible does not record them at all, and most historians regard them as myth. So all we know of their nature is through the eyes of their bitter enemies. They attacked the Israelites, but it isn't true they weren't provoked (the Israelites had entered their territory). --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 11:09, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Genesis 14:7 refers to "the whole territory of the Amalekites" and in any case if they had a city they were not mere nomads. The Amalekites first attacked the Israelites at Rephardim when the latter were travelling from place to place, so the implication is that the Israelites had encroached on Amalekite territory. Of course it doesn't say that explicitly, but it doesn't say the opposite either. There is no clear statement that the Amalekites were bandits or were any less ethical than anyone else. Any such claim in the article should make it clear that this is an allegation made by (who? tradition?). --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a> 12:59, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The extermination versus genocide discussion is in the section above. Merriam-Webster definition of genocide: <i>the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, <b>political, or cultural</b> group</i> (Emphasis mine). The Amaleks were, if not a racial group, a political or cultural group, as they did have a King. Having a King is a clear sign of being an individual, distinct and separate political group. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused">focused</a> 12:32, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article now states: <i>"The Biblical relationship between the Hebrew and Amalekite tribes was that the Hebrew tribes hated the Amalekites, primarily due to banditry committed by the Amalekites."</i> however, I'm not at all satisfied with this.</p>
<p>In discussion above, I had made the point that there isn't any evidence of mutual hatred between the Hebrews and Amalekites, and KG suggested that Amalekite banditry and disregard for Hebrew cultural sensibilities were the primary reasons for the hate. However, there is evidence of other battles between them, and other possible reasons for the fights; specifically that the Jewish tribes may have been attacked while passing through the territory of the Amalekites.</p>
<p>Although I wrote the sentence as it currently appears in the article, I'm not comfortable with it, and would appreciate any edits to it that further expand and explain the reasons for the animosity between the two groups. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused">focused</a> 16:54, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The hatred stemmed from having the weak and ill attacked from behind. This is from the Bible. I can't believe the hostility being expressed toward contemporary Jews for a <i>Bible story</i> about the ancient Israelites. There were 11 other tribes, go pick on them too!

<dd>The article, as it stands, vilifies the Israelites and sympathizes far too much with the Amalekites. Completely unprovoked, the Amalekites left their territory to attack the weak of Israel that were already exhausted (Ex. 17:8-15; Deut. 25:17-18). There was no reason to do this, as Israel was not even going to settle in Amalek's "territory." Canaan was north of Amalek, and they would not have been affected. Nonetheless, the Amalekites left their territory to attack an exhausted non-threat.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Once Israel had settled in Canaan, Amalek allied itself with Moab and Ammon to place Israel under subjection for 18 years (Jg. 3:12-14). Later, the Amalekites swept into Israel to ravage and plunder the land, leaving the Israelites impoverished (Jg. 6). When Saul campaigned against the Amalekites, it was not out of vengeance, but a response to the new atrocities against Israel they had comitted - the "plundering" of 1 Sam. 14:48 could very well have been recent, and Samuel, before slaying Agag, mentions "[Y]our sword has made women childless..." (1 Sam. 15:33) Samuel indicates that Agag himself had attacked and killed Israelites in his time - in fact, in killing Agag, Samuel did not once mention the past relationship between Amalek and Israel.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In the times of David, the Amalekites still persisted in their evil ways - "Now the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They had attacked Ziklag and burned it, and had taken captive the women and all who were in it, both young and old." (1 Sam. 30:1-2) These raids were likely regular in Amalekite society - no doubt, they lived off captured goods from Israel and other lands (like Philistia). Psalm 83 includes Amalek among the list of Israel's enemies who say, "Come, let us destroy them [Israel] as a nation, that the name of Israel be remembered no more." (Ps. 83:4,7)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>(When David lived among the Philistines during Saul's reign, he did raid the Amalekites at times, but he did so as a servant of Achish the king of Gath, and so it does not count as Israel attacking the Amalekites)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There is only one other occassion when Israel attacked the Amalekites. This is 1 Chr. 4:41-43, where 500 Simeonites (in the times of Hezekiah, even) invaded the hill country of Seir, killing the remaining Amalekites in the process. This was not, however, out of vengeful hatred for Amalek, but for the purpose of re-claiming their territory (the Simeonites actually attacked several ethnic groups in this battle - Hamites, Meunites, and Amalekites - in other words, Simeon attacked the inhabitants of the land irregardless of their ethnicity). Considering that Simeon borders the Amalekite territory, this was probably brought about by those tribes invading Simeon, as by the time of Hezekiah, the tribal borders were well-established.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Unlike in Israel, the Amalekites abused their slaves. In pursuing a raiding party, David's men find an Egyptian slave who, upon becoming ill, was abandoned by his Amalekite owner and left to starve to death (1 Sam 30:11-15). As an aside, this slave was probably among the captured from a raid in Egypt. Unfortunately, we know little else about the practices of these people.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Further, Amalek was hated by Israel as a national entity, not in a racist way. Israel even accepted Amalekites as immigrants, as indicated by an Amalekite being a soldier in Saul's army in 2 Sam. 1. Obviously, this Amalekite had not been killed just for being ethnically Amalekite.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would also like to point out that Haman was likely not an Amalekite - Agag is actually a district in Persia, and in all likelihood it is a coincidence that Agag was also the name of a famous Amalekite (see the entry for <a href="../../../a/g/a/Agagite.html" title="Agagite">Agagite</a>).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now, Is this really an unjustified hatred? Is fighting against such an oppressive enemy genocide? Each time Israel attacked the Amalekites, it was in self-defense, except for possibly one exception (when Simeon attacked Amalek in Hezekiah's times), but we aren't given enough information about the attack to know if it was justified or not. Given Amalek's history, they probably raided Israel and other lands to their last. This was not genocide but defending against raiders. THAT is why Israel "hated Amalek."</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Quite simply, a "War of Extermination" is genocide, regardless of reason, regardless of whether it's justified or not. It is simply a genocide. It is up to the reader to decide whether genocide was a just act or not. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.221.13.5_a343.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.221.13.5">69.221.13.5</a> (talk) 07:01, 19 February 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

<p>In the article, there is a sentence <i>See <a href="http://www.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/shiur.asp?id=1329" class="external text" title="http://www.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/shiur.asp?id=1329" rel="nofollow">Wipe Out Amalek</a> for a current rabbinical teaching on the matter.</i> which, in itself is valid material for the article, but it is an unexplained blind link contained inline with the text. In other words, the reader of the article has to go offsite to have an idea of what knowledge the link provides.</p>
<p>We should not require a reader to do external research to reach full understanding of a subject we cover. I suggest that we either summarize the teachings included in the article cited in the link, so that the link has full context, or move it to the bottom of the article.</p>
<p>I do not want to be the one to attempt to summarize the link, as I'm sure I will get some of it wrong (and perhaps some of it <i>very</i> wrong) because I don't agree with the teachings contained there<sup>1</sup>. I ask that someone who is familiar with these teachings provide more context for the link, or move it to the bottom of the article in the "external links" section.</p>
<p>I don't object to the link being present, in fact, I think it may provide a better understanding of the topic for some readers. But placement is always very important, and I think that inline links should <b>always</b> have some kind of summary of what is being cited. After all, that is the normal reason for using inline citations; that you've just quoted or summarized an opinion available elsewhere, and want to provide reference to the original for the reader.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup>(Although I believe in using force for defense, even in defense of a foreign nation being attacked by a third party, I'm generally too much of a pacifist to understand the treatment of the Amalekites as stemming from the values of "compassion and kindness" as the Yeshiva article states.) <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 02:22, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
