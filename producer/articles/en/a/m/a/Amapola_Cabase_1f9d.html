<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/a/Amapola_Cabase_1f9d.html" title="Edit section: Early Years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early Years</span></h2>
<p>Amapola Cabase was educated in several different schools: <a href="http://www.cnu.edu.ph/" class="external text" title="http://www.cnu.edu.ph/" rel="nofollow">Cebu Normal School</a>, <a href="http://www.deped.gov.ph/private/private.asp?sec=&amp;action=edit&amp;iID=681&amp;type=private" class="external text" title="http://www.deped.gov.ph/private/private.asp?sec=&amp;action=edit&amp;iID=681&amp;type=private" rel="nofollow">Malate Catholic School</a>, <a href="http://www.uv.edu/DesktopDefault.aspx" class="external text" title="http://www.uv.edu/DesktopDefault.aspx" rel="nofollow">University of the Visayas</a>, and <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_San_Carlos_4d91.html" title="University of San Carlos">University of San Carlos</a>. Amapola abandoned her academic studies for a full pledged career in music. She received her first key to Cebu City at 7 years old for her work in conducting Toy Orchestras in several elementary schools in Cebu. This concept started in Amapola's school when during music class, the teacher, Mrs. Coronada Pingol noticed Amapola's retention of the Toy Orchestra repertoire. The largest Toy Orchestra organized by Pingol and conducted by Amapola was composed of 100 schoolchildren from Cebu Normal School. Cebu City Mayor Osmena presented Amapola with the key to the city. The affair was hosted by Genie Peralta and broadcast on DYRC-Radio, then later replayed all over the Visayan Islands.</p>

<p><b>Radio and Television Career</b>:</p>
<p>Amapola co-produced and starred in her first musical television show at ABS TV Studios in Cebu City when she was a third year high school student at the University of San Carlos Girls High. Sharing in the duties of producer and director was Amapola's bosom buddy Marilyn Bajarias (who later worked for <a href="../../../a/b/s/ABS-CBN_97be.html" title="ABS-CBN">ABS-CBN</a> TV and Radio Studios in Manila.) One of the highlights of Amapola's career was the grand opening of the San Miguel Brewery in Mandaue City. The mammoth extravaganza starred all the big names in the Philippine Music Industry including Sampaguita and LVN Studios actors and television stars, including <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilita_Corrales_c362.html" title="Pilita Corrales">Pilita Corrales</a>, host of the nationally acclaimed "An Evening with Pilita". After that evening's performance, <a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilita_Corrales_c362.html" title="Pilita Corrales">Pilita Corrales</a> and her company offered Amapola her first break on national television as special guest in the former's popular TV show. One month later, Amapola and her family band led by her father Mahnee Cabase arrived in Manila for their first performance, followed by another. The successful performances were followed by stints at the Manila Hilton, and the Intercontinental Hotel in Makati. Pilita Corrales' brother Fae was now representing Amapola and the Sounds. Leaving a full-blown career in Cebu City, Amapola and her father Mahnee Cabase continued their musical careers in Manila with Cabase leading his band, and Amapola as resident chanteuse at the Intercontinental Hotel in Makati, Metro Manila. Amapola was a frequent guest in Joe Quirino's Seeing Stars on Channel 13; Nora Aunor's Superstar show, Pilar Pilapil Show, Helen Gamboa Show, and eventually co-hosted Etchos Lang starring Justo C. Justo. Soon other TV shows were added to Amapola's weekly list, namely: Stop Look and Listen on Wednesdays with co-hosts Eddie Mesa, Ike Lozada, among others, also co-hosting on other days were Tirso Cruz III and Novo Bono. Amapola also costarred with Vilma Santos and Edgar Mortiz in "The Sensations" airing every Sunday.</p>
<p><b>Commercials and Endorsements</b></p>
<p>Scores of radio and television commercials also came Amapola's way. Her most famous movie commercial was Vicks Cough Drops that played nationally for two years while Amapola was away on her tour abroad. Notable musician and producer Emil Mijares recorded a commercial with Amapola that required nine dialects for Silver Swan Soy Sauce. Mijares and Amapola finished the project in one afternoon. Amapola nicknamed "Jingle Girl" she recorded as a solo performer or with the groups: "Gentle Rain" led by Nonong Pedero and "Minor Changes" with Bess Silva and Alice Bell.</p>
<p><b>Concerts and Recordings</b></p>
<p>It did not take long before Amapola was invited to open for internationally acclaimed artists like Jack Jones, The Carpenters, Lou Rawls, Astrud Gilberto, The Platters, The Young Americans, Matt Monro, Sergio Mendes Brasil 66.</p>
<p>Amapola recorded her first movie theme composed by George Canseco. "Kapantay Ay Langit" won the Manila Film Festival Award for Best Song of the Year. Amapola received a trophy that matched George Canseco's. Soon, Amapola's first English LP album with Vicor in their Pioneer Label followed. The LP album entitled "Songs and Amapola" featured George Canseco's "Ode to Amapola" which the composer wrote especially for the album cover. Canseco also composed the title song for that album, "Songs," a song he composed exclusively for Amapola. Every song from the LP album was released as a single and three of the singles held positions in the nation's Top 10 for several weeks.</p>
<p>The first international concert tour Amapola signed on for was the Cavalcade of Stars with Diomedes Maturan, Linda Magno and Boy Mondragon among others. The show toured Taipei, Guam, and the Hawaiian Islands. The highly successful tour culminated at the Honolulu International Concert Hall. A contract to sing for the Kahala Hilton was offered to Amapola and she entertained at the popular Maile Lounge. Her popularity spread and she held the distinction of being the first Filipino female artist to top the Hawaiian most famous female performer i972. The Waikiki Beach Press twice featured Amapola for the front page story. Popular columnists Dave Donnelley, Ben Wood, and Wayne Harada wrote several articles and gave glowing reviews of Amapola's shows. Regular Kahala Hilton Maile Lounge habitués included Gene Hackman, Frank Sinatra, Rod Stewart, and the late Jack Lord. Very soon, Amapola was invited to co-host Hawaii's TV noon show hosted by Don Robbs.</p>
<p>After Amapola's successful run in the Hawaiian Islands, her high acclaimed concert in New York's Town Hall followed. The Town Hall concert was followed by a nightly appearance at the famous Bayanihan Club in Manhattan. In Amapola's audience was Ed Sullivan who nicknamed Amapola an "eyeful."</p>
<p>After the East Coast appearances, Amapola returned to the Bay Area to open the newly refurbished Mabuhay Gardens. During her second season at the club, a personal request came from the Jazz icon Bobby Enriquez for Amapola to perform with him at the Miyako Hotel in San Francisco's Japan Town. Their team-up became legendary and gained prominence in the Bay Area jazz scene. Earl "Fatha" Hines was seen in their audience. Enriquez and Amapola accepted contracts as a team including their performances in the Lake Tahoe casinos. The jazz concerts with Bobby Enriquez were followed by appearances at the Mocambo on Polk Street along name entertainers Patti La Belle, Carmen McRae, &amp; Anita O'Day.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, Amapola has received the Tinig Award, Manila Film Festival acknowledgment, won the Awit Awards twice, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Philippines National Press Club in 1987. In the United States, Amapola was awarded the Eye Award for Best Entertainer of the year, the Philippine Cultural Award in San Francisco, The Cultural Award in Michigan, and a plaque from former California Governor Gerry Brown during the Browns for Brown campaign.</p>
<p>Amapola is scheduled for a world cruise with Regent Seven Seas Cruises in 2006 and 2007. Her second book "Promising Skies" garnered rave reviews from New York Best selling author, Ellen Tanner Marsh who said "...Amapola writes like a dream." The 2nd novel was published in 2006 following her first multi-awarded novel "Coming Home."</p>
