Thank you amoruso-for contacting me about MA. I find it disgusting that people do not consider him an anti-semite-but since when have people cared about the jews.

<p>Keep up the good work in Lehi. The narrower your criteria for truth, the better the quality of the article will be. Just be careful and be curteous even to users that you do not agree with and take a break if its gets too tense. Also get an email address.</p>

<p>Hi amarouso, sorry to drop in uninvited. I changed the controversial thousands of buildings entry in the leb conflict section of the Israel page. The source you quoted said 6000 claims for damage, not 6000 buildings destroyed (the grauniad article I mean, the other source only deals with the human casualties) an insurance claim for damage could include a wrecked pool, a broken window or any other less serious incident. 950 Katushas may have been able to destroy thousands of buildings, i dont know, but if you provide a source that shows they did, please post it and change the article back. <a href="../../../b/o/y/User%7EBoynamedsue_998b.html" title="User:Boynamedsue">Boynamedsue</a> 120604</p>

<dd>"Peaceful" was actually a quote from Uri Davis in a peer-reviewed scholarly journal. Now, I hope you'll be a little less smug and condescending in the future. And, that you will quit removing well-cited sources. But, I doubt it. I'll be watching; your attitude has ensured that. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 16:32, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't care who said it... you must grasp the issue of balances and not pushing one version over another. The article in question is articulate and complicated enough for you not to choose one random source and depict it as fact telling an incident. And your negative attitude is uncalled for, I don't know where your general animosity and belligerent approach comes from. It's a shame. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 16:37, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know it's tricky to find anything pro- on a person like this - well, tricky might be an understatement - but (and I know this sounds bad) just because he's a child killer and a terrorist, doesn't mean we shouldn't treat him fairly, surely? Tricky, as I know next to nothing about this man, but phrases like 'smashed in the 4 year old girls head' and the like don't really add anything to the article compared to something slightly more neutral, like 'bludgeoned the girl to death'. We can add the 'four-year-old' bit in earlier in the article. Also, why 'burst into', as opposed to 'entered' - did they burst into the building? Is that an opinion? Where do you draw the line between entering and bursting into? - and AFAIK 'suffocated to death' isn't grammaitcally correct! Finally, why did you remove 'by the Israeli authorities' from the phrase 'Kuntar was tried and convicted for the murders of Danny and Einat Haran by the Israeli authorities.'? <a href="../../../h/a/w/User%7EHawkerTyphoon_6353.html" title="User:HawkerTyphoon">HawkerTyphoon</a> 12:15, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Him being convicted by Israel can be added if you wish, but I think it's redundant as it's obvious who convicted him from the article. Authorities is what - police&#160;? It's Israel's court of law (not military).</li>

<li>as for the daughter's death description - I really think that it sounding horrible doesn't mean it's not <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> - Kuntar himself talked about the incident this way, he's the one in the interrogation that from his words the whole incident is made clear. I don't think we should omit details that aren't disputed by anyone, from the article. If someone would say that he didn't do it in this way, then it can be disputed, but his supporters don't dispute the event, just the cause or motive maybe, not the details of the killing which he recounted himself.</li>

<p>I find it interesting that you remove the word "terrorist" about Lehi murders, in the interest of "balance" and NPOV. Yet you then replace the word "gunmen" with "terrorist" to describe Palestinian murders. You also seem to believe that only Palestinians are capable of "massacres", while Israeli groups engage only in "battles". This selective language, depending on who is doing the murdering, leads me to question whether you are truly interested in promoting neutrality and balance. Or are you perhaps here trying to promote a particular point of view? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndalusian1_e966.html" title="User:Andalusian1">Andalusian1</a> 23:55, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The answer is quite simple. A terrorist is like a murderer a person who killed someone innocent. That's why I have no problem to call Jews that murdered <b>civilians</b> terrorists (in fact, I considered it in the past and later even tried to insert the terrorists into some of these entries so your accusation of bias is out of place and wrong). But Lehi like PLO in general is a political organization, so it can either be a <b>designated</b> terrorist organization or militant/etc. However a person <b>who kills a baby</b> <b>or children in school</b>, the actual one that shoots that is, in cold blood can be called a terrorist I'm sure you understand the difference. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 00:29, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see we agree; killing innocent children is terrorism. I assume we also agree with that sentiment, whether the murder is from reckless indifference or from cold-blooded intent. You deleted the following sourced quote from a Jewish Israeli scholar "they murdered over 200 people, half of whom were women and children". Moreover, is Count Bernadotte guilty of something, or was his murder not terrorism? That was planned and executed by Lehi leadership. If that isn't terrorism, is it even _possible_ to have a "terrorist" group, because one can always simply state that a particular member was the terrorist? At any rate, you certainly didn't take any effort to describe the individual Lehi gunmen as terrorists.</dd>
<dd>Bottom line your claims to be of superior balance and neutrality have little credibility. That's because your editing changes when the names of the subject change.</dd>
<dd>A final word on our point of agreement, that murdering children is terrorism (whether through depraved &amp; reckless indifference or direct intent): <a href="http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0700world/tm_objectid=17422039&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50082&amp;headline=a-third-of-casualties-in-lebanon-are-children--says-un-relief-chief-name_page.html" class="external text" title="http://icwales.icnetwork.co.uk/0100news/0700world/tm_objectid=17422039&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50082&amp;headline=a-third-of-casualties-in-lebanon-are-children--says-un-relief-chief-name_page.html" rel="nofollow">"A third of casualties in Lebanon are children, says UN relief chief"</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndalusian1_e966.html" title="User:Andalusian1">Andalusian1</a> 20:57, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm glad we agree. I didn't delete anything, I just replaced it with material from the article which is more established and researched. The thing is the allegations of murders of children in Deir Yassin are BS, it never happened. And the sources in the article depict that myth very well. Of course if there was a Lehi member specifically who killed an innocent child then he would be a terrorist - he himself, no doubt. As for Bernadotte, he was a British representive. I specifically, perhaps you missed it, underline that politicans/soldiers and anyone in office of some colonial power is a legitimate target, he's not a civilian. And about a terorrist <i>group</i>, indeed nobody calls anyone a terrorist group in wikipedia. Your last note is ridicilious since children aren't supposed to be where armed men are in battles according to the geneva convention. A state that defends itself and targets those military targets might hurt those civilians used as human shields but it did not target them, I'm sure you can understand the difference. A final note - times have changed through the years. Britian bombed civilian areas killing 10000's of civilians in WW 2 and also bombing children hospitals in occupied Denmark and other countries. That's no longer justified and acceptable, and terorrism is also much more frowned upon. This is just a historical note since international law has indeed developed. I'm sure you can see the difference between actions taken during the time of WW2 against the British who were here on a temporary mandte and between attacking civilians of a 58 years old country. You can twist it around but you can't around that the British weren't civilians in the area. But a person who murderes a 4 year old kid in cold blood, admits it, and mind you he came from some other country, went into an apartment, broke in, took the kid and smashed her head on a rock - that particular person can be called a terrorist, yes. Oh and one final note, a legal note. "reckless indiffrence" if something really is that - it's still not murder. Murder requires intent and not just intent but premedidated intent, and not just that, but also not under influence of momentary rage for instance - that's a doctrine in itself and so on. It's a specific charge. I'm more familiar with the hebrew terms, but there is man slaughter, negligent killing and levels. This is just to correct your defitinition mistake so you know. So whatever your political or moral position is, you can not ignore a difference between a premedidated killing of a child and a collateral damage from a bomb shell for instance. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 22:22, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>What's bothering you is what one can see in the discussion of the palestinian political violence. A user, Jayjg responded there very well. You need to understand that there can be actually a differnece. The fact that these specific palestinians are terrorists doesn't mean that Jews and Israel have to be autuomatically are to maintain some fake NPOV. Same thing with Al Qaida and U.S.A for example - it doesn't have to be that way just because "the world is always balanced and everything is the same". No - dead is not dead, terrorism is not terrorism. The job of people who take things seriously enough is to look at who's the culprit and to define acts in as much accuracy as possible and point out to the differences when and if they exist. They don't always exist. Certainly one side wasn't always an angel. The Kfar Kasem massacre for instance was horrible and unjustified and done by Israeli in the 1950's and the court punished them for it. Same with Americans and certain massacres in vietnam , iraq and so on. But one can't just say that every thing Israel does equals what hamas do just for the sake of npov, no matter how it can be annoyed for those politicall supportive for the palestinians for instance. Just as one can safely side that was the nazis did was evil and without precedent, and it won't be pov. not every murder, killing, not even genocide is the same - there are details, motives, ideology, factors, considerations, perspectives, timeline, and many things. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 22:52, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't want to get involved in the details of this debate, but I just want to point out that both of you are using the term "terrorist" much more loosely than is generally accepted. Killing civilians is of course murder (as is killing any human being), but there has to be a specific kind of motivation behind that murder for it to be called terrorism. For the sake of accuracy in your edits, it should be noted that accidental civilian deaths in open warfare isn't terrorism (from a NPOV perspective). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkovich292_9f23.html" title="User:Markovich292">Markovich292</a> 01:23, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, if it is later found to have merit and to have been made in good faith, it can be held against one. You can't, for example, engage in a 3RR and then remove a 3RR warning as "trolling."

<p>I once saw an episode of a television show called "Becker" that really is worth mentioning to you. Just wondering, have you watched this show? Anyway, in this episode, Dr. Becker was accused by a writer of making racist comments. When confronted about it, it was revealed that it was the writer who was at fault for assigning racial overtones to an ordinary conversation. On thing in particular involved Becker's use of the phrase "those people that grill on the sidewalk." The writer <i>assumed</i> that Becker was talking about Puerto Rican's because he knew it was mostly Puerto Ricans that do that (in the show). He just ignored that Becker was refering <b>only</b> to people that grill on the sidewalk (because it gets in the way he says), and not Puerto Ricans.</p>
<p>Hopefully that illustrates the situation. I made a comment directed at all the people that were not dealing with the issue and making personal remarks/arguments/attacks instead. ThuranX saw something that was not there, and both you and he will not recognize that he was wrong. You both are in the position of the writer, and the only decent thing you can do is let go of your false assumption and drop the attitude you have because of it. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkovich292_9f23.html" title="User:Markovich292">Markovich292</a> 05:58, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I wonder why there is no "Siege of Jerusalem (1948)" article. Was it removed? Or never written. My view is that it was at Jerusalem that the Arab pleading collapses.

<dd>The article you linked to seems to be based on CBS data, which does list Ashdod as having over 200,000 residents in 2005 as provisional data.<a href="http://www.cbs.gov.il/population/new_2006/table3.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cbs.gov.il/population/new_2006/table3.pdf" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></dd>
<dd>This however is still slightly above 200,000 and not the 212,500 figure you posted. The Hebrew Wikipedia is almost always wrong on these issues because they quote the city websites which always exaggerate figures. A while ago I found out that they exaggerated the population of Eilat by over 20% (at over 57,000, while the real population is about 45,000) and brought it up in talk and they corrected it. So unless there's a better source than CBS, we should use their statistics alone. On a side note, I'm confused as to why CBS lists 2005 statistics as provisional data and 2004 statistics as normal data, considering the last census was in 1995 and all population data since then has been provisional.</dd>

I gotcha - I hadn't seen the new edits, only the revert by Brimba.</p>
<p>They will never go for any statement that characterizes posts, even if it pertains to a quality shared by the vast majority of posters or threads. I've tried before. This is why it is a matter of time before another edit war and probably why the thread should be scrapped.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if you saw the lengthy debate about the genocide reference. I demonstrated that since genocide includes 'merely' trying to force the expatriation of a people through mental anguish, and is not limited to mass murder, that pretty much the WHOLE SITE is a big genocide fest. I asked for, and was not presented with, one single means of achieving a 'white nation' that didn't involve genocide within the legal definition of the word - they did not or could not produce one. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStick_to_the_Facts_edc7.html" title="User:Stick to the Facts">Stick to the Facts</a> 20:47, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Whoa! Fraid I'm not with you on this brother. Two thoughts: first the name is ambiguous ("new people" or "new anti-semitism") but most importantly I don't agree with yr comment that this is in any way a compromise. None needed. MA is anti-Semitic by any measure, and not just an anti-semitic from the standpoint of "new" antisemitism.

If you are making a claim, you need to cite a source that backs up that claim, e.g. for the claim that Mark Twain has been taken as the primary source for Ottoman Palestinian demography you will need to find a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> that says that, not just sources that quote him about Palestinian demography or sources that say that he has been quoted about it. Similarly, if you wish to imply that the reason Abu Ali Mustafa was killed was related to any particular government's claims that the PFLP was a terrorist organization, or to Israeli claims that he was responsible for killings, you will have to find a reliable source to that effect.

<p>from PA. If you look at my contributions, you will see that I have worked/am working extensively on depopulated 1948 villages.

<p>Hi Amoruso, perhaps you could help me with something. Since August, an anon in Damascus has been deleting paragraphs about the <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circassians.html" title="Circassians">Circassians</a> in Israel. I'm guessing it's because he/she sees the Golan Heights (where Israeli Circassians live) as a part of Syria. Regardless, I was wondering if you could add some sources to the statements in the paragraphs the anon keeps deleting. Perhaps that might get him to stop. I haven't been able to talk to this person as they're on a dynamic IP. Thanks in advance. —<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhoikhoi_b62f.html" title="User:Khoikhoi">Khoi</a><a href="../../../k/h/o/User_talk%7EKhoikhoi_f6d5.html" title="User talk:Khoikhoi">khoi</a></span> 01:23, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, I don't mind the mention, especially since it has relevance later to the 2006 conflict because of Nasrallah's impudent demands. It's just that I'm trying to keep some sort of temporal flow to the article so things don't jump around too much. Of course it's a challenge to balance temporal flow with thematic flow, which you can see pretty much breaks down in the next-to-last section of the article. Can you just put the mention of Quintar in the right timeframe? -- <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKendrick7_5630.html" title="User:Kendrick7">Kendrick7</a> 06:18, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Siniora's position is relayed in the section on "Position of Lebanon," though if the new speech has a significant statement, you should include it. His crying doesn't convey a specific idea, and it is only original research to assign words to it. In any event, whatever he said before/during/after crying is far more enlightening vis-a-vis his position than mentioning his tears. As for the stones, if the event was an attack on IDF vehicles, then you should say so, though the citation you provided doesn't make mention of IDF forces in the area. I incorporated the point about HEzbollah's rejectionism in a smoother manner; a link to the detailed and established subsection in the main Hezbollah article is much more effective than citing an individual piece. In general, <a href="../../../w/t/a/WP%7EWTA_2564.html" title="WP:WTA">WP:WTA</a> says that we shouldn't use words like terrorist, as they are poorly defined and fraught with potential POV issues.

<p>You ask why I am so interested in the Arab Israeli conflict.</p>
<p>Well I have always been very interested in Israel and have always had Jewish friends (have never visited Israel though). I consider myself a friend of Israel and even though I recognize the intrinsic unfairness to the Arabs I have always supported the right of Israel to exist in this region and of Jews to live in peace and security there. But when I started reading Israel related pages in Wikipedia I found them not to be neutral.</p>
<p>Israelis do not live in peace and security 60 years after the creation of Israel. Why is that? Surely there are many reasons and I think both sides of the conflict make their best to polarize matters and to demonize the other side. Indeed an important reason (I believe) is the deafening propaganda that obscures the issues. It does not help peace when the truth is not known and when both sides of the conflict honestly believe in their respective nationalist mythologies. So I thought I could help peace if I worked towards more neutral articles in Wikipedia. I am a religious person and really believe that peace is what God wants too. I also really believe that this continuous conflict does not serve Israel's interests. There is no doubt that Israelis (not to mention Palestinians) would have a much better quality of life if this conflict were over. What's happening is stupid; there must be a better way. Incidentally, have you ever considered that maybe this continuous war-like situation is making the Israeli military a self-perpetuating institution? That the military service in the occupied territories is not really what's best for the soul and character of young Israelis?</p>
<p>Well, that's about it. As you can see I never answer a question with two sentences when I can come up with twenty&#160;:-( <a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDianelos_a85d.html" title="User:Dianelos">Dianelos</a> 08:40, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dear Amoruso, if you think BEFORE, BEFORE you will go back to Adam and Eve&#160;:-) What we need here is to think about the future. As a really great Jew said long ago, God wants us to forgive others. I know that keeping a grudge is part of Middle Eastern culture (and Greeks are very close to that culture), but to achieve peace one must transcend that. I agree with you of course that the point is not to achieve any peace but a long term solution.</dd>

I understand Jewish sentiments towards the Arabs; terrible thing have happened - this is a war after all. But I have not looked at the photo you pointed at; such things are bad for the soul. Muslims too have many pictures of children torn in pieces by Israeli bombs. Please do not live under the impression that such helps Israel: There are more, maybe many more, innocent Muslims killed, maimed, and abused by Jews than the other way around - many more Muslim families sunk into grief by loss, or their homes destroyed, or their property taken away- than the other way around. After 60 years of war the region is charged with propaganda and myth-making, but numbers count for something. Of course the two peoples' deeply dislike each other. The question is which is the best way to the future?</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw Spielberg's "Munich" and then read some newspaper clips from back 1972 - 25 years ago. After bombing in September 9 Palestinian camps in Lebanon in Syria (some say "terrorist training camps" some say "refugee camps"; I think they were probably both and that probably dozens of innocent Palestinians were killed there) here is what the Israeli briefing officer said "Our aim is to hit the terrorists as hard as we can, to cripple them and to make it clear that we mean business. The message is directed not only to the terrorists but also to the countries that harbor them."<a href="http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F60816F63854127B93CBA91782D85F468785F9" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F60816F63854127B93CBA91782D85F468785F9" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Sounds familiar? That was 25 years ago.</p>
<p>After decades of killing and suffering both peoples' psyche is getting angrier and uglier. Do you wish more decades of the same? Is this the Israel that Jews have dreamed of? If not then you must stop thinking about the bitter past and concentrate in working towards a peaceful future. And Palestinians must do the same. You don't make peace with your partners whom you respect; you make peace with your enemies whom you hate. I have no doubt that both peoples have enough heart to achieve this, and that what stops them is the insistent warmongering noise that comes from the extremists from both sides and that indeed polarizes both majorities.</p>
<p>You express outrage that Palestinians have voted for Hamas, but have you ever considered how Israelis voting for Sharon must have looked to them? You won’t achieve peace with your enemy if you don’t make an effort to understand them. If you were a Palestinian refugee what would you have done to gain a nation? Ehud Barak did not mince his words when he said in 1998 that "If I were a Palestinian youth I would have joined a terrorist organization"</p>
<p>Anyway I just posted in my talk page my response to your criticisms about the proposal being utopian. I would like to thank you BTW about your comments, they were quite stimulating. <a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDianelos_a85d.html" title="User:Dianelos">Dianelos</a> 08:22, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>About the infobox, I'm not the one making the template, the template is there when I joined wiki, I just followed the stats. However, league statistic is always better and easier to track. You need to remember that full statistics will include also domestics cups, which pretty hard to track.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin_tamb_21d1.html" title="User:Martin tamb">Martin tamb</a> 00:54, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, for Del Piero it is true that it is very details statistics from juventus.com, but not the case for several other players. If you want to change it, you just need to somehow manage to change the football infobox template. As for now, I think it is better to follow what has been there. Anyway, the 200 goals is also listed on the article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin_tamb_21d1.html" title="User:Martin tamb">Martin tamb</a> 01:05, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No worries, but I'm afraid I still may be wrong, from the juventus.com website I counted a total of 482 apps and 194 goals. And I have his statistics from current season is 7 apps 3 goals in Serie A and 2 apps 3 goals in Coppa Italia. If I am wrong please correct me. Anyway great job on the new template, will you start implementing this on other players? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartin_tamb_21d1.html" title="User:Martin tamb">Martin tamb</a> 01:53, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Amoruso,</p>
<p>I plan to add a new article/ or expand the article regarding the complete issues related to Masjid al-Aqsa proper, or Noble Sancturary. Are you aware of any article of that sort on Wikipedia. I see most stuff redirected to the Temple Mount page. I prefer to have the Temple mount page mainly to address the Jewish religious/historical info because that is really what Har Habayt is about with a cross link to the Noble Sanctuary page. Similarly, the Noble Sanctuary article have most Islamic architectural/religious issues with a link that cross links with the Temple Mount page. What do you think? I do not want to start on something and really get in a conflict and really waste your time and mine. So it would be nice if we agree on that beforehand. There should be no POV problems with this I believe. I need time of course to do that, I need to collect some more references, I do have some already but it needs more time for a professional look. For example, I would like to discuss minarets, gates, clocks, Imams, etc pertaining to this subject. Please note that there are two sections in al-Aqsa mosque page namely the meaning of the "Farthest mosque" and the "Third Holiest" thing all of which are not really related to the congregational Aqsa mosque but to the Aqsa compound as a whole. It may be better to have all this compound related issues in the same existing article of Aqsa mosque articulating of course the terminological differences. This might be better idea than really creating a new page, I mean article. This will probably take me two weeks or so because I am quite busy these days on other issues. Any suggestions? Thanks. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmaqdisi_042d.html" title="User:Almaqdisi">Almaqdisi</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/l/m/User_talk%7EAlmaqdisi_ed6a.html" title="User talk:Almaqdisi"><font color="DarkBlue">talk to me</font></a></small></sup> 06:48, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your reply. I will think about it. I am editing some other articles related to the same issue like this one <a href="../../../i/s/r/Isra_and_Mi%27raj_3c7b.html" title="Isra and Mi'raj">Isra and Mi'raj</a>. What seems puzzling is that the word <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masjid_al-Aqsa_7f02.html" title="Masjid al-Aqsa">Masjid al-Aqsa</a> that is used there takes us to the Page of al-Aqsa mosque. These do not really have the same exact meaning specially in this context since the congregational mosque did not even exist when these terms were coined. Apparently this confusion keeps coming due to the non exact overlapping between masjid/mosque. Masjid may refer to spot or a building. Jami or "congregation mosque" is the true Arabic equivalent of the English understanding of the word Mosque. It sounds to me as if there should be an article with the title Masjid al-Aqsa, explaining this Quranic term which does not necessarily refer to a building but rather to a blessed spot of prostration and worship as mentioned in 17:1. But again, it sounds to me that this may better correlate with the existing Aqsa mosque article. Additionaly, talking about the minarets of the Aqsa mosque seems more appropriate in the Aqsa page and not in the Temple mount page. Again, I am not saying that info in both articles should be mutually exclusive. But rather really more accounted for in the given pretext. Anyway, I will think of what you have said regarding the Temple mount page. I prefer maybe to share this info at the Talk page of the Aqsa page before moving ahead and adding it to any existing article, or creating a new article. Thanks. <a href="../../../a/l/m/User%7EAlmaqdisi_042d.html" title="User:Almaqdisi">Almaqdisi</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/l/m/User_talk%7EAlmaqdisi_ed6a.html" title="User talk:Almaqdisi"><font color="DarkBlue">talk to me</font></a></small></sup> 07:19, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's not that difficult to understand, really. The 'problem' is that my somewhat extreme thoughts on both sides make my view pretty unique. I'm one of Israel's most fanatical defenders to the outside and one of its most extreme attackers on the inside. To a limited level, of course; I do explain Jewish opposition to Zionism to people such as <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalestineRemembered_d4da.html" title="User:PalestineRemembered">User:PalestineRemembered</a>, who are normal people. I would not bother talking to neo-Nazis and Ahmedinejad, like some NK people have done. They are real anti-Semites. People like PalestineRemembered and Tiamut here on Wikipedia are the 'real' non-Jewish anti-Zionists: people who are personally involved, who can stay civilized. With such people, I have no problems cooperating. Same thing on our side: we also have Kachnikim, people like that Lance guy on <a href="../../../z/i/o/Talk%7EZionism_e758.html" title="Talk:Zionism">Talk:Zionism</a>, and <a href="../../../y/o/s/User%7EYossiea_e240.html" title="User:Yossiea">User:Yossiea</a>, who is waging a personal crusade against me in order to get me blocked from Wikipedia because he disagrees with my views on Zionism (just check his contribs - half his recent contribs are attacks on me, attacking my edits, complaining about me etc). --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel575_1e43.html" title="User:Daniel575">Daniel575</a> | <small><i><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDaniel575_08a4.html" title="User talk:Daniel575">(talk)</a></i></small> 12:37, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Amoruso,<br />
My apologies not to acknowledge the above sooner.

<p>But the sources are websites which dont exist anymore, which means they cannot be clicked and/or verified and hence this warrants their exclusion in accordance with WP policies.

<p>Dear Amoruso, I improved the Jewish Supremacy article. I didn't add sources or references, but I feel as it sounds more encyclopedia-ic and lenghthy-er. If you wish to change it back to your original one, then be my guest. I just didn't want bias on wikipedia. Please remember, the original article was written by a Stormfront member. In case you didn't know, Stormfront is a pro white, anti-semetic organization that uses terms like "Jewish Supremacy" to justify their hate speech. Thank you and good night.</p>

<p>I think solving this problem might take a little longer than expected. I'm trying to get a hold of some of the sources used in writing that section. It might take about a week.

<p>I think Zero gave an indication that he/she finds the book by Amichal Yevin a lot more acceptable. So you might want to use that more often. Also, maybe you should try to talk to Zero directly? My Hebrew is not that good, so I can't really comment on Hebrew texts without reading them first. But I'll try to get a copy of the book by Keller and maybe that would help. <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxico_16a2.html" title="User:Taxico">Taxico</a> 08:12, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Amoruso, I'm sorry I posted on your 3RR thing, I just stumbled upon it when I came to write this. Anyway now that the Aqsa Mosque and THS articles are fully protected, maybe we should discuss them and set aside any differences and reach a consensus.

<dd>If it's possible sure. As for THS, I want the article not to be vandalised and the intro to be kept NPOV. As for Al Aqsa, I want the article only to focus on the actual mosque on the southern temple mount (or heavy tagging to stay) and also add all sourced materials as with Twain etc. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 18:14, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, I reversed your recent edits because I believe them to have introduced factual errors. In particular:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Temple, not the Temple Mount, is Judaism's holiest site. It is a holy site for Judaism, not necessarily Jews. Many Jews don't believe in holy sites.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>The rabbi responsible for the Kotel is a Haredi rabbi and his opinions Haredi opinions. There are <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Orthodox_0eb6.html" title="Modern Orthodox">Modern Orthodox</a> authorities who permit women's prayer groups, so it would be incorrect and POV to say that Orthodox Judaism as a whole prohibits them.</li>
</ol>
<p>I discussed these issues on the article talk page, <a href="../../../w/o/m/Talk%7EWomen_of_the_Wall_524b.html" title="Talk:Women of the Wall">Talk:Women of the Wall</a>. Please reply there.</p>

<p>Post-Zionist and palestinian historians claim the "traditional Israeli historiography" didn't explain the events the way they happen. "Official Israeli historians" (who were maybe more propagandists than historians) would have built an history for these events. Right. Noted.<br />
They are many references for this in first quality (undiscussed) scholar's works.<br />
As a consequence, isn't their point of view an important information to add to an article. Not to claim that what they say is (or may be) true but only to underline what they say and permits he readers to understand precisely the "size of their (alleged) lie"... (if any)<br />
I think Katz, Schechtman and other pov would deserve a place in all these controversed articles but in a special section&#160;: "Israeli official history".<br />
Their Pov could be given and critics of their pov from other historians (if any) too.<br />
As I think I wrote some months ago (you were not there yet but this received no echo)&#160;:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>if what they claim is (maybe) not true, it is true that it is what they claim.</b><br />
<br /></dd>
</dl>
<p>This information deserves numerous lines in the articles because this is what all Israeli citizens and most western people learned unless they studied the matter deeply.<br />

<p>Benny Morris and Gelber are also Israelis... so it that propoganda as well&#160;? This is of course not true per Katz, Schechtman and the others. What they say is historical study based on facts and witness reports and news reports and protocols, it's not propaganidst. But yes in Palestinian exodus we only inserted this material in the appropriate section of the so called "theory" (which is actually a fact but we didn't push this) that Arab leaders pushed the exodus to happen. It should go back to that section I agree... Israeli official history of course doesn't make much sense for these things, it's of course not Israel's official history at all but historical studies of the events.
