	    <p>Amorite (Egyptian Amurri, Assyrian Amurra or Martu (<i>where? how are these confident identifications arrived at?</i>) is a term (<i>terms should be in quotes</i>) given by the Israelites to the greatest portion (<i>who else then is involved?</i>) of earlier (<i>earlier? than the arrival of the Hebrews probably</i>) highland mountaineer, or hillmen, descendants of Canaan (Gen. 14:7) who inhabited that land. (<i>is this mythic genealogy or ethography or geography or what?</i>) In early Babylonian inscriptions all western lands including Syria and Palestine, were known as "the land of the Amorites." (<i>this could make a good opening statement, if we knew what "early" means</i>) The Amorites were warlike mountain people. They are represented on the Egyptian monuments with fair skins, light hair, blue eyes, (<i>fair skins and blue eyes on "the Egyptian monuments"?</i>) aquiline noses, and pointed beards. (<i>but what are they wearing? but what are they doing? are they prisoners? are they bringing tribute? to whom? Middle Kingdom?</i>) In the Bible, (<i>it's not a book, it's a library</i>) they are supposed (<i>who is doing the supposing? described as? pictured as</i>?) to have been a powerful people of great stature "like the height of the cedars," (<i>good quotes need sources</i>) who had occupied the land east and west of the Jordan river; their king, Og, being described as the last "of the remnant of the giants" (<i>so was the ancestral Canaan a giant?</i>) (Deut. 3:11). <i>What's the actual information here?

<dd>I've now Googled Amurru on Image mode and discovered a cast of a bas-relief at the British Museum that was represented in Wikipedia's text "<a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egyptian</a> monuments with fair <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skin.html" title="Skin">skins</a>, light <a href="../../../h/a/i/Hair.html" title="Hair">hair</a>, blue <a href="../../../e/y/e/Eye.html" title="Eye">eyes</a>, aquiline <a href="../../../n/o/s/Nose.html" title="Nose">noses</a>, and pointed <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beard.html" title="Beard">beards</a>", apparently quoted from Roy Norvill, <i>Giants: The Vanqished Race of Mighty Men</i> Googling Norvill I discover that his fans consider him "an expert in the Hermetic code."

<p>Yeah, this is really crying out for some updating - Middle Eastern archaeology has changed a lot since 1911! The undue focus on the Bible, in particular, is ridiculous considering their much greater importance in Mesopotamian history. But that will take work... I'll see what I can find about Amorite language, anyway. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 05:30, 13 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

If the <i>Jewish Encyclopedia</i> material has been selectively used, the broad hint at the link could be dropped:</p>
<p><i>In Cappadocian Zinčirli inscriptions he is called ì-li a-bi-a 'the god of my father</i> We need to know whose inscription, because this alone doesn't transmit information. Approx. date?</p>
<p><i>represented on the Egyptian monuments with fair skins, light hair, blue eyes, aquiline noses</i> <b>and</b> Blue eyes, eh? okay, we get the race implication, but since males are rendered as dark skinned, females as pale in Egyptian conventions, I just doubt the whole thing (Eaton's 1897?). Are there any Amorites illustrated on an Egyptian relief anywhere on the Web to point at?</p>
<p><i>The god Amurru was identified with the constellation Perseus.</i> With the rest so improved, this passive of non-attribution sticks out worse than ever. Paleoastronomy anyone? ---<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 22:29, 18 Jul 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>quoting the article:</p>
<p>"Though herdsmen, the Amorites were not peaceful pastoralists. They were fierce tribal clansmen who apparently forced themselves into lands they needed to graze their herds. At first the Amorites were merely a regular irritant to the Ur-III empire, but eventually they undermined it to such an extent that the position of last king Ibbi-Sin was weakened to the point that his Elamite subjects were able to over throw his rule."</p>
<p>"Amurru also has storm god features. Like Adad he bears the epithet ramān 'thunderer' and he is even called bāriqu 'hurler of the thunderbolt' and Adad ša a-bu-be 'Adad of the deluge'. Yet his iconography is distinct from that of Adad and he sometimes appears along side Adad with a baton of power or throwstick while Adad bears a conventional thunderbolt."</p>
<hr />
<p>Clearly the Amorites were quite the conquerers as well as shepards and it would seem that their suspected god Amurru was empowered as such, to conquer.</p>
<p>Now for my additions. I've also read that Amurru was described as the leveler of cities and destroyer of peoples. Could it be that for the Amorites, he was a god that both enabled them in battle/conquest as well brought them a good flock. It's possible that both his Adad-like epithets, and his baton of power or throwstick personified him as a conquerer as well as a shepard. It's possible, mind you, it's merely speculation.</p>

<hr />
<p>Although it was long thought that the Amorites invaded the Third Dynasty of Ur, Assyriologists today largely doubt that claim. Much new archaeological and documentary evidence has come to light that showed that enclaves of Amorites existed in various parts of Ur and contributed to the kingdom.</p>
<p>The Amorites were not a clearly dilineated group of people nor were they conquerors at all. There was no concerted invasion from the Syrian desert. Rather, in some parts of the kingdom groups of Amorites simply asserted power in their local residences; the same was happening all over the region, and not just by groups labeled Amorites. The kingdom was already dissintegrating, and as centralized power slowly collapsed, many areas began to reassert independence. I feel that it is relevant to note this new scholarship, and so I have edited the article somewhat. --KTN</p>

<p>Can we get a much clearer re-editing of the information currently concealed in the following text in the article:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The [[Bible|Biblical]] usage appears to show that the more specific "Amorite" and less precise general "[[Canaanite]]" terms were used synonymously, the former being characteristic of [[Jahwist|Judaean]], the latter of [[Elohist|Ephraimite]] and [[deuteronomist|Deuteronomic]] writers as well as the [[Assyria|Assyro]]-[[Babylonia]]ns.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It may take a longer paragraph to disentangle these secret identifications. --<a href="../../../w/e/t/User%7EWetman_82d0.html" title="User:Wetman">Wetman</a> 05:47, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
