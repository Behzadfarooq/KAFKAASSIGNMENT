<p>It is generally accepted that medical torture fundamentally violates <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_ethics.html" title="Medical ethics">medical ethics</a>, which all medical practitioners are expected to adhere to.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippocratic_Oath_ec51.html" title="Hippocratic Oath">Hippocratic Oath</a> makes explicit statements against deliberate harm not in the patient's best interests. These statements are often translated as <i>"I will prescribe regimens for the good of my patients according to my ability and my judgement"</i> and <i>"to never deliberately do harm to anyone, for anyone else's interest."</i> (Note: these statements are formulations of the ethical principles of <b>beneficence</b> and <b>non-maleficence</b>.)</li>
<li>In response to the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_human_experimentation.html" title="Nazi human experimentation">Nazi human experimentation</a> on prisoners, which were declared at the <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg_Trials_3d43.html" title="Nuremberg Trials">Nuremberg Trials</a> to be "crimes against humanity", the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Medical_Association_c33f.html" title="World Medical Association">World Medical Association</a> developed the <a href="../../../d/e/c/Declaration_of_Geneva_e0cd.html" title="Declaration of Geneva">Declaration of Geneva</a> to supplant the dated Hippocratic Oath. The Declaration of Geneva requires medical practitioners to state "[I, the medical practitioner] will maintain the utmost respect for human life from its beginning even under threat and I will not use my medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity".</li>
<li>The Nuremberg Trials also led to the emergence of the <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nuremberg_code.html" title="Nuremberg code">Nuremberg code</a> which explicitly outlines the boundaries of acceptable medical experimentation.</li>
<li>Additionally in response to the Nazi atrocities, the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Fourth_Geneva_Convention_ea40.html" title="Fourth Geneva Convention">Fourth Geneva Convention</a> of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1949.html" title="1949">1949</a> outright prohibits the torture of prisoners of war and other protected non-combatants.</li>

<li>An Israeli medic was convicted of negligence for refusing to treat interrogated Palestinian detainee Mahmud Al-Masri for a burst ulcer, 24 hours before his death on March 6, 1989 at Gaza Prison. It was claimed by pro-Palestinian sources that this constituted medical torture, however this categorisation is disputed by pro-Israeli commentators, and those who consider it dereliction of duty rather than deliberate torture.</li>
<li>In <a href="../../../1/9/7/1978.html" title="1978">1978</a>, "Pisaot menuh" ("Human Experiments") were performed on seventeen <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_prisoner.html" title="Political prisoner">political prisoners</a> held at the infamous prison <a href="../../../t/u/o/Tuol_Sleng_Genocide_Museum_b202.html" title="Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum">Tuol Sleng</a> in <a href="../../../p/h/n/Phnom_Penh_adaa.html" title="Phnom Penh">Phnom Penh</a> under the <a href="../../../k/h/m/Khmer_Rouge_98c5.html" title="Khmer Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a>.</li>

<li>The <a href="../../../s/e/r/SERE_31db.html" title="SERE">SERE</a> ("Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape") program's chief psychologist, Col.

The <i>New Yorker</i> notes that in November, 2001 Banks was detailed to Afghanistan, where he spent four months at <a href="../../../b/a/g/Bagram_Air_Base_0a7e.html" title="Bagram Air Base">Bagram Air Base</a>, "supporting combat operations against Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters".</li>
<li>A 2005 report by <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Rights_Watch_35a7.html" title="Human Rights Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> suggested that torture was routine under the appointed Iraqi government. <a href="http://hrw.org/reports/2005/iraq0105/" class="external text" title="http://hrw.org/reports/2005/iraq0105/" rel="nofollow">Human Rights Watch Report</a></li>
<li>Dr. J.C. Carothers, British colonial Kenyan psychiatrist, has been implicated in designing interrogation of <a href="../../../m/a/u/Mau_Mau_f519.html" title="Mau Mau">Mau Mau</a> prisoners.</li>
