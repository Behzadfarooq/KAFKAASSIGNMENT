<hr />
<p><br />
The north is cold and dismal, where the people are restless and enslaved. They hunger for not only food, but a leader to hear their cries. Suddenly, the name of a man called Moghaddassi paints the walls and streets. People shout his name and join him in a dire quest for freedom. Imagine a man who was a philosoph and a savior to his people. Imagine that this man went through torture and pain for what he believes in. Envision him fighting against all odds to overthrow a government that is corrupted. This man is my father, and a visionary to many Iranians. He was a political reformist who sought to reform the Iranian Monarchy by rallying the north to aid him in his journey. He is what I believe to be a forgotten legend because the government did all they could to cover their tracks and and those who opposed them. We were a family of prestige and wealth. I remember my mother telling me how they would travel the world, or go somewhere like Germany for dinner because they felt like eating chicken. It was the life that so many still dream of today. It was a life I would never know.</p>
<p>My family had fled Iran during the revolution, leaving all the wealth and property. My father passed away when I was only two years old, leaving what he worked so hard for, and a family that loved him so much, including a son that would never see him. I grew up with a mother who has depression, heart disease, diabetes, and addiction to smoking. I grew up with nothing left from my father but stories, letters, and a video tape, where still today, I have not had the heart to look at. It is not because I did not care, but because I knew I could never be what my father was. I grew up as a morbidly obese child, without a care in the world except for the comfort of food and television.</p>
<p>It was a year ago when I realized how critical I was to the survival of my family, and that I could be something more than a person without a soul. My mother had performed some financial mishappenings, and it was then I knew where I stood in life. The story of my father had taught me the potential of my future, and my mother had taught me the consequences of life. I realized that it was because of her I never wanted to smoke, or lie, or steal, but to be a man of ethics and and love because I saw what it had done to her. I want to live my life by living his, helping those in need, because I know that there is enough hate in this world.</p>
<p>I began the goal of helping others by first helping myself. I had gastric bypass surgery, where in less than a year later, I had gone from a size 48 to 38. From there I made sure that I was not a failure to my family, but also to my friends by not allowing themselves to succumb to drugs and hate, but laughter and the feeling of knowing you are cared about and not alone. I want to meet everybody, and play some role in their life, no matter how little the task may be. I realize that my father met an untimely fate, and I know it is my task to fulfill his wish of helping those who need it most. Soon enough I believe, I will watch that tape and see if I have met his dreams.</p>
<p>I study Government and International Politics. I was also a Senator of the Student Government. I had gastric bypass surgery (stomach staple), and went from 352lbs to currently 230lbs in a year. In pursuit of an affectionate woman who has her priorities set, I have found that loyalty from others are incidently hard to come by. Regrettably, I have come to find the woman about whom I had dreamt endlessly only to discover she cannot even remember who I am.</p>
<p><br />
19 now (2006), I am sorrounded by social poisoning (sarcastic and faithless peers), yet enduring with plans to do something bigger with my life. The road is of course uncertain, but from inspiration I hope to one day become an Ambassador and/or work with non-govermental organizations.</p>
