<p>I'd like to discuss your recent revision of my reverts to <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict_7601.html" title="2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict">2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict</a>. I'll try to go point by point.</p>
<ol>
<li>You removed the flag of Lebanon. The title of the article is 2006 Israel-<b>Lebanon</b> conflict, so it seems fully justified to me to retain it. I did not add it, I simply reverted the removal of it.</li>
<li>You reverted three points in the article where I clarified that the New York Times was reporting on an Israeli research group report that was released. Please refer to the article itself<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/05/world/middleeast/05mideast.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/05/world/middleeast/05mideast.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which was already references in the article, which states "In a new report, an Israeli research group says Hezbollah stored weapons in mosques, battled Israelis from inside empty schools, flew white flags while transporting missiles and launched rockets near United Nations monitoring posts. The detailed report on the war was produced by the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Center for Special Studies, a private research group headed by Reuven Erlich, a retired colonel in military intelligence, who worked closely with the Israeli military."</li>
<li>You reverted the inaccurate figures of 20,000 to 30,000 tons of oil, where if you look at the article already cited<a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/09CB9736-6131-403E-A4CA-1033CD1107D5.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/09CB9736-6131-403E-A4CA-1033CD1107D5.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, these numbers are effectively made up. The article lists 12,000 tons, and the other article I added<a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/284404_focussecond10.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/284404_focussecond10.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> lists 15,000.</li>
<li>I added that 25,000 tons of oil had burned at the facility<a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/284404_focussecond10.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/284404_focussecond10.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, in the attempt to explain why the numbers may have been skewed (together these are the size of the <a href="../../../e/x/x/Exxon_Valdez_oil_spill_513d.html" title="Exxon Valdez oil spill">Exxon Valdez oil spill</a>, which was inaccurate prior to and after your revert).</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm reverting your revert of my revert.

No response from Dmcdevit. 24 hours and four minutes is not 24 hours - and 3RR is a precise tool - so <i>time served</i> is enough IMO. Accusation of incivility is "pulled up by the ears", as we say in Russian.</p>

<dd>I'm disappointed by the POV of some users concerned in their remarks. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">User:Patstuart</a>'s claims for "warrior and single purpose" for example are completely false. While I was blocked once for 3RR it was controversial since I saw that as a serious infringement of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. At this time I was involved in the edit-war and accidentally reverted 4 times against someone working against consensus. There was no incivility and I believe you were right in cutting the ban to essentially 12 hours. 48 hours was inappropriate especially since I contacted <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">user:Dmcdevit</a> personally and also apologisied for reverting 4 times and agreed not to revert the article ever again - this even though I never violated <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 22:01, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I humbly apologise and apologised to <a href="../../../e/l/_/User%7EEl_C_6d95.html" title="User:El C">user:El_C</a> for deleting his comment back then here, it was not intentional and it got jumbled up with the request for unblock at the time (I did delete his recent comment over a dispute after he removed my NPOV tag which I found also quite offensive, but I feel we started on the wrong foot there).

<p>Steve Hart now said this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=93771810&amp;oldid=93769548" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=93771810&amp;oldid=93769548" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> - this I don't understand. He's quoting a user saying "I'm not particularly interested in staring into Amoruso's soul. I'm interested in understanding the purported reason for the removal of material" - not sure why. In fact, what happened there was a user who was confused by the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and what is almost a <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">Personal attack</a> of <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">user:Zero0000</a> against me which is exactly what <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Hart_8ceb.html" title="User:Steve Hart">user:Steve Hart</a> is doing right now. In fact, I replied to the user several times and explained the content dispute. I didn't revert either for a long time until I found another verifiable source for something in the issue, posted it, and there was a consencus about it and no wars or any problem. In fact, what Steve Hart quoted is an example of how things should probably work in wikipedia as they were discussed and explained and used sources and civil language (from me) and admitting of one's possible error etc. Strange - here are the replies. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Revisionist_Zionism&amp;diff=76503921&amp;oldid=76492260" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Revisionist_Zionism&amp;diff=76503921&amp;oldid=76492260" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Revisionist_Zionism&amp;diff=88951781&amp;oldid=88950889" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Revisionist_Zionism&amp;diff=88951781&amp;oldid=88950889" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> I It's also troubling that HE is accusing others (some of the most respected good standing wikipedians and adminstrators of wikipedia) of bias when he was involved in the edit-war I posted above and which constituted 90% or so from his edits in the last months before he seemingly took a break from wikipedia... <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 09:26, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>removing the flag of Lebanon from the article 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict</li>
</ul>
<p>Too bad Steve Hart didn't (hmm.) go a bit further and saw that the user who placed the Lebanon flag admitted he was mistaken. Lebanon wasn't a combatant in the conflict and therefore the flag was out of place. The editor who placed the flag removed it himself. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict&amp;diff=92882662&amp;oldid=92882253" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2006_Israel-Lebanon_conflict&amp;diff=92882662&amp;oldid=92882253" rel="nofollow">[14]</a></p>
<ul>
<li>page move, moving Sirhan Sirhan (militant) to Sirhan Sirhan (murderer)</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, I did. Murder is NOT <a href="../../../w/t/a/WP%7EWTA_2564.html" title="WP:WTA">WP:WTA</a> as far as I know concerning someone who murdered a whole family. Perhaps Steve Hart can explain us how is such a person a militant&#160;? A militant could belong to an organization like HAMAS or Islamic Jihad MAYBE but this person was acting SOLO. So perhaps Steve Hart wants us to change the definitons of Criminal Law&#160;? This page was not a page in contention and no edit war or reverts took place.</p>
<ul>
<li>deleting material properly sourced to BBC: [134], ABC News: [135], PBS, others; blanking text in references: [136]</li>
</ul>
<p>Did I&#160;? I would like to remind Steve Hart that Blanking = vandalism and that's harsh accusation <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">incivil one</a> and he should avoid that ASAP. This was according to policy, another banned user pushing this, not Timshifter apparently possibly (who got 3RR for this) but BlueDome (actually another sock-puppet of the banned user in question ) and policy explained here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taba_Summit&amp;diff=92731694&amp;oldid=92203167" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taba_Summit&amp;diff=92731694&amp;oldid=92203167" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> and here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taba_Summit&amp;diff=91774716&amp;oldid=91755921" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Taba_Summit&amp;diff=91774716&amp;oldid=91755921" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> by many users. User was acting against consensus of atleast 4 users in good standing.</p>
<ul>
<li>a tendency of being uncivil on talk pages, e.g. [139] [140]</li>
</ul>
<p>none of the two example seem to be incivil. Actually, the Paranoia remark seems very light-hearted and a <a href="../../../l/o/v/WP%7ELOVE_328a.html" title="WP:LOVE">WP:LOVE</a> behaviour if anything, just jokingly. If someone got offended by it, I'd apologise of course. In fact, like Steve Hart said I (wrongly it seems) was particulary civil to him too even though he deleted material of mine. Seems strange allegation. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Palestinian_exodus&amp;diff=70330221&amp;oldid=70328663" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Palestinian_exodus&amp;diff=70330221&amp;oldid=70328663" rel="nofollow">[17]</a></p>
<ul>
<li>consistently removing warnings on own talk page, e.g: [141] [142], including removing an olive branch response by one editor addressed not to him, but to a third editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ah, the ol' "don't remove from your page" think. Have you looked on other user talk pages at any chance&#160;? Are you seriously pushing this allegation&#160;? Note that the alleged olive branch response was made by <a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalestineRemembered_d4da.html" title="User:PalestineRemembered">user:PalestineRemembered</a> a user now banned for 1 month for disruptive behavoiour on people's user pages. Seems Hart is missing a whole lot of information here. The timeshifter allegation was addressed already above - it was completely inappropriate and therefore removed.</p>
<ul>
<li>and finally, what I read, perhaps wrongfully...</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, you read that wrongfully. The topic on hand was how leads should be written for country articles. I suggested we try to reinstate some format into this in the name of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. I feel it's my right to discuss such issues with my fellow wikipedians at the project page&#160;? There was no malice or ill-intent there, just concern to make Israel on par with other country articles.</p>
<p>Steve Hart notes that he was involved in a dispute with me back in August. That's true. In fact, this seems to be what it's all about. Steve Hart not just disputed but edit-warred over that page and reverted constantly and was also warned about it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Steve_Hart&amp;diff=70529999&amp;oldid=70449788" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Steve_Hart&amp;diff=70529999&amp;oldid=70449788" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>. He also wanted to ban me from the head-start which was almost a threat and perhaps a violation of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> - "<i>Frankly, I'm not sure you will be allowed to edit for much longer if you are to go on like this</i>" and didn't seem to be concerned of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> issues <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Amoruso&amp;diff=70297456&amp;oldid=70297103" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Amoruso&amp;diff=70297456&amp;oldid=70297103" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. He says he already mentioned something bad about me in August right when I was a newbie but forgot to say I refuted his claims<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_massacres_committed_during_the_1948_Arab-Israeli_war&amp;diff=69266940&amp;oldid=69252906" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_massacres_committed_during_the_1948_Arab-Israeli_war&amp;diff=69266940&amp;oldid=69252906" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. Finally, his repeated violations of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> saying that other users are biased towards me for political reasons even though this has just been contradicted by a good faith editor who disagrees with my political opinions completely and utterly.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=93787343&amp;oldid=93787303" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=93787343&amp;oldid=93787303" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> Another proof of Steve Hart's agenda which revolved again over his war edit in August can be found again on this noticeboard. Steve Hart violated <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> (I shall file him a complaint over that because it seems repetitve) by saying "Let me be perfectly clear: There's no reasoning with these guys.

<p>I'm sorry you felt that way and I hope you change your opinion in the future. While a lot of my edits have involved support of Israel of course in conflict related articles, I feel that I also contributed in many non conflict articles about Israel and other issues like footballers and it's not just "one purpose" which sounds offensive to me.

<dd>Ah. Thanks for your response. You are completely correct; I pushed too hard in this situation, and I should have, at least, said something to your talk page first. I am sorry, I was too quick to judge; I can only ask your forgiveness for this offense.

<p>Hi Amoruso: I noticed you created Category:Synagogues in Australia that does not have any articles put into the category. The basic rule is that categories should <i>not</i> be created if there are no articles that go into them. Empty categories are frequently put up for deletion as "empty or orphaned categories" so not only only are you wasting your efforts but you creating false impressions by creating "ghost categories" that should not exist. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 07:11, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This seems to be from August but my guess is that it wasn't empty before, i probably stumbled upon an article about an Australian synagogue and created the list, then that article was removed from the category/deleted. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 20:24, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Amoruso, I've reported you for 3RR on the Bernadotte article <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_3RR_dc8f.html#User:Amoruso_reported_by_User:jd2718_.28Result:.29" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RR#User:Amoruso reported by User:jd2718 (Result:)</a> While you have not violated the letter of the rule, the rule does not grant 3 reverts every 24 hours, which is what you appear to be doing.</p>
<p>Discussion is more than putting a message on the talk page showing why you think you are correct, and following that with a revert. My sense is that if you revert yourself and come to the talk page to actually talk (not just to provide cover for a revert) a block will be less likely. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 15:07, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, you stated that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_Hinduism_f58f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Hinduism">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Hinduism</a> only dealt with the welcome template. You are right in that now everyone is only trying acheive consensus on the welcome template, because it is much more difficult to reach consensus on the others at the moment. If you look in the archives, you will realise that the first part of the discussion dealt with all them and many of the Hindu editors objected strongly on the article templates but compromised with those sympathetic with the Jews etc. that an explanation of the Swastik can be given to prevent further misunderstandings. Also, it has been shown again and again that the most holy symbol in Hinduism <b>is the Swastik</b> and <b>not the Aum</b> which is a syllable. The reverse is actually true, more people are supprting the removal of the Swastik on the welcome template than the article templates.

<ol>
<li>The Israelis and Palestinians "share much in common." I think this is misleading since they have two completely distinct cultures.</li>
<li>"The conflict has complicated ancient roots." I think the statement is misleading and suggests that there was an Israeli-Palestinian (or Jewish-Arab) conflict over land in ancient times.</li>
<li>The early Zionists "expressed their desire to re-create a state for the Jewish people." I think the word "create" was more accurate.</li>

<p>Hi Amoruso. I noticed that you changed the introduction sentence of this article to include Israel: "The Shebaa Farms is a small area of disputed ownership located at the border of <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, <a href="../../../s/y/r/Syria.html" title="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon.html" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>." My question is whether this is accurate. The reason I ask is because the map on the articles page doesn't show the region extending to the Israeli border. Thoughts? — <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorge.Saliba_41d6.html" title="User:George.Saliba">George Saliba</a> <sup>[<a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorge.Saliba_c664.html" title="User talk:George.Saliba">talk</a>]</sup> 03:15, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi again Amoruso. I'm guessing you're out. What do you think of changing this to "The Shebaa Farms is a small area of disputed ownership located at the border between <a href="../../../l/e/b/Lebanon.html" title="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> and the <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israeli</a>-occupied <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golan_Heights_4b58.html" title="Golan Heights">Golan Heights</a>."?

<dd>Hi again. Since I didn't hear back from you in the last three days, I've gone ahead and made this change. I also added Syria at the end, producing what I believe is an accurate representation of the dispute while including all three countries (which I think was your intended meaning). The new sentence reads: "The Shebaa Farms is a small area of disputed ownership located at the border between Lebanon and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in Syria." If you have any concerns with this wording, please feel free to drop by my Talk page.

<p>Shalom aleichem... I'm doing some work on the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> article in the hopes of bringing it up the featured status. Although I've been taking a break from the article in the past couple weeks, I went to continue where I left off. In particular, I reached a roadblock at the <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html#Demographics" title="Jerusalem">Demographics section</a> of the article because <a href="http://www.cbs.gov.il/hodaot2006n/11_06_106b.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.cbs.gov.il/hodaot2006n/11_06_106b.pdf" rel="nofollow">a major source</a> (a document from the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics) is entirely in Hebrew. I have searched for an English translation and have yet to find one. However, I see, according to your user page, that you are fluent in Hebrew and decently-skilled in English. So, I was wondering if you could translate the document or, if that's too time-consuming (I have a feeling it might be), just pick out the important facts and add them to the Jerusalem article as well as confirm the figures already mentioned in the article. If you don't have the time to do that, that is perfectly fine; just let me know.
