	    <p><b>History of the Jews in the Land of Israel</b> begins mainly from the ancient Israelites (also known as <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrews.html" title="Hebrews">Hebrews</a>), who settled in the <a href="../../../l/a/n/Land_of_Israel_af97.html" title="Land of Israel">land of Israel</a>.

<p>Jewish tradition holds that after 40 years of wandering in the desert, the Israelites arrived to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canaan.html" title="Canaan">Canaan</a> and conquered it under the command of <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joshua.html" title="Joshua">Joshua</a>, dividing the land among the twelve tribes. For a period of time, the united twelve tribes were led by a series of rulers known as <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judges.html" title="Judges">Judges</a>. After this period, an Israelite monarchy was established under <a href="../../../s/a/u/Saul_the_King_e3f5.html" title="Saul the King">Saul</a>, and continued under King <a href="../../../d/a/v/David.html" title="David">David</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon.html" title="Solomon">Solomon</a>. King David conquered <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerusalem.html" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> (first a Canaanite, then a Jebusite town) and made it his capital. After <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solomon.html" title="Solomon">Solomon</a>'s reign the nation split into two kingdoms, <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel.html" title="Israel">Israel</a>, consisting of ten of the tribes (in the north), and <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingdom_of_Judah_501d.html" title="Kingdom of Judah">Judah</a>, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin (in the south). Israel was conquered by the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assyria.html" title="Assyria">Assyrian</a> ruler Shalmaneser V in the <a href="../../../8/t/h/8th_century_BCE_e07b.html" title="8th century BCE">8th century BCE</a>.

<p>The kingdom of Judah was conquered by a <a href="../../../b/a/b/Babylon.html" title="Babylon">Babylonian</a> army in the early <a href="../../../6/t/h/6th_century_BCE_1836.html" title="6th century BCE">6th century BCE</a>. The Judahite elite was exiled to Babylon, but later at least a part of them returned to their homeland, led by prophets <a href="../../../e/z/r/Ezra.html" title="Ezra">Ezra</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/h/Nehemiah.html" title="Nehemiah">Nehemiah</a>, after the subsequent conquest of Babylonia by the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persians.html" title="Persians">Persians</a>. Jews were allowed to return with the Temple vessels that the Babylonians had taken. Construction of the <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Temple_74d1.html" title="Second Temple">Second Temple</a> was completed under the spiritual leadership of the Prophets <a href="../../../h/a/g/Haggai.html" title="Haggai">Haggai</a> and <a href="../../../z/e/c/Zechariah.html" title="Zechariah">Zechariah</a>.</p>
<p>At this point there was the formation of Jewish political-religious factions, the most important of which would later be called <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadduccees.html" title="Sadduccees">Sadduccees</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharisees.html" title="Pharisees">Pharisees</a>.</p>

<p>After the Persians were defeated by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>, his demise, and the division of Alexander's empire among his generals, the <a href="../../../s/e/l/Seleucid_Kingdom_c690.html" title="Seleucid Kingdom">Seleucid Kingdom</a> was formed. A deterioration of relations between hellenized Jews and religious Jews led the Seleucid king <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antiochus_IV_Epiphanes_2f84.html" title="Antiochus IV Epiphanes">Antiochus IV Epiphanes</a> to impose decrees banning certain <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Jewish religious rites and traditions</a>. Consequently, the orthodox Jews revolted under the leadership of the <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasmonean.html" title="Hasmonean">Hasmonean</a> family, (also known as the <a href="../../../m/a/c/Maccabees.html" title="Maccabees">Maccabees</a>). This revolt eventually led to the formation of an independent Jewish kingdom, known as the <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasmonaean_Dynasty_1bde.html" title="Hasmonaean Dynasty">Hasmonaean Dynasty</a>, which lasted from <a href="../../../1/6/5/165_BCE_c22e.html" title="165 BCE">165 BCE</a> to <a href="../../../6/3/_/63_BCE_2445.html" title="63 BCE">63 BCE</a>. The Maccabees purified the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_Temple_973a.html" title="Jewish Temple">Jewish Temple</a> in Jerusalem, an event that to this day is celebrated on by Jews on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chanukkah.html" title="Chanukkah">Chanukkah</a>. The Hasmonean Dynasty eventually disintegrated as a result of civil war between the sons of <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salome_Alexandra_aa42.html" title="Salome Alexandra">Salome Alexandra</a>, <a href="../../../h/y/r/Hyrcanus_II_6681.html" title="Hyrcanus II">Hyrcanus II</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/i/Aristobulus_II_b023.html" title="Aristobulus II">Aristobulus II</a>. The people, who did not want to be governed by a king but by theocratic clergy, made appeals in this spirit to the Roman authorities. A Roman campaign of conquest and annexation, led by <a href="../../../p/o/m/Pompey.html" title="Pompey">Pompey</a>, soon followed.</p>
<p>Judea under Roman rule was at first an independent Jewish kingdom, but gradually the rule over Judea became less and less Jewish, until it became under the direct rule of Roman administration (and renamed the <i><a href="../../../i/u/d/Iudaea_Province_84e3.html" title="Iudaea Province">Iudaea Province</a></i>), which was often callous and brutal in its treatment of its Judean subjects. In <a href="../../../6/6/_/66.html" title="66">66 CE</a>, Judeans began to revolt against the Roman rulers of Judea. The revolt was defeated by the Roman emperors <a href="../../../v/e/s/Vespasian.html" title="Vespasian">Vespasian</a> and <a href="../../../t/i/t/Titus_Flavius_80ae.html" title="Titus Flavius">Titus Flavius</a>. The Romans destroyed much of the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_in_Jerusalem_e1a8.html" title="Temple in Jerusalem">Temple in Jerusalem</a> and, according to some accounts, stole artifacts from the temple, such as the <a href="../../../m/e/n/Menorah.html" title="Menorah">Menorah</a>. Altgoether, 1,100,000 Jews perished during the revolt and another 97,000 were taken captive.</p>
<p>Major battles were in <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masada.html" title="Masada">Masada</a> and in <a href="../../../g/a/m/Gamla.html" title="Gamla">Gamla</a>. Gamla was the disrict capital of the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golan_Heights_4b58.html" title="Golan Heights">Golan Heights</a> first established by the last king of the Hasmonean dynasty. Gamla's citizens saw their battle as directly connected to Jerusalem and fiercely defended their stronghold. Eventually, all of the 9000 city's residents were killed. Both historical sites of Masada and Gamla have been excavated and are frequently visited in the modern <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_of_Israel_88e9.html" title="State of Israel">State of Israel</a>.</p>
<p>Judeans continued to live in their land in significant numbers, and were allowed to practice their religion, until the <a href="../../../2/n/d/2nd_century.html" title="2nd century">2nd century</a> when <a href="../../../s/e/p/Septimius_Severus_daeb.html" title="Septimius Severus">Julius Severus</a> ravaged Judea while putting down the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_Kokhba_revolt_30ea.html" title="Bar Kokhba revolt">Bar Kokhba revolt</a>. 985 villages were destroyed. Banished from Jerusalem, the Jewish population now centred on Galilee.</p>
<p>This was also the time of <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schisms_among_the_Jews_9486.html#Break-offs:_Samaritans_and_Christians" title="Schisms among the Jews">Schism between Judaism and Christianity</a>. Many <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christians</a> considered the new religion to <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supersessionism.html" title="Supersessionism">supersede Judaism</a>.

<p>In 359 <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillel_II_0ba6.html" title="Hillel II">Hillel II</a> created <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_calendar.html" title="Jewish calendar">Jewish calendar</a> based on the <a href="../../../l/u/n/Lunar.html" title="Lunar">lunar</a> year.

However, danger threatened the participants in that sanction and the messengers who communicated their decisions to distant congregations.

<p>Jews at this time in Israel were living under the oppressive rule of the <a href="../../../b/y/z/Byzantines.html" title="Byzantines">Byzantines</a> under whom there were two more Jewish revolts and three <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samaritan.html" title="Samaritan">Samaritan</a> revolts. Under the oppression, Jews still lived in atleast 43 Jewish communities in Palestine: 12 towns on the coast, in the Negev, and east of the Jordan, and 31 villages in Galilee and in the Jordan valley.</p>
<p>In 438 The Empress <a href="../../../l/i/c/Licinia_Eudoxia_7591.html" title="Licinia Eudoxia">Eudocia</a> removed the ban on Jews' praying at the <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_Mount_9e35.html" title="Temple Mount">Temple site</a> and the heads of the Community in Galilee issued a call "to the great and mighty people of the Jews": "Know that the end of the exile of our people has come"!</p>

<p>In 638 CE, the Byzantine Empire lost control of the Mideast. The Arab <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Empire_8981.html" title="Islamic Empire">Islamic Empire</a> under <a href="../../../c/a/l/Caliph_Omar_85bb.html" title="Caliph Omar">Caliph Omar</a> conquered Jerusalem and the lands of <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesopotamia.html" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Syria_3fec.html" title="History of Syria">Syria</a>, Palaestina, and Egypt. Under the various rules, Jews suffered and moved from driven from villages, to towns to coastal towns being reduced in numbers due to massacres. Nevertheless, the Jews still controlled much of the commerce in Palestine. The Jews worked as assayers of coins, dyers, tanners and bankers in the community.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../n/i/q/Niqqud.html" title="Niqqud">niqqud</a> was invented in Tiberias. The Jews defended Jerusalem and Haifa against the Crusaders in 1099. At the time, there were Jewish communities throughout the country which included Jerusalem, Tiberias, Ramleh, Ashkelon, Caesarea, and Gaza. <a href="../../../y/e/h/Yehuda_Halevi_33b1.html" title="Yehuda Halevi">Yehuda Halevi</a> famously makes his trip to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Jews almost single-handedly defended <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haifa.html" title="Haifa">Haifa</a> against the Crusaders, holding out in the besieged town for a whole month (June-July 1099). At this time, there were Jewish communities all over the country. 50 of them are known by name and include Jerusalem, Tiberias, Ramleh, Ashkelon, Caesarea, and Gaza. Along with the Arabs and the Turks, the Jews vigorously defended Jerusalem. When the city fell, the Crusaders gathered the Jews in a synagogue and burned them.</p>
<p>Jews were not allowed to hold land in the Crusader period but concentrated their efforts on the commerce in the coastal towns during times of quiescence. Most of them were artisans: glassblowers in <a href="../../../s/i/d/Sidon.html" title="Sidon">Sidon</a>, furriers and dyers in Jerusalem.</p>

He wrote that in 1165 he visited Jerusalem and went up on to the Temple Mount and prayed in the "great, holy house". <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Maimonides established a yearly holiday for himself and his sons, the 6th of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheshvan.html" title="Cheshvan">Cheshvan</a>, commemorating the day he went up to pray on the Temple Mount, and another, the the 9th of Cheshvan, commemorating the day he merited to pray at the <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs_442d.html" title="Cave of the Patriarchs">Cave of the Patriarchs</a> in <a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebron.html" title="Hebron">Hebron</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/1/4/1141.html" title="1141">1141</a> <a href="../../../y/e/h/Yehuda_Halevi_33b1.html" title="Yehuda Halevi">Yehuda Halevi</a> issued a call to the Jews to emigrate to the land of Israel and took on the long journey himself. After a stormy passage from <a href="../../../c/%C3%B3/r/C%C3%B3rdoba.html" title="Córdoba">Córdoba</a>, he arrived in Egyptian <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandria.html" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, where he was enthusiastically greeted by friends and admirers. At <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damietta.html" title="Damietta">Damietta</a>, he had to struggle against the promptings of his own heart, and the pleadings of his friend Ḥalfon ha-Levi, that he remain in <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egypt.html" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>; which also was Jewish soil, and free from intolerant oppression. He, however resisted the temptation to remain there, and started on the tedious land route, trodden of old by the Israelite wanderers in the desert. Again he is met with, worn-out, with broken heart and whitened hair, in <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyre_%28Lebanon%29_aa4b.html" title="Tyre (Lebanon)">Tyre</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damascus.html" title="Damascus">Damascus</a>. Jewish legend relates that as he came near Jerusalem, over-powered by the sight of the Holy City, he sang his most beautiful elegy, the celebrated "Zionide," "Zion ha-lo Tish'ali." At that instant, he was ridden down and killed by an <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a>, who dashed forth from a gate.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_History_of_the_Jews_in_the_Land_of_Israel_291c.html" title="Edit section: Mamluk Period">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Mamluk Period</span></h2>
<p>In the years 1260-1516, Palestine was part of the Empire of the <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mamluks.html" title="Mamluks">Mamluks</a> who ruled first from <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkey.html" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, then from Egypt. War and uprisings, bloodshed and destruction followed. Jews suffered persecution and humiliation but the surviving records cite atleast 30 Jewish urban and rural communities at the opening of the 16th century.</p>
<p>A notable event during the period was the settlement of <a href="../../../n/a/c/Nachmanides.html" title="Nachmanides">Nachmanides</a> in the Old City of Jerusalem in <a href="../../../1/2/6/1267.html" title="1267">1267</a> which since then a continuous Jewish presence existed in Jerusalem until modern day occupation of <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan.html" title="Jordan">Jordan</a> in 1948. Nahmanides then settled at <a href="../../../a/c/r/Acre.html" title="Acre">Acre</a>, where he was very active in spreading Jewish learning, which was at that time very much neglected in the Holy Land. He gathered a circle of pupils around him, and people came in crowds, even from the district of the Euphrates, to hear him. <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karaite_Judaism_18eb.html" title="Karaite Judaism">Karaites</a> were said to have attended his lectures, among them being Aaron ben Joseph the Elder, who later became one of the greatest <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karaite.html" title="Karaite">Karaite</a> authorities. Shortly after his arrival in Jerusalem he addressed a letter to his son Nahman, in which he described the desolation of the Holy City, where there were at that time only two Jewish inhabitants — two brothers, dyers by trade. In a later letter from Acre he counsels his son to cultivate humility, which he considers to be the first of virtues. In another, addressed to his second son, who occupied an official position at the Castilian court, Nahmanides recommends the recitation of the daily prayers and warns above all against immorality. Nahmanides died after having passed the age of seventy-six, and his remains were interred at <a href="../../../h/a/i/Haifa.html" title="Haifa">Haifa</a>, by the grave of <a href="../../../y/e/c/Yechiel_of_Paris_6377.html" title="Yechiel of Paris">Yechiel of Paris</a>. Yechiel Yechiel <a href="../../../a/l/i/Aliyah.html" title="Aliyah">emigrated</a> to the Acre, Israel in <a href="../../../1/2/6/1260.html" title="1260">1260</a>, along with his son and a large group of followers<a href="http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/places/acco.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/places/acco.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.lookstein.org/resources/bionotes.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lookstein.org/resources/bionotes.pdf" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> There he established the Tamudic academy <i>Midrash haGadol d'Paris</i>.<a href="http://www.jewishhistory.com/jh.php?id=AdditionalReadings&amp;content=content/segal_ch17" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jewishhistory.com/jh.php?id=AdditionalReadings&amp;content=content/segal_ch17" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> He is believed to have died there between 1265 and 1268.</p>

<p>Thirty Jewish communities exist at the time in Haifa, Sh’chem, Hebron, Ramleh, Jaffa, Gaza, Jerusalem, and many in the north.</p>
<p>Tzfat/<a href="../../../s/a/f/Safed.html" title="Safed">Safed</a> became a spiritual centre. <a href="../../../k/a/b/Kabbalah.html" title="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a> flourished among <a href="../../../s/e/f/Sefardic.html" title="Sefardic">Sefardic</a> Jews in Safed even before the arrival of <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Luria_e87d.html" title="Isaac Luria">Isaac Luria</a>, its most famous resident. The great <a href="../../../y/o/s/Yosef_Karo_f151.html" title="Yosef Karo">Yosef Karo</a>, author of the <i>Shulchan Arukh</i> was part of the Tzfat school of Kabbalah. <a href="../../../s/h/l/Shlomo_Alkabetz_9340.html" title="Shlomo Alkabetz">Shlomo Alkabetz</a>, author of the famous L'cha Dodi, taught there. His disciple <a href="../../../m/o/s/Moses_ben_Jacob_Cordovero_549a.html" title="Moses ben Jacob Cordovero">Moses ben Jacob Cordovero</a> authored <i>Sefer Pardes Rimonim</i>, an organized, exhaustive compilation of kabbalistic teachings on a variety of subjects up to that point. Rabbi Cordovero headed the Academy of Tzfat until his death, when Isaac Luria, also known as the Ari, rose to prominence. Rabbi Moshe's disciple Eliyahu De Vidas authored the classic work, <i>Reishit Chochma</i>, combining kabbalistic and mussar teachings. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaim_Vital_2658.html" title="Chaim Vital">Chaim Vital</a> also studied under Rabbi Cordovero, but with the arrival of Rabbi Luria became his main disciple. Vital claimed to be the only one authorized to transmit the Ari's teachings, though other disciples also published books presenting Luria's teachings.</p>
<p>In Safed, the Jews developed a number of branches of trade, especially in grain, spices, and cloth. They specialised once again in the dyeing trade. Lying halfway between <a href="../../../d/a/m/Damascus.html" title="Damascus">Damascus</a> and Sidon on the Mediterranean coast, Safed gained special importance in the commercial relations in the area. The 8,000 or 10,000 Jews in Safed in 1555 grew to 20,000 or 30,000 by the end of the century.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/5/6/1569.html" title="1569">1569</a>, the <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radbaz.html" title="Radbaz">Radbaz</a> moved to Jerusalem, but did not stay there long, because of the burdensome taxes that the Turkish government had imposed upon Jews. He settled in Safed, where he became an active member of the beth din presided over by Yosef Karo, who held him in great esteem.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/5/7/1577.html" title="1577">1577</a> A Hebrew <a href="../../../p/r/i/Printing_press.html" title="Printing press">printing press</a> is established in Safed. It's the first press in Palestine and the first in Asia.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/7/5/1759.html" title="1759">1759</a>, a massive earthquake destroys much of Safed killing 2000 people with 190 Jews among the dead.</p>
<p>The disciples of the <a href="../../../v/i/l/Vilna_Gaon_9c31.html" title="Vilna Gaon">Vilna Gaon</a> settled in the land of Israel almost a decade after the arrival of two of his pupils, R. Hayim of Vilna and R. Israel b. Samuel of Shklov. In all there were three groups of the Gaon's students which emigrated to the land of Israel. They formed the basis of the <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashkenazi.html" title="Ashkenazi">Ashkenazi</a> communities of Jerusalem and Safed, setting up what was known as the Kollel <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perushim.html" title="Perushim">Perushim</a>. Their arrival encouraged an Ashkenazi revival in Jerusalem, which until this time was mostly Sephardi. Many of the descendents of the disciples became leading figures in modern Israeli society. The Gaon himself also set forth with his pupils to Israel, but for an unknown reason he turned back and returned to Vilna where he died soon after.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../s/i/e/Siege_of_Acre_%281799%29_1145.html" title="Siege of Acre (1799)">siege of Acre</a> in 1799, <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon.html" title="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> prepared a proclamation declaring a <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_state.html" title="Jewish state">Jewish state</a> in Palestine, though he did not issue it. The siege was lost to the British, however, and the plan was never carried out.</p>
