<p>On <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stardate.html" title="Stardate">stardate</a> 3372.7, Mr. Spock, first officer of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starship.html" title="Starship">starship</a> <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starship_Enterprise_3c8f.html" title="Starship Enterprise">USS <i>Enterprise</i></a>, requests an abrupt leave of absence to his home planet of <a href="../../../v/u/l/Vulcan_%28Star_Trek%29_bdbc.html" title="Vulcan (Star Trek)">Vulcan</a> after displaying irrational behavior for several days. <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_McCoy_5719.html" title="Leonard McCoy">Dr. McCoy</a> witnesses one of Spock's outbursts, including the throwing of a bowl of Vulcan plomeek soup specially prepared for him by <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christine_Chapel_cd31.html" title="Christine Chapel">Nurse Chapel</a>, and agrees Spock needs some "time off".</p>
<p>Captain <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_T._Kirk_07e0.html" title="James T. Kirk">Kirk</a> is baffled by the strange behavior and Spock's unwillingness to tell him more than "I need rest", but honors Spock's request and diverts the <i>Enterprise</i> to Vulcan. Soon however, Kirk receives a priority signal with orders to proceed to <a href="../../../a/l/t/Altair.html" title="Altair">Altair</a> VI to represent the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Federation_of_Planets_abb7.html" title="United Federation of Planets">Federation</a> at an inauguration ceremony for the planet's new president. Kirk tells Spock his leave will have to be delayed. Later, Kirk asks Mr. Chekov how long it would take to get to Altair if they diverted to Vulcan just long enough to drop off Mr. Spock; Chekov replies that Spock has already ordered a course change to Vulcan.</p>
<p>Kirk confronts Spock, who says he has no memory of having changed the order. Kirk orders him to report to <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sickbay.html" title="Sickbay">sickbay</a> for a full examination. Once there, Dr. McCoy discovers Spock's blood chemistry is extremely active and has the presence of unknown hormones. If the condition persists, Spock will die in eight days from the physical and psychological stress. Spock does not wish to discuss what is currently affecting him, but Kirk demands an explanation.</p>
<p>Seemingly embarrassed, Spock informs that his condition is called <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pon_farr.html" title="Pon farr">Pon farr</a>, a very personal biological syndrome that all Vulcan males painfully endure periodically throughout their adult life. During this time, they must join with their wives, or die. Spock compares his need to return to Vulcan to the need for eel birds of Regulus to return every eleven years to the caverns where they hatched, and also to <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salmon.html" title="Salmon">salmon</a> of <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earth.html" title="Earth">Earth</a> who must return to the stream where they were born to spawn. Kirk gets the idea that it is essentially Spock's mating season.</p>
<p>Kirk contacts <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_Komack_ae1a.html" title="Admiral Komack">Admiral Komack</a> at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfleet.html" title="Starfleet">Starfleet</a> Command Sector 9, and requests permission to divert to Vulcan. The Admiral denies permission, but Kirk ignores the order, arguing there are already two other <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starship.html" title="Starship">starships</a> attending the Altair VI ceremony. Spock seems to calm down once he learns Kirk is doing what he can.</p>
<p>The <i>Enterprise</i> finally arrives at Vulcan, and Spock invites Kirk and Dr. McCoy to accompany him to the surface. Once there, Kirk comments on Vulcan's extremely harsh environment and its atmosphere which is thinner than Earth's.</p>
<p>Spock explains to them that Vulcans are married as children with the understanding that they will fulfill this commitment when they become adults. His bride <a href="../../../t/27/p/T%27Pring_4874.html" title="T'Pring">T'Pring</a>, who was betrothed to him at the age of 7, awaits him. He must enter <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kunat_kalifee.html" title="Kunat kalifee">Kunat kalifee</a>, his family's traditional place of the Vulcan marriage ceremony.</p>
<p><a href="../../../t/27/p/T%27Pau_%28Star_Trek%29_0af5.html" title="T'Pau (Star Trek)">T'Pau</a>, a highly respected member of Vulcan society, and best known as the only person to ever turn down a seat in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Federation_of_Planets_abb7.html" title="United Federation of Planets">Federation</a> Council, arrives to conduct the ceremony.</p>

<p>T'Pring arrives accompanied by Stonn, a pure-blooded Vulcan, who is obviously her lover, and invokes kal-if-fee, her customary right to a physical challenge between Spock and Stonn. But instead, she picks Kirk to be her challenger to fight Spock. The duel pains Spock, and he asks that T'Pau forbid it because Kirk "does not understand, he does not know", but T'Pau allows it. She tells Kirk to decide, telling him another champion will be selected if he declines. Kirk accepts the challenge, thinking he can let Spock win — then discovers that this is a fight to the death.</p>
<p>Regardless of Spock's condition, he displays superior strength and agility. Kirk is weakened by Vulcan's heat and thinner atmosphere and must struggle harder against Spock's strength. McCoy objects, telling T'Pau that Kirk is seriously disadvantaged, and suggests he inject Kirk with a tri-ox compound to compensate. T'Pau allows the injection. The combat continues and Spock garrotes Kirk with a traditional weapon, at which point McCoy pronounces the Captain dead and has his body beamed back to the <i>Enterprise</i>.</p>
<p>With the battle over, Spock now realizes what has happened. He gives up his claim on T'Pring and sadly returns to the ship. He announces his intention to resign from Starfleet and submit himself to whatever consequences await him for killing Kirk. However, he finds his Captain alive and well and expresses overt joy (unusual for a normally emotionless Vulcan). McCoy and Kirk then explain that McCoy actually injected the Captain with a neuroparalyzer drug that simulated death but merely knocked him out. Spock says that when he thought he had killed the Captain, he found that he had lost all desire for T'Pring, and the madness was gone. Furthermore, Kirk is let off the hook for disobeying orders when Starfleet retroactively grants permission to divert to Vulcan at T'Pau's request.</p>

<li>A photo of T'Pring as a child was altered so that the previously flat color behind her was replaced by a garden.</li>
<li>A panoramic shot of Vulcan's surface has been created showing the characters walking across a stone archway to the temple which is atop a massive spire, and reminiscent of the temple seen in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek_IV%7E_The_Voyage_Home_83cd.html" title="Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home">Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</a></i>.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/o/Amok_Time_42b6.html" title="Edit section: Trivia">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Trivia</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Filming on the episode was completed on <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_19.html" title="June 19">June 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1967.html" title="1967">1967</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The idea that the <i>pon farr</i> occurs once every seven years was never spoken in the aired episode. It may have been in Theodore Sturgeon's original script and cut along with numerous other details. Stephen Whitfield's book <i>The Making of Star Trek</i>, published in 1967, quotes <a href="../../../d/2E/c/D.C._Fontana_eb50.html" title="D.C. Fontana">D.C. Fontana</a> as follows: "The specific time interval between these occurrences varies from male to male and by other circumstances. The average is about once every seven Earth years when a Vulcan is separated from his people as is Spock, more often if living among his own kind." Fan critics often comment on the fact that Spock lives through <i>pon farr</i> despite not having consummated his marriage; however, Spock says himself that the madness left him after the combat, when he "killed" Kirk.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In subsequent versions of <i>Star Trek</i> the mating drive is specifically said to occur once every seven years. D.C. Fontana, in her novel <i>Vulcan's Glory</i>, shows that Vulcans can have sex together at any time, but that the <i>pon farr</i> is the fertility cycle. Although Star Trek novels are usually considered non-canon, many fans respect Fontana very highly for her early work on shaping our image of Vulcans and their culture, and may consider <i>Vulcan's Glory</i> to be canon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>T'Pau would be referenced in an episode of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Next_Generation_3745.html" title="Star Trek: The Next Generation">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></i> by way of a starship bearing her name. She would appear on the holodeck in the <i><a href="../../../v/o/y/Star_Trek%7E_Voyager_e7d2.html" title="Star Trek: Voyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></i> episode "Darkling". The character herself would appear decades later in the <i><a href="../../../e/n/t/Star_Trek%7E_Enterprise_849e.html" title="Star Trek: Enterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></i> episodes "<a href="../../../a/w/a/Awakening_%28Enterprise_episode%29_812e.html" title="Awakening (Enterprise episode)">Awakening</a>" and "<a href="../../../k/i/r/Kir%27Shara_%28Enterprise_episode%29_92eb.html" title="Kir'Shara (Enterprise episode)">Kir'Shara</a>". Since these episodes take place more than a century before "Amok Time", and were made years after <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celia_Lovsky_154d.html" title="Celia Lovsky">Celia Lovsky</a>'s death, the character is portrayed as a young woman, and by a different actress (<a href="../../../k/a/r/Kara_Zediker_ee41.html" title="Kara Zediker">Kara Zediker</a>).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The model who was photographed as 7-year-old T'Pring (seen briefly on the viewer in Spock's quarters) has been identified as Mary Rice. <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Mary_Rice" class="external autonumber" title="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Mary_Rice" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></li>

<li>Uniquely among <i>Star Trek</i> episodes, the closing stills include shots of the characters T'Pau, T'Pring and Stonn under the relevant guest actors' credits.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This episode marks the first time that a Starfleet <a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral.html" title="Admiral">Admiral</a> appears in a <i>Star Trek</i> production. The Admiral in the episode was known as "<a href="../../../a/d/m/Admiral_Komack_ae1a.html" title="Admiral Komack">Admiral Komack</a>".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The magazine <i><a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Guide_969f.html" title="TV Guide">TV Guide</a></i> summarised this episode with the <a href="../../../d/o/u/Double-entendre.html" title="Double-entendre">double-entendre</a> "Mr. Spock succumbs to a powerful mating urge and nearly kills Captain Kirk".</li>
<li>The staff weapon used by Kirk and Spock is called the <a href="../../../l/i/r/Lirpa.html" title="Lirpa">lirpa</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Leonard Nimoy made mention of this episode on the January 16, 2007 airing of <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Show_with_Jon_Stewart_8a54.html" title="The Daily Show with Jon Stewart">The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</a></i> in an attempt to explain that while Vulcans are logical, they can sometimes be quite emotional.</li>
