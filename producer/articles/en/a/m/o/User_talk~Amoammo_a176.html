<p>Hello, thanks for dropping me a message about the Tennant - Polly stuff. I've added a bit to the article saying "There has, however, been no official confirmation of this", how does that grab you for now? If it doesn't happen or there's a more official denial, then we can probably just remove the whole paragraph? I'm only uneasy about using the Tennant website denial for now as I believe Wikipedia has a thing against using fansites, in most cases, as sources. However, personally I probably think they are reliable in this particular case. Anyway, thanks again for your work on this! :-) <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngmering_21af.html" title="User:Angmering">Angmering</a> 19:43, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Amoammo, you will see that the subsequent edit I made to the page explains the House-Elves in the film. Some sneaky special effects guy inserted Dobby and another House-Elf riding the backs of camels (or llamas) when the Weasleys, Harry and Hermione are looking for their tent at the Quidditch World Cup. It is trivial, but it is true. --<b><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">Fbv</a></b><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel"><font color="red">65</font></a><i><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">edel</a></i> <sup>(<a href="../../../f/b/v/User_talk%7EFbv65edel_60e2.html" title="User talk:Fbv65edel">discuss</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fbv65edel_f6f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fbv65edel">contribs</a>)</sup> 20:10, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okey dokey. It looked like Dobby to me, but I agree, it's not confirmed. I'll put him back in to the list and adjust the page as necessary.

<p>Hey! I was reading the article about Robbie Jarvis and I saw that you erased two lines because there was no confirmation about them. So his birthdate is confirmated? I was wondering where people found that out... <a href="../../../l/i/l/User%7ELilyGirl_10cb.html" title="User:LilyGirl">LilyGirl</a> 01:13, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I know. i left it in cos it's pretty typical to not have a source for a birthdate. He's been reported as a 19 year old actor, so it doesn't really matter either way, in my opinion. It's the sort of thing you <i>could</i> find on the net (for example in some sort of directory) but not really want to disclose where you'd got it. Lots of reasons...</dd>
<dd>As for the ones i deleted. Well, the "seafaring" comment is pretty empty especially if there's no source for the place(s) he lives/places he's lived. And the Cedric thing, if that's true <i>should</i> be verifiable. Don't really know what i'm saying here...<a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoammo_73c6.html" title="User:Amoammo">Amo</a> 07:25, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, just was wondering if you were US-born as well or how you have US Citizenship and are a UK Wikipedian. I was born in the US, but to a British parent, and don't see the point in 'place of birth' ideas of nationality. Just wondering.

<dd>"don't see the point in 'place of birth' ideas of nationality". hmm, i largely agree, and i think that american's especially can take these things too seriously, but it can be fun to experience sides of yourself even if they don't necessarily come "naturally". I mean, i am the only one of my freinds who has eaten a twinkie! To answer your question, i am a UK/US citizen born (and resident) in the UK, to one American and one Enlgish parent. They found out when they registered me that if they hadn't been married i would only be a US citizen (despite being born in London) although i think that law may have changed now.<a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoammo_73c6.html" title="User:Amoammo">Amo</a> 19:06, 2 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I see, I was born in the States, but moved here at 19, however, being home-schoolled, I grew up with my father and watching lots of English telly, so I was rather shocked whenever I went to meet other people (who took being American rather seriously). I always found them rather silly, since they took this all rather seriously. In the end, is one not what one feels and which one can identify by others of a similar group? <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Kerr_90b0.html" title="User:Nick Kerr">Nick Kerr</a> 20:08, 2 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi there...fair enough. If you don't like it it's also Wikipedia policy to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">be bold</a> and get rid of it!

This is not exactly the stuff of flame wars so if it bothers you feel free to remove! <a href="../../../p/p/e/User%7EPperos_d8fc.html" title="User:Pperos">Peeper</a> 19:57, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Personally i am rubbish with IPA, so to me "gregg" is certainly more accessible, however, i was under the impression that it was wikipedia policy to only use IPA, seeing as spelling things out can lead to differences in opinion. Was what you added, really following guidelines? <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoammo_73c6.html" title="User:Amoammo">Amo</a> 19:52, 19 April 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>

<p>Hi Amoammo, thanks for your message and sorry for the slow reply. I assume you're referring to <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSIPA_dc40.html" title="WP:MOSIPA">WP:MOSIPA</a> and the bit that says "Pronunciation transcriptions based on traditional English spelling are discouraged". As I read it that's very much a guideline rather than an agreed policy, and to my mind a very debatable point. I think it's a pretty dubious claim that people who have enough English to use the English WP will be thrown by English respellings any more than native English speakers -- the problem is of course that English is inherently unsuited to such tasks because of its loony orthography. But a respelling (or other non-specialist approach such as "rhymes with..." which <i>is</i>, perhaps illogically, sanctioned by that guideline) is nearly always possible, and far more helpful to the average user. Add to that the fact that, as you've no doubt noticed, the IPA is very often added by people that know rather less about it than they think -- nearly all the IPA transcriptions I've seen have been to some extent faulty -- and the fact that no systematic poslicy is applied in transcriptions, so that the same sound is transcribed in different ways in different places. There isn't even any consistency in how narrow to make transcriptions (often excessively narrow to show off the editor's familiarity with the IPA chart!), or even whether they should be phonemic or phonetic, and let's not even get started on the question of whose accent should be transcribed in the IPA! This is a guideline that hasn't begun to be thought through, IMHO. It would surely be madness to remove a respelling that is 100% comprehensible to everyone in favour of IPA which is understood by a tiny minority of users. By all means add IPA, though it's really overkill here when all we're doing is distinguishing /i:/ from /e/. So in this case at least, surely common sense dictates leaving "Gregg" alongside the IPA.

<dd>Thanks for pointing me in the direction of that MoS page. It's good to know what the consensus is. I think in this case i agree with you. I'm certainly not very proficient when it comes to IPA, and i think ppl tend to glance past it with an "oh, so it might not be pronounced the way i thought it was, but at least the correct version is there for the same of the encyclopedia" sort of way. (If you see what i mean...) It also occurred to me that it might be particularly helpful to have "gregg" because, while i know most of my english-speaking friends assume it to be "Greeeg", using my knowledge of german i originally thought the "ei" would be pronouned like "eye" in English. Anyhow, thanks for your edits. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoammo_73c6.html" title="User:Amoammo">Amo</a> 20:21, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yes, "Greeg" would be a perfectly logical assumption since "ei" represents /i:/ in many Scottish words. And as you say /ai/ would be a very reasonable guess too. When I get round to it(!) I must have a look at where WP really stands on all this pronunciation business and what can be done to improve things (several times people have taken out my respellings when adding IPA so it's an issue that's come up before) but as I say I suspect it hasn't been properly thought through.

<dd>Hi, i've been wondering about how to change article titles in ages, but can't find any info on wikipedia about it. The article that's made it come to the forefront of my mind again, is <a href="../../../e/t/i/Etienne_Guichard_c36f.html" title="Etienne Guichard">Etienne Guichard</a>, which should be "<i>Étienne</i> Guichard". <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoammo_73c6.html" title="User:Amoammo">Amo</a> 20:35, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Generally, you can use the 'move' tab at the top of a page to move it to a new article name. Have a look at <a href="../../../m/o/v/Help%7EMoving_a_page_3be0.html" title="Help:Moving a page">Help:Moving a page</a>. In many cases though, there may already be a redirect in the way of moving a page. At that point, you will need to enlist the assistance of an admin to swap the article and the redirect. -<a href="../../../d/a/w/User%7EDawson_517d.html" title="User:Dawson">Dawson</a> 20:39, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the help. I'm also having a little trouble with a guy called User:Therealeggplant on the <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Norton_f148.html" title="Edward Norton">Edward Norton</a> page. i edited norton's full name (and provided a source for it), but he keeps coming back to rv the name, sometimes leaving the other source intact! Is there any thing i can do about it? <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoammo_73c6.html" title="User:Amoammo">Amo</a> 20:48, 26 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is most likely due to the controversial nature of the name, which may be worth mentioning in the article in some capacity. The source of Fundrace isn't a very comprehensive source, there isn't even anything that says it is definitively the same person. Anyway, he has been credited with both variations, have a look at the <a href="http://www.edward-norton.org/faqs.html" class="external text" title="http://www.edward-norton.org/faqs.html" rel="nofollow">Edward Norton FAQ</a> for a bit of an explanation. Generally, you want to bring up content disputes on the article's talk page, and talk it out. If it cannot be resolved, try talking with a third, neutral party - possibly an admin, to mediate. -<a href="../../../d/a/w/User%7EDawson_517d.html" title="User:Dawson">Dawson</a> 20:59, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hm, that FAQ is where i got the source from. I know it's not a particularly good one. I suppose the FAQ itself couldn't be a source? Thereal eggplant didn't reply when i left a message on his talk page (it just doesn't look like he replies to anyone) and i also mentioned it on the Edward Norton talk page. How would i get in touch with an admin? <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoammo_73c6.html" title="User:Amoammo">Amo</a> 21:06, 26 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would think the FAQ itself could be considered a source, as it is citing its own sources. You could reword the article to mention both names, and explain the confusion. Anyway, to reach an admin I've found the easiest away is to hop onto <a href="../../../i/r/c/Wikipedia%7EIRC_channels_a457.html" title="Wikipedia:IRC channels">IRC</a> and ask for an admin in #wikipedia or #wikipedia-en, but if that isn't feasible, you can always put up the helpme tag again, and I'm sure one will be along quick enough. Just make sure you stick the tag near your question so they know what you're referring to. -<a href="../../../d/a/w/User%7EDawson_517d.html" title="User:Dawson">Dawson</a> 21:19, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks for the link. Do you have any idea when Losing Gemma is coming out? It'll be on ITV i presume... My friend gave me the ES magazine with her Rock 'n' Roll interview, and she doesn't come off overly well your right. Is there any official news about her and Rufus Sewell? I saw Rafe Spall in Wide Sargasso Sea - it was very good, and he was, as always, amazing.</p>
<p>ooo interesting lol She DOES habve straneg fashion sense though.... Anyway, I'm goin to see it on friday. <a href="../../../x/_/p/User%7EX_pure_evil_x_8191.html" title="User:X pure evil x">X pure evil x</a> 16:31, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>She's getting quite a lot of media coverage/attenson all of a sudden then. Good for her I say :P I really want to see Big Nothing, becasue it looks waaaay better than Starter for Ten (which I skipped in favour of Pick of Destiny) <a href="../../../x/_/p/User%7EX_pure_evil_x_8191.html" title="User:X pure evil x">X pure evil x</a> 22:37, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Did you watch 'Losing Gemma'? I did - was weird. It started off alright, but I kid of worked out the ending so it was a bit ruined lol I loved her with darker hair though - suited her. <a href="../../../x/_/p/User%7EX_pure_evil_x_8191.html" title="User:X pure evil x">X pure evil x</a> 22:36, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No, it was this one <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462477/trivia" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462477/trivia" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. This reference to IMDB is already on the Pierrepoint (film) page. But when I read the "Independent" article you are referring to ("putting the noose round the necks of two friends of his son, Rafe"), I doubt whether IMDB is right. The Independent article looks more trustworthy to me. Let's make a mental note (both of us) to check the FULL cast credits ASAP. --<a href="../../../k/a/u/User%7EKauko56_9e5c.html" title="User:Kauko56">Kauko56</a> 21:31, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, I do understand your reasons for reverting some of my edits, but I still think it important to show that she actually worte and appeared in the show. Also I still think that we should include that there were three series as it was her career after all. And I think you were right about the ratings, so i've added that to the actual show's page. Also, the bit with tate's films, I find that a bit messy with the bullet points. What do you think?

<dd>You can link up Yahoo. But not the groups. Any person can open an fansites or various group and they add it here. That is not allowed. It is sort of like adding link which has no information. :). --<a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyWalker_5153.html" title="User:SkyWalker">SkyWalker</a> 09:56, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes they is already 1 fansite available <a href="http://ruthwilson.e-fans.net/" class="external free" title="http://ruthwilson.e-fans.net/" rel="nofollow">http://ruthwilson.e-fans.net/</a>. That is more than enough. If they is a official site you can add that. Limit entering more that 3 fansites. The sites should be updated and have more information. Then it ok. :). Many people are using wikipedia for their traffic purpose and advertisment. --<a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkyWalker_5153.html" title="User:SkyWalker">SkyWalker</a> 11:54, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
