<p>"Microsoft has chosen to not save the FPU/MMX registers across context switches in Windows XP 64-bit Edition for 64-bit programs "</p>
<p>Is this correct? I've seen quite a few MS blog entries supporting this claim but upon consulting the SDK from "Microsoft Platform SDK\Bin\win64\x86\AMD64\SWConventions.doc" Microsoft claims that MMX/Floating Point stack registers are preserved across context switches but MMX/FPU register use is stricly forbidden in kernel code.[section 2.3.7]</p>
<p>Perhaps this should read "...not save the FPU/MMX registers across 'all' context switches..." since I have no doubt it is (gladly) an attempt to obsolete FPU/MMX/3DNow instructions.</p>

<dd>Ok, it seems someone else "corrected" things back. Fixed it again. I did some more research on this... the FPU/MMX registers are not saved across u/k transistions, but this was the case under x86 too. The real issue is that they are not saved when changing from, and are not restored when changing to, a thread that can only run in kernel mode. For example, the threads in the so-called "system" process. They most definitely ARE saved/restored when switching from/to all other threads, including threads running x64 code. I personally don't think all of these details belong in the article, as these are Windows internals details and the article is about AMD64, not Windows.... <a href="../../../j/e/h/User%7EJeh_81c3.html" title="User:Jeh">Jeh</a> 04:55, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Running x86/MMX/3DNow! instructions in 64-bit mode is not supported by AMD programming reference, the Windows SDK has no support for compiling both intrinsics and assembly code that uses these instructions on 64-bit plaform, so there's no need for Microsoft to support it. It's all outlined in <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/b/5/5b5bec17-ea71-4653-9539-204a672f11cf/AMD64_PortApp.doc" class="external text" title="http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/b/5/5b5bec17-ea71-4653-9539-204a672f11cf/AMD64_PortApp.doc" rel="nofollow">Porting and Optimizing Applications on 64-bit Windows for AMD64 Architecture</a> whitepaper right on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/64bit/default.mspx" class="external text" title="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/64bit/default.mspx" rel="nofollow">WHDC: 64-bit Platform</a> site.

<dd>You have valid points and I focused too much on what the OS code is doing, and not on what developers should do. I've changed the Windows point accordingly, and just left out the whole issue of why... which is probably better for this page anyway.</dd>
<dd>Math instructions are perfectly usable in kernel mode in Windows in certain circumstances. That is what the DDIs KeSave/RestoreFloatingPointState are for (see DDK docs), or their Eng equivalents, the latter being available to graphics drivers (and very commonly used).</dd>
<dd>Finally, as for the CPU, the most recent version of the AMD programming docs ( from <a href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/TechnicalResources/0,,30_182_739_7044,00.html" class="external free" title="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/TechnicalResources/0,,30_182_739_7044,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/TechnicalResources/0,,30_182_739_7044,00.html</a> ) say "x87 floating-point instructions can be executed in any of the architecture’s operating modes" (volume 1, section 6.1.2) and "The x87 instructions can be used in legacy mode or long mode. Their use in long mode is available if the following CPUID function bit is set to 1:" (volume 5, section 2 intro -- and that bit IS set on my two Opterons and on my amd64). The same verbiage appears in the hardcopy versions I have, which are slightly older. Do you have another reference that says otherwise? <a href="../../../j/e/h/User%7EJeh_81c3.html" title="User:Jeh">Jeh</a> 01:06, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>And the issue continues...</p>
<p>Locke Cole added a comment to the article: " source for this&#160;; I think early documentation indicated this was true, but in actual fact it's not? "</p>
<p>As DmitryKo pointed out above (and see the paper he linked at microsoft.com), it is not *supported* by Microsoft. None of the Microsoft compilers, etc., will generate x87 instructions, for example.</p>
<p>The early reports that were wrong were the claims that the OS would not save/restore x87 machine state in long mode. It does save and restore them, and furthermore x87 instructions will *work* in long mode. They'll even work in kernel mode in long mode, as long as you are careful to use the DDIs I mentioned. But MS doesn't support their use in long mode. <a href="../../../j/e/h/User%7EJeh_81c3.html" title="User:Jeh">Jeh</a> 18:11, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks Jeh. The reason I mentioned it was that I'd read a blog entry on blogs.msdn.com (that I cannot find now) indicating that Microsoft had backpedaled on ditching FPU/MMX support.

<p>About the claim&#160;:</p>
<p>"Due to the 64-bit architecture, the AMD64 architecture can address up to 256 tebibytes (also known as terabytes) of memory "</p>
<p>so 64 bits matches an 1.9... * 10^19, so about 19 Exa byte, so about 19'000'000 terabytes&#160;! So could someone correct that claim or explain why the real addressing space is not as long as the theoretical addressing space&#160;? If it's something like a practical adaptation to the largest size of memories in scope, it's a real shame, because I think we can't exclude Exabyte memories on a single computer, especialy because of the theoretical molecular limit of about 1.02 * 10^23 is still further away 5'000 greater which leaves 5'000 molecules for a mole of matter storing 19 Exa byte of memory, probably accessible with a volumetric memory based on nanotechnologies. Another reason would be the short life of a processor family making it unlikely to survive a 256'000 scale of memory evolution.</p>

<dd>The AMD64 <b>architecturally</b> supports up to 2<sup>52</sup> bytes of <b>physical memory</b> and up to 2<sup>64</sup> bytes of <b>virtual memory</b>. <b>Current implementation</b> only supports 2<sup>48</sup> bytes of <b>virtual memory</b> and 2<sup>52</sup>(AMD) or 2<sup>40</sup>(Intel) bytes of <b>physical memory</b>. But the implementation limit could be lifted easily when necessary.Zuxy</dd>
</dl>
<p>Go read the Architecture manual, what you are saying is pure rubbish, the CPU supports a flat -non segmented virtual address space of 2<sup>64</sup> bits. Physically it handles 2<sup>48</sup> or 2<sup>52</sup> bits. Dont get the limits confused, what you are saying is highly erroneus. So in Virtual memory speak its 64-bits. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Lordofacid (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lordofacid_0eee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lordofacid">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>No, you are mistaken. Although virtual addresses are 64 bits wide, in current implementations (and for any chips known in the planning stages) you cannot populate that entire space. Valid ("canonical") virtual addresses run from 0 through 7FFF`FFFFFFFF, and from FFFF8000`00000000 through FFFFFFFF`FFFFFFFF. The high 16 bits of the address are ignored during address translation, except that they must be copies of bit 47 (in a manner akin to sign extension), or an exception will be raised. So, although the addresses are indeed 64 bits wide, and all 64 bits must in fact be specified, only 48 of them are really usable. This was done to cut down on the number of address translation steps, i.e. to reduce the cost of a TLB miss. Hence 2<sup>48</sup>, or 256 TiB usable virtual address space (of which 64-bit Windows is only populating a total of 16 TiB....) <a href="../../../j/e/h/User%7EJeh_81c3.html" title="User:Jeh">Jeh</a> 19:06, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>...updated the main page accordingly. I see a number of additional "implementation details" that could be added, such as page table entry format, a map showing the four-level (9 bits per level, plus 12 bits of byte offset in page = 48 bits total...) address translation scheme, details on how the REX prefix works, etc. Then this new section would become a subsection under an "implementation details" section. <a href="../../../j/e/h/User%7EJeh_81c3.html" title="User:Jeh">Jeh</a> 19:38, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>AFAIK 32 bit x86 CPUs support up to 32 + 16 - 2 (or maybe -3?) of Virtual memory space. 32 bit of offset, and (16 - 2) of segment (-2 because of the two priviledge level bits). True that this assumes flat memory (CS=DS=ES, etc.) is not used. Thus, 32 bit CPUs can access Virtual Memory space of 2<sup>46</sup>, which can be accessed when running more than one process.</p>
<p>In practice, Windows 32bit, for example have the following [<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/memory/base/memory_limits_for_windows_releases.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/memory/base/memory_limits_for_windows_releases.asp" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>[limits]] .</p>
<dl>
<dd>Wrong. At least in the 32-bit x86 architecture, the segmentation system doesn't allow access to more than 4 GiB (32 bits) of memory. This is because 1) the segmentation mechanism runs on top of the virtual address space, which is 32-bit, and 2) segments are not used like you assume: in real mode, "addresses" (offsets) can be 20 to 32 bits long (real/extended real mode), and the address is formed like this: segment*4 + offset. In protected mode, however, segments are defined by structures called segment descriptors stored in either the GDT or the LDT, and the address is formed like this: descriptor.base + offset. Those structures are 32-bit oriented, and thus won't allow addresses longer than 32 bits by themselves. The only way of having them is via the Physical Address Extension (PAE) mechanism, which allows the computer to have up to 36 bits of physicall addresses, mapped to the 32-bit virtual space using paging.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the AMD64 architecture, however, and when in 64-bit long mode, addresses are <i>always</i> 64-bit, the segmentation mechanism is mainly deprecated (save GS and FS, of which only the base is used) and PAE paging is always enabled. The 256 TiB figure is because the AMD64 spec allows processors not to implement all the address bits: they can have as little as 48-bit of virtual addresses and 40 bits of underlying, paging-mapped physical addresses - current AMD64 processors are more or less like this. All addresses formed must be canonical as stated in the article, which, as the pictures explain, allow a neat positioning of both kernel and user code, not to talk of later extensibility.&#160;:<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabbit_e032.html" title="User:Habbit">Habbit</a> 17:25, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>One <i>could</i> support 46-bit segmented addresses within a 32-bit linear address space; one cannot, however, have more than 2<sup>32</sup> bytes worth of the 2<sup>46</sup>-byte segmented address space resident in the linear address space at any one time, so one would have to swap segments in and out of the linear address space in response to, for example, "segment not present" traps, and every reference to a swapped-out segment would involve a trap plus whatever operations are required to move other segments out of the address space to make room for the new segment to be moved in, as well as whatever operations are required to move the new segment in. That would be the case regardless of how much physical memory you have; all that additional physical memory would do for you would be to reduce the number of I/O operations to backing store required - it would not reduce the number of segment swap operations required.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Paging and PAE can be disabled, effectively skipping them (and limiting the physical space to 32 bits). So, in fact, you <i>could</i> design an operating system that allows each process to have some 16380 segments (i.e. using up all the descriptors in both the GDT and the LDT) of 4 GiB each, working with one at a time, and performing some <b>gigantic</b> page switches to allow accessing them all. That gives you an address space of nearly 32 + 14 = 46 bits, yep, but it's not worth the trouble of designing compilers with segmentation support, especially when you can have an AMD64 with a 48bit virtual address space (4 times the memory of your "46 bit" x86). <a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabbit_e032.html" title="User:Habbit">Habbit</a> 15:54, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>According to these articles, the Intel processors do not support the LAHF and SAHF instructions in 64-bit mode, because an early release of the AMD docs said the architecture would not. AMD later changed this statement, and support for these instructions was added to their processors. The other article implies that these instructions are used for context switching, so the difference is probably only relevant to O.S. kernel developers. Mhowkins 18:44, 28 Aug 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>It seems like the user "Bad Byte" is the one who did this (and I later joined in, refining the separation of content). It was in an attempt to separate the earlier article into information about hardware implementing AMD64 and the AMD64 architecture itself. I think that the <a href="../../../a/m/d/AMD64_8952.html" title="AMD64">AMD64</a> article should be primarily about the AMD64 architecture, and articles like <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athlon_64.html" title="Athlon 64">Athlon 64</a> and <a href="../../../o/p/t/Opteron.html" title="Opteron">Opteron</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intel_Xeon_ed1f.html" title="Intel Xeon">Intel Xeon</a> should be about the hardware implementing AMD64. However, as the hardware implementing AMD64 is relevant, I support the current list of products implementing AMD64, with links to the articles.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think that the "supported operating systems" information from previous reincarnations of this article really needs to be brought back. That's important information this article shouldn't be without, and I think I'm going to get started writing this list.</dd>

<p>What idiot mucked about with this page? This person clearly does not know one end of a PC from another. I can accept the world is full of ignorant and stupid people, but why oh why screw up a perfectly good page, and insert total nonsense? I've written tons of content for the PC section in the WIKI, AMD, NVIDI, ATI, so I'm not taking this lying down.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...a straightforward extension of the x86 architecture to 64 bits</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eh? So eliminating the FPU is just extending the x86 architecture? Er, no. Actually, its the biggest change to the x86 architecture since the i386 rolled out - and some would argue more significant. I'm going to put back a lot of the old content, my content, before the article got ruined and rendered technically inaccurate. I can't be bothered to find out who did this - whoever you are, read this, take note, put it down to experience, and take your ignorance elsewhere.</p>
<p>Right, done the deed. You know you have a crank, when stuff about AMD's advertising in the Netherlands, turns up in what should be a technical article.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Having made the damning charge above, I guess I have to give at least one example to illustrate the point. Consider: <i>While it was considered at one point <a href="../../../r/i/s/RISC_0a73.html" title="RISC">RISC</a> chips would inevitably replace the outdated and quirky <a href="../../../x/8/6/X86.html" title="X86">x86</a> architecture, in fact <a href="../../../a/m/d/AMD64_8952.html" title="AMD64">AMD64</a> effectively turns <a href="../../../x/8/6/X86.html" title="X86">x86</a> into a modern RISC type programming environment. The genius of <a href="../../../a/m/d/AMD64_8952.html" title="AMD64">AMD64</a>, is that it undertakes this major architecture upgrade, while retaining legacy compatibility.</i> Total nonsense. To the extent it is something other than pure opinion/babble, it says that AMD64 includes a RISC-like instruction set. That is false, and it's a mistake that anyone with the slightest knowledge of the subject would not make.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Then we have the curious question above, "So eliminating the FPU is just extending the x86 architecture?" I can't make any sense of that. Again, total nonsense.

<dd>Having thought about it more, I conjecture that he is saying that AMD64 drops the x87/mmx instructions. That is false; they are included.

<p>1) <b>AMD64 (also x86-64 or x64)</b> - x64 is Microsoft's term, not AMD's one. IMHO it would be consistent ether to remove non-AMD terms (<i>AMD64 (former name: x86-64)</i>) or include all the terms (<i>AMD64 (also x86-64 or x64 or EM64T)</i>)</p>
<p>2) <b>Marketing analizes</b> section: AMD is told to never extend IA-32 instruction set. That is false! Remember 3DNow! and PowerNow! The real difference is that previously intel ignored AMD innovations and coupled them with it's own incompatible ones later (SSE instead of 3D Now! <i>and SSE was told to be better technically</i>, SpeedStep and later Enhanced SpeedStep instead of PowerNow! <i>ST was worse, EST about the same</i>), and for AMD64 intel did not developed it's own non-compatible 64-bit extensions. It is Intel's behavior that made difference, not AMD's one.</p>
<p>BTW, not the same is going about La Grande and VanderPool, but i would not say if it was AMD or Intel 1st in those extenseion and their analogues.</p>

<dd>Ever since the 80286, x86 processors have always had two separate categories of segment registers - one for code and one for data. You can only ever execute from a "code" segment, meaning that "data" segments are never executable. In fact, you cannot mark a "code" segment as writable, either. In this way, Win16 is more protected against buffer overflows than Win32. In Win32 and most other 32-bit operating systems, there is a separate code segment, but it maps to the same address as the data segment used in DS, ES, and SS, and segment registers aren't used for, well, segmenting memory anymore. -- Myria 23:54, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Consensus against us?! If all wikipedia users were polled, I'd expect people to prefer what they see in a computer ad to what they see in the 37th page of an IEEE spec. I guess it really comes down to accessibility vs. technical accuracy, and the intended audience. How much jargon (gibibyte) should we let in, alienating the common man (gigabyte)? I hate the hard drive industry's power of ten lies as much as everybody else, but I really don't think this is how to fix it. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnruble_01c8.html" title="User:Johnruble">Johnruble</a> 18:45, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry but it is not the "hard drive industry's power of ten lies." "giga" means 1,000,000,000 and an 80 GB hard drive really does contain 80,000,000,000 end-user bytes -- usually a bit more. And Windows will even show you that number, if you look in the disk properties. Yes, in many Windows displays MS uses the "GB" prefix improperly, dividing the drive capacity by 2^30 instead of by 10^9, showing the capacity as "73 GB"... nevertheless you can still store 80 billion of your bytes on the drive. Tell me, would you still consider the HD makers liars if they put "80 billion bytes" on the box? Er, wait, that's exactly what they're saying. <a href="../../../j/e/h/User%7EJeh_81c3.html" title="User:Jeh">Jeh</a> 23:12, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sure you meant to type "to portray one billion bytes", but anyway... Turn it around: The only place that "giga" ever means 2^30 is when the prefix "giga" is followed by "byte." What you're arguing is that it's perfectly fine for the same prefix to mean different things for different units of measurement: One km should remain 1000 meters, a megawatt should be 1,000,000 watts, one GHz should still be 1,000,000,000 cycles per second... at least, I hope you would agree to those... but one GB should be 1,073,741,824 bytes. That's frankly ridiculous, no matter how long the computer industry has promulgated it. SI prefixes have been around just a *bit* longer, you know?</dd>

<dd>Furthermore there is no motivation to use binary prefixes with hard drives. There is absolutely nothing about a hard drive that requires or even encourages the capacity to come in powers of two (as there is with RAM), so why should a binary prefix be reasonable?</dd>

<dd>As for "deception," the only point of discrepancy is in the digits on the HD box vs. the digits displayed by Windows; after all, Windows WILL show you the capacity down to the byte, it does jibe with what's on the HD box, and it also jibes with the number of bytes Windows will let you store.</dd>

<dd>As for what people expect, ask a random sample of 100 PC users to write out the size of a "300 GB" hard drive without the "GB" and I'll bet 90% of them write "300,000,000,000 bytes." (If they are not sure how many zeroes the "G" prefix represents, ask them to try it with a "1.42 KB" file.) Similarly, most people are not aware that a "256 MB" DIMM does not contain 256,000,000 bytes, but slightly more.</dd>

<dd>Personally I think it's the RAM makers -- and, of course, ALL displays in OSs -- that should change. Back when RAM was measured in KB the discrepancy was small, but at the GB level it's almost ten percent. And wouldn't the RAM makers love to change their labels to say, for example, "268 MB"? Of course they would! Everybody's reported installed RAM sizes would increase too. It would be like a free upgrade!</dd>

<dd>Seriously, the HD makers could address the issue very simply: in addition to saying "1 GB equals 1,000,000,000 bytes" on the box, they could also say (for a 300 GB drive) "this drive provides at least 300,000,000,000 bytes of usable storage (displayed by most operating systems as 279 GB)" <a href="../../../j/e/h/User%7EJeh_81c3.html" title="User:Jeh">Jeh</a> 03:02, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The confusion between 1000 and 1024-base units has gone on long enough, and is becoming more and more important since the ratio between these units gets greater with larger prefixes. Introducing new units <i>is</i> the only real way to solve it, and I would expect most people to be intelligent enough to realize the relation between terms "megabyte" and "mebibyte" or much more so for MB vs MiB. These new units are also linked on most pages in case anyone is unsure. In my opinion, this is the way to go, and Wikipedia should be progressive in adopting new and positive initiatives. FYI, in addition to harddrive manufacturers, all networking hardware (eg, 100Mbit/s Ethernet meaning 100 000 000 bits) and internet connection speeds reported by most ISPs (not all, to add to the confusion) use 1000-base prefixes as well. -- <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EIntgr_3172.html" title="User:Intgr">intgr</a> 11:07, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>re. comm speeds -- Exactly. Similarly, a "100GB native" LTO2 cartridge holds 100 x 10^9 bytes, not 100 x 2^30. So I was too broad above; "binary" prefixes are not even common with all uses with "bytes," it's really only "bytes of RAM" where they are used consistently. There are just two possible solutions that make sense: One, OSs should change to use binary prefixes in all displays where they are now using powers of 1024, and should display file and hard drive sizes with the correct decimal prefixes using powers-of-1000 divisors. Or, two, OSs would change to use powers of 1000 in all cases, and RAM makers would relabel their products, so e.g. a "256 MB" DIMM becomes "268 MB." I actually like the latter solution better, as it maintains consistency. I think the RAM makers would like it too *grin*. <a href="../../../j/e/h/User%7EJeh_81c3.html" title="User:Jeh">Jeh</a> 13:06, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You guys make good arguments. I suppose it's pretty ridiculous for me to wish to overload the definitions of metric prefixes when talking about bytes, though that's how I'd like it to be. Some day I'll have kids who have pebibyte ipods, and I'll be the old man, resisting change, refusing to start using the new prefixes. --<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnruble_01c8.html" title="User:Johnruble">Johnruble</a> 19:08, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
