<p>First, your comments do not belong on my front page. That's what the discussion page, like this one, is for. The front page is for me, not for you. Second, please sign in to make changes -- clearly, you are making edits using both AMDG1976 and your IP number -- this is known as "sock puppet" behavior on Wiki and is considered fraudulent -- one may presume you do this from ignorance, but you will run into trouble. Third, neither Harvard, which is a secular institution founded by Congregationalist nonconformists and later controlled by Unitarians, nor Oxford offer pontifical degrees, therefore I did not earn my pontificals at either. I was lecturing on SC the year it came out, thank you, so I did not just discover it -- and since Pontifical faculties are <i>chartered</i>, yes, SC does provide the broad, constitutional requirements for the dgrees. In the US, postnominals generally follow order of being earned, not some sort of hierarchy of importance you have come up with, and you will find plenty of theologians with Ph.D.s rather than S.T.D.s -- pontifical faculties here do not grant concurrent civil and pontifical degrees (if you have a Ph.,D. and and S.T.D. from CUA, for instance, that means two sets of comps, two sets of coursework, and two completely different dissertations). Wiki does use both British and American English, but "honours degrees" are not a simple matter of terminology -- the meaning of the degrees is very different: this is not a spelling or lingo issue, this is a very real distinction. Wiki should be accurate, not just accurate for the UK or Canada, and so should either lay out the basic info alone or lay out all of the comparisons, but not just list YOUR schools, as if Regis, for instance, is how things are done everywhere. The article was actually fine until you started editing it to make it sound like somebody was trying to puff their own resume -- not sayting you were, but that's how it comes across. Take a look at the coursework, graduate student teaching, language and comps requirements for a Ph.D. from Yale, Harvard, et.c, and compare them with those for the S.T.D. at a pontifical school and show me which one is harder to earn, requires more time, and believe me, I can vouch for the comparisons. If you want to make distinctions, make it between the JCD (which is relatively easy), the STD (which is usually harder, depending on the faculty, and excluding the "Easy A" in Rome), and the SSD (which is a bitch, due to the language requirements mostly, and so is rarely earned) -- now THAT I'll buy, that a Ph.D. or S.T.D. in Scripture is easier to earn than the SSD.<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarvardOxon_da84.html" title="User:HarvardOxon">HarvardOxon</a> 14:52, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi HarvardOxon Please Refrain from the swearing and the personal attacks, whilst we are at it. Sorry -- ignorance on both the front page and IP number -- though there is clearly no way I was hiding my IP address so no fraud was intended. Thanks for the heads up. Oxon Harvard question was rhetorical. I realise the CUA and WJST do what they do -- that is why I mentioned them. And you can't say CUA, for instance, as it is a singularity in the USA in awarding them both in the manner they do. I'd be much better off if the ThD/PhD and STD were the same, fyi! But they are not and the previous page was not accurate. The language reqs for STDs are more than the PhD/ThD because they build on the STB and STL. That is, Hebrew, Greek Latin for the STB. The two Europeans for the STL and the three europeans for the STD. You need to ditch the "MA talk" if you want it accurate for the USA and Can and the UK. An MA is different in the rest of the world. And I had noted that i was talking about British honours degrees, which clarified my meaning. Also, you need to look at how you use the term professor if you actually mean what you say here. I am unsure as to how your 'middle position' just magically seems to be a USA-centric position? If we keep at it, I am sure we will arrive at a middle position. Agree totally, if looking at degree reqs and not subject matter that the SSD is a nightmare to earn.Amdg1976 15:10, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
