<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/d/Amdahl_Corporation_f4e8.html" title="Edit section: Company origins">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Company origins</span></h2>
<p>Amdahl Corp. launched its first product, the Amdahl 470 V6, in <a href="../../../1/9/7/1975.html" title="1975">1975</a>, competing directly against IBM's high-end machines in the then-current <a href="../../../s/y/s/System_370_33e8.html" title="System/370">System/370</a> family. (At IBM, Gene Amdahl had co-designed the groundbreaking <a href="../../../3/2/-/32-bit.html" title="32-bit">32-bit</a> architecture, <a href="../../../2/4/-/24-bit.html" title="24-bit">24-bit</a> addressing, <a href="../../../s/y/s/System_360_1199.html" title="System/360">System/360</a> line of computers. Applications written for the System/360 can still run, unmodified, on today's <a href="../../../z/s/e/ZSeries_475b.html" title="ZSeries">zSeries</a> mainframes four decades later.) At the time of its introduction, the 470 V6 was less expensive but still faster than IBM's comparable offerings. For the next quarter century Amdahl and IBM competed aggressively against one another in the high-end server market, with Amdahl grabbing as much as 24% marketshare. Amdahl owed some of its success to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antitrust.html" title="Antitrust">antitrust</a> settlements between IBM and the U.S. Department of Justice which assured that Amdahl's customers could license IBM's mainframe software under reasonable terms.</p>
<p>Dr Gene Amdahl was committed to expanding the capabilities of the uniprocessor mainframe during the late '70s and early 80's. Amdahl engineers, working with Fujitsu circuit designers, developed unique air-cooled chip designs using high speed ECL (emitter-coupled logic) circuit macros packaged in a chip with a heat dissipating cooling attachment (looked like the heat dissipating fins on a motorcycle engine) mounted to the top of the chip. In the 470 and 58x0 systems, the chips were mounted in an 11 by 11 array on multi-layer boards called Multi-Chip Carriers (MCCs), that were positioned in high airflow for cooling. The Amdahl mainframes of this era, unlike IBM systems, were completely air cooled, and did not require "plumbing" for chilled water. The MCCs were mounted horizontally in a large rectangular frame. The MCCs slid into a complex physical connection system and the processor "side panels" interconnected the system, providing clock propagation delays that maintained race-free synchronous operation at relatively high clock speeds (15-18nS base clock cycles). This processor box was cooled with high speed fans generating horizontal air flow across the MCCs.</p>
<p>Additional models of Amdahl uniprocessor systems included the Amdahl 470 V7 and V8 systems (the V8, first shipped in 1980, incorporated high speed 64K buffers to assist paging, and the first real hardware based virtualization known as "Multiple Domain Facility"). With Gene Amdahl's departure, and increasing influence from Fujitsu, Amdahl broke into large system multi-processor design in the mid-80's with the 5860 and 5880 models.</p>
<p>Always the entrepreneur, Gene Amdahl left the company he founded in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>, moving on to start a couple of new technology companies.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/d/Amdahl_Corporation_f4e8.html" title="Edit section: Market exit">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Market exit</span></h2>
<p>Amdahl Corporation enjoyed perhaps its best sales during IBM's transition to <a href="../../../c/m/o/CMOS_a629.html" title="CMOS">CMOS</a> technology in the early to mid 1990s. At first IBM's new mainframe CMOS processors couldn't perform as well as spare-no-expense <a href="../../../b/i/p/Bipolar_junction_transistor.html" title="Bipolar junction transistor">bipolar</a> technology, giving Amdahl a temporary advantage. However, IBM's CMOS strategy paid off in the long run, allowing IBM's <a href="../../../p/o/u/Poughkeepsie%2C_New_York_9470.html" title="Poughkeepsie, New York">Poughkeepsie</a> factory to produce even faster mainframes at lower cost as the technology matured. By the time IBM introduced its breakthrough <a href="../../../6/4/-/64-bit.html" title="64-bit">64-bit</a> zSeries 900 in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, it was all over for Amdahl's hardware business, which only had <a href="../../../3/1/-/31-bit.html" title="31-bit">31-bit</a>-addressing Millennium and OmniFlex servers to sell. In late 2000 Fujitsu/Amdahl announced that the company had no plans to invest the estimated US $1 billion (or more) to create an IBM-compatible 64-bit system.</p>
<p>Historically it is unclear whether Fujitsu/Amdahl made the right decision. Despite heavy competition from other server platforms, IBM's zSeries has enjoyed a resurgence due to the widespread adoption of <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a> and the escalating transaction volumes (in <a href="../../../c/i/c/CICS_df76.html" title="CICS">CICS</a>, <a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_Management_System_d3fe.html" title="Information Management System">IMS</a>, <a href="../../../i/b/m/IBM_DB2_3de5.html" title="IBM DB2">DB2</a>, and other mainframe subsystems) brought about by <a href="../../../e/-/b/E-business.html" title="E-business">e-business</a> growth. IBM's zSeries revenues are actually increasing despite declining prices. As of late <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> IBM is the only manufacturer of production-grade IBM-compatible mainframes. However, Fujitsu announced in late 2005 that <a href="../../../e/d/s/EDS_7999.html" title="EDS">EDS</a> would sell its line of "mainframes" outside Japan. Unlike prior models, these Fujitsu systems are not compatible with IBM's and cannot run <a href="../../../z/2F/o/Z_OS_0da1.html" title="Z/OS">z/OS</a>, but the announcement has customers wondering if Fujitsu will take the next step in re-entering the (now growing) market. Amdahl also failed in its effort to introduce ObjectStar software (initially known as Huron) during this period and that product later became a successful MBO when it was onsold to TIBCO.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/d/Amdahl_Corporation_f4e8.html" title="Edit section: Amdahl customer options">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Amdahl customer options</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../z/2F/o/Z_OS_0da1.html" title="Z/OS">z/OS</a> 1.5 is the last release of IBM's flagship operating system still able to run on 31-bit mainframes, including Amdahl and older IBM systems. IBM plans to end support for z/OS 1.5 on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_31.html" title="March 31">March 31</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2007.html" title="2007">2007</a>. In May, 2006, IBM announced that the next version of <a href="../../../z/2F/v/Z_VSE_dbc5.html" title="Z/VSE">z/VSE</a>, Version 4, would require a 64-bit system, signaling a future end to 31-bit support for that operating system. <a href="../../../z/2F/t/Z_TPF_d463.html" title="Z/TPF">z/TPF</a>, which became available in December, 2005, also requires a 64-bit system. The 31-bit Linux distributions will survive as long as the <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_source.html" title="Open source">open source</a> community and distributors have interest. So while there's still some potential life for Amdahl's hardware, the transition to 64-bit systems continues. Some companies and governments still have Amdahl systems performing useful work into mid-<a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, and Fujitsu/Amdahl still supports those customers with replacement parts and other services.</p>
<p>Arguably IBM did not have a suitable replacement model for many Amdahl customers until the May, 2004, introduction of the zSeries 890. The zSeries 800 also became an attractive replacement for Amdahl machines, especially in late 2005, as that model's typical price fell below $100,000. The <a href="../../../s/y/s/System_z9.html" title="System z9">System z9</a> BC model, introduced in May, 2006, increased IBM's attractiveness yet again, and the BC drove z800 and z890 prices down even more. (Fujitsu/Amdahl now sells used IBM mainframes.) Other options include running without support, rewriting applications, or running applications under <a href="http://www.funsoft.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.funsoft.com/" rel="nofollow">FLEX-ES</a>. FLEX-ES is a mainframe instruction set emulator that supports <a href="../../../e/s/a/ESA_390_13b5.html" title="ESA/390">ESA/390</a> and, in some cases, <a href="../../../z/2F/a/Z_Architecture_f8db.html" title="Z/Architecture">z/Architecture</a> operating systems and software.</p>
<p>The vestiges of Amdahl were recently resurrected under a new name: Platform Solutions Inc. <a href="http://www.platform-solutions.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.platform-solutions.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> by Dr. Gene Amdahl and some of his core engineers. Using capital from Intel and other major investors they created a new plug compatible mainframe that not only ran the z/Series operating systems very well but also had z/Series channels for attaching real IBM equipment as well as virtual simulators for most hardware to minimize the need for IBM’s expensive peripheral equipment.</p>
<p>The most innovative thing about this machine is that its LPARS host not only IBM operating systems, but 64-bit Intel Linux, HP-UX, Solaris and others. This is not done with emulation, but with a clever hardware based virtualization.</p>
<p>This makes the machine useful in businesses with multi-platform environments as the same computer power can be directed to the machine architecture that needs it most and the pooling of CPU power lowers the overall cost. In addition, this and the self contained peripherals, make it an ideal all-in-one D/R box.</p>
<p>Platform Solutions started shipping its machines the first quarter of 2007. This precipitated a lawsuit from IBM. Platform Solutions countered that by “tying” the sale of its software to the sale of its hardware, IBM was in violation of its anti-trust agreement with the U.S. Justice Dept. The lawsuits is still outstanding.</p>
