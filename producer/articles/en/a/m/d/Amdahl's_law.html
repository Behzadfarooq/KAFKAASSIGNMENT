<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/d/Amdahl%27s_law.html" title="Edit section: Description">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Description</span></h2>
<p>Amdahl's law can be interpreted more technically, but in simplest terms it is the <a href="../../../a/l/g/Algorithm.html" title="Algorithm">algorithm</a> that decides the speedup not the number of processors. You eventually reach a place where you can not parallelize the algorithm any more.</p>
<p>As a concrete example of Amdahl's law, while one could speed up part of a computer a hundredfold or more, if the improvement only affects 12% of the overall task, the best the speedup could possibly be is <img class='tex' src="../../../math/d/7/3/d73faedbe4efa4a1478b3c74aac73db8.png" alt="\frac{1}{1 - 0.12} = 1.136" /> times faster.</p>
<p>More technically, the law is concerned with the speedup achievable from an improvement to a computation that affects a proportion <i>P</i> of that computation where the improvement has a speedup of <i>S</i>. (For example, if an improvement can speed up 30% of the computation, <i>P</i> will be 0.3; if the improvement makes the portion affected twice as fast, <i>S</i> will be 2). Amdahl's law states that the overall speedup of applying the improvement will be</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class='tex' src="../../../math/8/9/6/89638a25639297d701f9298b68ee9cec.png" alt="\frac{1}{(1 - P) + \frac{P}{S}}" />.</dd>
</dl>
<p>To see how this formula was derived, assume that the running time of the old computation was 1, for some unit of time. The running time of the new computation will be the length of time the unimproved fraction takes, (which is 1 − <i>P</i>), plus the length of time the improved fraction takes. The length of time for the improved part of the computation is the length of the improved part's former running time divided by the speedup, making the length of time of the improved part <i>P</i>/<i>S</i>. The final speedup is computed by dividing the old running time by the new running time, which is what the above formula does.</p>
<p>Here's another example. We are given a task which is split up into four parts: P1 = .11 or 11%, P2 = .18 or 18%, P3 = .23 or 23%, P4 = .48 or 48%, which add up to 100%. Then we say P1 is not sped up, so S1 = 1 or 100%, P2 is sped up 5x, so S2 = 5 or 500%, P3 is sped up 20x, so S3 = 20 or 2000%, and P4 is sped up 1.6x, so S4 = 1.6 or 160%. By using the formula <img class='tex' src="../../../math/0/f/7/0f7caebea39ba009b4868290b8dbc5a8.png" alt="\frac{P1}{S1} + \frac{P2}{S2} + \frac{P3}{S3} + \frac{P4}{S4}" />, we find the running time is <img class='tex' src="../../../math/1/8/a/18a2c7853bd0fccdcb22eb637ac9b759.png" alt="{\frac{.11}{1} + \frac{.18}{5} + \frac{.23}{20} + \frac{.48}{1.6}} = .4575" /> or a little less than ½ the original running time which we know is 1. Therefore the overall speed boost is <img class='tex' src="../../../math/5/4/c/54c4269ae56a19af1778a0c98143a422.png" alt="\frac{1}{.4575} = 2.186" /> or a little more than double the original speed using the formula <img class='tex' src="../../../math/9/c/2/9c2913c40b703504367ba8191b974c32.png" alt="\frac{1}{\frac{P1}{S1} + \frac{P2}{S2} + \frac{P3}{S3} + \frac{P4}{S4}}" />. Notice how the 20x and 5x speedup don't have much effect on the overall speed boost and running time when over half of the task is only sped up 1x, (i.e. not sped up), or 1.6x.</p>

<p>Amdahl's law is often conflated with the <a href="../../../d/i/m/Diminishing_returns.html" title="Diminishing returns">law of diminishing returns</a>, whereas only a special case of applying Amdahl's law demonstrates 'law of diminishing returns'. If one picks optimally what to improve you will see monotonically decreasing improvements as you improve. If, however, one picks non-optimally, after improving a sub-optimal component and moving on to improve a more optimal improvement one can see an increase in return. Consider, for instance, the illustration. If one picks to work on B then A you find an increase in return. If, instead, one works on improving A then B you will find a diminishing return. Thus, strictly speaking, only one (optimal case) can appropriately be said to demonstrate 'law of diminishing returns'.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/d/Amdahl%27s_law.html" title="Edit section: Parallelization">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Parallelization</span></h2>
<p>In the special case of parallelization, Amdahl's law states that if <i>F</i> is the fraction of a calculation that is sequential (i.e. cannot benefit from parallelization), and (1 − <i>F</i>) is the fraction that can be parallelized, then the maximum speedup that can be achieved by using <i>N</i> processors is</p>
<dl>
<dd><img class='tex' src="../../../math/b/1/0/b10e75b6ec0f910e6b8fe5e0f79205f6.png" alt="\frac{1}{F + (1-F)/N}" />.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the limit, as <i>N</i> tends to <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinity.html" title="Infinity">infinity</a>, the maximum speedup tends to 1/<i>F</i>. In practice, price/performance ratio falls rapidly as <i>N</i> is increased once (1 − <i>F</i>)/<i>N</i> is small compared to <i>F</i>.</p>
<p>As an example, if <i>F</i> is only 10%, the problem can be speed up by only a maximum of a factor of 10, no matter how large the value of <i>N</i> used. For this reason, parallel computing is only useful for either small numbers of <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_processing_unit.html" title="Central processing unit">processors</a>, or problems with very low values of <i>F</i>: so-called <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embarrassingly_parallel.html" title="Embarrassingly parallel">embarrassingly parallel</a> problems. A great part of the craft of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parallel_programming.html" title="Parallel programming">parallel programming</a> consists of attempting to reduce <i>F</i> to the smallest possible value.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/m/d/Amdahl%27s_law.html" title="Edit section: Limitations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Limitations</span></h2>
<p>According to Amdahl's law, the theoretical maximum speedup of using N processors would be N, namely <i>linear <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speedup.html" title="Speedup">speedup</a></i>. However, it is not uncommon to observe more than N speedup on a machine with N processors in practice, namely <i>super linear speedup</i>. One possible reason is the effect of cache aggregation. In parallel computers, not only does the number of processors change, but so does the size of accumulated caches from different processors. With the larger accumulated cache size, more or even the entire data set can fit into caches, dramatically reducing memory access time and producing an additional speedup beyond that arising from pure computation.</p>
