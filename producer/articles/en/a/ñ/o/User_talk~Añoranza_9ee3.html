<p>The page protection has nothing to do with any edit war. I didn't even know there was one. It is due to ongoing vandalism by an abusive user who has created several hundred throwaway accounts with which he posts an administrator's personal information into articles. After going through the trouble of removing those edits from the page history, it would be wise to semi-protect the page for at least a while, if only to delay having to repeat the process. — <small>May. 7, '06</small> <tt class="plainlinks"><b>[08:21] &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" rel="nofollow">freakofnur<sub>x</sub>ture</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_freakofnurture_e7bb.html" title="Special:Contributions/freakofnurture">|</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreakofnurture_149a.html" rel="nofollow">talk</a>&gt;</b></tt></p>

<p>You've asked why I prefer opera. You might be a Firefox fanatic, but I am not. I've used Opera before there was a Firefox. Firefox's font rendering looks bad on my laptop with a 16:9 monitor aspect ratio. Opera does mouse gestures, has more features by default, and is more polished than firefox in its current state. I don't hate firefox, I put it on my parents computer but Opera meets my needs better than firefox. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBige1977_d3fc.html" title="User:Bige1977"><font color="black" size="-4">Big</font><font color="red">E</font><font size="-4">1977</font></a> 21:52, 13 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your comments have been noted. Trying to find a middleground is usually better then advocating someone just discard someone elses work. Today it seems me and Anoranza came to a middleground thanks to some discussion instead of constant revert war.

<p>I didnt take part in the debate to delete the category war on terrorism. I think the debate was politically motivated. The term is a policy of the current administration of the US govenrement that has had both negative and positive consequences. If you dont like the consequencesyou should add that to the discussion rather than deleting the category which will be usefuil for future research into the effectiveness of hte War on Terror.<a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrdthree_f9a2.html" title="User:Mrdthree">Mrdthree</a> 02:29, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was decided the category should be deleted. You can challenge that decision but you cannot restart the category against consensus.

<p>Don't you realize? Every time you comment from your IP, your block gets automatically reset. Admins aren't involved in that. Just calm down and walk away. Come back in a week once you've thought things through. Because you know what? If I were an admin I'd have blocked you myself. Personal attacks are <b>not</b> tolerated. Just because an admin made a mistake in blocking you for 3RR doesn't give you the right to insult them. He tried to fix things. I've seen a lot of admins here who wouldn't even listen to your protestations that you hadn't violated 3RR. He listened and unblocked you, and then you insulted him.

<p>As posting in other users' name in order to defame them is a severe violation of wikipedia policy the IP should be blocked indefinitely. Sorry if this is a wrong suspicion, but as few people will have noticed my case I would like to know if this was user <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0faults</a> who is from New York as well, as he writes on his page.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as I have done nothing wrong and no evidence of any wrongdoing has been presented, I protest my block. A cynic remark about someone who abused his admin powers in no way justifies a one week block. The user blocked in spite of a conflict of interest and in spite of the fact that I had not violated the rule as he claimed. He did not apologize and instead threatened me and invited others to block me. <a href="../../../a/%C3%B1/o/User%7EA%C3%B1oranza_d332.html" title="User:Añoranza">Añoranza</a> 10:20, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem is that information has been responded to and is the basis of accusations apparently, so I will not edit it and change it from its original state, its almost misleading to do so, in my opinion at least. I am sorry you find it shameful, I offered you help, help I had no need to even offer considering the RfC etc. I would like to point out that even though we have argued, I have before met you in the middle like on the Iraq War article, and even fixed your bad edit on that Panama article then explained how to use the tag. But as I said, I was just offering advice, I am sorry you feel the way you do. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue"><sup>|sockpuppets|</sup></font></i></a> 22:53, 9 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First of all, they were blocked, so others already confirmed they were vandals. Second, there are only two possibilities. Either it was me, than I was a vandal. Or it was someone else pretending to be me to ensure I stay blocked. That would be the worst vandalism I have heard of up to now.

<dd>A one week block for one "incivility" that had a concrete reason and happened after someone else was very incivil to me and abused admin powers is a severe case of double standards and biased action.

<dd>You know what, it was an honest mistake by JDoorjam and he was perfectly within his power to warn you not to edit war. Any admin would have done the same. Edit warring is not tolerated. As for incivility, 1 week might be longer than what I personally would have preferred but considering your continuing uncooperative attitude, I see no reason to reconsider. I also warned NSLE about future use inflammatory comments. I'm a rational (and pretty fair) person. But if you just keep saying the same rhetoric of "I didn't do anything!" and "They're abusing admin powers" over and over, I again am less inclined to reconsider any blocks. Just take some time off, then come back in a week and keep cool.

<dd>If someone does an honest mistake, there is no reason not to apologize. I would not have complained about a warning if it had gone to the other party, too - just look at the zillion of reverts by <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0faults</a>. In this case, the admin who blocked me did not warn but blocked right away in a case where he was involved himself, and again, instead of apologizing he threatened me and invited others to block me. This is by far more incivil than making one ironic comment in response to an abuse of admin power. You however choose to block only me and to restore a completely unbased block justification. I agree to differ with you about the incivility, but the other reasons are without any basis. Asking others to calm down for a week is not really helpful if you force them to stay away for a week under such dubious pretenses.

<dd>I think saying that he invited others to block you is a bit of a stretch. Either way, you brought this upon yourself. You do realise you shouldn't have insulted users intelligence right? Again, nobody has abused any admin power thus far and it would be wise of you to stop claiming that over and over. JDoorjam unblocked you as soon as he found out he had made a mistake. How do you respond? You call him stupid. And as for calming down, how else do you suggest we do it? You know what, don't edit this page for 48 hours. Come back, and then just say that you will <b>never</b> insult other users again, and I'll reduce your block. Prove that you can at least be reasoned with.

<p>There are a number of very odd things happening around fringes of the Rex/Merecat story, and I certainly don't understand them all. One is Thewolfstar, who considered Merecat a friend and ally; she has been banned but has created a number of sock puppets and is now using open proxies to post comments. (Misconfigured proxies often leave extra backslashes after apostrophes, you can see this in some of the edits of <a href="../../../7/0/2E/User%7E70.87.34.82.html" title="User:70.87.34.82">70.87.34.82</a> (<a href="../../../7/0/2E/User_talk%7E70.87.34.82.html" title="User talk:70.87.34.82">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.87.34.82_204a.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.87.34.82">contribs</a>) ). The use of all caps and the language of the last post is a characteristic of Thewolfstar when she is pissed off. There are a number of posts about Thewolfstar on <a href="../../../a/n/i/WP%7EANI_afbb.html" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a> in the recent archives and the active page; here is a post where she is caught using another open proxy at The Planet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive108#Registered_user_connected_through_open_proxy.3F" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive108#Registered_user_connected_through_open_proxy.3F" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, one strange thing about the Merecat situation is how did Thewolfstar suddenly find all these open proxy servers at Merecat's old ISP? It is a coincidence or did he set something up for her? (Thewolfstar is definitely a real person, a middle-aged lady in upstate NY with an 18 year old son who also edits; several admins have spoken on the phone with her).</p>
<p>Another strange thing is why is there an anonymous user posting from a range of Koren IP numbers insisting Zer0faults is a Merecat sock. That's your correspondent above, 221.146.211.193. At this point, Zer0faults has been checked 3 times and no evidence has appeared, so I think continuing to make a big deal of it would be counterproductive. (I personally don't put a lot of credibility behind anonymous accusations leveled at registered users.) I have no idea who used that ChoiceOne account to forge your sig; it doesn't seem to be an open proxy. The problem is that if it is a dynamic IP number (that is, assigned to different users daily or even hourly at random) there might be multiple established users who have used that IP in the last month and to disclose them all (and presumably round them up for questioning) would be a gross violation of their privacy, not to be undertaken except in case of serious, prolonged policy violations. (Of course the incident was serious to you, but there were only 2 edits on one day, so not serious enough to violate multiple users privacy.)

<dd>Yes, thanks a lot. There are really strange people around. From a wikipedian of another language version I even got emailed once in protest of valid orthography, and it turned out he had dedicated all of his time to it and even started an association for it. He had been banned for repeated obstruction and then started to email all users he found.

<p>I agree in principle with the need to call articles by names that are international recognisable and do not embed POV into the title, however your commit messages make no mention of a policy, and can be seen as a reduction of information (see Operation Iraqi Freedom), so it appeared that you were acting as a one man army. I apologise if any commit comments offended.</p>
<p>You obviously believe in this strongly ... why join <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Military_history_a13e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history">WikiProject-Military history</a> to tackle the problem with a diplomatic approach and the assistance of others. They have rough guidelines on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Military_history_a13e.html#Article_names" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Military history">article names</a>, but currently they do no have a list of articles that dont follow this guideline. Creating such a list as part of that project will allow a systematic improvement to take place.</p>
<p>Also, why not start by explaining on <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_operation.html" title="Military operation">Military operation</a> how these code names are arrived at, and provide examples. It would be good to see examples from various countries and US administrations, and thus back up the <i>propoganda</i> argument you make. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">Jayvdb</a> 00:45, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>To reflect on "Operation Just Cause", you were using "Invasion of Panama" as the new article name. However the eventual name was "United States invasion of Panama". If this had of been discussed before changes were made, lots of unnecessary edits and wasted time would have been avoided. That is why I suggested that this improvement to article titles is conducted as a project.</dd>
<dd>Please visit <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iraq_War_58f4.html" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a> and <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003_invasion_of_Iraq_768c.html" title="2003 invasion of Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a> -- they are separate articles.

<dl>
<dd>I didnt mention articles being moved. I am talking about the edits to other articles.</dd>
<dd>Also, I am not concerned about the redirects. Previously an article included the <b>text</b> <i>Operation Iraqi Freedom</i> (who cares where it redirected to -- imagine for a minute the article has been printed out), which meant the reader knew precisely which military operation the article referred to. When you change this to <i>Iraqi war</i> , that infomation is lost, and the reader needs to dig around to figure this out. You have been blinded by the importance of your project, and as a result are making small mistakes which is really annoying. To make matters worse, you have made the same tiny mistake on lots of articles.</dd>
<dd>To switch into a positive mode, stop making changes. Create a page on your user page and <b>propose</b> changes.

<p>The issue isn't really your changes so much as your methods for making them; you really should be discussing things—preferrably as general guidelines—first, and making edits to hundreds of pages second. Doing it the other way tends to be counterproductive at best (the ArbCom made a very insightful ruling in one case that "[he was] arguably completely technically correct — but he interacted so negatively with others that he actually convinced people he was not") and blows up into a repeat of the Danzig/Gdansk or AD/CE bloodbaths at worst. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 00:51, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Avoiding redirects and using a neutral point of view are well established policies. I do not know what you mean with "Danzig/Gdansk" or "AD/CE" but I am happy to discuss anything were I can improve my editing. On the other hand, I am very concerned about <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0faults</a> who refuses to do so. <a href="../../../a/%C3%B1/o/User%7EA%C3%B1oranza_d332.html" title="User:Añoranza">Añoranza</a> 00:59, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There were <i>huge</i> fights about whether the term <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danzig.html" title="Danzig">Danzig</a> or <a href="../../../g/d/a/Gdansk.html" title="Gdansk">Gdansk</a> should be used for the city, and whether AD or CE should be used for dates; both sides edit-warred to their version (because was "more" neutral) to the point that people started getting banned, and the issue still hasn't been resolved.</dd>
<dd>There's no ruling, in general, that operation names are <i>inherently</i> problematic; I think it would be best to come up with a general guideline on using them—in text and otherwise—before running around making massive changes. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 01:05, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not say they are inherently problematic. Most are propagandistic, not neutral, can be replaced, and consensus was to avoid them, so I avoid redirects.

<dd>"Desert Storm" and "Golden Pheasant" are less propagandistic - I do not even recall to have protested the first one. However, referring to the powers of nature and one of the most expensive metals is euphemist when actually labelling a military attack. Furthermore, the sheer fact that the names were chosen by one side and not used by the other shows they are not neutral. <a href="../../../a/%C3%B1/o/User%7EA%C3%B1oranza_d332.html" title="User:Añoranza">Añoranza</a> 01:27, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Seconded. This manner of conversation is rather impolite, at best.</dd>
<dd>To your more substantial point: the fact that they're <i>euphemisms</i> does not automatically disqualify them from meeting the requirements of NPOV (which is not necessarily "true" neutrality); we need mereley determine whether reputable outside sources have a consensus on which term(s) may be used. (Similarly, we use "Holocaust" rather than "German mass genocide", because that is the generally accepted term. Same thing with "Holy Roman Empire".) <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 01:40, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I remove provocative rhetorical questions by <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">User:Zer0faults</a> as I see no intent to fruitfully discuss and I find his hobby of posting endless innuendo everywhere obstructive. Sorry if this seems impolite, but I have had enough of this.</dd>
<dd>The fact that we use holocaust as an article title shows we regard it as sufficiently neutral. The fact that we do not have "Operation Just Cause" and the other propaganda names I listed as article titles shows we do not find them neutral. <a href="../../../a/%C3%B1/o/User%7EA%C3%B1oranza_d332.html" title="User:Añoranza">Añoranza</a> 01:46, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Err, not quite; all it shows is that we find that particular title to be the <i>best</i> one for the article. It says nothing at all about whether <i>other</i> titles for the same topic may or may not be sufficiently neutral; there are plenty of reasons other than neutrality for choosing an article title.</dd>
<dd>Which brings us back to my original point. There is <i><b>no</b></i> current policy that operational names are <i>inherently</i> inappropriate, so comprehensive changes away from them—particularly in the cases listed above, where there isn't even a propagandistic bent to the names—should not be undertaken in the manner of a blind edit war. If you'd like to avoid them even in cases where the consensus is that they pass the NPOV requirement, please start a general discussion (<a href="../../../m/i/l/WP%7EMILHIST_2318.html" title="WP:MILHIST">here</a> would be the most obvious place) about a guideline; but please don't just run roughshod over articles making changes that everyone but yourself seems to disagree with. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 01:53, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I already answered parts of this. The very fact that one side chose the term shows it is not neutral. "Operation Just Cause" was moved exactly because consensus was that I am right to find it not neutral. As I have focussed on cases where the propagandistic character of the operation name is striking and there has not been a single case presented where consensus found an operational name neutral I do not see in how far your comment is helpful. <a href="../../../a/%C3%B1/o/User%7EA%C3%B1oranza_d332.html" title="User:Añoranza">Añoranza</a> 01:57, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>History is written after the fact; just because one side chose the name (which tends to be true of a great many things, actually) doesn't mean it cannot be accepted as a suitable—or even the dominant—way of referring to something.</dd>
<dd>More concretely, though, I had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_Marine_Corps&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59189999" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_Marine_Corps&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=59189999" rel="nofollow">this</a> in mind. There is nothing "striking" about <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Desert_Storm_afe2.html" title="Operation Desert Storm">Operation Desert Storm</a>, hence my request that you discuss the issue first (or just, you know, don't change the ones that aren't really propaganda). <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 02:07, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I told you why I do not think it is appropriate. Please show me a case where an operation name after WWII became accepted and neutral standard. <a href="../../../a/%C3%B1/o/User%7EA%C3%B1oranza_d332.html" title="User:Añoranza">Añoranza</a> 02:09, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Arc_Light_8959.html" title="Operation Arc Light">Operation Arc Light</a>, perhaps? (Many other examples exist which are so small and obscure that they simply don't have any names besides the operational one. And why the <a href="../../../w/w/i/WWII_688e.html" title="WWII">WWII</a> cutoff point, incidentally? The US forces, at least, continued to use meaningless names for combat operations well into the Korean War.) <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 02:30, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As very few people will have heard of that operation you cannot say that the name became accepted and neutral standard. Neutral observers would not call it Arc Light but something like "storing of xyz weapons at Guam". Note that "Light" for a weapon is euphemist. As I wrote, the fact that a name appears to be meaningless does not mean it is neutral. If it was chosen by one side and is not used by the other side it is not neutral. WWII is kind of an exception as there is no other side does not exist any longer. However, if an operation that consisted of a war crime had been labelled something like enduring freedom/just cause/infinite justice, etc. it should not be moved either. <a href="../../../a/%C3%B1/o/User%7EA%C3%B1oranza_d332.html" title="User:Añoranza">Añoranza</a> 02:41, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Being chosen by one side does <b>not</b> automatically make the term unacceptable; neither does being euphemistic. Is there any reputable source that actually <i>disputes</i> the use of the term? (And plenty of "sides" in conflicts since WWII don't exist anymore, so I don't see how that would be a convincing argument.) <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 02:48, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Being chosen by one side and not used by the other makes it not neutral. While the Nazi regime and its Allies vanished and hardly anyone feels sorry about it even in Germany, Italy or Japan, many people accuse the US and Israel of breaking international rules in Lebanon, Grenada, Panama, and Iraq. <a href="../../../a/%C3%B1/o/User%7EA%C3%B1oranza_d332.html" title="User:Añoranza">Añoranza</a> 02:52, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But that has absolutely nothing to do with it. It is not Wikipedia's role to judge whether actions were right or wrong, or whether anyone should feel sorry for the defeated. We merely report what <i>others</i> have written on the topic; and we should therefore use the same terminology outside sources do, regardless of who was involved in the fighting. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 02:56, 18 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Of course it is not our role to judge. However, if we know that many people go as far as calling invasions "wars of aggression", "imperialism" or whatever, we know that using propaganda terms chosen by the government of one party are not neutral. <a href="../../../a/%C3%B1/o/User%7EA%C3%B1oranza_d332.html" title="User:Añoranza">Añoranza</a> 02:59, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>I am sorry to arrive so late in discussion, but some of the articles I have recently worked on have been involved in this quite extensive edit war. If there has been an exhaustive discussion and consensus reached already, please point me in that direction. Otherwise, I think you (Añoranza) need to calm down a bit. I completely understand that military operations are given codenames that reflect a bias, but that is the official name regardless. If an article is discussing the operation specifically, not just in general terms, it is probably informative to the reader to know its official name; not doing so would be a form of politically-correct self-censorship. Again, please point me in the right direction if there has been a full discussion about this, but all I've seen is nothing but edit after revert after edit between <a href="../../../a/%C3%B1/o/User%7EA%C3%B1oranza_d332.html" title="User:Añoranza">Añoranza</a> and <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0faults</a>.

<dd>I have no objection to what you write about articles discussing the operation specifically, where it is probably informative to the reader to know its official name, and I have already written so. However, there are very few such articles. In most articles, the propaganda names can be removed without losing anything. The reader interested in operation names can still find them in the articles he is directed to. Furthermore, I have actively participated in the discussion of this, my request to rename "operation just cause" met consensus, and if <a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults">Zer0faults</a> reverts avoided redirects and NPOV I cannot help him. <a href="../../../a/%C3%B1/o/User%7EA%C3%B1oranza_d332.html" title="User:Añoranza">Añoranza</a> 02:41, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

I am tired of this, remove all the NPA tags if you want, the point has been made repeatedly, I will bring this issue up again if you want to accuse others of removing tags you place on their page. Furthermore I think you should talk to the admin above and maybe you can see the other sides point of view, or maybe talk to the editors above that are telling you mass edits are not appropriate, or maybe just make a post on the military page as reccomended and just get a policy put in place. Good night Anoranza I will see you on the RfC talk page Monday as I think this warrants another day cool off between us. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 04:46, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. I am inclined to agree with you that operation names are not only biased but should be used sparingly. But if you want to change nearly every reference in wikipedia, you should definitely draw up a set of guidlines to follow yourself and for future editors. If it is agreed upon, then you won't have to worry about people reverting all of your edits. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operation codenames should only be used when:
<ul>
<li>the specific military action is being discussed from a military perspective</li>
<li>the article is describing a person or unit that participated in specific operations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Codenames should not be used when:
<ul>
<li>the action is being discussed in general terms</li>
<li>a neutral name for the action would be more descriptive than an unneutral codename</li>
<li>when there is doubt as to how to refer to the operation <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshdboz_c913.html" title="User:Joshdboz">Joshdboz</a> 11:32, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Propaganda names should not be used where avoidable. It does not depend on whether persons or units participated in specific operations. If the specific operation name is needed for a specific reason it can stay, if only the conflict is referred to a neutral name is appropriate. <a href="../../../a/%C3%B1/o/User%7EA%C3%B1oranza_d332.html" title="User:Añoranza">Añoranza</a> 21:24, 18 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please read the entire thing, while not appropriate for titles, unless its the most common name, they are appropriate for article space. IF you disagree with this then state it there. They will probably explain the policy to your further. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_ecbe.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 21:39, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Its not a discussion about you, so there is no disagreement with you. However the policy states operation names are permitted in article space, and if they are there should be footnoted unless the link points to the appropriate location. Now that your "redirects" have been fixed, the issue left is if the terms should be in the articles. You can see from the discussion that they are in fact ok to be in the articles.

<p>This case has closed and the final decision has been published at the link above.</p>
<p>To summarise, Añoranza is banned for one week and the principals in this matter are encouraged to enter into good faith negotiations regarding use of propagandistic operational codenames for which there are neutral alternative names in common use.</p>
