<p>Sozin is spelled Sozen. I have proof</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd be curious to see the proof... there seems to be a lot of discrepancy over this, though I did discover today that the <a href="http://www.nickelodeon.com.au/fullynick/tvshows/shows/index.php?show_id=56|" class="external text" title="http://www.nickelodeon.com.au/fullynick/tvshows/shows/index.php?show_id=56|" rel="nofollow">Official website (Australia)</a> website has it spelled as it "Sozin" (see the "Zuko" character page), so I'd think that's how it should be spelled unless you have some conflicting evidence. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EPrototime_62d7.html" title="User:Prototime">Prototime</a> 02:46, 4 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's not good proof but if you put closed captioning on a tv when somebody says Sozen it shows up as Sozen i don't know if that is good enough but there's my proof.
<dl>
<dd>Closed captioning is not always a 100% official transcript of the episode. Oftentimes, closed captioning will crop and rewrite what is actually said, so either the text can fit on the screen or the reader can understand the context easily. We can't be sure, then, if they read the script for the proper spelling of sozen/sozin.</dd>

<p>Shouldn't you guys update the part regarding Aang's bending abilities? I mean he's already pretty good (though not a master) in waterbeding and in earthbending, as we've seen in SOFN. But how did they do that in the past?</p>
<p>I beg to differ. I believe Aang has mastered <a href="../../../w/a/t/Waterbending.html" title="Waterbending">waterbending</a> and his bending status should be updated. Besides I dought that <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katara.html" title="Katara">Katara</a> will come up to Aang and say "Your a waterbending master now! Good for you!"

<p>May I suggest we change the main picture. All of the other characters have updated pictures that show them in season 2 but Aang's picture is still the same.

<dd>Not a bad thought, but I'm not sure which to use. Personally, I'd think the best would be something showing the darker, brooding side of him that's emergered.

<p>Do these characters really need their own sections under the Relationships header? I mean, they only appeared in one episode, probably never will again, and had no real lasting effect on the plot.--<a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyre2387_3b03.html" title="User:Fyre2387">Fyre2387</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../f/y/r/User_talk%7EFyre2387_93d0.html" title="User talk:Fyre2387">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fyre2387_382c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fyre2387">contribs</a>)</sup> 17:10, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is a very good point and has been seconded. With rumours that the show has been successful enough for a fourth season, these relationships will seem insignificant by the end. 202.72.187.152 17:50, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I posed a similar question on Zuko's page. I think we need to prune relationships as time progresses. Such that, Zuko and Song had an encounter but unless they have an encounter again their relationship is summarized on The Cave of Two Lovers and that should be enough. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeirToPendragon_b665.html" title="User:HeirToPendragon">H2P</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../h/e/i/User_talk%7EHeirToPendragon_c05a.html" title="User talk:HeirToPendragon">Yell at me</a> for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HeirToPendragon_68aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/HeirToPendragon">what I've done</a>)</sup> 23:04, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>After looking at the other characters I suggest we delete a few people in the relationships section. Many of them are just a small summary of the episode the minor character showed up in. I think we should limit the relationships to those who have interacted with the characters multiple times. Example would be that Iroh has no purpose on Toph's page (they met once and their meeting is summarized in The Chase) but Suki could stay on Sokka's due to two encounters having deep inner impacts on Sokka. However we'd also have to limit those characters who have had no real influence on the character in question, example being that Sokka has not influenced or done anything to affect Zuko and doesn't need to be on the page.</p>
<p>I think something like this needs to be done to allow the pages to be more direct. Lengthy does not necessarily mean its better.

<dd>Ok I can agree with you on the pictures removed after I actually looked at them. My main question is if this should be done to Zuko as well. Zuko's page is like 10 pages long and without the pictures it's boring and just looks bad (granted some can be shuffled away).

<p>Alright, the finale's ending was downright evil, especially for we, the editors bent on keeping only factual information in the Avatar articles. Unfortunately even I'm not sure what to make of the end of Crossroads of Destiny. Aang enters the Avatar State, allowing the seventh chakra to flow and separating him from worldy connections (Katara). However, Azula strikes him down, and the symbolic representation of Aang conquering the seventh chakra collapses around him. I'm almost certain we're going to have to say that it's not certain what this means- Kataangers'll rampage on us if we say outright that Aang has let go of Katara, and for another thing we really don't know for sure what this means for the upcoming season.</p>

<p>Has anyone noticed the fact that Aang and the rest of the airbenders are/were reminiscent of Tibetan Monks? One dead giveaway (which I just added) is explained in the trivia section:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>In "The Storm," it was shown that the four toys Aang chose that determined his destiny are a turtle (Water), a string-powered propeller (Air), a Hog-Monkey (Earth) and a drum (Fire)</i>. <i><b>This is the same procedure a child must go through in order to be recognized as the reincarnation of a <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tulku.html" title="Tulku">Tulku</a> Lama in <a href="../../../t/i/b/Tibetan_Buddhism_3b98.html" title="Tibetan Buddhism">Tibetan Buddhism</a>. According to the book Magic and Mystery in Tibet by <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexandra_David-Neel_3a65.html" title="Alexandra David-Neel">Alexandra David-Neel</a>, “A number of objects such as rosaries, ritualistic implements, books, tea-cups, etc., are placed together, and the child must pick out those which belonged to the late <a href="../../../t/u/l/Tulku.html" title="Tulku">tulku</a>, thus showing that he recognizes the things which were his in his previous life.</b></i></dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="../../../t/u/l/Tulku.html" title="Tulku">Tulku</a> Lamas reincarnate as many times as they see fit. This is very similar to Aang’s situation. There are a lot more similarities between airbenders and Tibetan Buddhists, but I can’t think of any right now as I just got home from work (9pm – 5am).

<dd>Maybe because with aliases some (non-observant) people might not be able to tell that Bonzu Pippenpaddleopsokololis the third (or however it's spelled) was Aang. With nicknames, it's kind of common knowledge. maybe. Should there be a nicknames section? Enough people have nicknames (Aang, Katara, Zuko, et cetera), maybe it should be added to the template. <a href="../../../b/a/g/User%7EBagpipeturtle_82a9.html" title="User:Bagpipeturtle">Bagpipeturtle</a> 22:31, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The whole Pippenpaddleopsokopolis thing should stay...Aang and Katara used them as their real names to get past the guards of the Earth Kingdom, so they're aliases. Same as how Zuko called himself "Lee" and his uncle "Mushi". Nicknames aren't used this way, they're simply ways of addressing a person if you already know their real name. <a href="../../../y/_/b/User%7EY_BCZ_9daf.html" title="User:Y BCZ">Y BCZ</a> 23:38, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Pippenpaddlewhatever was only used for one episode, and it was more for comedic effect than an actual alias. If Aang were to have been using that as a real assumed name, he would have made it more believable, like Zuko and Iroh (Lee/Junior and Mushi)'s in most of Season/Book 2. As for Twinkletoes, that's a nickname, and there's not really enough for any of the other characters, is there?

<p>This is just a personal opinion but I think the relationships aren't really needed for the character pages. It seems since the relationship pages were created, it has only sprouted more controversy on what is considered a relationship, and what is merely fandom. Add on to that, with a future season coming, there's only going to be more increase to that particular section.</p>
<p>The character pages (Mainly Zuko's and Aang's) are far too long and the character relationships is the only reasonable thing to cut out. And I personally think there already enough on the pages without relationships, to give anyone enough insight on the characters. <a href="../../../l/i/o/User%7ELionheart08_9914.html" title="User:Lionheart08">Lionheart08</a> 20:48, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I come by this site every so often because i enjoy watching this show, the animation is great and I think the story is very well told, having said this, i recently viewed the avatar: the last airbender: 'Aang' page and noticed that a couple of thing were odd, chiefly the use of the word 'fag' which appeard as Aang's name and also appeared in the throughout intro. Anyway, I don't want to judge, I do however think that if people are going to read this page that they should leave it as is unless it's relevant information. Vandalising pages on wikipedia can be fun, nonetheless, i would prefer reading this info without having to come by some stuff some bored guy wrote so he could have fun. Anyway, I edited the page a little so i hope it looks like it did originally before the derogitive terms were thrown about. Thats it for me all, and if you do see that kind of trash talk and find it offensive, do feel free to re-edit it and post a message like I did.</p>

<dd>We can't, but <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">the admins</a> can. It's a touchy subject, though. Page blocking and editor blocking/banning are things that are normally taken with heavy consideration. This is because either of those actions goes directly against the very foundation of Wikipedia which is stated in the main page: "The free encyclopedia that anyone can edit". So while users can be blocked, they first need to be reported and be a continuous offender in order to merit the "drastic" measure.</dd>
<dd>Pages get blocked even more rarely and how they decide what pages get blocked are a mystery to me. I do not see how the <a href="../../../i/c/o/Def_Jam%7E_Icon_5304.html" title="Def Jam: Icon">Def Jam: Icon</a> page warrants a block more than the Avatar pages. Go figure.</dd>

<p>Honestly, do we? I mean, its a a one time joke, I can pretty much guarantee they won't be using it again. I mean, OK, put it in the article somewhere, fine, but I just don't see that it needs to be in the infobox.

<p>While Aang might have been a bit goofy when picking such an unnecessarily amusing name for his alias, it was a serious attempt to obscure his identity and present a false name, which I'm pretty sure is what an alias is. It might not have been particularly successful, or even long-lasting, but it <i>was</i> an alias. <a href="../../../j/b/k/User%7EJBK405_a584.html" title="User:JBK405">JBK405</a> 20:51, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It was a one time alias. Zuko and Iroh's were for a good portion of season 2. This doesn't count and should not be there. -<a href="../../../d/y/l/User%7EDylan0513_8f4d.html" title="User:Dylan0513">Dylan0513</a> 21:08, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Zuko was only called "Junior" in a single episode, and that was only as a joke, too, (Iroh obviously enjoyed it) but that alias is on his page, and the Blind Bandit, Dong, and Kua Mei are all on Toph and Katara's oages, despite likewise only being in single episodes. <a href="../../../j/b/k/User%7EJBK405_a584.html" title="User:JBK405">JBK405</a> 21:18, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The Blind Bandit was a very different case than Bonzu Pipnpadawhatever, as Toph had been fighting the Earth Rumble competitions under this name on a previous occasion (she was addressed as the reigning champ, if I'm not mistaken). As for Dong and Kua Mei...are those the names Katara and Toph used to get into the Earth King's party in <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_of_Walls_and_Secrets_9946.html" title="City of Walls and Secrets">City of Walls and Secrets</a>? If it was, even that's questionable, as it was used once and only once, and Long Feng presumably later found they were lying. And Zuko's name got much more use than just one episode - I distinctly remember Iroh referring to Zuko as Junior/Lee in Ba Sing Se on more than one occasion (in the tea shop, I believe). Besides, Junior was actually more of a nickname ("Well, that [Lee] was his father's name, so we sometimes call him Junior" -Iroh in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cave_of_Two_Lovers_8a08.html" title="The Cave of Two Lovers">The Cave of Two Lovers</a>). <a href="../../../k/o/c/User%7EKochdude388_efc8.html" title="User:Kochdude388">Kochdude388</a> 22:07, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I'm quite sure that Iroh never used the nickname "Junior" other than in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Cave_of_Two_Lovers_8a08.html" title="The Cave of Two Lovers">The Cave of Two Lovers</a>, it was always Zuko when in private and Lee/Li (There seems to be confusion over which precise spelling) when in public (Or "My Nephew" or "Prince" or other such things). And yes, Dong and Kua Mei are the alias's Toph and Katara used when entering the Earth Kings party, and they're on the two character pages (And they have not been contested, as Bonzu has been). I think that frequency of use really shouldn't even be a factor here, because how much use a person gets out of something doesn't change what that something is; Bonzu was used as an alias of Aang and, even if it wasn't particularly effective, it still happened. <a href="../../../j/b/k/User%7EJBK405_a584.html" title="User:JBK405">JBK405</a> 22:15, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It was barely an alias. It was a joke that wasn't that funny. Kua Mei and Dong were way more important and had the theme of the scene before. Bonzu's random and a joke. Iroh's and Zuko's were used on more than one occasion in more than one episode. -<a href="../../../d/y/l/User%7EDylan0513_8f4d.html" title="User:Dylan0513">Dylan0513</a> 22:30, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's a questions of consistency, Fyre. Pure and simple. An alias is an alias regardless of when, why, or how it was used. Toph was only called the Blind Bandit in one episode, but it's an alias that all of us see as important because of its history. History is not important in defining an alias.</p>
<p>The nature of an alias is not of the essence, it only matters that it is, in fact, an alias. By definition. We can't exclude Bonzu simply because the name itself is somewhat silly. Mushi is somewhat silly as well, but it's still an alias. Used once or used often, it was used. Still in use or retired, they're still alias. We're not going to remove The Blue Spirit from Zuko even though he threw away the mask.</p>
<p>Bonzy needs to be kept for consistency, aliases need to be kept for organization. That's really the only thing that matters: consistency. We use all aliases or none at all. Being selective would be a double standard that is frowned upon.</p>
<p>What one THINKS of an alias's worth does not matter. That is an OPINION. All that matters is this: was it ever an alias in the context of the show? If the answer is yes, then we have ourselves a FACT which MUST be presented for the sake of CONSISTENCY regardless of how we FEEL about it. <a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESage_of_Ice_3d30.html" title="User:Sage of Ice">Sage of Ice</a> 22:34, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm afraid I can't agree. This particular alias is an unimportant detail. Others, Lee, Mushi, Blind Bandit, and so on, were all things people were known as for a significant time. An infobox ought to list essential facts, leaving details to the article's content. This is not an essential fact by any means. I think you're presenting a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_alternative.html" title="False alternative">false alternative</a> in this "all or nothing" argument. Nothing stops us from using some judgment, and blanket statements tend to do more harm than good.--<a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyre2387_3b03.html" title="User:Fyre2387">Fyre2387</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../f/y/r/User_talk%7EFyre2387_93d0.html" title="User talk:Fyre2387">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fyre2387_382c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fyre2387">contribs</a>)</sup> 22:44, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Using one's judgment causes one to omit facts. Wikipedia is based on facts and nothing more. That shouldn't change. One's judgment is no different from one's opinion. You judge the alias as expendable. I judge it as needed. No difference from "I think it's expendable" or "In my opinion, it is expendable". We can only judge what is and isn't fact, not what facts are worthy of presentation. We CAN, however, judge HOW a fact is presented. If you do not like Bonzu or June or any of the others in the infoboxes, then perhaps the infoboxes should be changed to display "Important aliases" instead.</dd>
<dd>Once again, importance is RELATIVE, however, and is something that heavily relies on how one PERCEIVES the fact as opposed to the undeniable truth that it IS a fact. <a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESage_of_Ice_3d30.html" title="User:Sage of Ice">Sage of Ice</a> 22:52, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>(un-indenting)We most assuredly can judge which facts are worthy of presentation. Truth is not Wikipedia's sole qualification for inclusion. We can indeed discuss this sort of issue and attempt to reach consensus. That's what talk pages are for.</p>
<p>Regardless, I'm not making a case that this should be completely omitted, I'm simply saying it doesn't need to be listed in the infobox. We don't list everything about a character in an infobox, so we're already making a judgment. We don't, for example, say Aang sometimes Airbends when he sneezes in the infobox. I could edit the infobox, add a field for "Things done while sneezing", but that wouldn't make sense. Why? Its just not important enough to mention there. Unless we wish to inculde the entire article in the infobox, we're already making judgments, one more is perfectly fine.--<a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyre2387_3b03.html" title="User:Fyre2387">Fyre2387</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../f/y/r/User_talk%7EFyre2387_93d0.html" title="User talk:Fyre2387">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fyre2387_382c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fyre2387">contribs</a>)</sup> 23:10, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Like I said, we can only judge HOW it's presented. And that's exactly what we've done with the infoboxes and what is included in them. Once again, like I mentioned before, if you want to change how a fact is presented, then you need to change the category. Changing it to "Important aliases" would be a change in the presentation. Keeping it as just "Alias" submits it to consistency. Consistency is more important than opinions on worth. That is all it comes down to.</dd>
<dd>Now, if we were to change the infobox to "Important aliases", where exactly would you include Bonzu in the article? It doesn't really fit anywhere unless we want to toss it into trivia. <a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESage_of_Ice_3d30.html" title="User:Sage of Ice">Sage of Ice</a> 23:16, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Frankly, I think the need to add the word "important" is a bit of a <a href="../../../s/h/r/Template%7EShrubbery_e450.html" title="Template:Shrubbery">demand for a shrubbery</a>, but I can live with it as a compromise (although "Significant aliases" may be a better choice of words). In this particular case, I'd just add it to the bit about the visit to Omashu, being that that was the occasion in which it occurred/was relevant.--<a href="../../../f/y/r/User%7EFyre2387_3b03.html" title="User:Fyre2387">Fyre2387</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../f/y/r/User_talk%7EFyre2387_93d0.html" title="User talk:Fyre2387">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fyre2387_382c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fyre2387">contribs</a>)</sup> 23:24, 8 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's hardly a demand for a shrubbery. If anything, your request would better fit that category since there's no real reason within canonicity to remove Bonzu from the infobox. You want it gone because you feel it's unimportant even though it played a vital role in allowing the characters to meet King Bumi in Omashu. So you see, within canon, Bonzu should stay. I was offering the compromise not for my sake, but for yours. I only care about consistency. If the infoboxes (for all the characters) read "Significant Aliases" instead, then I have no qualms with Bonzu being removed since there is no consistency being broken. Same logic would then also apply to Kua Mei, Dong, etc.</dd>
<dd>Personally, I think that the need to remove Bonzu from the infobox just because it "makes the thing ugly" is being all too picky for all the wrong reasons. It does more good than harm staying there. <a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESage_of_Ice_3d30.html" title="User:Sage of Ice">Sage of Ice</a> 03:15, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Oh wow would ya look at all this. For that "harm good" bit, no not really. Yeah its not killing any puppies but its not particularly helping anything either. Seriously though, it was from the early days of the show, it was this little joke (along with the Kangaroo Island bit), and its just, eh. You'd think they'd make a reference to it by now. ~Father's Wish 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>They haven't referenced the Blind Bandit since the eponymous episode. They may mention her fighting days (mostly through Xin Fu and Master Yu) but they have never again called her by that name. Doesn't mean the name didn't serve a purpose and isn't worth mentioning...</dd>
<dd>Really, I don't know what's so hard to get here... it was an alias, like it or not. Stop trying to argue importance and just accept the fact that it is what it is.
