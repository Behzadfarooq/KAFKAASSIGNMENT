<p>If you can find a valid tag that expresses why Image:Laurynhillessence.jpg can be used under the <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">fair use guidelines</a>, please replace the {{current tag name}} tag that you have placed on it with that tag.

<p>Hi there. Thanks for uploading the cover for "Candyman" at Image:CandymanCover.jpg. The image has been removed before, and I'm guessing that it's because people believe that it is not the real cover. If possible, would you mind providing a link to where you found the image or how you obtained it? <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 03:02, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
