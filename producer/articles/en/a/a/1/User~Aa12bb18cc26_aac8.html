	    <p>Summary and Commentary of Ayn Rand's "Atlas shrugged" ini 4/23/2006</p>
<pre>
      William Vanderbilt, who said "The public be damned." does not quite fit in with Ayn Rand's heroic figures. He inherited his wealth with which acquired six railroads that were built by somebody else and also he gave huge amounts to charitable institutions including the YMCA. "The Public be damned" was said in reply to a proposal that the New York Central be run as a public trust. More apt, but taking a little longer would have been, "What the hell do you think I am doing now?" 
    I am currently on page 490 of the 35th Anniversary edition (Signet,1985) with an introduction by Leonard Peikoff (C 1992).I gave myself permission to start writing my thoughts about these 1040
</pre>
<p>pages of fine print, produced in the grand Russian tradition of Tolstoy and Dostoyevski. Any Rand was born, 1905 in Russia and left in 1926 in view of her disgust with the fact that the Kerensky government failed allowing the Bolsheviks to sieze everything that was left in Russia after the war.</p>
<pre>
     I feel that at this point at 49% through I see the gist of everything Rand is saying, though I will modify my comments if sometning  new and unexpected turns up between now and the end. I consider that the book was written during the Eisenhower-Nixon administration. I am recalling in this context the start
</pre>
<p>of what is known as the "rust belt". I also recall riding West on a train and being told that that was the last passenger train running on that line, unless the President intervenes at the last moment. Amtrak was not yet born.</p>
<pre>
     But what we have here is an allegory and a morality tale. It is the tale of the "righteous victim" on the one hand and the inventive, intelligent industrial entrepreneur, on the other who "victimizes" by means of the single minded purpose of the industry he/she is building. We have an edgame of a world catastrophe, in which most countries were already. "Peoples' States". 
     But first lets go to what people were saying and the news reporting during Eisenhower-Nixon? The McCarthy hearings were on when this 'Tail-gunner' Joe claimed he knew of an exact number of Communists in the State Department. Oh, people said, even if he lied and fabricated he raised an important issue. As if the issue had not been raised before when there was a panic about the Russians being able to land troops here by helicopter. Or when President Truman's failed fight for civil rights was somehow linked to being soft on Communism. Or how the Marshall Plan could only be saved by linking it to the fight against Communism. (A Full Life, Helen Gahagen Douglas) Mao had comppleted the takeover of China. The U.S. Navy had been throwing as many shells on Quemoy Island as their ships had done in the Pacific WWII. The worst insult was Fidel's ousting Batista right next to our shore. 
     The Russians were the big threat, especially after they built the Bomb when Fuchs confirmed Kurchatov and then the Great Big ones. While they were threatening us, actual damage to us happening were continuing layoffs from shutdowns such as Youngstown Sheet and Tube and International Harvester. I H had only a few years ago produced the world's largest propeller shaft. 
     And there were the Existentialists. Existentialism born was positive and uplifting in asserting that we as individuals create our life, our identity as we go along. But purveyors of Despair complained that the frame or our existence was that there was no one telling us what do do and that makes us so lonely.
     Then we had the anthesis; "Positive thinking". Hook ourselves to "overhead" and "overhead" would make is happy.
     But who are the heroes in Rand's morality tale and who are the victims? The heroes are self made industrialists and engineers and the villians are the hypocritical public who do not apperciate the benefits of self made people investing labor and money.
