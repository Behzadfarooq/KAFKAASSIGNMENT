<dd>Fine by me&#160;:-) Regarding research on articles about Racism, Slavery, etc, I'm currently pre-occupied in preventing [User:KazakhPol] from labelling an Islamic group <a href="../../../h/i/z/Hizb_ut-Tahrir_ba47.html" title="Hizb ut-Tahrir">Hizb ut-Tahrir</a> as terrorist, he has yet to provide once referenced incident of HT being involved or linked to any terrorism. Rather other users and myself have provided a bulk of evidence to the contrary. He also seems to want to <a href="../../../s/e/n/Sensationalise.html" title="Sensationalise">sensationalise</a> all things related to Islamism, viewing it as a terrorist monologue <a href="../../../a/a/l/User%7EAaliyah_Stevens_b9e9.html" title="User:Aaliyah Stevens">Aaliyah Stevens</a> 16:45, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The State Department does consider the ISF a terrorist organization<a href="http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/rpt/fto/2801.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/rpt/fto/2801.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> so your entire refutation of the Heritage Foundation's reliability just flew out the window, <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazakhPol_c9da.html" title="User:KazakhPol">KazakhPol</a> 18:45, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Read your own link regarding FIS, translated as the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Salvation_Front_0842.html" title="Islamic Salvation Front">Islamic Salvation Front</a>; the state department does not list FIS as terrorist, even in the out-of-date list you link which is from 1999, not like latest one I referred to <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/fs/37191.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/fs/37191.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. And before you argue about the acronym 'FIS' that's how the state department refer to them when they mention that they won the elections: <i>"... in early 1992 after Algiers voided the victory of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS)"</i> <a href="../../../a/a/l/User%7EAaliyah_Stevens_b9e9.html" title="User:Aaliyah Stevens">Aaliyah Stevens</a> 10:19, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It does list it... are you saying that the political and militant factions dont equate? At the very least the link shows the Jamestown Foundation wasnt making stuff up. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazakhPol_c9da.html" title="User:KazakhPol">KazakhPol</a> 06:55, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry I'm getting rather frustrated with you're repeated inability to cognise a simple fact in plain english, FIS (<a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Salvation_Front_0842.html" title="Islamic Salvation Front">Islamic Salvation Front</a>) is not listed by the state department as a foreign terrorist organisation, and there is <b>no mention of any military faction of FIS there either</b>. Even in Algeria FIS is not designated as a terrorist group, rather it was simply banned. <a href="../../../a/a/l/User%7EAaliyah_Stevens_b9e9.html" title="User:Aaliyah Stevens">Aaliyah Stevens</a> 13:06, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>hello AS, i thought i'd try offering some advice as i see you're getting a little frustrated on Talk:Hizb ut-Tahrir. content disputes <a href="../../../n/a/m/WP%7ENAM_9e2a.html" title="WP:NAM">draw the extreme ire</a> of many editors who fall into them (which is pretty much everyone). sometimes you feel you're having to repeat things again and again, whilst at the same time perceiving that the other side simply refuses to listen. it's always important to <a href="../../../c/o/o/WP%7ECOOL_e649.html" title="WP:COOL">keep a cool head</a> and maintain your composure, overly asserting yourself with caps or boldface can come across as aggressive or uncivil. i totally understand the sentiments experienced when people are behaving in an <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/DICK" class="extiw" title="m:DICK">uncomprimising</a> manner. unfortunately, that is part and parcel of the encyclopaedia: you have to deal with people you don't see eye to eye with. moreso on Islam-related articles: emotions are high on all sides and you'll almost always see talk-page brawling on some article or another.</p>
<p>if talk page discussions aren't working, then there are <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">other ways</a> to try sorting out the dispute: you shouldn't feel that you're being compelled to have to try making someone understand something (which you may see as very basic). i would sincerely suggest you set up a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERfC_a13a.html" title="WP:RfC">RfC (request for comment)</a> if you find that you've exhausted the avenue of discussion. thanks. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItaqallah_7a9f.html" title="User:Itaqallah"><small><b><font color="#029DDD">ITAQALLAH</font></b></small></a> 23:12, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Assalamu Alaikum, I noticed your comments on the Sunni Islam talk page. Not that I particularly care about the state of links in a wikipedia article but I just though I'd comment on some of the stuff you wrote. Please don't consider this criticism of any kind. I'm just mentioning some things which I think are relevant.</p>
<p><i>We should not put culturally specific (i.e. Pakistani/Indian urdu barelwi) sites on this page,</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Every scholar of Islam has some cultural specificity. Even Al-Ghazzali whose brand of Sufism (with it's emphasis on austerity) is suited to Persians rather than to (say) the Turks who benefited more from Imam Rumi etc.
<dl>
<dd>I agree, but not to the narrow extent that subcontinental 'scholars' have done so, many of which don't even speak arabic, (so would hardly qualify to be Scholars), e.g. some have even gone to the extent of claiming Urdu is the language of Islam, even for arabic speakers. Although you may believe that Ghazali was culturally specific, he was universally accepted throughout the world, among Sunni, Shia, and non-Muslims (who referred to him as algazal). <a href="../../../a/a/l/User%7EAaliyah_Stevens_b9e9.html" title="User:Aaliyah Stevens">Aaliyah Stevens</a> 16:52, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>this is not about Sunni islam of the barelwi persuation in the subcontinent, and no major Sunni Scholars came from there in the development of sufism or Sunni Islam in the first few hundred years.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>That's inaccurate. I'm a Keralite (which happens to be the only state in India with a Shafi'i majority amongst the muslims). Islam started here at the time of the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) himself when one of the local kings visited him after beholding one of his miracles (<a href="http://www.jaihoon.com/watan/perumal.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jaihoon.com/watan/perumal.htm" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>). Also, there are scholars like Zainiddin Mallibari who lived quite long ago. As for the northern parts of India where the Hanafi madhab is more established, there are scholars from there who have contributed to Islam and Sufism quite a bit. A look at the <a href="../../../m/u/j/Mujaddid.html" title="Mujaddid">Mujaddid</a> article should show that. I'm not sure about the time periods though so maybe you're right in this regard.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Yes, none have come from the subcontinent, in the formation years of Sunni Kalam, and theology, i.e. the period of the 4 great Sunni Imams, or even a few hundred years after that. The closest thing was Abu Hanifah, whose grandfather originated from Kabul.<a href="../../../a/a/l/User%7EAaliyah_Stevens_b9e9.html" title="User:Aaliyah Stevens">Aaliyah Stevens</a> 16:52, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>Barelwis do not exist anywhere except in that region. I find the notion that Sufism=Barelwis disingenious on the part of Barelwis, because sufism is much bigger than Barelwis.</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>That's true. It's just that majority of the people in India who have a Tariq and follow a more traditional path are Barelwis. Which is not to demean the Deobandi Ulema who are great too.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I admit that Barelwis are one of the largest Sufi sub-groups in the subcontinent, however they've only been around since the British colonial period, and there is evidence (not proof) to suggest thier founder collaborated with the colonialists against the Muslims who resisted the British occupation.<a href="../../../a/a/l/User%7EAaliyah_Stevens_b9e9.html" title="User:Aaliyah Stevens">Aaliyah Stevens</a> 16:52, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>and there is links to Imam Ghazali who was the most famous Sufi scholar on earth</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>He was definitely one of the greatest. The world has benefitted a lot from him and may Allah continue to spread his Barakah. I just worry that if you idolise him too much, you're in danger of looking down on other friends of Allah and of injuring yourself spiritually. Not that I disagree at all. I hope you understand.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Rest assured that I do not look down upon any of the Awliyaa, I just don't like the very narrow, blinkered approach to sufism of some of my Barelwi brothers and sisters, who do takfir on other Sunnis, and claim they are more significant than they are, or even claim exclusivity to the mantle of the Ahl-as-sunnah, claim their leaders are the Mujadids, or the Shaykh of Islam. They seem to self-aggradise too much. <a href="../../../a/a/l/User%7EAaliyah_Stevens_b9e9.html" title="User:Aaliyah Stevens">Aaliyah Stevens</a> 16:52, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I won't hold my breath. If you were convinced of the existence of God by the Kalam argument Aaliyah, maybe you can explain to me why you disbelieve in the <a href="../../../a/c/t/Actual_infinite.html" title="Actual infinite">actual infinite</a>? <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 01:31, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Firstly, please don't have fights on my userpage. I have taken Aminz advice on board. Secondly Arrow740 has raised an important question regarding Kalaam. Arrow740, the way <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orientalist.html" title="Orientalist">orientalists</a> study Islam is very skewed, they carry paradigms, ill informed notions of context, form disjointed conclusions, and lack a background (which is not their fault) in understanding Islam. You can't understand a watch, by studying a single cog, without knowing how it works and fits in with the rest of the system of cogs. The best non-muslim students of Islam are usually Arabs like <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Said_407a.html" title="Edward Said">Edward Said</a>, who although are not Muslims, have an appreciation of the language of Islam, and it's background. The Kalaam arguments are not one argument as understood in the west, it is a whole host of arguments attempting to provide rational evidence for the existence of a creator.</p>
<p>Now that I have given a background to what I was going to say, rest assured that I do not reject actual infinites in maths, only that in maths it is a human construct. The Kalaam arguments presented in the English language do a disservice to it, the best books in English I have found available on this topic, are <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-juwaini.html" title="Al-juwaini">al-juwaini</a>'s, but they suffer from poor translations. The Kalam argument does not necessitate that you reject infinites, only that you rationally observe that unlimited things don't exist; infinity in one aspect is still limited in others, but being unlimited means no limits in any aspect. This is one reason why I also reject the <a href="../../../w/a/h/Wahabi.html" title="Wahabi">Wahabi</a> or <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salafi.html" title="Salafi">Salafi</a> creed in Islam and <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthropomorphism.html" title="Anthropomorphism">Anthropomorphism</a> because it places limits on the unlimited, as does <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinitarian.html" title="Trinitarian">trinitarian</a> theology in Christianity (not the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Unitarian.html" title="Unitarian">unitarian</a> Christians). I don't believe in actual infinites in tangible material being, because I reject the notion that time is infinite. Actual infinity is used usually to argue against the existence of an unlimited eternal creator. For an actual infinite to exist, time would also have had to exist infinitely, which would mean that time had an infinite number of 'iterations' to reach this point in time, which would never have got here, if it had to get through infinite iterations before. <a href="../../../a/a/l/User%7EAaliyah_Stevens_b9e9.html" title="User:Aaliyah Stevens">Aaliyah Stevens</a> 12:26, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You said, "I don't believe in actual infinites in tangible material being, because I reject the notion that time is infinite." Your argument was: "For an actual infinite to exist, time would also have had to exist infinitely, which would mean that time had an infinite number of 'iterations' to reach this point in time, which would never have got here, if it had to get through infinite iterations before." You are still envisioning a beginning of time. If time had no beginning, and no matter how far back you look you will still have further to look, then there is no problem with an infinite amount of time before this moment. There is no proof that there is no beginningless series of events. Just because Aristotle said that there can be no actual infinite doesn't make it so. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 19:02, 13 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I don't disbelieve in the infinity of time because Aristotle said so, I believe that if it was infinite it would not have reached the current point, because if you have an infinity to cover you will never reach a 'current' point, as we do in time. Think about it, if you had an infinite distance to cover before you reach a certain point, you would never reach it. Anyway. I'm not going to consume my talk page with this argument, it was nice talking. <a href="../../../a/a/l/User%7EAaliyah_Stevens_b9e9.html" title="User:Aaliyah Stevens">Aaliyah Stevens</a> 08:36, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your argument applies in the situation of math as well, where it is more clearly false. So the argument is wrong. In fact it is certainly possible that there was no first instant, and our universe is the current one of a chain that goes back infinitely far into time and forward infinitely far into time. <a href="../../../a/r/r/User%7EArrow740_2a2c.html" title="User:Arrow740">Arrow740</a> 22:33, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You have clearly not understood my point, and I am not claiming a first instant as an axiom for my argument. Anyway, I will not have my talk page consumed by this debate anymore, thanks again for the discussion, but let's leave it now. <a href="../../../a/a/l/User%7EAaliyah_Stevens_b9e9.html" title="User:Aaliyah Stevens">Aaliyah Stevens</a> 09:07, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Muhammad Said:</p>
<p>"God has said: Three people I will deal with on the Day of Judgement: someone who gives in my name who betrays, a man who enjoyed the money of capturing selling a free man, and a man who employed someone who did his job, but did not pay him” (narrated by Al-Bukhari)</p>
<p>"There are three categories of people against whom I shall myself be a plaintiff on the Day of Judgement. Of these three, one is he who enslaves a free man" (al-Bukhari and Ibn Majjah)</p>
<p>"Whoever slaps his slaves or strikes them, his only atonement is to free them" (narrated by Muslim on authority of ibn (Caliph) Umar).</p>
<p>"Whoever kills his slave, we will kill him"[31]</p>
<p>In early Islam, neither a Muslim nor a Christian or Jew could be enslaved.(ref John Esposito (1998) p.40)</p>
