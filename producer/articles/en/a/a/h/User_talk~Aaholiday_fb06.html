<p>One on One was an American sitcom which aired on UPN. One on One can also be seen on Trouble in the UK which is still showing. The series stars Flex Alexander as a single sportscaster, who becomes a full-time dad when his teenage daughter moves in with him when his ex-wife decides to accept a job out of the country.</p>

<p>[edit] Premise The sitcom takes place in Baltimore, Maryland. Sportscaster Flex Washington (Flex Alexander) reluctantly gives up his bachelor ways when his 14-year-old daughter, Breanna (Kyla Pratt), decides to move in with him after his ex-wife (guest star Tichina Arnold) decides to accept a job offer out of the country.</p>
<p>[edit] Supporting Characters Duane Knox (Kelly Perine) is Flex's best friend and godfather to Breanna. He is a used car salesman and a constant presence in their lives. Also around were Breanna's best friend, Spirit (Sicily Sewell), and Arnaz (Robert Ri'chard), a rock-star wanna-be whom Breanna develops a crush for.</p>
<p>[edit] Later developments One on One was created by Eunetta T. Boone, who later devised Cuts as a spinoff from One on One with some character crossovers. In an episode airing on One on One, entitled "Phatheadz", special guest star Marques Houston returns as Flex's brother, Kevin Barnes when a hair-care mogul buys their family barbershop, "Phatheadz", and forces his spoiled daughter Tiffany (Shannon Elizabeth) to co-manage the salon with Kevin. Although the episode served as a backdoor pilot in hopes of winning a time-slot on the 2004-2005 fall season, the series (renamed as Cuts) later debuted as a mid-season replacement in 2005. Characters from both shows made occasional guest appearances on the other show.</p>
<p>The fourth season marked the final season for Kelly Perine and Sicily Sewell (the actors were fired due to the network issuing pay cuts to some of their series for the upcoming 2005-2006 season). In order to keep the show going, the writers and producers decided to take the series in a new direction for the fifth (and current) season. After graduating from high school, Breanna decides to move from Baltimore to attend college in Los Angeles with Arnaz by her side. Wanting to pursue films, Flex Alexander decided to appear in only a few episodes, allowing his character, Flex, to occasionally visit Breanna when his job allows.</p>
<p>[edit] New Characters Four new characters were added to the show for the fifth season. Cash Bagen (Jonathan Chase), a cocky photographer who aspired to be a filmmaker; Lisa Sanchez (Camille Mana), a materialistic, underachieving college student; Darrell "D-Mack" McGinty (Ray-J), the hip-hop obsessed college student is really just another boy from the suburbs; and Sara Crawford (Nicole Paggi), a stylish, career-challenged young woman who was constantly in search of love.</p>
<p>[edit] Recurring Characters [edit] Season 1 Ron Canada as Richard, Flex's father. Joan Pringle as Eunice, Flex's mother. Tamala Jones as Tonya, an old girlfriend of Flex's. Tichina Arnold as Nicole Barnes, Flex's ex-wife and Breanna's mother. Holly Robinson Peete as Stacy, Flex's co-worker. Khanya Mkhize as Ginger, Breanna's rival and Arnaz's former girlfriend. [edit] Season 2 Omar Gooding as Malik, a barber at Phatheadz. Rashaan Nall as Walt, a barber at Phatheadz. Shondrella Avery as Candy, a nail stylist at Phatheadz and love interest for Duane. Melissa De Sousa as Natalie Odessa, Breanna's teacher who later dates Flex. Josh Henderson as Josh, Breanna's new love interest after her break-up with Arnaz. Kim Coles as Leilani Jones, Spirit's mother. [edit] Season 3 Edward "Grapevine" Fordham Jr as Ace Fields, a new barber at Phatheadz. [edit] Season 4 Saskia Garel as Danielle, Flex's girlfriend. [edit] Season 5 Kel Mitchell as Manny Sellers, the former child actor and Breanna's landlord. Ernie Grunwald as Benjamin Brandy Norwood as Michelle, D-Mack's sister</p>
