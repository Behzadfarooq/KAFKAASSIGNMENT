<ul>
<li>Image:NewASAnti-Semiticposter.jpg Photograph of a placard at an antiwar rally, under a creative commons license. However, it is obviously a <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/commons:Derivative_work" class="extiw" title="commons:commons:Derivative_work">commons:Derivative work</a>, zombietime does not claim to be the artist, ergo no permission from the original author and thus we can only use it as fair use. (This image alone generated quite a bit of vitriol on the talk page, so I loathe getting into this.)</li>
<li>Image:FrenchCemetery103004-01.jpg Photo of nazi symbols graffitied on some french cemetary. Fails 1 (anyone could take a photo of such, or make one as this /specific/ incident is not important), 8 (who can't figure out what a swastica on a tombstone looks like?) and the litmus test of the fair use policy.</li>
<li><a href="../../../p/r/o/Image%7EProtocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion_2005_Syria_al-Awael.jpg_456f.html" title="Image:Protocols of the Elders of Zion 2005 Syria al-Awael.jpg">Image:Protocols of the Elders of Zion 2005 Syria al-Awael.jpg</a> Book cover of an anti-Semitic book (well, I'm assuming, I cannot read it). If the book was discussed it might be fair use, but it is just thrown in there haphazardly without "critical commentary". Does not contribute much to the article (8).</li>
<li><a href="../../../o/c/t/Image%7EOctopusNAS1.jpg_f950.html" title="Image:OctopusNAS1.jpg">Image:OctopusNAS1.jpg</a> A Nazi propoganda image. It has a spurious PD-because tag (see <a href="../../../p/d/_/WP%7EPD_9540.html#World_War_II_images" title="WP:PD">WP:PD#World_War_II_images</a>). Anyone can draw a representation of this, the specific one does not matter, etc so fair use is a no go (imo).</li>

<p>Most of these also fail point 10 on specififying the copyright holders per 10 and the barest of fair use rationales when needed. FWIW, I think somone needs to go through all of SlimVirgin's uploads in particular. Many copy/paste fair use rationales and some things that are just plain wrong. <a href="../../../h/i/t/Image%7EHitlerwithdeer.GIF_eb8c.html" title="Image:Hitlerwithdeer.GIF">Image:Hitlerwithdeer.GIF</a>, Image:Hitlerdog.GIF (dubious PDs, no information given); Image:Judeasamaria.jpg, Image:Wieseldeathmarch.gif maps are 99% of the time not fair use, it is even listed as a counterexample!; <a href="../../../p/a/m/Image%7EPAMegrahihostage.jpg_8976.html" title="Image:PAMegrahihostage.jpg">Image:PAMegrahihostage.jpg</a> doesn't seem to be valid PD; Image:Weisbaden-Duggan.gif a map, labeled PD... that even has "© 2001 Microsoft Corportaion Alle Rechte vorbehalten" (all rights reserved) on it, huh?; many without any source data <a href="../../../p/r/i/Image%7EPrimoLevi.gif_ef9f.html" title="Image:PrimoLevi.gif">Image:PrimoLevi.gif</a>, Image:DavidIckeprotest.gif, Image:Greer4.jpg; etc, but there are a decent number to go through.

<dd>I was intending to do a flying visit here, so I haven't given this full attention yet. However, on the bulleted points I cannot find any fault with your logic. Only a few of these could <i>ever</i> be fair use. (I haven't looked at the article yet.) On Slim, I love her like a brother from another mother, so the thought of getting into a copyright stoush with her? Feh. But I am nothing if not dogged, so I'll look it over in the near future. If my heart breaks and my children become orphans, on your head be it. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span></dd>

<dd>I placed a list on his talk page. He's done some fine, he's got 9 over the last 3 days that were blatantly early (I have some minor tolerance for ones done on the 5th day, mostly because there can be timestamp issues). I've made it clear which ones I have an issue with, and the response was hostility. I have three options: 1) try to correct his behavior, 2) bring every early close to DRV, or 3) Escalate it to the point where he'll be involuntarily forced to curb his actions. I don't want 3, and the community doesn't want 2. Sadly, 1 has been met with hostility. I'm not going to ignore it, so either the behavior must change or you'll have to be the one to be willing to mentor him on how to consistently do it right. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 03:04, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Think of this as option 1.5. I don't have any reason to consider either one or the other of you as anything but reasonable, I'd like to think that I'm impartial to a fault. I <i>do</i> understand that you've made the same points on SM's talk, and that it wasn't going well. Here we can have a second go at talking, even if it means saying some of the same things again. But to begin with at least, it would be best if we:
<ul>
<li>Left all the previous discussion behind,</li>
<li>Limited ourselves to factual statements, and</li>
<li>All agreed that some good will come of this.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm working my way through these, giving as much my opinion on the quality of the debate as anything. I'm leaving aside <i>for now</i> the question of how valid an early close is. That being said, am I reading these date stamps wrong or were several of these closed early and <i>not</i> noted as such in the closing edit summaries?

<dd>You might want to check the log for August 16th, for some reason, all of those are in there. And those are the ones I closed today.

<dd>So something happened, not sure what. All I can say is that I closed them from the last log on the main AfD page. Right after a fresh log is added (a new AfD day), I go to the last log and close all that I see can be. If someone got the timestamps wrong, or placed them there by accident is beyond my scope. That would require some digging I suppose. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">SynergeticMaggot</a> 07:43, 21 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Aaron. I didnt realize we were going to be anal about the timestamps. If this is the case, then every single AfD I've closed has been early. I dont go by the 120 minute rule for closing obvious keeps per consensus, let alone speedy's. So can we leave jokes about smoking crack behind, and become productive?

<dd>I can't even easily find the ones I as protesting anymore, but this is the kind of flippancy about the timing that I worry about.

<dd>I'd really just like a little <i>time</i> to look over the contended closes, and to get a better picture of SynergeticMaggot's closing practices. Both of you seem ready to go at it hammer-and-tongs, however. There are a couple of things that bear mentioning for everyone involved:
<ul>
<li>Having someone put the microscope to your actions is never fun, but being defensive about them never helps. We're all human, we're all doing the best we can, and we all are dedicated to improving the encyclopedia.</li>
<li>It's easy to read the wrong thing into someone's bare text when you're on the defensive. That means <i>both</i> only reading what the person actually types <i>and</i> being careful what you type. I've put my foot into it with the second already.</li>
<li>This <i>should</i> be just a couple of mates having a chat. It's not the Spanish Inquisition, and nothing binding is going to come of this. And it's probably going to take a while.</li>
<li>I should have said this at the start: <b>I'm slow.</b> If that's a problem for anyone, no harm no foul if they want ot try and find someone else.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So, I'll keep doing my thing here, but maybe both of you should think about other stuff for a little while. Avoid each other, avoid closing AfDs, take this page off your watch list. I'll get back to you pretty soon.</dd>

<dd>I'm not at all worried about the microscope. I've been through one RfA and it toughened me up very nicely. Since we are admitting mistakes, I should admit one of my own. I sometimes if not always, fail to give actual reasons for my closes, and sometimes close as speedy keep on accident. The former is going to be adjusted (no more unreasoned common sense keeps for me) and the latter fixed.

<li><b>BDJ</b> - closed speedily even though it met none of the criteria. SM also reversed Samir's reopening after I noted the issues with the close.</li>
<li><b>SM</b> - The recent close by CharWeb was done right in my eyes, and I thanked her for it. You (DBJ) requested that it be reopened for delete discussion and didnt bother to vote. Time waster.
<ul>
<li>Minor clarification. Boston, Ontario was closed 3 times. First by Samir, second by me, and third by CharWeb. BDjeff, you said that the second close was done wrong, and I just need clarification as to which close. Mine ( closed as uneeded reopen) , or CharWeb's which was subject to a second close due to the relist? Either way its a keeper. SynergeticMaggot 03:52, 21 Aug 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All three were incorrect, to be specific. Samir's was closed out of process, which is why he gladly reopened it. Yours was out of process, as it not only reversed the reopening, but closed it early without cause. The third was closed incorrectly as it was reopened as a fresh AfD following the listing at DRV, and was never up long enough to get the hearing it was supposed to get, and especially never given the opportunity for those with problems at the original AfD. So my original "second" was Char's, but upon clarification, the AfD has yet to be closed properly. --badlydrawnjeff talk 03:57, 21 Aug 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>SM</b> Samirs thoughts were that of my own. It needed a fresh AfD, as the old reason was no longer valid. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">SynergeticMaggot</a> 08:41, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thank you for the advice. I will learn from all of this and move forward. Altough, if you allow me to nickpick for a split second...in conflict resolution, I actually did breing this up to two admins before bringing it to ANI. Both said they would have closed as keep. I used ANI as a means to contact a wider audience, in an attempt to intervene (which is the purpose of ANI). It semi-worked (no reflection on your methods). I gave Bdjeff a number of opportunities to work forward. Hes ignored that and every other warning to stop (trolling now). I'll drop by when I feel its right, and thanks for the offer. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">SynergeticMaggot</a> 23:40, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Assuming you're serious (and honestly it is always hard to tell) the particular thing that would strike me as inflammatory was something I'd already quoted: ""if you disagree with me, I'll block you, and I have friends who will make sure you stay blocked." Of course Kelly never said or implied any such thing. Indeed the imputation, by a certain LtPowers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Kelly_Martin2&amp;diff=70082353&amp;oldid=70075840" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Kelly_Martin2&amp;diff=70082353&amp;oldid=70075840" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, was in itself either absurd or inflammatory in itself, depending on how seriously one takes LtPowers' words.

<p>That you guys are doing great things in saying that everyone who disagrees with you is wrong, that by deleting the content under the logic that it's not references isn't saying "This content could potentially be wrong, so I say it IS wrong!" What should I be expected to say when you've done literally nothing to help with this article? The lack of references is not the reason for deletion, it's your argument to get rid of cruft that you don't like (even though that oh so silly majority likes it). You and AMIB have been scraping up anything you can to "clean up" Wikipedia to what you would like it to be. What logical person would argue that lack of references should lead to deletion? Would you delete <i><a href="../../../d/o/u/Mario_Kart%7E_Double_Dash%21%21_c4fa.html" title="Mario Kart: Double Dash!!">Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</a></i> if it lacked references? No? Then why are you applying this inane logic exclusively to articles that you dislike? Simple - you dislike them. Anything that you can use to argue against the article, it's fair game. Get over it. If you can't accept that people don't value your opinion over theirs', then leave Wikipedia, because this isn't your kind of place. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 05:13, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>It says "if we cannot find a source, we shouldn't post it" or something of that sort, right? Well, have I ever once, or any of us ever once stated that this article was unsourcable? Why must you say that this ONE article, out of millions, needs to be immediately sourced and if it cannot be, it should be deleted instead of marked with a citation tag? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 16:33, 28 August 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>And? Yes, it is the writer's obligation to add sources. But you are making a 100% baseless claim that it cannot possibly be sourced. Why should we disprove an argument that you can't prove? Does it say that all content not sourced must be deleted? While you are at it, why don't you deleted the <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> tag, since if anything is labelled with it, it must be deleted instantly. I hope that you have plans to do so, since you are trying to get content deleted for not having sources (instead of, oh, say, putting a note saying that it lacks a source? God forbid though). You are deleting content with MANY, MANY people who make their opposition to what you are doing clear as the fact that the Earth orbits the sun. What argument are you making? That because of lack of references, you can remove all content? And you keep citing that and ignoring the simple fact that you're the one making an argument. You're trying to immediately delete all content (disregarding everyone who disagrees) on the basis that you're saying the content doesn't exist. Even if we have to provide proof, before requesting it, you immediately said "hey, this is gonna be deleted, okay bai bai", and refused to allow it to exist in any way until I eventually got enough current support (because apparently, old votes are irrelevant). I think anyone with an ounce of common sense could take a look at what you're doing and say: "Hey, this guy's just trying to find reasons to delete an article which he doesn't think should exist". First you and AMIB said it was bad quality. Then you said that keep can be interpreted as redirect (because you two decided that the removal of content from Wikipedia is synonymous with keeping the content on Wikipedia). Merge and Redirect mean keep in an AfD, keep does not mean merge or redirect. Then you said it couldn't be referenced, saying "find a reference or I'll delete the content". I've already personally shown to AMIB that it can be referenced based on the IGN cheats section with a mention of Mr. Resetti's antics.</dd>
<dd>So, Brenneman, I ask you this - if I were to remove unsourced content from a variety of pages, would it be vandalism? Because that is exactly what you are doing. If you aren't willing to help me remove unsourced content from Wikipedia, then I would interpret that you think what I'm doing (which is what you are doing) as vandalism.</dd>
<dd>One more question - do you know what the citation needed tag is? And do you know why people made it? Cmon, think about it! It's easy. Well, I'll tell you anyway - so we don't have to DELETE CONTENT. So people can actually know that the unsourced content EXISTS. How is it progressive to delete content that is unsourced? How is that going to make WP better? By deleting the content, you create no opportunity for it to be sourced, which doesn't really help me to believe that this isn't an attempt to remove cruft from Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 05:21, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(<a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_the_Animal_Crossing_series_b173.html" title="Characters in the Animal Crossing series">Characters in the Animal Crossing series</a>) Contrary to your, LttP, and my own initial assumptions, the article <i>is</i> verifiable. Your objections to the existance of the article (No sources, multiple clean up tags, better dealt with in parent article, unencyclopedic tone. Not much else to say really.) have been addressed, as shown below, and I would like to have the merger tag removed.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>No sources</b>. Sources have been provided in part, and the potential for verifiability of the rest of the article shown. In fact, as I was reading the article I noticed several sentences which were near-direct plagarizations from the player's guide (now fixed), which suggests that the original author was using the guide as a source, and merely forgot to reference it... causing all of us a lot of trouble in the process. I do not possess the necessary resource to reference the half of the article about Animal Crossing Wild World, but am searching in hopes of finding an individual who possesses it. I will continue to add additional references tomorrow, but I need to sleep for now.</li>
<li><b>Multiple clean up tags</b>. All have been addressed except for citations, which is still in process.</li>
<li><b>Better dealt with in parent article</b>. False, as the article is a precise application of the <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> guideline on lists of characters. Also, would create <a href="../../../s/i/z/WP%7ESIZE_929b.html" title="WP:SIZE">WP:SIZE</a> problems if merged.</li>
<li><b>Unencyclopedic tone</b>. Fixed.</li>
</ol>
<p>To summarize, the article has been repaired from its previous and admittedly horrid state to a workable, living, improvable article which meets the Wikipedia 1.0 Start-class criteria on the assessment scale. If people would stop arguing over it, and instead actually work to <b>improve</b> the article, (and I found a guy with the Wild World guide) this could easily rise to B-class. With continued collaboration, I believe it could actually become a very decent Good or Featured List.</p>
<p>In conclusion, your emergency measures have succeeded! The article <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_the_Animal_Crossing_series_b173.html" title="Characters in the Animal Crossing series">Characters in the Animal Crossing series</a> has had its course reset to the proper direction, and normal editing may now resume. (Which is what you wanted, right?) All editors may now cease tearing out each other's throats, put down the large wooden mallets, take off their flame-proof eyeshields, and use those pens for what they were originally meant for rather than stabbing each other in the eyes.</p>

<p>Please, change this "Two Girls" abomination to anything: Pioneer plaque, fine, though I think for a Biography Project it would be better to use an image of an old, leather-bound book with some press guilding and some silhouette that would offend no one: Beethoven's, Newton's, Aristotle's, you name it. I find "Two Girls" image so offensive that I am ready to blow the top and start a vandal war over it, and that's not really in my character. The problem is, this image is a racially motivated imposition of certain ideology that I despise. Human beings should be regarded strictly on their individual merits, without classifying them by race. Race-based political correctness is a racism, painful to anybody who has been persecuted on the basis of their ethnicity -- inverted racism, granted, but still a racism. Like those questions about your race in government's questionnaires. If they are skin-color blind, why do they care what my race is? The same with this "Two Girls" photograph. It is a real torture to me, to see it on the talk page dedicated to my favorite writer. Please, remove it ASAP! Arvin Sloane 08:36, 8 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sigh. Everytime someone claims I have a "vendetta" against Tony, god kills a kitten. Is it at all possible that I object to the <b>actions</b> and not the <b>editor</b>? I don't understand why it's so difficult to encompass the paradigm that

<li>Person A does thing 1 lots and lots of times,</li>
<li>Person B thinks that thing 1 is really bad, thus leading to</li>
<li>Person B objecting to thing 1 lots of times.</li>

Ohh, let's ignore Bish and Geogre while we're at it. Splash clearly also has a grudge, write him off.

<dd>Och aye, no. I didn't <i>on purpose</i> revert Tony twice, just happened that way. The WP:SNOW header I didn't see consensus on, that's all. With regards to referencing that essay in closes, there has been demonstrated multiple times on the DRV talk page that consensus exists <b>not</b> to do it. As I explained above, I have no problem with Tony personally, I don't know him personally. But as long as he keeps doing the same things that I object to, I'll keep objecting. Simple really.

<p>I like my version, and I think your version is somewhat overloaded. This style of editing is quite different from article editing, but it's in normal use on arbitration cases and works very well in situations where one does not expect the parties to all agree on matters. Fred also apparently wants to signal that he prefers the version I proposed (as tweaked a little by him). Maybe he'll change his mind over time if we keep them side by side.</p>

<dd>Forgive me if I cannot help but see your determination to present only the facts that you like as "wicked." I'm interested in presenting a clear and factual account, you appear not to be interested in doing so. To choose only the most egregious of examples, you like the statement "<i>There was also a great deal of opposition including strong opposition from those he had blocked for "hate speech"."</i> It would be more accurate to say <i>"Of the over seventy people who opposed, <b>two of the three</b> users blocked for "hate speech" were included."</i> But alas, accuracy does not seem to be what you are shooting for. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman">Aaron Brenneman</a> 06:09, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just some thought here, we may be happily throwing remedies and principles one after another, but that isn't going to help unless we actually have sufficient evidence to build a case.

<p>Hey Aaron. I haven't run into any issues with Tony in the least. I actually commend his behavior that I have seen. That said, it is interesting your general collection of various incidents over years in the evidence section with regards to Tony. I will be following the case to see how it turns out. There is one editor that I have run into that a similar case could be made against, if not stronger than the one against Tony. The question is whether such a long term case based on multiple disputes with many people in the context of a significant edit history actually results in anything meaningful. Have you seen a case such as yours work before? Can you point me towards such previous models? Thanks. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 05:26, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aaron, You've been leading a charge to refactor the workshop, and slow the rate of Tony's input. I won't speak to refactoring, I'm not sure it's a huge issue, but as to Tony and his input in the Workshop, I'd ask you to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you began contributing to the case, you pulled out Tony's past going back quite a bit.</li>
<li>A great deal of critical attention has focused on Tony.</li>
<li>If you look closely at his comments, he's done more to contribute civilly and recognize the complaints of others than he has in any arb case where he's been an involved party, at least that I've seen. And I've been watching since the WebComics case.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please, look closely at his contributions. I think real progress is being made, not just for Tony, but for many people participating, and I think pushing him too hard on this is only going to accerbate old conflicts between you two. Things are proceeding, and it may be messy but not as messy as some cases have been. This won't go on forever. --<a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkSplotch_5c7c.html" title="User:InkSplotch">InkSplotch</a> 02:51, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Agree. Tony went way overboard, even by his own standards; more to the point, he did so at a time and place where he offended more than one or two editors at the same time. He's paddling furiously; let's let him do that. I'd rather not see him leverage some vague charge of being denied right to reply into sympathy leniency. He's already pretty much endorsed his own de-adminning; given his level of general political support in and out of ArbCom, that's about as much as we can expect. Anyway, he's not the big fish in this particular barrel. By all means, let him boil his own broth. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reid_d143.html" title="User:John Reid">John&#160;</a><a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Reid_5801.html" title="User talk:John Reid">Reid</a> 07:59, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can understand the desire to bite your fingers at this point (the e-version of biting your tongue), since the "only a clerk may do that" begs the question enormously. At the same time, Fred's right about one thing: the investigation into a big mess will be a big mess. That's a separate problem, though. No one knows who the Rfar is on or what it is about, so we all take our pick. I know it's about Tony, but it's also about Kelly, somewhat about James, somewhat about Giano, maybe about me. There is no way that I can foresee an actual decision being made, much less a remedy, given that the whole thing is a shotgun blast. <i>Part</i> of it is, as you've identified, "clerks." Part of it is, as Hamster Sandwich has pointed out, "who gets to lobby on the mailing list" (and "can recused people still be arguing on the secret mailing list?"). The hundred places where "Trust us: it's for your own good" is breaking down are showing up, and that's combined with very specific people doing very specific misdeeds. In Tony's case, we can say that it's "progress," but it's progress toward where he should have been at the very outset of being an admin. The rest of us don't block like that, and no one else would act like that and still be an administrator 9 months later. Kelly's behaviors have been abominable, as well. So, we all take our individual angles, and the result, I fear, will be dissipated force. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 16:24, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sometimes I don't understand how the arbitration committee groupthink works. What could can possibly come of <i>failing</i> to specify the parameters? I'll not venture into speculating why we need a class of editors to ease the burden of arbitration by doing grunt work and providing summaries, but that normal editors are now forbidden from doing so. I shall however begin doing my homework prior to the next arbcom pseudo-election, presuming that we have one.</dd>

<li><i>"...it would be easy for the above statement be taken with, as someone notable in her absence said, "a cowlick of salt."</i> - This looks like you're quoting KM (though I'm not sure if that's the her), and in any case being the first commenter on Tony's apparent <i>mea culpa</i> makes your voice commensurately louder than all who come after. Casting doubt on it from the get-go isn't assuming much good faith. I don't think even you would argue that Tony doesn't mean what he says when he says it.</li>
<li><i>"I'd find it easier to believe this if it were accompanied by something more solid. For example, asking the arbitration committee</i> directly <i>to apply some of the remedies on offer would be a good start."</i> - This looks like a kick in the ribs. Tony is /appears to be trying to take this seriously and you asking for him to submit to a Scarlet C or sit in the stocks won't make him feel any better about it. If he's going to change, it won't be because of the opinions of his detractors, I think we've established that as well. Tony seems to reply best to those he already knows calling him on the disparity between what he says he is doing and the apparent effect of what he's doing.</li>
<li><i>"...This is not an attack, or a "tarring" but a simple statement of fact. Have a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Aaron_Brenneman/Requests_for_comment/Tony_Sidaway_4&amp;diff=37646143&amp;oldid=37645985" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Aaron_Brenneman/Requests_for_comment/Tony_Sidaway_4&amp;diff=37646143&amp;oldid=37645985" rel="nofollow">this</a> statement by Tony Sidaway. ..."</i> - It's also something you've said before, and many times over (maybe not that specific diff, but ones like it). I know it can feel vindicating to finally have Tony listening to others, and to try to repeat your points, but it's doubtful you'll convince anyone anew now by repeating old diffs, and it just makes you look like you're holding a grudge (which you're entitled to do, emotionally, I just am not sure it benefits this RFAr, remedy, or Tony's current viewpoint on his own behavior).</li>
</ul>

<p><s>Hi,</s></p>
<p><s>I disagree pretty strongly with your encouragement to this editor to consider continue to close AfDs. AfD/DRV is contentious enough; reading the capacity of non-admins to close broadly (or, gulp, IARing it) is an invitation to headaches and frequent deletion reviews. It's my view that, once an editor has exceeded his authority in closing unclear debates, he/she should be prohibited from closing anything prior to gaining adminship. I came to his page to tell him as much, found your note, and know that I need to discuss this with you first. A user who redirects his userpage to a version of IAR isn't somebody who needs encouragement of his boldness. Your thoughts? Best wishes, <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 23:08, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<dd><s>Thanks for coming around! Yeah, I'm well aware that I'm on the outer with respect to non-admin closings, and I left a note with SamBlan telling him I'd worded up Parseltongue and asking if he wanted to counteract my advice.</s></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><s>I understand what you're saying about the potential for making a mess. There is clearly truth in it (he says looking at DRV/Log/2006 October 4.) I think about in like this:</s></dd>

<li><s>Better to have them stuff up when it's easier to fix.</s></li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><s>Either Parseltongue will sort himself out (e.g. learn form the experiance) or not. If he does, then everyone benefits. If he does not learn anything then when/if he requests promotion, the "disgusting rabble" (or whatever the insult-of-the-week is) will have more information to base their decision on. I can see with hindsight that my <i>laissez faire</i> advice potentially impacts you, as the Duke of DRv, more than most. Sorry 'bout that mate.</s></dd>

<dd><s>There's more than one way to learn from experience: if PT were warned against closings because he had mucked them up, perhaps he would quiet down and watch admins do the job. This one series of incidents is enough "educational stuffing up" in my view. What troubles me is his somewhat defiant tone on his userpage, and his reference to that inexplicable mystery, WP:IAR, as a justification. He's a rogue, and he isn't even an admin yet. Aside from the fact that this would bring vigorous opposition from me in any RfA, I don't think he's learned well from "stuffing up" unless he does a better job of acknowledging his failures.</s></dd>

<dd><s>A couple comments on his talk page yesterday were probably unhelpful. (But, it looks like you realized this too, hence the apology). However, I'll admit I find it hard to take seriously any editor who removes criticism from their own page without comment. I try to make it a habit to not address an editor anymore once they've done that- however I've broken my own rule countless times. I'm a hopeless optimist (is that even possible?) and I always assume that a previously-unresponsive editor could suddenly become responsive at any time. Anyway, I thikn I'm just babbling now. One possibly relevant point tho: if someone expressed concerns to an editor, and they delete them without comment, this shows that dispute resolution has been attempted, and it (IMO) shows that further attempts to resolve the issue with that editor are unlikely to succeed. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 14:57, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</s></dd>

<li><s>First off, I'd like to see mediation w/ MONGO at some point in the near future.</s></li>
<li><s>Second, I wonder if you could explain to me exactly what happened. Is this community really so arbitrary that someone can be summarily executed just by the whim of an administrator? I thought the rules said otherwise. I hadn't even broken any rules and one of MONGO's chums decided to ban me forever? How does that work, and what actions are being taken to discipline the administrator who abused their power?</s></li>
</ul>
<p><s>I'm a bit disheartened already about this project, and will probably go back to lurking to some degree, at least for a while until I figure out exactly what happened. From my point of view, Wikipedia looks like an Encyclopedia run by a group of thugs.

<dd><s>I'm replying to this here (despite having just left a message on your talk) since I like to keep discussions together. There are several factors at play here.</s>
<ul>
<li><s>Firstly, MONGO recently experianced a fairly intersting time with regards to being mentioned on another website. It linked his user page and encouraged people to, erm, visit and comment.</s></li>
<li><s>Secondly, your contributions are a couple of standard deviations outside the norm.</s>
<ul>
<li><s>If you go to the top of this page there's <b>Special ADN</b>. Click the "N" and you'll get contributions by "noobs." Have a browse and compare.</s></li>
<li><s>You've only got like fifteen main space contributions, but <i>quite</i> a few more outside article space.</s></li>
<li><s>You're quoting policies and guidelines chapter and verse, using the shortcuts</s></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><s>Penultimately, you're a persistant bugger.</s></li>
<li><s>Finally, you've asked about something which is always controversial. "Normal" users can't protect their own pages, and in the past there has been some heated debate on this issue.</s></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd><s>Add all these up, and MONGO connected the dots and decided that you're here to hassle him instead of contribute to the Encyclopedia. <b>This was not an entirly unreasonable conclusion for him to draw.</b> While I choose to handle things differently, I can empathise with his response.</s></dd>

<dd><s>My advice is to write it all off to bad luck, misunderstanding, and miscommunications. In general this is a warm and welcoming space, particularly for those who spend more time writing articles (or reverting vandalism, or finding sources for things, or whatever) and less time on pages starting with "Wikipedia:" I hold steady at about 30% article contributions, and any time I get cross with things, I just go and do some article clean-up and I feel heaps better.</s></dd>

<p><s>Yeah...thanks. Remind me to give you tips on how to be a better administrator some time. And no, it wasn't an issue for the article talk page in my case. Him making a comment rather than a stupid edit would have been nice, but what, exactly, would be the point of me going "Aah! Someone...<b>DID</b> something to the page!" Nah. No thanks. I did that when I was just starting out. Serves no purpose and makes one look like an idiot. Also, I didn't just say "inappropriate edit". I explained the situation in detail. User by user, edit by edit, the comments are made on their talk page unless it's an issue for debate with the article. Does the listing of a confirmed character seem debatable to you? Now, you might have a soft spot for the user. Whatever. I don't care or judge. However, I'd rather you not come at me questioning my actions without a solid reason.

<p><s>Very sensible comments when closing that longwinded AfD, Sir. There's one slight surprise, however: <i>This is, to some degree, a rip-off for the "defenders" of the article.</i> Do you perhaps mean a tip(-off) (i.e. <i>advice</i> to concentrate on verifiability in the future)? Or conceivably you really do mean a rip-off; an apparently unfair (even if actually justified) removal.

<p>I've stuck this down here as it's a more general thing, and so as to not (further) muddy the waters. While the removal of tags (and in particular afd tags) is defined as a kind of vandalism, we should use caution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Often it's simply that very new users don't understand that it's a process, and think that if they disagree, they can say so by removing the tag. It actually introduces a bias <i>towards</i> deletion both by screening out people who are interested in the article and by prejudicing the afd crowd, but that's another story.</li>
<li>In this case, there clearly was some dispute about the best way forward. In his edit summary the user pointed to the deletion review. An ill-advised edit, yes, but it appears to have been done "in good faith."</li>
</ul>
<p>I tend to be <i><b>very</b></i> careful about calling people vandals/sockpuppets/meatpuppets/etc. I try to use words that reflect on the contribution, not the contributor, as much as possible. Rather than getting into it with someone over whether or not they are a "vandal" it's best to focus on the edits. Which in this case you've done, so I'm making general observations here. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 01:35, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>No objections at all to anything you've done above, I intend to adopt your recommendations immediately, and I thank you for your help! One tiny quibble, though: Francisx's <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> stuff calling me a liar and someone who edits for political purposes is still sitting on AN/I. The only thing I've got going for me here is my reputation (never been involved in any dispute resolution process anywhere beyond talk pages, with the exception of a single 3RR in my early days that was reverted almost immediately for being miscalculated - and even there the guy I was reverting turned out to be pretty much the troll I'd suspected; he ended up being block for 4 or 6 months by Arbcom on a totally unrelated matter a while later), and I really don't need stuff like that hanging around uncontested in the AN/I archives if I ever make a run at adminship (which I intend to do eventually). So while I'm not going to ask you to nuke it point blank, I would very much appreciate it if you'd look at those accusations, see if you can find any evidence that they are true, and act accordingly per <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> and the general Wikipolicy on unsourced negative stuff. I don't think you'll find any evidence to back them up; as an example to prove otherwise, an AfD was just closed where'd I'd nominated eight separate articles for being part of a <a href="../../../w/a/l/WP%7EWALL_5398.html" title="WP:WALL">walled garden</a> of spam, even though most of them were about books and people overtly supportive of my political party (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_World_Ahead_Publishing_0a4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/World Ahead Publishing">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/World Ahead Publishing</a>). But whatever decision you come to, pro or con, will be the end of it and I won't mention it again anywhere. I know I'm being a bit pushy, but like I said, my reputation is all I've got here; I don't ever hang out on IRC or the mailing lists or otherwise interact much with the "community", wherever it is.

<dd>How about if we give it some more time, continuing to try to educate them about policy via the talk page? It's better to educate new editors than to alienate them, and they probably just don't understand that they can't delete sourced text and insert improperly attributed statements. (There are now three of them, and there will be more.)

I tried to bring peace to the Lieberman articles before the primaries, and it ultimately failed because of the desperate anons, who seem to think people read Wiki before deciding for whom to vote, and had to be semi-protected. The most we can hope for is to watch out for violations of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> on all candidate articles, and try to educate the newcomers to policy. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 20:27, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I have to admit I hate election articles like a sheep hates shearing. They are <i>always</i> a terrible pain in the tuches, but lots of people love them... *sigh.* Regardless, this editor seems to be responding positively and I'll continue to asnwer any questions they have. A big tip of the hat to Sandy, by the way, for the efforts to date. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 22:41, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You tipped the hat too soon, Aaron, I hit the wall with this one. I tried, but perhaps I'm just naive, or overly optimistic, or just plain dumb ... I spent a bunch of time explaining that letters to the editor aren't reliable sources, the other editors do seem to be coming along, but Francisx accused me of inserting POV because I explained that letters to the editor don't cotton.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Francisx#Failure_to_assume_good_faith" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Francisx#Failure_to_assume_good_faith" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>.

<p>Now that Francisx is engaging in blatant lying, I'm going to formally ask for you to take administrative action against this edit, or at least put the relevant {{<a href="../../../n/p/a/Template%7ENpa3_472b.html" title="Template:Npa3">npa3</a>}} tag on the editor's user talk page so I can take it straight to <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> when this editor does it again. Specifically, I'm complaining about this line from <a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrancisx_a43f.html#Diane_Farrell_et_alia" title="User talk:Francisx">User talk:Francisx#Diane Farrell et alia</a>: <i>"One poster, {User:Aaron} even stated on the first AfD Discussion page for Farrell that he 'would never vote for her.' I think that demonstrates rather heavy POV against this particular bio."</i> Really? Well, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Diane_Farrell_399f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Diane Farrell">Here's the first AfD</a>. Compare it to my user contribution history and you'll see I was in the middle of a months-long Wikibreak at the time, and thus would have had a bit of trouble making any comment in that AfD whatsoever. And just to provide evidence that this isn't a mere mistake on the editor's part, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Diane_Farrell_%28Second_nomination%29_2b52.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Diane Farrell (Second nomination)">here's the current one</a>, which I did participate in. I didn't say anything remotely like "I'd never vote for her" there, either, nor on the DRV that you closed, nor on AN/I. Between myself and <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">User:SandyGeorgia</a>, this sort of thing has happened too many times from this editor to be mere mistakes.

<p>Sheep to the shearing: the only good thing is it's over in 3 more weeks. Sorry to touble you, since I already left a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:FloNight#Escalation_on_Farrell.2C_Shays.2C_CT" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:FloNight#Escalation_on_Farrell.2C_Shays.2C_CT" rel="nofollow">message for FloNight about 12 hours ago;</a> I don't know when FloNight will be online. In addition to the other issues, we now have a possible copyvio, with exact wording and structure from Farrell's campaign ads used to write an entire section on <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Shays_4915.html" title="Christopher Shays">Christopher Shays</a>. I discussed it on talk page, reverted it (correcting several other accumulated problems in the same edit, also discussed on talk); my removal was reverted and labeled "vandalism" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Shays&amp;diff=81160888&amp;oldid=81160756" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christopher_Shays&amp;diff=81160888&amp;oldid=81160756" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> by <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> (<a href="../../../f/r/a/User_talk%7EFrancisx_a43f.html" title="User talk:Francisx">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Francisx_4d51.html" title="Special:Contributions/Francisx">contribs</a>). Farrell's campaign ad is still on Shays' article, along with other poorly-sourced edits. I imagine Farrell would be thrilled, and Shays puzzled, about why Wiki carries Farrell campaign ads in Shays' article.

<dd>Struck, misunderstood the joke from MONGO, and understand your reluctance about these messy election articles. Thanks for bringing it to the attention of ANI. Maybe when the Wiki admins finish fighting over incivility among themselves, one of them will find time to look at the incivility down here in the trenches, where we're trying to write an encyclopedia and keep Wiki out of BLP legal problems. Thanks again, and sorry for the trouble. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a>

<dd>No need for you to apologize: it's not your problem. I guess I only ended up here because you were helping out the other Aaron. And I understand how it must be sapping you. I'm pretty disgusted, though, that I've had to put up with the accusations and incivility for a week, when Shays' or Farrell's pages aren't my problem. I was just following the rules and trying to keep Wiki out of a BLP mess, considering the New York Times coverage of Farrell's article. I guess I'll let them handle their own messes: I'm a busy editor anyway, to be dealing with the level of tendentious editing that allows someone to write an entire section from an opponent's campaign ads, while making accusations about me. Wiki's problem, not mine. But I don't understand why it happens, along with the incivility. "Warring editors" (plural): that's the slap in my face on ANI for trudging along down here in the trenches like a dumbo. I'm going to put a POV tag on the article, be done with it, and get back to work.

Whither those who come only to reprove,
But the adminbacklog tag from CAT:CSD you did remove

In future meetings I do proffer the advice
that commenting it out would suffice

<p>I made another small change, when I noticed that white block div you had to cover official messages. I hadn't applied my firefox fix to it before. You might want to check it in IE and Firefox to make sure things still look like you'd intended (don't forget ctrl-F5 forces a reload, ignoring cached info).

<p>I really don't like going to Admins like this (especially if they don't like US politics!), but I feel I need to correct a significant misrepresentation. What Sandy terms "campaign ads" are reliably-sourced quotations from Chris Shays that articulate his views on the Iraq War issue. They are provided without prejudice, POV or commentary. Sandy seems to feel that they constitute an "attack," and has said that they are taken out of context. I have encouraged her to place those quotes in context or provide more information, and yet she has not done so. Frankly, I do not understand her concern or see why she feels this is "Democratic Camapaign Material." I do, however, regret having my hard work summarily reverted, as happened here.[15] So as not to waste your time, I won't continue this argument on your talk page, but I don't want you to have any misconceptions about the situation.<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 07:36, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I deleted your box remarks on the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvey_Jackins_9cbb.html" title="Harvey Jackins">Harvey Jackins</a> page because of what looked to me like a very POV "RC is a walled garden" statement - have you had contact with RC, or is this due to something else? The HJ page has been worked on, and argued over, for a long time and includes a good deal of research, some of it very anti-him and anti-RC, so it is not a fluff piece. Can you say why you made this statement? I note that it follows a very similar use of that phrase from another user on the re-evaluation counseling page.
