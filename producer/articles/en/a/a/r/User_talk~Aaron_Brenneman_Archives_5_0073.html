Both of you, I know, sincerely love the encyclopedia and have done many great things.

<p>I lost all hope when I saw there was now an ArbCom clerk chair; I've briefly returned to fix some stupidity, and now find who the other clerks are. I see why you've left. My advice: just tidy anonymously, if you wish, or just find something else to do. I've also noticed, with humor, the dustup at AfD, and the crazy threats there. Good show even trying.

<p>I need to reply to your last post in longer terms. But sleep is needed - so just, never mind. You were not the one creating vile userboxes, and making silly remarks on an RfC (and they are still doing that). Much has been said all round, not least by me, that woud be better unsaid. Some have enjoyed trolling, some have revelled in victimhood and some of us have lost sight of the encyclopedia. Nothing seems broken that can't be fixed. So peace from me, if it is reciprocated. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 01:24, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>First, I wanted to say that I really appreciated the invitation to your RfA, given that I'd voted in opposition before. That's highly laudable! Second, It appears to be sailing through without problem. Were I to comment/vote, I doubt there would be much that I could add that would have any significance, given the comments made already. As you may know, I don't lightly vote, and it's time consuming for me to evaluate people with significant editing histories such as yourself. Given that there's probably little that I could add to the discussion, and given that I am horribly wiki-backlogged in terms of signficant requests (I'm still doing little stuff, but major things are waiting in the wings), I'll have to decline the invitation. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 19:04, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just happened to run across your question to RedWolf24 due to his talk page being on my watchlist. Looking <i>only</i> at the five links you provided, my take on it is that it's no big deal in and of itself for most of a person's contributions to be to AfD. Of course, if the content or tone of those are off, it could be a problem. If that's the issue, I'd say focus on that rather than the fact that the user chooses to concentrate on AfD. I think people are helpful even if they only concentrate in a narrow area, like RC patrol, AfD, etc.</p>
<p>Again, I've only reviewed the links you provided. I haven't reviewed the user's actual contributions to AfD, which as far as I know could be basically trolling (like some of the folks who were voting oppose on every RFA for a while). If all the user ever does is provide "diluted" or "devalued" AfD votes, you might look into the sentence in <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> which states "neither a sockpuppet nor a brand new <i>single-purpose</i> account holder are a valid member of the Wikipedia community." <a href="../../../j/d/a/User%7EJdavidb_f8c2.html" title="User:Jdavidb">Jdavidb</a> (<a href="../../../j/d/a/User_talk%7EJdavidb_d285.html" title="User talk:Jdavidb">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jdavidb_e085.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jdavidb">contribs</a>) 00:55, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In response to your question, I don't feel that your actions were 'bullying', intimidation or harassment, and the idea that you were considering an RFC is clearly a misunderstanding. However, there are a couple of points I'd like to make. I don't really find anything wrong with your initial message to JJay. However, from JJay's reply it should have been clear that he didn't appreciate you questioning his editing patterns, and I think the sensible thing to do would have been to leave it at that.</p>
<p>I take it from your comment to Zoe that you also had a problem with JJay's idea of citing sources. This seems to me a much more serious problem that spending lots of time on AFD, so why did you not mention this in your message to JJay? I can't find anything about this on his talk page.</p>
<p>On an unrelated note, I do like your formatting of your RFA page, and especially your use of footnotes. Great idea. <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaven4x4x_5184.html" title="User:Raven4x4x">Raven4x4x</a> 01:00, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good evening, Aaron. I just reverted your link on the centralized discussions page. I did that because it seemed too ambiguous. There are several discussions going on simultaneously on that one page. I could not immediately figure out which topic or debate was being advertised. If I couldn't easily figure it out (and I follow that page quite closely), it seemed that it would be a disservice to new participants to ask them to join the discussion at the top of the page. When you put the link back, would you please do so with a section-link directly to the debate that needs outside participation? Or perhaps frame the question in a stand-alone subpage? Thanks. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 03:23, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks bro, I wonder what will come out of this -- if we can finally get a rule of law here, or the caste system will solidify and certain people will be above policies. Everyone seems to have forgotten here that Jimbo was Wheel Warring here, yet it's ok for him to do so for some reason.</p>
<p>Eh, whatever. I have alot of things going on outside here now, so it's not as big a deal as it was before. It's just unfortunate that if a caste system does solidify in the next few days/weeks/months that eventually Wikipedia will be eventually be destroyed by someone powerful in the real world who was inadvertently screwed by the caste system here.

<p>I'd like to offer an alternative possible outcome: That, having collectively realised that there does exist a problem with the unfettered admin, a system (if if only a social one) of greater accountability and responsibility rises. That Jimbo made the correct move, however heavy-handedly, and that this is in fact the brightest sign we've seen in the last six months... but of course it could go either way.<br />

<p>I know you can't help being nice to lost causes - but this one is really lost. See the evidence page of his RfAr (and ask yourself how much good faith there is in his actions), he's continued trolling since that was filed - creating two pedeophile userboxes since Jimbo deleted the first lot. He is an irrepressable troll, who is smart enough to push the right buttons to convince certain people he's a martyr for free-speech. His time on wikipedia is coming to an end, and since I like to champion you as a lost cause,&#160;;) please don't let him drag you down.

<p>I think it's a typo. I'll fix that in a second. Thank you again for being during that tough time last week. Ultimately all it took was a realization to end the feeling I was having: I am the master of my own destiny, both on here and in reality(I'm on AOL at home, and I make 99% of my edits on a laptop, I likely have used more IPs than Tony has deletions under his belt). With that out of the way, I can do my best to help fix the real problem: the lack of respect between users on here.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I don't understand the speedy delete on Brian Peppers. I haven't been watching AfD very long, but it appeared to me that <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHall_Monitor_050f.html" title="User:Hall Monitor">User:Hall Monitor</a> posted that particular AfD as an attempt to gather some consensus. You closed the AfD early "without prejudice" in the event that consensus is eventually obtained to put the article back.</p>
<p>I don't understand what process is supposed to be used to acquire that consensus, if not AfD (and it looked to me like the AfD was trending towards a 'no consensus', which usually translates to 'keep' in a normal AfD). Is my thinking muddy? Could you enlighten me? -Ikkyu2 04:44, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

But watch out for <a href="../../../t/o/o/Too_much_information.html" title="Too much information">Too much information</a>! Ok, re MA: I admit I'm not good about following up on ideas and notions and suchlike once I half bake them, but see <a href="../../../p/g/h/Pghbridges.com.html" title="Pghbridges.com">pghbridges.com</a> and the associated AfD <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Pghbridges.com_694e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pghbridges.com">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pghbridges.com</a> (including the talk pages) for some thoughts about reference sites and the applicability of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> to those sorts of sites. For me it's more quality than pure quantity. If the site is a source people rely on in a significant way, it doesn't matter if it ranks high in Google or Alexa, merely that the cites of the site you find in Google show that people (serious people, like librarians, academics, etc) DO rely on it. That's my thesis anyway. I need to do more about getting more people to think about it. The idea here is that WP is for researchers as well as general knowledge seekers and describing a site that researchers need isn't "promoting" it per se, it's making the researchers job easier. Now, MA probably has less "serious" research info than pghbridges (or <a href="../../../s/t/r/Structurae.html" title="Structurae">structurae</a>) but it's still solid research that gives sources, making it a reliable citation source. And I think that means that just randomly citing it via refs doesn't go quite far enough. That's my thesis anyway.

<dd>Well, I am positing the thought that it's a source, but then the next question is, is it a reliable source? I've started a discussion germane to that question at <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#Other_wiki.27s_as_reliable_sources" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)#Other wiki's as reliable sources</a>. I stumbled into this through <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamieHari_adee.html" title="User:JamieHari">User:JamieHari</a> who linkspams the Marvel Database Project into comics articles, sometimes listing it as a reference. I then stumbled across <a href="../../../m/e/m/Memory_Alpha_f337.html" title="Memory Alpha">Memory Alpha</a>, and it makes you wonder if the article, no matter how well written, is either worthy of inclusion or featured article status.

<li>See Lar, the angle I come from is that when such websites are cited by scholars and the like, those citations are in reliable sources, and therefore pass the criteria of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, having non-trivial coverage in reliable/reputable sources. Also with regards to Memory Alpha and sites like it, they're what's called tertiary sources aren't they, which means we evaluate on the strength of <b>their sourcing</b>. But I think we're probably on the same page in this discussion. What concerns me is getting the debate to <i>this</i> level, rather than one of debating whether Steve Block's fan page on the Legion of Super-Heroes, for example, is a reputable/reliable source.

<li>I have no expertise or standing in this area, I am no more than just another random Trek fan (and not that big of one of late, the newest stuff left me quite cold). The difference I see is one of degree.... WP we certainly does quote from primary sources once in a while but for the most part, it "usually summarises secondary sources". My read on MA is that they quote from (and summarise) primary sources a lot. It's perhaps not a very important point, but I'm interested in your take nevertheless. Is it possible for something to be partly secondary and partially tertiary? If so, what does that mean? Is it a meaningful distinction? I have no idea. Also, how would you classify <a href="../../../h/a/e/HAER_a7c5.html" title="HAER">HAER</a> for example? THe photo database part seems quite primary, and it hosts original (commissioned) research and works... But it's also a repository for work done elsewhere which is merely housed there. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 20:54, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Perhaps also worth noting in this conversation (which I have shown up extremely tardy for) is that Memory Alpha was included in a Knight Ridder story that was carried in the Charlotte Observer, The Wichita Eagle, and Contra Costa Times. The site has also been covered by Florida Trend magazine. So, it would seem to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, in that "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 03:51, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't really care whether MA meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or not, because its notability is established by being a verifiable (and cited) reference site, not by its traffic, or by its mentions in the popular press.

Restating that view just to drive it home: <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is irrelevant for sites that primarily have value as references.

<p>"Boy, you've got a real hard-on for Nadesuka all at once, don't you?

<p>That's probably a bit over the top... as I said on the talk page I'm of two minds. It just drives me batty when Tony doesn't follow process, but I see his point about the effect some of these really corrosive things have too. But this is turning into a game of appearances and right now the appearance given off is that it's you vs. him, for the most part and he's coming off looking far more reasonable.

<dd>Trout slapping accepted. Even in the face of Tony's increasingly hysterical attacks on Nandesuka it was not appropiate for me to respond the way I did. I just get frustrated with how Tony's words never seem to mean what they say, and how he is able to perform the most outrageous actions with utterly dispicable motives while crying "assume good faith!" the entire time. He consistantly fails to deal with others honestly, and we're prevented from speaking out plainly and saying, "Hey, that smells!"<br />

<dd>Tony has the time and energy to ensure that his side is well presented. He also clearly believes that the best defence is a good offense, look at the transparent manner in which his now attacking Nandesuka. If Crotalus shows his face on the Arbitration workshop, nothing good will come of it. Do you suspect that there is some evidence that Crotalus might be aware of that is being missed? At to the "good work" comment, if you'll examine his contributions you'll see that he's actually continuing to contribute to the encyclopedia.<br />

<dd>For the record, I also said that I admired Crotalus for working on the encyclopedia. I don't think Crotalus acted in bad faith over this and having investigated Netoholic's evidence I don't believe that he is a sock of a banned user. Nor would that really be relevant if he is now acting in good faith--it's what you're doing now that is important to Wikipedia, not what you did last year; all banned users can in principle be redeemed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I can tell Crotalus is a good editor and, despite this case, we have both shared civil words since he brought it. Such evidence as exists to suggests <i>faux pas</i> is minor--such as nominating a RFC process page for deletion and complaining of vandalism when people removed the tag. The Committee is highly unlikely to consider this worthy of attention.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Nandesuka's case is different. It appears to me that he deliberately used his administrator powers three times to undelete a page that he admitted would <i>certainly</i> (his words) end up being deleted, when at the time of his first undeletion there was a 52-9 pile-on in favor of deletion. That shows poor understanding of what sysopping is about. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 16:59, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I guess what I fail to understand is why overriding process was a good thing in that case. I understand the argument that if process is about to give a flawed result, if consensus seems to have arrived at a finding that the sky is green, the good of the encyclopedia requires that the right thing be done. But that wasn't the case here. If process is about to give the right answer, and soon, letting it actually do so makes all of us process wonks feel that the system is fairer. (note carefully I speak not of rights, not of free speech. We have no right to free speech here, and in general no rights at all other than the board grants us, except not to participate, or to fork. I speak of perception of fairness). So why the rush? The argument needs to be made that there was a compelling urgent need to override a process that was about to give the correct result anyway. I do not think you've made that argument, in general. That you seem unwilling to make it, unwilling to admit that sometimes you do act rashly, or at least give the appearance of doing so, gets under the skin of some of us to the point that some of us say uncivil things to you, which is regrettable and should not be abided, but which does not dilute the validity of the point, it merely undermines the ability to make it effectively. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 20:43, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Good question. There are a lot of boxes. Way too many, in fact. But picking out for speedy deletion ones at the edges, quasi-randomly, isn't really going towards solving the root cause.

<p>I went along with your request to remove the userbox, but I do not believe it should be deleted. I have it on my user page, but not as much because I disagree with the pope as much as I find it to be funny. It depends on how you view it, and I personally think it should remain for its humor value. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlue80_be80.html" title="User:Blue80">Blue80</a> 10 February 2006, 09:15 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. I read your guidelines and fair enough. What if the entry is specific to the name 'webGM'? On the page it might mention that webGM developed a site and have a link to that site. I am only new to Wikipedia so I'm obviously still getting a feel for whats acceptable and whats not.</p>
<p>I await your reply.</p>

<p>Hey there. I am still awaiting communication regarding my entry 'webGM' and it's subsequent deletion. Seeing as you have recently received admin priveliges I would of thought you would be doing the right thing and keeping the communication levels up regarding this.

<p>Hi. I noticed you removed the {{db-bio}} tag and added a {{prod}} tag to this article. The problem is that I removed a {{prod}} tag when I added the {{db-bio}} tag. (Confused yet?) I believe the rules of the <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">Prod</a> tag say that an article can not be re-prodded and therefore the article must go to AfD. Sorry, it appears that I may have made a mess of it as I was unaware that non-notable porn stars don't go to CSD. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames084_3305.html" title="User:James084">James084</a> 04:04, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>In a nutshell, there was a very good chance that it would work. Some of the trolls were already blocked, progress had been made on clarifying policy, etc. It was an opportunity to effect some change. I'll maintain that a large part of the problem is that we've tolerated the disruption and subversion of ordinary processes like TfD for too long, which has only served to reinforce some of the common misunderstandings of what Wikipedia is about. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkSweep_b58d.html" title="User:MarkSweep">MarkSweep</a>&#160;<small><a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkSweep_9d72.html" title="User talk:MarkSweep">(call me collect)</a></small> 06:53, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I feel like this is beating a dead horse. I think that Brecher's print columns themselves provide ample verification for the claim that he writes media coverage on Fresno, or if you like, is relevant to a popular culture section on Fresno. If every editor but the belligerent anon ip were of this opinion, I would say we have consensus. But I'm still not sure what you think here. Going with the analogy to made on the article talk page, would you really say we need multiple independent media sources that Janeway is from Bloomington, IN in star trek? <a href="../../../d/s/o/User%7EDsol_459f.html" title="User:Dsol">Dsol</a> 20:39, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please have another look at <a href="../../../f/r/e/Talk%7EFresno%2C_California_9374.html" title="Talk:Fresno, California">talk:Fresno, California</a> you get a chance. You insisted earlier that all parties stop reverting and dicuss, and rightly so. Since then the anon ip's version has stayed, while everyone commenting on the issue in talk except the anon ip (and possibly you, I'm not sure) agreed that some (perhaps qualified) mention of Brecher could/should be included based on the UPI interview. I think the discussion has clearly established a consensus and I am ready to revert. However, I admire your level-headedness throughout this tired affair and would appreciate your candid opinion on this as well. <a href="../../../d/s/o/User%7EDsol_459f.html" title="User:Dsol">Dsol</a> 19:20, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey Aaron, you probably recognise me from the <b>Munt</b> page. Anyway, this post is in relation to another article -<a href="../../../j/u/n/Jungle_Music_8f11.html" title="Jungle Music">Jungle Music</a>.</p>
<p>Me and a few others contributed a fair bit of time, effort and unique information to the original article. It has since been repeatedly deleted, re-directed and vandalised... even to the point where two Wiki-users collaborated to knowingly start an edit-war by repeatedly re-directing the whole page and completely removing my and other editors contribs.</p>
<p>The debate at hand is whether or not Jungle and Drum&amp;Bass are the same thing. My POV is that they are different, and that drum&amp;bass evolved into a separate genre FROM Jungle. They obviously disagree.</p>
<p>Seeing as this is obviously a POV disagreement for now, I offered a solution that we keep the articles of <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drum_and_bass.html" title="Drum and bass">drum and bass</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/n/Jungle_music.html" title="Jungle music">Jungle music</a> separate (with references to the debate in the headers) <b>UNTIL</b> more research has been done... this met with a resounding silence and continued sneaky redirections. Is there any way to lock a page (or lock a user from editing a page).</p>
<p>I guess I fear that over-bearing, control-freak users will make it too difficult and stressful for a lot of useful information to be posted... I know that I have stopped adding to the Jungle-music page until I know my work won't be deleted. I have a 17,000 word thesis (on the history of these styles of music) being offered to me in order that I can add more the info there - but what's the point?</p>

<p>Of course.

<p>I accept that you did what you thought was "best". Where we disagree is on whether it's even good, let alone best. Aaron, frankly, I think you should <i>never</i> delete an article that you are not sure consensus wants gone. Neither should Jimbo for that matter. He isn't actually the Pope and his judgement is not infallible, even if it is unchallengeable. If you think that a good way to promote discussion is to piss off half the people already involved in discussing something, I really do think you need another think about it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the difference we have is one of conceptualising the debate, Aaron. You think we were having a debate over whether an article should be restored. I don't. I think we were having a debate over whether people who don't like the article should be permitted to destroy it. I think that is always what any deletion debate comes down to. Sometimes we agree that they can and sometimes we don't, but they should have our agreement before doing so. If we are making out that we work by consensus, we stand by that. Otherwise, we have to understand that we work by fiat. I for one would never have voted for you had I had that understanding. I would in fact vote against each and every admin candidate who suggested that they should be allowed to remove content by fiat rather than with the backing of consensus. If you are able to look at it from that conceptual frame, you may be able to understand why I don't think your action in removing the content was helpful, particularly if you consider that some of the discussers, including me of course, do not have the tools to prevent you.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrace_Note_02ea.html" title="User:Grace Note">Grace Note</a> 03:03, 23 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your reply. I do understand that re-deleting the article didn't solve the problem I was trying to address. I appreciate all the time that you've taken to talk to me about this, and hope that you understand if I don't talk about it anymore it's only because I think that I talk too much. Keep an eye on me and do keep telling me when you think I've screwed up.</dd>

<dd>Thanks for that. I'm not aware of how copyright law adresses re-distribution without attribution of promotional material, Japanese or otherwise.

<dd>And a lot of us think you're still wrong. TVRage is growing whether you or anyone else around here likes it or not. So eventually, they'll be right back here with justification that you just won't be able to deny. I don't get why you feel the need to prolong the inevitable. Good thing I'm in charge at Tv.com, or I wouldn't know the truth. You've actually proven that you are biased, and have decided the bigger website can't have competition on here. This link from our Modirator Lounge proves it: <a href="http://www.tv.com/moderator-hangout/tvrage-wiki-page/topic/22723-214121/msgs.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tv.com/moderator-hangout/tvrage-wiki-page/topic/22723-214121/msgs.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Undeniable proof that Tv.com admins and managers asked staff members here directly to get rid of TVRage. I agree with most, but not all of JohnQ's statements on the delete page. This is just proof that all those reports are true. This website is unfair and not to be taken seriously. And if you really wanted to be serious, you would have merged with a formal library long ago. Sincerely, P.P.
<dl>
<dd>Err, yes. <i>Error(s): You do not have access to view topics on this board.</i> is all I get there, so if you're going to convince me that I've been compelled by my TV.com controllers to delete this page, you're going to have give me a bit more to go on. Why, for instance, would "staff members" care what a third party wanted up to do with regards to "competition "? What coercion and/or inducement are you suggesting was offered? - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000"><sup>{T}</sup></font></a><span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="#000000" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 13:33, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Damn, I though we took off the barrier. A couple of our staff have gloated that they have your people "in their pockets." You removed TVRage, which was a site in direct competition with us. Wiki = publicity. We know this. Why do you think we added a page on here? A good portion of our traffic comes from the fact that we have a page here. You deleted our competition from the website so that only ONE source for television info could remain here. We steal the traffic TVRage would have gotten. I'm not saying YOU specificly were told to kill them off. I don't even know who the "pocket people" are. I'm just saying that we're aware of how things around here really work. You don't care what the users on the site think. You start a delete post, get opinions, and then cast your own votes amoung Admins and a few Editors. I am saying that there are at least two people in charge of that vote who are registered at Tv.com, and a few others who were convinced by some of our staff and some officials at CNet to vote delete. If you think I'm wrong or full of it, go back to when Tv.com was up for being deleted, and see how quickly we got the vote to stay. We've won no awards, all our publicity comes from other CNet websites, and no one has bothered to write an article on us. But we've stayed! I wonder why? All I'm saying is I think TVRage got a bum deal because a lot of the members from both our site and here are corrupt. No one would have even bothered TVRage with a delete post if we hadn't been watching for them to re-post here. And considering that it's been shown that both normal users and respected Editors were saying TVRage should stay, it's rather suspicious that they'd still be deleted by the Admins. And I'll thank you not to post my IP, I want to remain anonymous. P.P. Thanks for taking the time to respond.</p>

<ul>
<li>You will want to get an account if you wish to remain anonymous. It only takes one click for anyone (administrator or no) to see your contributions in my history. It's standard practice to place an identifier after comments that are unsigned (in the narrow wikipedia sense of providing a link to the user and contributions) and almost anyone who sees your comments will do so.</li>
<li>I do care what users here think, and try to ensure that deletion decisions reflect what not only those who participate in the debate itself wish, but also those who've participated in hammering out guidelines. It's a lot more work to construct a framework within wich it's possible to make unbiased decisions than it is to make intuitive responses to single issues. Notability guidelines are usually worked out over <i>months</i> and have at times included input from hundreds of users, and should not be cast aside lightly.</li>
<li>I care not one whit for competition, to be frank. All I care about is encyclopedic value. If and when TvRage has bitten into, well whomever, enough to garner some coverage in independant media to demonstrate its encyclopedic value, I'll be happy to see it restored. But not until then.</li>

<li>Actually, although the blue link looks suss, it's what we often to with cra.. er, non-notable bands. Since their names are usually "plausible missplellings" they often get redirected. So, "Daith" has in fact simply recreated a deleted article, but someone else has come along and done the correct thing with it. One (slightly smart-arse) outcome is that the "very new" users often have difficulty knowing how to do re-direct... thus resulting in things popping up with varied capitalisation. So if you'd like, just put it on your watchlist and if it turns into a band article again <i>then</i> send it to afd.</li>
<li>Just a small point - we <i>can't</i> delete things per WP:MUSIC. There is a chasm between the speedy deletion criterion and the suggested inclusion critera, on purpose, that we have to send to afd. We can, however, now send them to {{prod}}, thank you Radiant! wherever you are!</li>
