<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronSw_South_Africa_notes_3348.html" title="Edit section: Imperialism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Imperialism</span></h2>
<p>Defined as: the policy of dominion of a nation by direct territorial acquisitions or by gaining indirect control over the political or economic life of other areas</p>
<p>A few different types in South Africa:</p>
<p>Dutch Imperialism: Started in 1652, when the Dutch East India Company establishes a colony at the Cape of Good Hope. It was just supposed to be a small station, but it quickly became very profitable.During this period, the colonizing Boers (farmers), or Afrikaners, begin settling large farms at the expense of San and Khoikhoi, non-Bantu speakers of the region</p>
<p>British Imperialism: Britain takes the Cape Colony from the Dutch in 1795. South Africa was seen as a simply a stepping stone to trade in Asia, very little was invested into the colony. Slowly they began to establish more laws and more formal style of imperial rule on both Afrikaners and Africans. The Afrikaners began to move inland in search of better land (the Great Boer Trek) to escape control by the British government.</p>
<p>Economic Imperialism: When diamonds and gold were discovered, it was seen how profitable South Africa could be, and the conflicts between the Boers and the British were superseded by the imposition of formal British rule over South Africa's interior. Quickly, diamond and gold mines became critical to the British Imperial economy, and steps were taken to ensure that the profits from those mines remained in the hands of Europeans.</p>
<p>Apartheid: Resulting policies increased control over African labor and African movement on the basis of race-policies that would eventually lead to the twentieth-century system of Apartheid, which can be thought of as a form of imperialism.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronSw_South_Africa_notes_3348.html" title="Edit section: Colonialism">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Colonialism</span></h2>
<p>Defined as: The political, social, economic, and cultural domination of a territory and its people by a foreign power for an extended time. The main difference between this and imperialism is the degree by which the territory is settled by people. Colonialism implies a larger number of settlers.</p>

<p>The Dutch Cape Colony, 1652 - 1795: Started with the Dutch East India Company. Most of the settlers came from low classes of Dutch and German society to practice intensive agriculture, but it wasn’t very successful, so they set up towns to cater to the traders. These town grew enormously, and more formal political structures were established.</p>
<p>The Dutch Pastoral Colony, 1652 – 1795: A lot of white colonizers also decided to become pastoral farmers, with hunting as a sideline- the Boer population. They spread out thinly over a vast area of land, becoming more isolated from the towns around the southwest. They ended up taking over a lot of land from the San and the Khoikhoi.</p>
<p>The British Cape Colony, 1795 – 1870: British began to bring small numbers of people to South Africa to maintain it as a colony, but mostly for economic purposes. They also brought in missionary organizations. Eventually, they created legislative bodies. In 1820, the British government paid for a group of 4000 people to come to South Africa and set them up as agricultural farmers. This created conflicts with the Boers.</p>

<p>Dominated land usage for farming, kicked native people out of their lands. With the Dutch settlers, Khoikhoi and the native pastoral communities tried to fit in with the trade relations of the colonists, but with little success- throughout the successive skirmishes and wars between the Khoikhoi and the Dutch, they were expelled from their farming lands (1660s). With the British settlers of the 1820s, the gov’t placed them on land claimed by Xhosa who had been moved from their land earlier.</p>
<p>Slavery: Started importing slaves from all around the world, like Indonesia, India, and Sri Lanka. Also from other areas of Africa as well, like Mozambique and Madagascar. Even when the British outlawed slavery, such racial discrimination and exploitation of the desperate poverty of the native people pretty much kept things the same.</p>
<p>Political: Legally, slaves had no rights. They couldn’t marry, had no rights over their children, and couldn’t make legal contracts. They could be sold at will. Because pastoralists were often kicked out of their lands, they had to work for white colonists, who often treated them with exactly the same procedure as slaves</p>

<p>The most important fact to remember is that the settlers were completely dependent on their slave labor. They consistently had to be importing slaves, because the slave population was not self-reproducing. Since the slave population came from all over Asia and Africa, they had a vast amount of cultural, linguistic, and religious backgrounds, and it was pretty much impossible for them to be unified very much.</p>
<p>Most of the Dutch, French, and German settlers were from the lowest classes of European society, but the differences between their European backgrounds diminished in the colonial situation. Basically social origins didn’t matter anymore, only abilities.</p>
<p>At the very beginning, relationships between the settles and the Khoikhoi were pretty cordial, but once the Khoikhoi realized what a challenge the settlers were putting forth, they began to attack, and a series of small wars followed, ending up with the disintegration of the Khoikhoi society.</p>
<p>Within the white Cape Colony, status and wealth were very important. Political officials had a lot of power and authority; there was a class of wealthy traders and farmers, and a growing class of poor whites. In between there were small traders, farmers, and business owners. There was also a lot of political tension between the senior officials and the most successful settlers of the colony.</p>
<p>There were few marriages between European men and freed slave women, but a lot of extramarital sexual activity, which contributed to much genetic mixing within both the “black” and the “white” populations.</p>
<p>When the Dutch pastoralists began moving onto the land of the native pastoralist, they would start by using a spring and its nearby pastures without opposition, and then attain exclusive control, turning the indigenous people to tenants and clients. The indigenous hunter-gatherers (the San) would turn to raiding in order to survive. But the trekboers were never self-sufficient, they would still have roots in Cape Town.</p>

<p>in context, the systematic destruction of a people. Basically, the various wars between the natives and the settlers were often very violent, and in the cases when the settlers won, usually because of better firearm power, they would often systematically kill all of the adult men- leaving the women and children. For example (Thompson, pg 49) Trekboer commandos would exterminate adult hunter gatherers, but would make a point of capturing children, and they would distribute the children among themselves. Also, as a result of diseases such as smallpox imported by the Europeans, of some assimilation with the settlers and especially with the slaves who were to arrive in later years, and of some straightforward extermination, the Khoikhoi have effectively disappeared as an identifiable group- the closest descendents are the so-call Cape Colored people. Also, in the many brutal wars among different African native groups, there would also be systematic killing of the men, and incorporation of women and children into their society for the purposes of enlarging the family.</p>

<p>Contrary to this myth, which was spread not only in South Africa, but also in Europe, South Africans were not very warlike. They did participate in raids, but overall were not a very hostile population.</p>
<p>This stereotype was created mainly to justify the colonial take-over, by making the native inhabitants seem less human, and to justify the violent means used in colonization.</p>
<p>Also, the colonists did not understand the social structure of the South Africans, and often misinterpreted their actions.</p>

<p>Shaka ascended to Zulu chiefdom in 1816, though he was not next in line, because of his warrior prowess. He greatly expanded his kingdom, and made many military innovations, like the creation of the short spear and a technique of hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>He also re-arranged the social structure, taking boys into military service and keeping them in an all male environment during their fighting years.</p>
<p>Also expanded his kingdom, capturing or incorporating other chiefdoms into his massive state. Many see him as a hero for his resistance to colonization, but many also see him as a bringer of “Mfecane,” a time of great suffering, because of his system of central state tyranny.</p>

<p>On one side of the gender myths is one of pre-colonial harmony, in which there was communal bliss, and the social structure worked without mishap.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the gender system was not horrible, and women as well as men viewed the institution of marriage very differently from the Western view.</p>
<p>There were no white saviors of women. This myth simply played off the racial and gender myths, displaying African men as animals.</p>

<p>There was a myth that all tribes were stagnant, with a history of animosity and warfare towards each other. This view affected the Africans later when colonists attempted to create homelands, and when they put the different groups at odds in working situations.</p>
<p>In fact, tribes weren’t really so stable. People were a valuable commodity in Africa, and tribes were organized around the goal of gaining more members. With this mindset, it was a better idea to be open to new members, and not to be hostile and excluding.</p>
<p>People from different tribes married across lines, changed allegiances if they were unsatisfied with one chiefdom, or began their own. They were not race-based</p>

Set a precedent as a racially-split labor force, as blacks were required to do dangerous manual labor while whites “supervised” them.</p>

<p>Black reserves were being transformed into reservoirs of cheap, unskilled labor for white farmers and industrialists. Blacks didn’t have the training to obtain skilled jobs and also were on the receiving end of a blatantly racist white government. The combination of the two forced the black population to remain stagnant in the labor hierarchy formed. Natives Land Act of 1913 also included clauses that reduced all Africans in the white-owned rural areas into tenant and wage laborers.</p>

<p>The Africans were forced into an economy based on money, not crops. They weren’t prepared for their transition into the capitalist economy and thusly were easily manipulated by government acts that made black South Africans wage laborers. The reliance upon money came from many of the black peoples’ desire to fit in with the white ways. For instance, the Christian ideals of the whites required the natives to purchase clothes, which in turn required money. The demands of white civilization coupled with the racist laws of the white government created a wage labor economy centered on the Bantu homeland labor reservoirs</p>

<p>Black laborers weren’t allowed to live in white cities and were kept in homelands far outside of the urban areas. These workers migrated into the cities to work each day and then went back at the end of the day to live in their homesteads.

<p>Lecture: male dominated place; living space separated by ethnicity; devised own forms of entertainment (i.e. gum boots into dance, brewing beer for drinking); social problems with women – prostitutes and town women</p>
<p>Going for Gold: Aggressive when out of mines – “they became aggressive when they come out from work and are not afraid of anything that faces them (82); umzi = homestead, “the commitment to building an umzi was dependent on a wider social and economic system, rooted in the potential for ‘doing-for-oneself’…” (32); boy said “he was on business” @ mine “needed money desperately as he wanted to buy cattle and pay lobola for his wife and build his umzi” and “interest in ‘building an umzi’- the true aspiration of every traditionalist Xhosa speaker (133-34); would enter mine marriages because it “would enable them to accumulate bridewealth sooner and thus began to build umzi” (138); goal was “to more rapidly become ‘men’ at home” equating becoming a man to building up an umzi, sexuality fit well into umzi system because it “indirectly served to maintain the authority of older men within the subsistence system at home” (139)</p>
<p>Synopsis: The primary goal of migrant worker was to earn money to buy cattle to pay lobola for their wives and, thus, start a family and build their umzi/ homestead. Building up one’s umzi allowed him to become a man; this provided incentive for him to earn money quickly even if it meant stooping to unpleasant means.</p>

<p>Going for Gold: izibonda = room representatives; chosen by unanimous vote by boarders, generally quiet, reasonable, had more mine experience, mediator inside room &amp; spokesman to rest of compound; position “had its origins in the workers’ own need for solidarity and self-regulation rather than any management initiative,” “had not co-opted with management,” position of great responsibility, no one sure if they initiated worker resistance (97-98); election of iz. allowed “all sorts of arguments and group pressures” to be presented, open discussions designed for “negotiating a consensus” (260); sometimes considered by union “management stooges” (109), under Shangaan practice only iz. could enter mine marriage (130); induna: = black supervisors, supposed to represent will of the people, could enforce or forget about rules, could invoke management authority, had arbitrary power, “favoritism” &amp; “victimization” – “the diffuse power of the induna lent itself well to both,” people play up to him to receive favors, behave like one of royal blood making people tease behind his back, also had informal powers from umteto (Nguni word for law/custom/ etc.) (83); could be caught up in moral economy in compound system/ also cases were simply compound managers creature, induna practice died out w/ National Union of Mineworkers (255); “unvarnished view of white management despotism” with fall of puppet indunas (268); “grievances go through isibonda to the induna,” “if induna himself was unjust or unresponsive”… “instruct isibonda to get together and arrange to summon everyone to a meeting…outside the compound manager’s office,” induna relayed the going-ons of the compound to the manager (88-89)</p>
<p>Synopsis: Both the izibonda and induna were figures of black authority in the compounds but the izibonda was elected by the workers with informal power while the induna was appointed by the compound manager with official responsibilities. Both could be in cahoots with management but most often the induna was the manager’s puppet.

<p>Synopsis: Mine marriages kept men from contracting disease or becoming obligated to illegitimate children thus allowing them to maintain their focus of building umzi.

<p>The Section 10 Rights were under the Group Areas Act of 1950 that virtually separated parts of white South Africa into a checkerboard with different zones for specific races. One consequence of the influx control system was to create a condition of permanent insecurity for the African population in urban areas. The situation was only marginally better for the minority of urban Africans who, by virtue of their long-term urban residence prior to the adoption of the seventy-two hour law, had been granted permanent urban status under section 10 of the Group Areas Act. Under Section 10 of the Urban Areas Act, no African can be present in an urban area for more than 72 hours unless he/she has fulfilled certain obligations. Those exempted from these restrictions are generally referred to as 'Section 10 dwellers'. These persons were given the right to move between different urban areas in search of work without registering with the labor bureau; in addition, they will be given job preference over migrants. "Section 10 rights" could be lost for a variety of legal infractions or because the government deemed their holder "undesirable." A loss of Section 10 rights brought with it the prospect of being "endorsed out" and forced to move to a rural area.</p>

<p>(Thompson) - The government tired to limit the flow of Africans into the cities with a complex accumulation of pass laws. The origin of those laws goes back to the eighteenth century, when slaves were obliged to carry document signed by their masters when they were absent from their master’s homes. Some pass laws were designed to ensure that white farmers should not lose their African laborers. Others were designed to prevent Africans from living in towns except as laborers for Whites. If the African failed to produce it on demand by an official, he would be jailed or expelled from the town. In 1967 in a general circular the government stated “it is accepted that the Bantu are only temporarily resident in the European areas of the Republic for as long as they offer their labor there. As soon as they become no longer fit for work they are expected to return to their country of origin or the territory of the national unit where they fit ethnically.”</p>

<p>(Thompson)</p>
<p>Black Townships – The burgeoning manufacturing and service industries as well as expanding mine industry drew in many Africans from improvised reserves into townships. Africans built shacks of sacks, woods, corrugated iron, and cardboard on the outskirts of white towns. The town were violent places (totsis), seething with discontent. Many forms of illegal activity such as shebeens, prostitution, and robbery, took place in the townships out of financial necessity. Most people lived in poverty.</p>
<p>White neighborhoods – White suburbs in white cities were in far better condition then black townships. Many of the facilities were superior. Crime, Violence, Domestic Abuse and Drug use were considerably lower. Social customs and censorship or radio and news often left whites unaware of the plight of the other races. White neighborhood had a surprising amount of diversity when one considers the numerous black servants each white home would have.</p>

<p>(Thompson) – Failure to modify governmental policy caused frustration and divisions of opinion among politically conscious black South Africans. The Africanists wanted a purely Africa movement. The Africanists under Sobukwe broke away in 1959 and formed the Pan-Africanist Congress. On March 21, 1960, upstaging the ANC, they launched a campaign against the pass laws. Large numbers of Africans assembled at police stations without passes, inviting arrest in the hope of clogging the machinery of justice. At a police station in Sharpville, near Johannesburg, the police opened fire killing 67 and wounding 186, most of who were shot in the back. The confrontation led to widespread work stoppage and disturbances. Government struck back fiercely by mobilizing army forces and outlawing the ANC and PAC. The forces deprived Africans of the last change of organizing lawful, peaceful, countrywide opposition to apartheid and forced the ANC leaders underground.</p>
<p>(Kaffir Boy) – Once I remember black people did attempt to fight for their rights. A group of learned black people organized a march of protest to show white people that they didn’t want to carry passes any more. Many were shot while fleeing for safety.</p>

<p>(Thompson) – The government’s attempt to mold the minds of young black people through tight control over their education lead to widespread outrage. Black students were profoundly frustrated by the condition in their school and colleges. The ideas of Black Consciousness penetrated the urban schools. On June 16 1976, thousands of black school children in Soweto demonstrated against the government’s insistence that half of their subjects be taught in Afrikaans (the language of the oppressor). Protests became nationwide after the police shot and killed a thirteen year old at the demonstration. At least 575 people were killed, 134 being under the age of eighteen. During 1977 the government banned SASO and all its affiliated organizations. Thousands of young blacks fled the country.</p>
<p>(Kaffir Boy) – All the hate, bitterness, frustration and anger that had crystallized into a powder keg in the minds of black students, waited for an igniting spark. The spark was the Bantu Education’s department sudden decree that black schools had to teach in Afrikaans instead of English. Banners said “we don’t want to learn the language of our oppressors” “stop feeding us a poisonous education,” and “equal education not slave education.” There was lots of looting and burning of government facilities and other shops.</p>

<p>(Thompson) – Though the government had previously left African Education to mission schools, the national government felt that mission schools were transmitting dangerous, alien ideas to their African students and making them as Verwoerd said Black Englishmen. However, with the expanding economy and industry requiring more literate workers the national government instituted the Bantu Education Act (1953). Under the act, the central government assumed all control of public African education, making it virtually for non governmental schools to continue operating. Verwoerd stated “if the native in South Africa today in any kind of school in existence is being taught to expect that he will live his adult life under a policy of equal rights, he is making a big mistake … the re is no place for him in the European community above the level of a certain form of labor.” Education was not compulsory for black children. Black facilities were considerably inferior. Black schools got considerably less funding leading to lower teacher pay and fewer textbooks. Coloured and Indian schools were inferior to whites but better than black schools in many respects.</p>
<p>(Kaffir Boy) – Under Bantu Education law black children were supposed to acquire a solid foundation in tribal life, which would prepare them for a productive future in their respective homelands. Verwoerd “the native child must be taught subject which will enable him to work with and among his own people […] Bantu education should not be used to create imitation whites.”</p>

<p><b>Black spots</b> were rural “land owned or occupied by Africans in white areas” (Thompson 193) that the government assigned to belong to another racial group, generally whites. This term was applied to lands outside the Homelands where Africans still worked the land, either as landowners or as sharecropping tenants. Under apartheid, the South African government tried to whitewash these black spots by forcing the Africans who were occupying the land to leave, as they became unnecessary labor when the agricultural industry mechanized. These surplus workers were generally forced to relocate to their appropriate Homelands. This <b>Forced Relocation</b> also occurred in urban areas as non-whites were removed to townships outside the main cities or back to the Homelands. Overall, it is estimated that 3,548,900 people were forced to move between 1960 and 1983 (Thompson 194).</p>

<p>A small minority of Africans in South Africa placed themselves among a more stable class. Though they had as few rights as other blacks, they maintained larger, more stable households. Many were the descendants of prominent chiefs and thus received good missionary educations. Many held white collar jobs but were still under the supervisions of prominent whites. Some even worked for the Bantu Education/ Homeland system, taking as much as they could out of what they knew was a false institution. This group would end up in direct conflict with other poor blacks after the fall of apartheid due to a continually expanding disparity in wealth between the two groups.</p>

<p>I couldn’t find specific references made to the black market in any of the major readings. After reviewing my notes, I think the black market refers to the underground crime activities taking place throughout much of South Africa at the time. Alcohol, drugs, and prostitution played a major role in this underground world. If any of you have any other descriptions or definitions, please share.</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe what was meant was a black market, as in, selling products to the black population. White businesses were often in favor of black urbanization because they wanted a middle-class black market to which they could sell consumer goods.</li>

<p><b>Border Industries</b> are industrial compounds that developed near the Homelands (later Bantustans) to exploit the hoards of black workers who could not make a living as agriculturalists on the Homelands. These industries were subsidized by the state in order that provide this employment as part of its attempt to prop the Bantustans up as independent nations.</p>
<p><b>Closer settlements</b> were areas where artificial suburbs arose on Homelands from which Africans had to commute (often very long distances) to get to work in white cities because there was no agriculture or industry in these areas. (Lectures 2/9 and 2/14).</p>

<p>The rezoning and subsequent bulldozing of these two areas where non-whites had lived urban, cosmopolitan lives are indicative of the forced relocation policies of apartheid. Under these programs, the areas mentioned and others were rezoned for exclusively white use. The mixed township of Sophiatown was destroyed in 1954-1955, while the Coloured community of District 6 was removed slightly later. Both these sites provide memorial to loss suffered under apartheid (See Thompson 194 for more info, not that in-depth and lecture 2/16).</p>

<p>The labor hostels served as an ideal living space for the apartheid system because they provided white South Africa with the necessary labor force without paying the reproduction costs. The hostels emphasized the fact that blacks should only be in the city to work and most should stay on the Bantustans. The hostels also strained male-female relations as females were reliant on male wages to survive and so men could exercise tyrannical power over them, especially as they were the ones who were legitimately in the hostels. Aside from dividing men and women, the hostels were places of ethnic division as many hostel-dwellers were more conservative and linked to their homelands than township residents (especially true of Zulus). (Information from Lecture 2/16, for in-depth stuff go to A Bed Called Home).</p>

<p>&#160; A Bed Called Home: &#160; In the late 1960’s, women and children entered the hostel environment since the creation of the Abolition of Influx Control Act of 1986. Older men would mentor younger people from their villages to protect them from city life and exploitation from local township folk, which mainly included local township women. Some mentors would keep a small portion of the younger ones’ earnings so that there would be savings for the end of the year visit home and to support their family. Others lost touch with their traditions and didn’t return home, having lost themselves to the city.</p>
<p>Hostel life revolves around the men, who seem to have historical claim to everything, whether it’s eating first or bathroom privileges. Within the hostels, women prepare meals and take care of household chores while children played outside with their mothers. At night, when the men came home from work, children were to be kept quiet so that the men could sleep and wake early the next morning for work. Often, some men feel that their space is being invaded by noisy women and children who live with their families. Many parts of the home are segregated—men reserve the front room for meals and meetings while women use either the bedrooms or the outside area, but this varies from hostel to hostel. Teenage boys would sleep in the front room but would have to wake up to help their fathers in the morning and to get out of their way. During the weekend, only men are allowed to use the laundry and hang their clothes since that is the only time they have available.</p>
<p>Women are deemed to be the extensions of their menfolk and are not recognized as persons in the hostel system of justice, which is a point of distress because of feelings of abuse. Age plays an important dividing line in women. Senior women, “who are done with the business of being women,” become honorary men controlling younger women.</p>
<p>Relationships between men are characterized by hierarchy legitimized by tradition and based on age differences. For example, younger men defer to their elders, who supposedly have more wisdom and reliability in handling others. Some men, especially in the Langa clan, only allow women as day-time visitors because of their commitment to a clean Christian life and their desire to maintain a spirit of “brotherhood.” Allowing women to sleep over in the hostels would threaten this moral purity, create points of conflict between the men and set a bad example for younger residents. Men are in control of the language used, especially older men. Hostel’s township neighbors discriminate against those living in hostels, viewing them as outsiders. Due to poor or lack of recreational space, many hostel dwellers get bored and resort to gambling and alcohol, which lead to more violence and assault.</p>
<p>Some relationships in hostels are still seen as marriages even if that man has another family in the rural areas. A woman marries into the man’s family whereas the man remains unattached to the women’s family, except for the responsibility of the lobola. By bringing the woman into the man’s family, the man develops a system of control and ensures the perpetuation of patriarchal family relations. Culturally, the women are responsible for the new bride, establishing control by the mother-in-law and sisters-in-law over the bride. This creates divisions between women instead of fostering supportive relationships. Women oscillate between town and country—torn between the responsibilities of looking after their rural home and raising the children and maintaining a personal relationship with their husbands. To the man, his wife and children are obligatory responsibilities, especially in rituals and traditional healing ceremonies in the case of sickness within the family. Women are constantly battling to keep their husbands who sometimes cheat and leave them for other township women. If this occurs, the woman is left with no income and no support, resorting to begging, prostitution, or finding a job, which means leaving their children alone. Single women are in stiff competition for finding a supportive male, seeing them as useful resources. The men use these “girlfriends” for companionship and domestic work while the women use the men for their wages.</p>

<p>“Red People”: went into the city, but rejected European clothing, culture, and Christianity; avoided school, church, and western commodities; they honored ways of ancestors; built up homesteads and tried to preserve traditions and native ways; an example is Mathabane’s father in Kaffir Boy</p>

<p>Pretty much how it sounds. European missionaries used the guise of education to impose Christianity and their ideas of colonization on the natives. They basically taught the natives how to adjust to conquest. While the goals of some missionaries may have been noble, most missionaries worked out of the idea of the “white man’s burden.” Instead of acknowledging pre-existing native ideas and lifestyles, they assumed that the white way was the right way and selfishly used education to cause divisions among accommodating and resisting blacks. These divisions, despite the noble goals of some missionaries, exacerbated the plight of the natives some wanted to stick with traditions while others wanted to embrace Christianity and other white ways.</p>

<p>Most whites basically freaked out because they wanted to preserve the separation of their ways from the black ways that they believed were inherently inferior. When this assimilation became proletarianization in the latter half of the 20th century, whites became scared that the up-and-coming blacks were going to steal their jobs. This fear that blacks would steal jobs from whites as they gained more education and worked to assimilate caused whites to intensify their beliefs in apartheid. So there was financial stimulus for the whites not wanting blacks to be involved in “their” society.</p>

<p>Basically, reread the important parts of Biko. But here are some key ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>owning your race; pride and dignity in color</li>
<li>being black is not a skin color, but a state of mind</li>
<li>"The first step is to make the black man come to himself; to pump life back into his empty shell; to infuse him with pride and dignity, to remind him of his complicity in the crime of allowing himself to be misused and therefore letting evil reign supreme in the country of his birth. This is what we mean by an inward-looking process. This is the definition of ‘Black Consciousness" pg. 29</li>
<li>Blacks no longer seek to seek to reform the system because doing so implies acceptance of the major points around which the system revolves</li>
<li>black solidarity
<ol>
<li>We are all oppressed by the same system</li>
<li>That we are oppressed to varying degrees is a deliberate design to stratify us not only socially but in terms of aspirations</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Biko criticizes the Church because it tells the destitute blacks to “turn the other cheek” in response to white subjugation. It manifests a tacit acceptance of the system and thus perpetuates the belief that “white equals value.”</li>
<li>he hates the white liberal ideology because the liberals act like they care about the blacks when they actually are just trying to alleviate their guilty consciences due to apartheid. They try to maintain white political domination with a façade of aid to blacks. According to Biko, the white liberal is “eager to demonstrate his identification with the black people only so far as it does not sever all his ties with his relatives on the other side of the color line.”</li>
<li>basically, black consciousness is a call for black solidarity without white help because the whites cannot possibly understand the plight of the blacks.</li>

<p>Distinct culture developed, blacks living in Sophiatown didn’t fit in to the roles white South Africa had envisioned. Cultural Hybridity formed, creolization, different cultures melded to form a unique new one. Tsotsis (gangsters) adopted American dress, slang, and names for their gangs</p>

<p>Sophiatown was an enclave in Johannesburg that emerged as one of the few places where blacks could own property alongside Indians, Asians, Coloureds, and some poor whites. It was also a place where black South Africans became fascinated with blacks in the U.S. and spurred a black consciousness movement where they looked to Black America for a way to define themselves in the international community. Sophiatown’s identity also manifested itself in writings, such as DRUM magazine. There was also a rise in new forms of Christianity, bringing together ideas from African spiritual life and European Christianity.</p>

<p>The term Shebeens refers to the bars of illegally, home brewed beers set up in Townships in South Africa.

They were also large centers for prostitution for the black miners.</p>
<p>Later, once beer brewing became legal, shebeens became important social centers in townships where blacks could socialize, dance and sing with each other. Jazz music was very important as one of the many forms of entertainment in Shebeens as well as a lively stage scene. By taking advantage of a job usually done by women, it was also source of independence for black South African women.</p>

<p>From lecture notes 2/7:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working class whites against—felt economically threatened; saw the problem as the need to enforce segregation</li>
<li>White liberals (missionaries, humanitarians), also those who saw the profit in the black market and those who needed long-term, skilled labor—had always been for African assimilation</li>
<li>White ambivalence: safer to keep them in rural areas, but economically better to have them in town as consumers, laborers</li>
<li>Government—saw the problem of how will they govern urban Africans who will be there permanently: families with children (what will they do with the children?), unemployment, well-organized gangs</li>
<li>the National Party’s policy statement on the racial problem (of needing to maintain white supremacy) was a contradictory hybrid of two competing ideas: it set out complete economic segregation of Africans in their reserves as an ultimate goal but qualified it by stressing the need to satisfy white farming and manufacturing interests (Thompson 185)</li>
</ul>
<p>From lecture notes 2/16:</p>
<ul>
<li>So then led to urban hostel as an Apartheid ideal—Whites didn’t want blacks to be members of society or to have to take care of their families, but they wanted there to be urban laborers, so they made hostels bachelors-only in order to keep wives and children in the reserves. (The whole idea was to redefine urban Africans as members of reserves, not of society.)</li>
<li>also dealt with need of urban black workers by creating a special class of blacks with rights to stay in city (“section 10 rights”) (2/9)</li>
<li>another angle on white ambivalence: blend of fear and intimacy because of African urbanization outside the plan (1. informal settlements that were rebuilt if destroyed 2. blacks living in white neighborhoods as servants, nannies?led to profound form of contacts between races, interdependency) (2/16)</li>

<ul>
<li>Grand apartheid = a system of labor control, the Bantustan system (political rights only apply in rural reserves), denial of urban housing rights (2/9)
<ul>
<li>used to prevent Africans from numerically dominating and getting political rights (2/14)</li>
<li>from theory that South Africa belongs to whites, so blacks should have a separate development where they could ‘develop along their own lines’</li>
<li>implementation done by 1) separation—strengthened color bar, introduced legal mechanisms like identity cards, segregated places 2) rolling back African claims to membership in South Africa—systematically stripping of rights i.e. expanded restrictions on housing, made voting only a racial privilege; Bantustan</li>
<li>at heart of apartheid—idea that 1) there were four “racial groups,” 2) Whites as the civilized race were entitled to have absolute control over the states 3) white interests should prevail over black interests, and 4) white racial group formed a single nation while Africans belonged to several distinct nations (Thompson 190)</li>
<li>reason for rural relocation: migrant labor system had been based on the fact that workers had land in rural areas where they could return to, but when the land was no longer functional as an agricultural base, there was fear that blacks would become detached from the land, flee to the cities, and become numerically dominant. Because the election of 1948 rejected accepting this, and because white farmers wouldn’t allow them to take away their land, they decided the only option was to have forced relocation of blacks (from farms, black spots, urban areas, informal settlement group areas) to reserves (2/14)</li>
<li>apartheid turned identities into legal identities; the ethnic consciousness created by the political structure (Bantustan, separating land by tribes) caused violence, ethnic hatred—made blacks go against one another (2/14)</li>
<li>apartheid was also a system of labor control, exploiting black people with low wages in a capitalistic society</li>

</li>
<li>for international complicity, “reformed” apartheid by getting rid of petty apartheid, but not grand apartheid (just jettisoning the most visible racial aspects) (2/9; Thompson 224):

<p><b>Non-racialism-</b> Policy of instituting popular democracy that would overthrow apartheid and instead replace it with a system of “one man, one vote” in which race would play no role in the political scene.</p>
<p><b>Africa for the Africans-</b> Espousing the “Africanist” point of view, the PAC (which largely dissolved in the ‘80s) took a more radical approach to rebelling against the apartheid system which addressed the historical basis of apartheid. The conquest of S. Africa (from here SA) resulted in whites taking land from native Africans, and the PAC sought to rectify socio-economic inequality through massive land redistribution.</p>
<p><b>Struggle against Capitalism-</b> Most thoroughly addressed by Thompson and Terrablanche (although he discusses the post-apartheid period), the “capitalism” used by the white elite utilized “super-exploitation” that generated enormous profits for owners and below-subsistence level wages for workers. Labor organization and boycotts sought to end a systematic reduction of African natives to cheap labor.</p>
<p><b>Black Consciousness Movement-</b> For a more thorough assessment, read Biko Ch. 9. In short, Biko endeavored to overthrow the “colonization of the mind” that had successfully wiped out African cultural heritage and replaced the void with Christian and Western European ideology in general. By valuing their own humanity and right to freedom in South Africa, Biko convinced blacks that being black was not merely a term describing skin color, but “a reflection of mental attitude”.</p>

<p>Here Mathabane would be a particularly useful resource. This includes the student uprisings (Soweto) and previous urban conflicts (Sharpeville) that were a direct result of political organization among blacks in urban areas. Also, the township local committees play a significant role in militarizing and mobilizing the black population against the oppression of apartheid.</p>

<p>A good place to discuss the effectiveness of Red vs. School, where eventually it was the white-educated blacks who used the system to achieve change, not a massive uprising of “red” Africans in what would almost had to have been armed struggle (which probably never would have defeated the well-equipped SA army). Significant change begins in 1986 with the repeal of the pass laws and the Land Act of 1913. Mandela is elected in 1994 and this leads into the next topic.</p>

<p>Since I missed the lecture on this, I’m not entirely sure what the “political transformations” is getting at, unless they mean the relatively peaceful surrender of the SA government instead of all out war and the general end to apartheid. The elections proceeded and the majority largely elected the ANC into power. The secret negotiations refers to the closed-door deals made between top ANC leaders and white-owned businesses. As a result, they were not held accountable for their business practices which exploited African labor for over 100 years and perpetuate socio-economic inequality to this day (Terrablanche).</p>

<p>Terrablanche Ch.11. The detachment of white business from the less-advanced sectors of the SA economy and the formation of the capitalist enclave. Not only have the major SA corporations benefited from the secret negotiations and the lack of integration into the rest of the SA economy, but their strong push for embracement of globalization has allowed for disinvestment and mobility of corporate assets that eliminate the possibility of wealth redistribution.</p>

<p>(Terreblanche, ch. 4)</p>
<p>In the 1994 election, the ANC alliance ran on the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP). The proposal originally came from COSATU, especially the National Union of Mineworkers (COSATU's "most powerful affiliate"). The ANC adopted their policy and it won them 60% of the electorate.</p>
<p>However, the ANC was "a dismal failure" in implementing it. In November 1994, the ANC published a white paper introducing "fiscal prudence" as a goal and dropping talk of redistribution. "Fiscal prudence" and other neoliberal policies, while a boon to the corporate sector, left no funding for RDP programs. Instead of funding the RDP itself, the ANC forced the different government departments to spend their funding on "RDP-oriented" programs. Nor did the ANC try to restructure the economy to break up monopolies caused by racial capitalism. The RDP office was finally closed in March 1996. In 1999 elections, the ANC again claimed to support the RDP. But it "seems as if the ANC accepted the RDP on a rhetorical level only, and used it mainly for electioneering purposes."</p>
<p>In June 1996, the ministry of finance introduced a new replacement program: Growth, Employment And Redistribution (GEAR). In "an almost desperate attempt to attract" foreign investors, GEAR promoted blatantly pro-business neoliberal policies for an export-oriented economy, claiming these would have incredible trickle-down effects for everyone. "Retreating into the fantasy world of economic textbooks", the ANC claimed that GEAR would achieve the RDP's goals.</p>
<p>By these standards, GEAR was another failure. While neoliberal targets were met, the larger goals were missed. The economy grew by only 2.7% instead of 4.2%, investment grew by only 1.2% instead of 11.7%, and employment actually shrank! Government officials blamed the Asian crisis and downplayed the projections, saying they weren't targets but far-off goals. But since the neoliberal targets were met, the corporate sector (and thus the ANC) continued supporting GEAR.</p>
<p>In 2001, the end of GEAR's planning period, the government claimed it was really a stabilization strategy and now that things were stable, growth would get started any day now.</p>

<p>(Thompson, 275ff)</p>
<p>After the ANC took power, it set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to look into human rights abuses since the Sharpeville massacre. It had the power to subpoena witnesses and grant individuals amnesty on the condition that they revealed the truth and could prove their actions were politically motivated.</p>
<p>The TRC's 17 commissioners were nominated by NGOs and selected for their opposition to apartheid. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, recipient of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, was chair. The commission received a great deal of money, including $1.4 million from the US government. Hearings began in December 1995 and lasted for two years.</p>
<p>Politicians, police, and military officiers all claimed their orders came from the very top: presidents Botha and de Klerk, who maintained they did nothing wrong. The commission decided they were lying. Meanwhile, the ANC was accused of several violent attacks but demanded a blanket amnesty since their cause was just. Tutu threatened to resign if it was granted and "found the ANC guilty of gross violations of human rights", but granted amnesty to 37 ANC politicians.</p>
<p>Africans and Afrikaaners both accused the TRC of unfairness. Mandela accepted the report "with all its imperfections" while Mbeki called it "wrong and misguided". The National Party called it "flawed and divisive". In the end, many killers and torturers received amnesty and most victims received very little in the way of reparations.</p>
<p>(Terreblanche, ch. 4)</p>
<p>Terreblanche criticizes it for focusing only on things like killing, abduction, and torture, arguing that it ignored the larger issue of racial capitalism and exploitation. (It spent only 3 days on the subject in its 2.5 years.) By doing so the ANC agreed "if not explicitly, then at least tacitly" to condone the vast profits made by whites and corporations through exploitation. The TRC went after those who violated the laws of apartheid, but not those who made the unfair laws in the first place. Its report ended up sounding like business was "a valued friend". In any event, the real problems go back 350 years -- not the 34 years the TRC focused on.</p>

<p><b>Racial capitalism</b> was the system instituted by the British which forced blacks into the position of exploited workers, combining the effects of both class control and segregationist policies. The blacks were exploited as a native, segregated workforce.</p>
<p>This system was not overthrown until the ANC took power and replaced it with <b>democratic capitalism</b>, which removed the racial segregationist components. However, this did little to change things, since poverty was still distributed across mostly racial lines and the ANC did nothing to alleviate this.</p>
<p><b>Social democracy</b> is a system supported by Terreblanche in which a stronger, interventionist state tries to guarantee a minimal standard of living for its population, ensuring they have food, health, housing, welfare, and perhaps even jobs.</p>

<p>A form of inequality caused by a large-scale structure in society, as opposed to more minor differences in ability or opportunity. Poor blacks are stuck in a form of structural inequality, where all the power and wealth goes to white corporate leaders and their well-placed associates in the black elite and there is very little opportunity for the average person to improve their lot.</p>
