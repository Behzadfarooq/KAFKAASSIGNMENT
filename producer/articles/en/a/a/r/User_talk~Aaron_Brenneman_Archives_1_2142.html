<p>Some comments on your reasonning:</p>
<ul>
<li>His arbitrary removal of a "spurious" nomination to VfD - perhaps I misspoke in my edit comment. The vfd notice was simple vandalism by an anon. Check the history <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Noncommutative_geometry&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Noncommutative_geometry&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> - the vfd notice had been removed twice over, by others.</li>
<li>His alteration of another editor's VfD vote... again, I think you're being unfair (and your wording implies that I changed the vote). I didn't change his vote, merely removed wikipediafascism - VFD isn't a soapbox for people ranting and insults; it's there for voting.</li>
</ul>
<p>As to the other two... well, I still think they were right, but I won't try to discuss them. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M. Connolley</a> 09:21:09, 2005-07-14 (UTC).</p>

<p>I checked Wiki-policy, there is no rule stating about what happens when a nominator votes keep, or the other votes related to the noms. I will try to see if people will return to the page and review their votes. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 05:09, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It has been ten days since I wrote the above, and for some reason, the article is still up for deletion. I am just going to see now if the vote to keep will increase or the voting will stay the same. The article has stabilized, and I am pretty happy with it. Not sure what will happen, though, or not sure how long before it is closed. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 01:33, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello! Sorry to bother you, but since you voted on the earlier CSD proposal about unremarkable bands, it would be appreciated if you cast your vote for this version.

<p>I thought I'd deal with your comment here, since it is outside the scope of VfD. Last point first: no, I wouldn't feel in any way cheated, because I could just go and write the article again myself....unless it had been locked away for 4 months. I couldn't merely recreate the old content, granted, but my creative powers are not so limited that this would be a problem. By not being bound by a vote I didn't participate in, I just mean that I feel free to vote this time based on my own assessment of things, and not purely on the fact that it had been VfD'd before. If I <i>had</i> voted before I'd feel somewhat morally bound to vote the same way again if the article was largely unchanged. Of course, your example is something of a hypothetical point: the chances of the community being so deserted as to create the scenario you describe are very slim indeed.</p>
<p>Finally, and because I like answering rhetorical questions, about policy. My answer above about being able to vote how I like having not voted before applies here, too. If a policy came up for a re-vote and I had not previously voted and it had not been changed, yes, I would feel free to go whichever way I liked. That's quite different to not being bound by the policy in between of votes on it though. The better analogy would be: "do you think that a deleted article should be undeleted just because you didn't participate in the vote". I would <i>not</i> think that, provided the VfD had been validly conducted and closed. If it was invalid then, yes, it should be undeleted and I would consider it on its own merits in my own way.</p>

<p>Nah, 'twas an exceptional situation, so I just took some exceptional steps. Hopefully they were those steps that were the least disruptive and closest to consensus. I consulted documentation beforehand, and read several related votes. I also politely talked with everyone who dropped by and asked me what I was doing, and provided them with links to the relevant docs.</p>
<p>This time last year, I don't think people would have made much trouble out of it, even if I'd done most of it without admin priveleges.&#160;:-P</p>
<p>Anyway, come morning, <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">User:Angela</a> and several others took over for me. and that's that. It's now out of my hands.&#160;:-)</p>
<p>A growing number of people on wikipedia have policy as first priority, and the continued correct functioning of wikipedia only as their second priority. I think the reason for this is that it takes time to integrate people into the wiki culture, and new folks can't oversee everything that's going on, so they reach for hard and fast rules to grab a hold of to start with.</p>
<p>Being so strict on policy is a bad thing. It makes the community rather brittle, and gives people like the GNAA a foothold where they can enter and disrupt our activities.</p>

<p>Firstly let me say that I am sorry to have to bother you.</p>
<p>Secondly, I wish to let you know that a recent VFD that you took part in has closed. The result was that 32 people voted to keep all individual bible verses as seperate articles, and 34 voted that they shouldn't (2 abstensions, and 3 votes for both). This is considered by standard policy not to be a consensus decision (although the closing admin stated that it was a consensus to keep them).</p>
<p>Thirdly, the subject has now been put to a survey, so that it may remain open until there is a clear consensus for what appears to be a difficult issue to resolve. You may wish to take part in this survey, and record a similar vote to the one you made at the VFD there. The survey is available at <a href="../../../b/i/b/Wikipedia%7EBible_verses_f874.html" title="Wikipedia:Bible verses">Wikipedia:Bible verses</a>.</p>

<p>I apologise if the tone of my comment seemed uncivil. However it is difficult to assume good faith when you open an RFC against an administrator who does such a difficult job, and doubtlessly receives enough flack as it is, for closing VfDs as "no consensus" when a simple tally of the votes would make it clear that there really was no consensus. I could find nothing even remotely resembling abuse of admin powers in any of the evidence you provided.</p>
<p>This kind of thing only serves to make people more pessimistic about the whole VfD process and pretty much tipped off the mess we have now with VfD getting deleted. I consider myself a deletionist, and I wish the process could be as logical and smooth as possible so that we can remove the bad articles quickly and easily. This RFC has served to improve nothing about Wikipedia, and only appears to be a mudslinging attempt to get revengence against an admin who was only doing his job. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalathion_ea64.html" title="User:Malathion">malathion</a> <a href="../../../m/a/l/User_talk%7EMalathion_119a.html" title="User talk:Malathion"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></a> 01:26, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

Ok, I'm just going to be straight, rather than careful and precise.<br />
There are two possibilities here: either you're a nice guy or you're not. Being a nice guy in no way precludes you from disagreeing with me, or even agreeing with me while thinking I'm a jerk. Since I'll never actually know, I have to use <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">faith</a> and treat you like a <i>misguided</i> nice guy.<br />

<p>Intentionally or not, this is condescending. Both <i>upset</i> and <i>distress</i> mean "mentally perturbed". But not using the word <i>anger</i> or an analog, you deny even the possibility that the other person has a <b>reason</b> to be angry. Being "dumbfounded" at their "distress" compounds this further.<br />

Whatever your intentions, you don't <i>sound</i> like a nice guy here. You sound like seomone who made a claim, didn't like it being challenged, and made subtle and artful attacks rather than backing up your claims. And it made me angry, no question.<br />
<br />
It would be dishonest of me to say that this exchange had nothing to do with the RfC. I <i>believe</i> I would have done the same thing had it not occured, but I don't <i>know</i>. There are a lot of strong feelings being expressed, and I'm listening to what people have to say. Your comments to date do not give the appearance that you're doing the same. I would only ask that you try and learn something from all of this, just as I will.<br />

Aaron, let me just say that your comments frequently cause me utter and complete bafflement. Interacting with you on the movie VfD was almost painful because however politely I tried to make my statements you reacted as if to some slight. My "comment" is met with an "irritated comment", which comprises all kinds of quite bizarre accusations and bear an edit summary "Reply to Straw man.". I politely rebut the accusations, inasmuch as I can understand them, apologising for upsetting you, and you launch into a tirade accusing me of using loaded language, describing my actions as "pernicious". Aaron, please think it possible that if I say I find your statements baffling, eyebrow-raising, and inappropriate, it may be because you seem to be disposed to take expressions of disagreement as personal slights. The least I can do in the circumstances is to endeavor to avoid upsetting you further by having any more to do with you.--<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 06:42, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Tony - did you even <i>read</i> anything I wrote? You're reply is exactly what I'm trying to illustrate to you. Please, <i><b>please</b></i>, try and see someone else's point without being "baffled". If you are actually incapable of doing so, have someone else look over that exchange. Pick someone with whom you disagree but respect, and ask them if it's really so incredible that I would feel that you were not being straightforward. There is no question I can sometimes be a pig: curt, sharp, and prone to excitability. The only question is will you take <b>any</b> responsibility, or simply contine to be baffled.<br />

<dd>Aaron, please try to understand that I long ago lost patience with your antics.

<dd>Ok, it's clear now that the problem isn't me. How could I have been nicer above? How is that a "tantrum"? Do you not notice that you've totally ignored everything I've said? I suspect that we'll have to work together here for a long time, and that we'll be treading a lot of the same ground. You really do have a choice, to continue <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikihate_20c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikihate">as is</a>, or try to make things better.

<p>Radman - your vote <i>"Keep, non-notability not established. Furthermore, nominator's assumptions are based in original research."</i> seems on the face of it to be done in spite. Ok, I've made you angry, ok, you think the RfC is stupid. I understand that, fair enough if you feel that way. But this isn't any kind of "campaign" or "quest for vengance" or anything like that. If you actually think that this little flash movie should stay in, that's great, vote your heart out. But don't just do it because you want to stick it up me, mate.<br />

It was a simple listing alerting other Australians to a VfD concerning a local topic. It's often good to get locals voting on topics they have an intimate knowledge of. Besides, wikis are open in nature, no comments are ever discreet unless you choose to directly email them (which I'd have treated as confidential). Onto your style, I see no overall problem, though I've only given he VfD a quick glance for now. Tony Sidaway is a passionate editor, and presents strong arguments towards his cause.

<p>I have asked inter for help before in the past, he is just an admin I trust to be unbias and fair. I do know it isnt being mediated yet, but mediation seems to be the best way we can work out a compromise until we can learn to play nice with each other. The picture is copyright by the guy who is pictured and we have his permission to use it. We haven't talked about the picture outside of email and you can see in the Infantilism and ABDL talk and Daves talk and my talk, that Dave was against there being only a female pictured. I tried to point out the rarity of male AB picts that are vanilla and allowed on Wiki, then to overcome copyright restrictions, compared to the wide availability of females in AB and the wide selection of public domain pictures to choose from. Finally, I said to him, if he demands it, he shouldnt force it on me but instead find one on his own. Tod, the person in the picture, gave him the two pictures while fully aware what it would be used for. He keeps the copyright though because he doesnt want his picture ending up on every AB site out there, we ABs love our privacy, but he has given us the ability to use it on wiki. You should email the person to ask directly. --<a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbitOne_44d2.html" title="User:OrbitOne">OrbitOne</a> 08:10, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

Tony, oh captain of good faith, you've just accused me of making "yet another false, baseless and personal allegation" for saying "Answering it is better than deleting it, then it doen't look like you're trying to hide anything". And, if you'll check the timing:</p>
<ul>
<li>13:39, 7 August 2005 I replace RF's comment</li>
<li>13:40, 7 August 2005 You make a note on the talk page.</li>
</ul>
<p>How about this: get someone else to tell me I've been nasty. Not that I've been <i>wrong</i>, because that's something else entirely. Find someone <i>other than yourself</i> who will look over my contributions and find personal attacks or somesuch. And get them to tell me so nicely, with specifics. If I am as you characterize me, that shouldn't be hard.<br />

<p>I don't understand what you're asking me to evaluate, or what you're asking me to do. I simply think schools are important enough to include all of them in Wikipedia, both for their own merit, and for providing a good entry point for new Wikipedians. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused">focused</a> 07:50, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think I understand what you're getting at, and I would certainly state that <i>regardless of the school inclusionist goals, the means they are using are undesirable</i>. For instance, the VFDs on schools are significantly longer and less civil than average. The pages devoted to garnering VFD votes and providing one-sided statistics see more edits than the WikiProject schools. The issue has been known to influence RFA voting and inspire RFCs, and there are related instances of sockpuppetry (many of which alleged, but some proven) and even accusations of counterconsensual use of admin tools. Many of the people involved are incivil, several are downright hostile, and most are unwilling to discuss such things as organization, standardising or systemic bias. Overall, the signal-to-noise ratio is low. I realize I'm not providing evidence here, but that's because I have better things to do with my time than seeking it (and frankly, I don't see what the big deal is with schools and why everybody gets so worked-up about it). Supposing you had evidence, what would you do with it? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 12:03, August 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please understand that I am trying to be as straight-forward as possible here. Comments such as <i>"I won't request that your profile be deleted for violating official policy,"</i> tend to demonstrate that you <i>don't</i> understand policy. More to the point, as I've mentioned before, you appear to not understand some of the basics of Wikipedia.<br /></li>
<li>That's not an insult, and I'm sorry because I know that it sounds like one. It takes a long time to understand the interactions, unwritten rules, complex mix of rules, guidlines, precendents, and dictatorship that make Wikipedia work. And once you think that you understand everything, some one points out <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> and does what they want anyway! Two thirds of the time I have no idea what is going on.<br /></li>
<li>By looking at your edit history, I cannot help but notice that you've confined yourself to contributing to a narrow set of topics. Perhaps if you tried editing some other articles, get involved in some collaboration, a bit of back-and-forth over POV, and produce a shiny finished product, you'll get a better feel for things.<br /></li>
<li>Because I can't imagine you're having any fun right now. I imagine instead that you're angry and frustrated and this is a <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_thing.html" title="Bad thing">bad thing</a>.<br /></li>
<li>But if you continue like this things aren't going to get any better for you. Really. I'm going to keep trying to produce a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">great online encyclopedia that anyone can edit</a>, I'm going to continue to make <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">crazy edits</a>, I'm going to keep working for <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">balance</a>. I'm going to keep being <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">patient</a>, I'm going to continue to avoid <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">insults</a>. I am going to keep <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">believing</a>.</li>
<li>If you think I'm out of line, maybe I am. I'd be mad to deny even the <i>possibilty</i> that I'm doing the wrong thing. I've included some links, the next step would probably be <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequest_for_comment_fd68.html#General_user_conduct" title="Wikipedia:Request for comment">Request for comment (RfC)</a>, as we don't seem to be able to communicate. I was recently chewed up and spat out in an RfC I raised, but it <i>is</i> the next step if you feel I'm "after" you. I'd imagine <a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbitOne_44d2.html" title="User:OrbitOne">OrbitOne</a> would provide the second signature for you.</li>
<li>Oh, it appears I was mistaken about the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Adult_Baby_af0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Adult Baby">VfD</a>. The consensus appears to be a merge into <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantilism.html" title="Infantilism">Infantilism</a>. Which means I'll probably end up heavily involved in the content of that article, too!<br /></li>

<p>Well, you're right, I am new, and I don't fully understand all the vagaries of Wikipedia. But I have seen the rules for deletion, and understand them. I understand that you're violating them. I have seen requests for User Profiles to be deleted. I ahve seen references to User profiles that have been deleted. I have seen the reasons why. I have seen the majority of them have been deleted for vandalism. I understand that quite well. I also understand what vandalism is. And, I understand that it is what you are doing. Do you understand what you are doing? And do you understand what the consequences are? When the time comes, there won't be any more opportunities for you to reverse course. Before you bite off more than you can chew, make sure you think about what you are doing. Because as verbose as you may be, the moderator who deletes your profile will not be giving you a long speech about it when it happens. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavy_Blue_c6f5.html" title="User:Davy Blue">Dave</a> 20:40, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dave,<br />
I think that you may have been confused as to whom the author of the comment you were responding to actually was. While this is understandable, and in fact the reason I'm always clucking on about signatures, your response was not appropiate. I've placed some comments beneath yours, and I really suggest that you ask some one else for their advice. Find an <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_Requests_for_Assistance_1619.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA Requests for Assistance">advocate</a> and drop a note on the page, please. Because "Why don't we just delete you" is a <i>threat</i>, and I will not tolerate another.<br />

<p>Aaron:</p>
<p>Thanks for your personal message to me concerning the conflict in the article "Infantilism". I take no offense to your position. Two things, though...</p>
<p>First, I have NO IDEA how to use the personal messaging system by which you contacted me. Can you explain? (I have no idea whether you will get THIS message - lol)</p>
<p>Second, while I appreciate your advice, there is just simply NO WAY I could summarize the objections I have to the attacking text without going into a full explanation. This is what I said in the beginning, and I tried several "lesser" explanations but this guy named "Orbit" is one of the most unreasonable people I've ever dealt with. No amount of explanation is sufficient for him.</p>

<p>The main reason for me choosing christianity as a focus point is because I have no idea what other religions would say. I do not have access to a rabbi to ask about judaism or a hindu monk to ask about hinduism. If the christianity section should go though, I would like to keep the OI section since they are the only group that tries to treat or remove infantilism as a practice or desire, not because of religion. --<a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbitOne_44d2.html" title="User:OrbitOne">OrbitOne</a> 07:51, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Just leave them alone, man. This isn't the right place for it. If you resort to flaming people, you'll discredit yourself the way Aaron does everytime he opens his mouth. Treat matters with civility, and if someone like Dean comes along and says, "hey, I'm leaving you alone, why don't you leave me alone, too?" than do them that favour. Dean didn't come here and start slamming us. He hasn't been sending offensive messages to anyone or threateneing to delete anything. He's not rabidly foaming at the keyboard about how this page can't be allowed to exist, or how he doesn't like the picture, or anything. He's just saying, "Leave us in peace." Let's do just that.</p>
<p>Now, does anyone here support my opinion that Aaron should be banned from Wiki? I want to get a consensus before I make the formal declaration. Should we forgive him, or flush him? And if we forgive him, should we make sure he understand that he's not to persist in this harrassment/vandalism that clearly violates Wikimedia policy, or should we trust that he gets the hint that people aren't going to put up with that crap anymore? Do something on generic religion, Orbit. You do have access to that. JUst not this one particular kind of religion to the exlusion of all others. Use general terms, not specific ones.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavy_Blue_c6f5.html" title="User:Davy Blue">Dave</a> 12:15, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>To correct you on one point, Dean has slammed me repeatedly over email, but I havent flamed his group. I feel that their role in removing infantilism as a desire or practice does justify the inclusion of the group in the article. --<a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbitOne_44d2.html" title="User:OrbitOne">OrbitOne</a> 16:14, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><small>This comment was moved from following an <i>unrelated</i> discussion regarding Islamaphobia.</small><br />
I will take this as a hint that people read my possition and comments and religious bias. Okay, where do I start? Oh yeah. I 1) do not want to put my head in my ass by making wild claims about religions that I do not know enough about to state what their possition is on Infantilism and 2) I am reporting the veiws of the christian church when it comes to Infantilism. 3) The Islam article backs up my claims, Islam is born from Christianity and believes in the bible as well as the Koran, -but- seperated when it comes to the subject of Jesus being the son of god, Islam taking the veiw that Jesus was a prophet. 4) As I am reporting the church veiw, I myself am not writing anything that is POV, rather, I am writing NPOV about a statement made by churches which is POV. Sorry for making it so long, but being called a racist rubs me the wrong way, thanks. --<a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbitOne_44d2.html" title="User:OrbitOne">OrbitOne</a> 16:21, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Orbit, how many times do I have to repeat the phrase generic religion? Do you just not get the concept? It doesn't mean talking about religions you know nothing about. It means using neutral terms that don't specify one particular faith. Instead of Christ, use God. Instead of Christianity, use the word Religion. Instead of Sin, use the word Error. Discuss ideas that are common to all faiths. Like understanding, compassion, etc. Why? Because there's more people out there than just christians, that's why. And they're all valid, too, no matter what the majority composition of the US is. Don't be an aaron, for God's sake. You're more enlightened that that. And where does racism factor into any of this? And why do you hate Dean so much? Leave the poor man alone.<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavy_Blue_c6f5.html" title="User:Davy Blue">Dave</a> 22:40, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

Then the section about Infantilism and religion shouldnt be up. If I talk about generic religion and Infantilism, I with great success have gotten my head into my ass. --OrbitOne (Streaking)</p>
<p>Ummm - can you guys take it to your <i>own</i> talk pages, or the article talk page? Oh, and Orbit (Streaking?

<p>While it would be very nice to deal with anti-social behavior, I don't think that large-scale problems in that area can be solved by the Wikimunity, since it would defy the core principle of allowing anyone to edit. That said, feel free to put some evidence together and put it to RFC; just don't expect any concrete response, as behavioral RFCs usually don't get much. On a related issue, I am going to put <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_Personal_attacks_ec18.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy/Personal attacks">Wikipedia:Blocking policy/Personal attacks</a> up for an official proposal soon, which may help.</p>
<p>Oh yes - recommended reading material is the RFC section of RFAr (not sure what the link was, but the RFAr requested comment on their proceedings). One of the suggested options was a 'content committee' that potentially would be able to deal with such issues.</p>
<p>I'd also like to say that while the school inclusionists' methods are wrong, their goals are not - people who wish to spread their POV about religion or racism, however, are wrong on both counts, which is far worse. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 13:47, August 11, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not angry or annoyed with you about putting up for deletion, a little dissapointed but nothing personal.

<dl>
<dd>Radiant is quite wrong to state that I'm creating a quorum policy--articles relisted are still VfDs and the purpose of doing so it to attract attention to them so that they will be discussed and the discussion can then be closed with more confidence. I have been doing this for a week or two, and I see to recall that you praised me, Aaron, for doing so. Radiant's claim that I do so only when I disagree with the outcome is incorrect--the Anguilar VfD was evidently treated as a bad faith nomination and completely ignored for several days.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I do sometimes close VfDs as keep and then on the basis of being bold I perform a merge or redirect or whatever I think needs to be done, even if I don't see a consensus to do so. What of it? A closer is also an editor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And of course a 3 del / 3 redir discussion, we established on the RfC, must always be closed as a default keep. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 13:03, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That was not established. It was Tony's opinion which was heavily disputed by just about anyone else.

<p>The "history" is that the words do not have identical meanings, they are both commonly used, neither is incorrect in context, and one should not unilaterally decide to expurgate a particular word from Wikipedia because one feels it is "ugly" (this is the reason the expurgator has given on his Talk: page). "Obligate" typically has more of a legal flavour (to compel one to do something), whereas "oblige" typically has more of a social flavour (to do something as a favor). As well, their usages differ slightly in American and U.K. English.

<p>Put up or shut up? Excuse me? It is possible that things <i>are</i> being "put up" that are not yet ready. Tony doesn't get to decide when the community is no longer tired of his abusive actions. He can be weary of my saying that he listens to no one else, but he could end that very easily by starting to listen to VfU, by voluntarily taking a break from being "Mr. VfD," or by trying to establish consensus for his solitary view that VfD only has delete or keep outcomes. That would be an <i>excellent</i> way to get me to stop complaining. After all, I wasn't complaining before he started doing all this (and insulting everyone who disagreed with him), and now I am.

<p>Aaron, Splash and I have been tuning up the proposed text change; we think it's more or less ready. Do you have further suggestions? Also, how should this proceed?

<p>I just noticed two edits of yours, reverts on this article:</p>
<ol>
<li>01:49, 9 September 2005 (hist) (diff) Essential tremor (Removed material added re-added (twice now) without use of talk page. Please use talk page before re-adding this material. Also please use preview.)</li>
<li>01:32, 9 September 2005 (hist) (diff) Essential tremor (Please note that reverts without an edit summary or use of a talk page are fair game for removal. If there is a reason this section should go in, please use talk page.)</li>
</ol>
<p>This seems a little OTT to me. Couldn't you just have edited the section to remove the superfluous external links? Insisting that the fellow go to a talk page about adding a section on support groups for a neurological condition to an article about that condition that already contains links to those same groups' websites seems, well, somewhat unnecessary. If they're worth linking to they're worth writing about. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:45, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I did edit the section to remove the extra links. Then there was nothing left, so I removed the section. When an editor repeatedly adds material back without edit summary than another use is removing, asking for use of the talk page is reasonable.<br />

<p>I don't think you were very reasonable there. It is simply false to say that there was no informational content other than superfluous links. Since you did revert twice, I'd have prefered to see you actually use the talk page yourself to explain why you kept doing it. I still don't really know why you did it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 03:28, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

Thank you for your suprising interest in this issue. You'll note that the section was:</p>

</dl>
<p>I've bolded the section that was neither repeated nor NPOV. If you believe that this information warrented inclusion in the article in a little subsection all it's own, you are of course welcome to argue that. As to the rest, my edit summaries were quite clear, as seen above. I would do exactly the same with any persistant adding of external links without edit summary or use of talk page.<br />

<p>It's not so much the fact that the information you repeatedly removed warranted inclusion where it was NPOV (it obviously did, and you were obviously easily able to identify it) it was your bullying approach and your utterly false claim that someone must use a talk page prior to adding information to an article. That kind of behavior isn't only contrary to policy, it can be extremely damaging in an environment where we must do everything we can to cultivate, not alienate, new editors. If you do it again I'll come back and remind you of this. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 04:27, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aaron. I see that there was a small exchange about the use of a bicycle image. I was the VFD closer who added the picture when closing a school deletion debate, <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Charlotte_High_School_5be9.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Charlotte High School">this one</a> in fact. I added that picture as a little joke, and nothing else than that (except perhaps venting some frustration of going through the three step process of closing, removing the VFD tag and adding a link to the talkpage when the server is slow).</p>
<p>I will usually not vote in deletion debates over schools, and the times I do so are either to vote "merge" on a stub which could easily be merged, or "keep" on a school which I think is particularily notable. Alright, I am guilty of creating an article about the high school I attended (<a href="../../../b/e/r/Bergen_Katedralskole_6f3f.html" title="Bergen Katedralskole">Bergen Katedralskole</a>), but I think that one is notable.

<p><a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Eric_Littmann_5237.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Eric Littmann">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Eric Littmann</a> quote: "The result of the debate was NO CONSENSUS, which defaults to KEEP"</p>
<p>That seems pretty clear to me.</p>
<p>Actually, if you look at <a href="../../../b/i/g/Talk%7EBig_Brother_%28USA_TV_series%29_0621.html#Merge" title="Talk:Big Brother (USA TV series)">Talk:Big Brother (USA TV series)#Merge</a> you'll find no support for requests to merge/re-direct individual contestant articles. Before doing a re-direct, you should discuss on the talk page and see if there's support. It's ok to go ahead with re-directs on your own, *if* you expect nobody to contest it, but not in this case. The main article is already huge, and discussion of merging/re-directing into it, should be discussed in one central spot. Given, the re-direct was done unilaterally, I'm well within my rights to remove it, on my own. If there's no proven consensus for the re-directs, I will continue to do so. However, if you garner a consensus to support the re-directs, I will respect that.</p>
<p>What you fail to understand, is that mergers are a two-sided affair. There's a source *and* a target. Editors on the target must be involved. Otherwise, you're doing a page blanking.</p>
<p>--<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 06:46, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, I guesse what I'm have the most trouble understanding, is why does the larger issue of what to do with individual conetstants get discussed over-and-over, and every place *but* <a href="../../../b/i/g/Talk%7EBig_Brother_%28USA_TV_series%29_0621.html#Merge" title="Talk:Big Brother (USA TV series)">Talk:Big Brother (USA TV series)#Merge</a>, which is the one place it should be discussed. You can't split the issue up, on a per-article basis. Rather, I'm simply asking for a *central* discussion, and basis for agreement. The word "knee-jerk" is not what *I* did. If you explain your full logic on the relevant talk page, *before* acting, you'll find you're less likely to be reverted. If certain articles were special cases, and you explained that *first*, I might have left them. Even, if you have a good reason to make such a major change, if you fail to explain it, a revert is quite likely. You made several major changes, with no attempt whatsoever, to discuss it, in a central spot. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 07:07, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi again. Actually, a couple re-directs probably had a good case, which I'm quite open to. I suggest this: go over to the <a href="../../../b/i/g/Talk%7EBig_Brother_%28USA_TV_series%29_0621.html#Merge" title="Talk:Big Brother (USA TV series)">Talk:Big Brother (USA TV series)#Merge</a> list the proposed re-directs from strongest to weekest cases for the re-direct, with specific reasons. If you do that, I'll agree that at *least* one re-direct is warranted (like <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Littmann_421a.html" title="Eric Littmann">Eric Littmann</a>. I'm not a fan of smaller stubs. I think the contestants warrant *good* articles, but not *any* article. So, I'll take your suggestion, and offer <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_Littmann_421a.html" title="Eric Littmann">Eric Littmann</a> as my sacrifice to compromise. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 07:50, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The last thing I want is to drive anyone away from Wikipedia...so I strongly encourage you to stay...I was on RC patrol and came across the edits you made and reacted primarily to the term "they even call each other that" when you used the "N" word to make a point. I doubt that, as Sidaway has pointed out, you did this in malice. I also qualified my last comment by essentially stating that I also get worked up and write things I don't always mean. With that in mind, don't for a minute run away from this. You do a lot of work that many here, myself included, find tedious but it needs to be done. In that, your purpose here is probably more of a contribution than mine as I usually try to write and or expand articles about 75% of the time. Now as far as spam mail, I don't do that sort of thing, I don't have a sock puppet account but I do log in from two different locations so if a developer checked my IP s/he would find this to be true. I confess to coming across as hostile or forceful at times, and that is a fault I have to admit...perhaps it is a spinoff of my occupation. Take a break, cool off and I will do the same. Ignore those that seem hell bent on working against you...I mean, look at this garbage that has been on this person's userpage for months:<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrodo_df69.html" title="User:Brodo">User:Brodo</a> in which s/he calls me his "neofascist sockpuppet".

<p>Thinking about it, I am glad that you have reconsidered, even though the other day I was so offended that I could only think "don't let the door hit your ass on the way out." I don't wish to re-ignite this type of acrimony again - and I am sorry that I purposely called you a deletionist as a way to annoy at the end of the exchange. My use of the term to refer to "those that vote to delete" (either to a specific AfD or in a more general way) is neither intended as dismissive, nor as an insult; it is certainly more convenient than type out "those who vote to delete this article" or "those who frequently vote to delete" each and every time I wish to use that expression. In any case, I am sorry if someone intentionally harassed you via email, but I assure you it wasn't me - I do not even have your email address, and whoever might have done so is extremely childish. Hopefully, we can get along and put this episode behind us. (P.S. I retract my earlier comments about discussion on user pages or elsewhere).--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 08:27, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm still recovering from looking at the diff on my watchlist about half an hour ago. I do not think that instituting the proposal was too bold in itself; it has a clear consensus, verging on unanimity, on the talk page. It has been advertised widely and has not been rushed. However, there needs to be some consequential changes: specifically to the naming: Deletion Review now appears on VfU whilst the title is unchanged.</p>
<p>Also, I'm still a little unclear at how we're going to work it. There were a couple of suggestions of 'mechanics', although nobody commented on them specifically, save for Tony Sidaway's suggestion of loading in favour of keeping/undeleting. I personally don't like the current suggestion by DES because it's too long, but I can see that it might work quite well. However, my original intent (not that this matters, but anyway) was to retain the majoritarian system since it makes undeletion easier than than a consensus; I hadn't forseen that it was seen as too hard by some. I wanted to change as little as possible to make change as easy as possible. One thing at a time, you know? Finally, there were some concerns over taking speedies out-of-scope; I'm more or less persuaded others are not: they now appear as in-scope on VfU.</p>
<p>So I don't think you were too bold, but I do think we need to iron those things out, and quickly. Perhaps we should snip the mechanics suggestions into a proper section of the talk page, VP/RfC it, drop notes on the participating editor's talk pages and try to seek their opinions on that aspect specifically. I extracted 3 proposals from the discussion — see <a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_Deletion_Review_1bb2.html" title="User:Splash/Deletion Review">User:Splash/Deletion Review</a>, but DES said he didn't like any of them. He preferred a retention of the majority system (as do I, for simplicity) based on <i>process-not-content</i> but offered a non-majority system as you can see on both my talk: and VfU talk:. How do you think we should collect those things up and try to sort them out? -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:59, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Was that you who archived? My apologies if it was: I assumed it had been done by my best Wikipedia friend trying to hide something.&#160;;-) By all means, rearchive if you want to.</p>
<p>I agree that it would be good if there was something completely separate from arbitration, but the fact remains that the arbcom asks people to try other means of dispute resolution first, and RfC is often the one they choose, all the more so given that the mediation committee appears not to be functioning. Also, I don't think it's only the RfC's perceived association with the arbcom (as a first step) that's the problem. I think it's also the format. It's a pretty nasty thing to do to someone, let's face it: put a series of complaints against them and ask others to comment. I see it as exactly like putting someone in the stocks and throwing rotten tomatoes at them. So I don't see how anything with that format could be improved.</p>
<p>Just thinking out loud. We currently have article RfCs, and user-conduct RfCs. How about a third type: an issue RfC? Let's say for example that I annoy you by reverting something you've written once a day for three months. You can't have me blocked because there's no 3RR violation. You can't take me to mediation because the waiting list is very long. You can't go straight to arbitration, and a user-conduct RfC is very messy. However, you could post an issue RfC, asking for comment (perhaps mentioning no names, or perhaps giving diffs from the dispute: we'd have to think that through) about the substantive issue that the dispute boils down to i.e. the issue of slow reverts.</p>
<p>That has two advantages: first, it avoids the personal stuff, but secondly, it forces the person bringing the RfC to focus on exactly what the issue is, aside from personal ill-feeling, and they might actually find that when they do that, there isn't as much of an issue as they thought. Would something like this work? <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 06:07, 20 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I've replied point by point on my talk page. Generally i do think your changes were not for the bettre, and i've give my reasons. But I am not at all unhappy with you proposign or defending them. i on't own this idea or even my proposed text.</p>
<p>My vital points are:</p>
<ol>
<li>DR should treat keeps and deletes as nearly identical as possible.</li>
<li>If a majority thinks process was violated, some action must result.</li>
<li>DR should be as final as possible.</li>
<li>The DR mehanics should be as explicit as possible, leaving little to implication.</li>
<li>"process not content" must be enshrited as a DR principle, in general.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your text can be alted to include those points, I would support it. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:26, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aaron, there's been a lot of discussion over at VfU Talk over the new proposal, and in the thick of comments by DES, yourself, Splash and others I've lost my way as to which version all of you seem to have settled down to. Would you be so kind as to help me with that—perhaps just drop a box with the proposal on my page or point me to a spot where it's stated in full and clearly?

<p>Thank you, Aaron. It's a very good start. I'm troubled by 4 (strongly enough that I would oppose a version containing it), and 3 is well-intentioned but in my very humble opinion misconceived—it will lead to havoc if passed. But the rest is promising.

<p>I hope this is the correct place to respond&#160;:) [in response to the timeshare page edit]</p>
<p>I did read/skim the "welcome page", but did not really see anything about adding links... well, the "policy" about adding a link to a page on wikipedia.</p>
<p>However, I do understand your point and the whole purpose of wikipedia...</p>
<p>anyway, my question is:</p>
<p>If I can add value to a page and offer a "summary" of the view... then give a link more for details....</p>
<p>is that allowed?</p>
<p>Given that I did read the Objections and clarifications of the NPOV (interesting no less)</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>ADDED -- I read this part, it appears to be vague or up for interpretation</p>
<p>Advertising. Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third-party verifiable, so articles about very small "garage" companies are not likely to be acceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic</p>

<dd>Any closure where an editor thinks the admin has misread the (no-)consensus, either accidentally or wilfully. I imagine it would be hard to challenge closures which had much above 75% support either way, and easy to challenge those with less than 60% (so the answer to your direct question is 0-60%). Between that range, the likelihood of competent challenge (unlike most of today's offerings on VfU) would depend on how controversial the article was and how well expressed the closure was. It would also depend on the strength of the basis of the views of the numerical majority who are being overridden. What I mean is that, just because the evil numbers are between 60% and 75% doesn't automatically yield a basis for a DR. Would that about tally with what you'd expect? And where's Encephalon gone? -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 02:54, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>...because if I had said "should not", I'd have been giving the wrong impression. It's a little bit of enforcement on my part, and I considered a stronger phraseology. Removing those nominations <i>will</i> cause great anguish if done prior to acting on the outcome of the debate, which is going obviously to be undelete. Neutrality has indicated no desire to discuss the issue. I do not think the admin who undeleted one of them was right to do so, because we have a process and we should respect it (that particular one still has a AfD tag linking to a now-closed debate). Once the process is started there should, imo, be extenuating circumstances absent here to shortcircuit that process. Yes, I know VfU in particular is often short-circuited to an undelete, and that is usually wrong unless it's a simple correction of an obvious mistake. So if those school nominations are removed, prior to acting on the debate, I will replace them. I get to decide that because I thought of saying it first, and I'm well within admin discretion to decide that the debates will run their course, and well within reason to take action to preserve process. It has also been backed by another admin since. I figure you no longer intend to remove the debates, given Neutrality's participation, so the point is a little moot. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 23:43, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On recent past experience with Neutrality and AfD-stomping, he is disinclined to either respond to messages, or to undelete when it is obvious that either process or outcome demands it. I have little sympathy with an Arbitrator so inclined; imagine what his response would have surely to be if a problem-admin were before the ArbCom and the case included similar evidence. He could end the flogging at a stroke by pressing his 'restore' button, but chooses not to: he even votes <i>keep deleted</i> and so asserts his closures were entirely proper. There is no suggestion that anything would have been different had discussion preceded listing, although I suppose that is just retro-speculation. Discussion before VfU is always best, but it is by no means required, even though it perhaps should be. When <i>I</i> dispute a closure, I use a talk page, and would strongly encourage others to do so, as I figure would you, admin or no. But unlisting a well-within process listing on those grounds, and effectively branding it out-of-process, once it is well underway is too much — and would be setting a precedent which I do not think would be helpful. In effect, yes, I was/am pulling the admin card, though not on you specifically: my message on VfU was to discourage anyone from having the <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">bright</a> idea of following your suggestion when you yourself had not done so. In that respect, it's not at all unheard of for an admin to oversee a contentious debate, and delisting would certainly have been contentious. And yes, everything's fine, but I am being a little more assertive than usual in this particular case because I am getting tired of people (admins, usually) shortcircuiting VfU. That said, if someone speedy undeletes, I won't object especially loudly, (although I might a little bit) as long as they do the job properly. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:22, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>PS. Don't think that I decided you were misbehaving or anything. It would have been clear if I thought you were. I was careful to only say that we were straying towards a wp:point, without actually making one. It would be hard indeed to make a wp:point over encouraging discussion.

<p>Oh hell. I'm not sure what's happening, but I think it's a phenomenon I call "topic warring." Inclusionists disagree with me strongly...</p>
<p>What I think is happening is analogous to what is happening with e.g. webcomics, in which the fans of some niche phenomenon basically band together to assert that practically every webcomic automatically belongs in Wikipedia. And if you challenge this, they say "well, you obviously know nothing about webcomics so you shouldn't be expressing your opinion." Of course, IMHO Wikipedia is founded on the assumption that people can do valid research and make valid judgements outside their area of expertise.</p>
<p>So I think the same thing is happening with vidcasts. People interested in vidcasts are using Wikipedia as a promotional vehicle for vidcasts in general.</p>
<p>I'll look at it some more later. Might or might not vote. My advice is cast your vote as you think fit, ignore any flaming, shrug it off if the article is kept. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:12, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

Hi. I'll try and be as polite as possible. Except in the case of vandalsim, simply reverting someone's changes is considered poor form. Reverting to <i>your own version</i> is quite bad form. You may have views that differ from mine, the appropiate place to work them out is on the article's talk page, not via edit summary. I'll look forward to seeing you <a href="../../../b/i/b/Talk%7EBible_751f.html#External_links" title="Talk:Bible">there</a>.<br />

<dd>I'm trying not to. I told Snowspinner I'd drop it, and I plan to, if just to keep my word. I really don't think I can do anything further that would actually aid the situation. Anyway, I'm supposed to be taking a break, which I need. And you're right: it probably would have been a good idea to have that addendum first (20/20 hindsight, eh?) but I honestly doubt that Snowspinner would have responded any differently. Hey, I never told ya, but I got a kick out of your headings that you created at the beginning (community smacks nominator around a little bit, Snow walks away feling a little cocky) even though I was pretty sure someone would delete them. Guess I've mentioned it now: you've got a good sense of humor. I hope it stays that way, and fucks to anyone who says "be serious."

<p>It sounds like a very sensible idea, Aaron, like most of yours. I do agree with the general gist of it—that personal attacks should be more actively discouraged, rather than often just glazed over—but I'm no expert with how your specific proposal lines up with currently existing policies. I note that Tony and Filioct have had some constructive things to say on the talk page; they're both obviously very experienced with this sort of thing, so I daresay their discussion will be quite fruitful. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I do seem to remember that there is currently a page on WP that is somewhat similar to this; I've never had occasion to use any such device of course, and I hope I'm not pulling this out of my imagination, but perhaps a look there might provide some ideas too?

I have been quite intentionally <b>not</b> using subst on {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest_d929.html" title="Template:Test">test</a>}} and its variations, so that it is essier for a future person editing the talk page to see exactly which level of warning was given.

<p>Thanks for the acknowledgement! I've (hopefully) addressed your concerns on the AfD page. Collating the list did take a while, but it was what I felt like doing at the time, so there was no particular virtue in doing it, nor do I have an unhealthy attachment to it. If you're convinced it's actually harmful, please feel free to delete it! Personally, I certainly don't think it should be read <i>instead</i> of the discussion above it, but I feel that in the proper context, it's a useful bit of info.

<p>B. As the information quoted in the Washington Post is based on testimony of a currently imprisoned terrorist, I don't know for sure that this constitutes a fact based accord. The Capitol would have been the easiest target aside from the Pentagon to spot from the air (aside from the Washington Monument) that would have had a maximum impact akin to the Pentagon attack.</p>
<p>C. I may have, and may still revert the addition so I saw no reason to add something I had yet to fully examine and either decide to keep or argue for it's removal. Had I put the information in to begin with, I would have added the links.</p>
<p>D. The same IP has a somewhat ambiguous past editing history. My perception is that an anon with a checkered IP history editing in a contentious article such as the <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> may not be absolutely trustworthy.</p>

<p>Hello! I understand your concern. I had collected earlier those links to essays, studies and publication (books), some of already deceased authors, about specific religious topics (articles) and I think they may give, in most of the cases, more insights into the development of those same articles. Anyway, I've finished the relevant links' edition. See you!</p>
<p>Also I understand why one may not like too many "External links"; however there are subjects which an encyclopedia can not thouroughly develop (it would become a book instead of an article). Users, like myself, who want to go deeper in studying a subject - of an article for example as <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alchemy.html" title="Alchemy">Alchemy</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essenes.html" title="Essenes">Essenes</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Sea_scrolls_8d81.html" title="Dead Sea scrolls">Dead Sea scrolls</a> or <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_of_Assisi_f7c7.html" title="Francis of Assisi">Francis of Assisi</a> - use all those links to search for more knowledge, to understand, to construct conceptions, etc. According to this point of view, when someone cuts good external links or in an indiscriminate way, without knowing what those links are about, the article becomes more poor, limited. Wikipedians should perhaps be concerned to cut dead links and links to publicity but let remain the link good knowledge source: there are many valueable data in the World Wide Web, and not only here at Wikipedia (but Wikipedia only beneficiates if it keeps an open attitude toward external knowledge). Thank you!</p>

<p>I was wondering if you had a fix for my wording on Deletion Review? We can do it here, if you like or there, I don't particularly mind. As it stands, I don't think it will cause confusion, particularly with the help of Septentrionalis's addition to the 1st line.</p>
<p>I think we're almost there in terms of making the move, although the speedies question is a bit of a millstone. I think the immediate remedy to that is to accept the <i>status quo</i> and continue the debate through the move. After all, the main reason for the change is to being kept debates into scope rather than to stir up the speedy process. I'm going to put a to-do list on the talk page in a little while, but I'm happy to fiddle with the words. I don't think we should worry about them overly having said that, since they will probably need amending once first used anyway. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:20, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, thanks. I'll give it a final nudge later today. As for the rant, well, I quite agree. If people checked their egos and politics at the door, we'd all get on famously. It is a fact that this place operates without consequences for most, and the ArbCom are about to amply demonstrate their lack of spine by referring Steve to RfA. When they do so, I'll register my opposition and write a stinging inditement of the Committee to go with it. The reason we don't have revolutions (often) in real-life is that the government knows it'll get a kick in the teeth if they screw up. If admins here screw up, they just find a friend to cheer for them and it's all ok. Even when they do their research so carefully and act with so much thought as to summarily undelete copyright infringing text.

<p>Aaron, do please stop being unreasonable. You've twice falsely claimed that I should use the talk page or block you for 3RR. Since you've come nowhere near to breaking the 3RR, and I have no intention of doing so, and I have used the talk page whereas you have simply taunted me in edit summaries, it's becoming utterly surreal.

<p>Yes, I am familiar with the reasons under which the IP trace for evidence of sockpuppetry would only occur in dire circumstances. I was just curious about IgnoreAllRules as it seems he was targeting <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">User:Tony Sidaway</a> and I saw that you had reverted him several times.

<p>Not to further badger, but I was noticing that you didn't make any edits from this account from 02:15, October 18, 2005 to 02:46, October 18, 2005. User:IgnoreAllRules made 11 edits in 3 minutes between 02:41, October 18, 2005 to 02:44, October 18, 2005. All eleven edits had as edit summary; "I'm Tony! I know best!!". In light of recent issues between you and Tony and other rather strange coincidences that can be elaborated further if need be, well, I really like people that are straight forward and honest.

<li>Aaron, I don't fault the use of sock accounts, and respect that since you use your real name, one may come in handier for you than it would for me, not that you do use one. A brief spree of obvious vandalism, I could forgive that...no big deal...I know you and Tony are at odds and if indeed you performed these vandalisms, well, they weren't that bad overall, and at least you and others quickly reverted them. Now in regards to someone tracking your IP...I don't have that capability but noticed the vandalism while on RC Patrol..the username IgnoreAllRules (redlined) struck me as a potential vandal, but I was overedited by another with a faster trigger doing the revert. I often rely on <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">Occam's Razor</a> due to nature of my real life job...the easiest explanation is usually the right one. Now as far as a breach of admin ethics regarding an unauthorized IP query...I am not familiar with that set of rules but not sure they matter as proof any more than my little time flow above described...I mean, even if the IP was the same, you could always say that your little brother was messing around while you were away for a few minutes. I know you have morte integrity than to want to hide, so, as you've requested, I'll butt out. Respectfully, I do not want to hound anyone.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 05:24, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Aaron, you just deleted all but one of the links to the sari article -- including several that were referenced IN the article, several that consisted only of instructions on HOW to wrap a sari, and several that went to commercial sites, yes, but to the "all about saris" sections of commercial sites.</p>

<p>Aaron. I saw your note earlier in the day and am responding properly now. From what happened, and from what I see on Splash's page, I think you're currently under what has been called "wikistress". Wikipedia can be very callous, unfriendly, unfair, and sharp. The main reason it is so is because it is populated by humans.&#160;:)</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be though—or if it is, it doesn't have to affect you much. Don't let it. Realize this for what it is: an impressively imperfect project aimed at creating an impossible thing. It is, or can be seen as, noble, and I believe some day many years from now its descendent will be. <i>We</i> are the ephemeral, transitory, invisible, anonymous workers helping it toward that goal. When it is achieved we'll be long gone. It is altruism that keeps us here, now, while it is massively, almost unimaginably, imperfect. A little more imperfection, a few more silly edits, a bit of reverting here and warring there, someone being impossible—don't let it trouble you. If someone insists on a view that you believe is incorrect, by all means engage him and tell him why you think it should be done another way. Don't forget the other part of the bargain: listen to what he says. Try for a solution. If it is impossible, try to do the right thing (this can be hard). But whatever you do, if you find it includes feeling that it might be a good idea to vandalize a couple of pages, even if temporarily, even for a short while, it's likely best to take a break.</p>
<p>With the current disagreement, I believe most editors who have an interest in deletion policy on WP will agree with the version you're trying to keep on WP:DRV. That can be seen very simply—that version is theirs. Tony feels that it is invalid, for two reasons. The first is he believes "if in doubt don't delete" is a kind of "chief precept" of deletion policy that should be prominently placed in DR. The second is he believes DR should not be restricted to questions of what has come to be termed "process". This second issue is actually more complicated than it appears. I think we're all actually closer to agreement than most think we are, but it will need to be discussed with some care in the coming weeks/months.</p>
<p>The first issue is less complicated. One thing I'd like to say in Tony's defense is that he keeps being told that his addition of IIDDD to the template is inadvisable, but I don't recall anyone actually explaining (or attempting to explain) why (I may be wrong though. Has anyone?). It is true that the current version has wide acceptance among the editors who're actually involved with the running and working of DR. However, if someone says that something's not right with it because it conflicts with policy, that needs to be examined, whether or not most of us agree on the current version. I can post my view on this, later. Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong, but perhaps with a discussion on the actual merits of IIDDD, we might find ourselves—all of us, Tony, Kappa, Splash, Rossami, an everyone else—coming to an agreeable solution.</p>
<p>You are an excellent editor, Aaron. Too valuable to loose. Please be happy and well. I'm going to be away for a while myself, so I will not be able to contribute to any ensuing discussion, but I'm sure everyone concerned will be able to decide something satisfactory.

<p>(Was just about to go to bed, forgive any thinkos and/or rambling) I don't know when I first encountered Tony, but it was months ago, and I think even before you did, just in the normal course of editing, and his talk page has been on my watchlist since. I've always respected his judgment, dedication, and helpfulness. Even after he restored one of my first, zealous, speedies. (As an aside, I don't know how it is possible for anyone to get on Radiant's bad side or vice versa, but it happened. Haven't talked much recently, but Radiant and I used to see each other a lot, indeed he nominated me for my adminship. He is one of the most open and reasonable people I know on WP.) I'm pretty sure I remember way back in the primordial depths of time when this <i>thing</i> between you and Tony started. It was about some VFD debate, likely a school, right? Then you encountered each other on VFD again and again, it spread to talk pages, and spread more. I'm not even sure when we met, Aaron, (though I just realized that silly note at the top of this page is from July), but I've had enough rational discussions with you, and seen you around as well, that I long ago came to the conclusion that I could trust and respect your judgment, dedication, and helpfulness. I think you (plural) are level-headed and reasonable, and I would point a needy editor to either of you. You (plural) can also be abrasive, stubborn, and, yes, coy. That happens, somehow, mostly only when you encounter each other, or the issues that spark this. My point is: <i>why?</i></p>
<p>I must admit (don't know if I should be guilty about it, but I'm guilty about not knowing&#160;:) that your admission hasn't really changed my opinion of you (good judgment, dedicated, stubborn, etc.) in that I still have cmplete confidence that I would trust a decision by you, and that you still have that inborn WP hatred of all vandals. Not to compare them, but neither of Tony's RFC have changed my confidence in him either. I think, independent of each other and the general tussle, you are best. What have you gained from it, besides much undue stress and insanity? I'm sure it's been suggested before, but now would be the time to <i>just drop it</i>. It isn't anything that I think mediation, or another RFC, or even (Jimbo forbid) and RFAr could help. This doesn't mean you give in, or thatI think you two can become best wikifriends overnight. But how about if you refused to engage each other? Period (well, it was a question mark). I'm convinced that by now your banter does nothing but inflame each other. Watching this slowly spiral away has been painful for many I'm sure. I've seen both of you lose control in different ways and to different degrees. But if we all are to accept your apology as sincere (I certainly do) the least you could do is start over and give it a shot. Disputes between good-faith, trustworthy editors are worse that trolls and vandals: they divide the community, and create factions where none need to be. Don't ever forget how much good you can still do for this wonderful encyclopedia, but also try to think up how much more you could have done in that time you wasted thinking about Tony. Again, my point is: <i>why?</i> Not just why have this dispute, but why are we all here (including Tony)? Let that guide you.</p>

<p>Haha. You're right. I guess I wouldn't blame someone if they changed my name to 'fresh eats figs'.

The problem for Firefox is probably the style=background tag but I simplified it as much as I can so maybe it will work for you (guys) now. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshgavin_9ad7.html" title="User:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="white" style="background:blue">&#160;freshgavin&#160;</font></a><a href="../../../f/r/e/User_talk%7EFreshgavin_46e9.html" title="User talk:Freshgavin"><font size="-2" color="white" style="background:blue">TALK&#160;&#160;</font></a> 07:06, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeah, I'd do it in a heartbeat. I'm not terribly worried about losing my adminship, because I stand firmly behind almost all of my actions, and despite Tony's doubts, I don't doubt my motivations. Anyway, even if I did lose my admin priveleges, I could still edit, and I could get out of all the messy politics associated with the position. Besides, if I didn't get re-adminned, then I probably wasn't doing a terribly good job in the first place, and I could probably learn a lot from the experience.

<p>No, they just convinced me that the article merits inclusion. However, that said, I'd <i>really</i> like for some broader discussion about what is an acceptable source for comics. <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a> is quite inadequate right now. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">xd</font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 02:49, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Basically the transwiki process has become this kind of endless cycle that never gets completed. I wrote the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETranswiki_log_fe21.html#Instructions" title="Wikipedia:Transwiki log">instructions</a> there, and hope they make some sense. An article is transwikied because, presumably, it doesn't belong here. The TL, as a record of transwikied articles, is a list of articles that need cleanup in some way. Just take any article and deal with it appropriately (merge, send to AFD) and strike it out when you are done (or upon resolution of AFD) or if it is encyclopedic enough now (some are old enough to have changed substantially). Any stricken entry can be archived whenever. If we take <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corn_soup.html" title="Corn soup">corn soup</a>, I'd say find somewhere to redirect it or just take it to AFD as it was transwikied to Wikibooks Cookbook <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Corn_soup" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Cookbook:Corn_soup">wikibooks:Cookbook:Corn_soup</a> 2 months ago with out any changes since, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a how-to (recipe). Finally any resolved Wiktionary entries should have {{<a href="../../../t/r/a/Template%7ETranswikied_to_Wiktionary_a460.html" title="Template:Transwikied to Wiktionary">transwikied to Wiktionary</a>}} replaced with {{<a href="../../../t/r/a/Template%7ETranswiki_to_Wiktionary_Finished_cab7.html" title="Template:Transwiki to Wiktionary Finished">Transwiki to Wiktionary Finished</a>}}. (Very few of the archived ones do, but going back and fixing that is probably lower priority atm.) That's it in a nutshell, did it make sense?
