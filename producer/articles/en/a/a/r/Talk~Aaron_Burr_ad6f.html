<p>The article says that Burr was a supporter of George Clinton, yet it also says that Clinton opposed his bid for New York Governor. The article does not say why. So what was going on here.--<a href="../../../1/2/9/User%7E129.94.6.30.html" title="User:129.94.6.30">129.94.6.30</a> 06:11, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Indeed, Burr and Clinton were close, but politics changed them. See the latest Bio., "Burr," by Milton Lomask, 1982. Most recent and (probably) accurate biography yet. (User: Bruno Monkus) 21 July 2006.</p>

<p>Looks like we should talk about this one a bit. Personally, I don't see how the Cheney thing has much to do with Aaron Burr, but not enough to revert it. But I can see why one would.

<dd>The 'shooting' item, as currently written; misses the essential point: that both the Burr and Cheney shootings took place in completely non-military, non-wartime contexts. Obviously many Presidents and Vice-Presidents served in the military. Indeed, I would guess more than the "eight" Veeps mentioned in the article as currently amended discharged firearms in battle. The point is what is unique about the Burr and Cheney shootings; specifically the civilian context of both. If that is not made clear, then the entire addition makes no sense and should be deleted. dukdukgoose 18:13, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The "clear" part is that these incidents are entirely unrelated. They are coincidental only in that they involve a weapon, a victim, and a sitting vice president. These coincidental facts have no historical merit with regard to Burr or Burr-Hamilton. Therefore, they should be omitted entirely from Burr's articles. Burr had no role in or influence over Cheney's incident, therefore, it's entirely inappropriate to muddy up the Burr articles. Including Cheney in the Burr article makes about as much sense as including Neil Armstrong in Burr's article on the grounds that they are both male, U.S. citizens, and were elected officials in the U.S. government. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 19:41, 16 February 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>I see your point, but my feeling was lumping a partial list of ex-Veep military records in with the Burr and Cheney shootings and treating them all as if they were the same was less "clear" still.

<p>Cheney was second sitting Vice-President to shoot someone while in office.

Just keep the short reference in the Burr article.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The whole Cheney thing adds absolutely nothing of interest to the Aaron Burr article. If Cheney where involved in a duel than by all means add it, but this was a hunting accident peopl,e and someone got sprayed, not the sitting veep taking aim at someone and shooting to kill. To place it in here demeans the Burr article and blows the Cheney thing way out of proportins.--<a href="../../../k/a/l/User%7EKalsermar_7a00.html" title="User:Kalsermar">Kalsermar</a> 20:29, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I respectfully disagree. The circumstances are different, Cheney himself mentioned Burr, but the fact is that Cheney was the second Vice-President to shoot a person while serving as Vice-President. So the reference stays. Yes, future VPs have shot at people when they served in the military, for example. So I'm receptive to Rklawton's suggestion.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Assuming Cheney mentioned Burr, then the reference should go on Cheney's page, not Burr's and that's the whole point of my objection. I don't like to see articles about historical figures muddied up by events upon which they had no impact. It simply isn't fair to Burr. Think about the impact this policy would have on so many articles! For example, I buy "W" ketchup. The "W" stands for George Washington. Should the fact that this ketchup uses his image and initial go in George Washington's article? Of course not. Good or bad, the ketchup isn't Washington's fault. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 21:09, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Maybe I'm missing it above, but could someone complete the sentence: "Information about the recent Cheney hunting accident belongs on the Aaron Burr page because. . ." Yes, the Cheney hunting accident belongs in Wikipedia. Yes, discussion of that incident might include mention of the Burr Duel, but it will be a rare person who comes to the Aaron Burr page for information about Aaron Burr that will expect or gain insight into Mr. Burr by the inclusion of the reference to the accident. Its an interesting tid-bit. I appreciated the Daily Show treatment of it (including Burr), but this isn't an article on Cheney, Hunting Accidents or even Vice Presidents Who Have Shot People. <a href="../../../j/w/y/User%7EJwy_3c30.html" title="User:Jwy">John (Jwy)</a> 21:16, 16 February 2006 (UTC)

<p>The Cheney reference is asinine. It adds nothing to this article. It makes Wikipedia look like a poor piece of trivia and nonsense. There's no reason to go find every last thing people have in common and point it out. I'm removing it on the grounds that it is irrelevant, uninformative, and adds nothing to the article.</p>

<dd>I would like to address one of the issues raised on another talk page. I'm not sure where. It has to do with a reference to Burr in Cheney's article vs. a reference to Cheney in Burr's article. There is a big differnce because Burr is a historical figure that can't comment on Cheney. Burr's encyclopedia article needs to be focused on what happeded in his life back then, not current events. It can be more appropriate to include references to past historical characters in articles about contemporary people. People are comparing Cheney to Burr, not the otherway around.

<p>Here's a careful explanation of my position:</p>
<dl>
<dd>First, Cheney made note of Burr during a post-shooting interview, so a reference on Cheney's article to Burr may be appropriate.</dd>
<dd>Second, since Burr did not serve as a role-model or other influence over Cheney's accident, and since Cheney's incident is nothing more than a mere (and weak) coincidence, it doesn't belong in the Burr and Hamilton-Burr articles.</dd>
<dd>Here are a couple of tests to apply:
<dl>
<dd>1) If we applied the weak-coincidence rule to all Wikipedia articles, what would result?</dd>
<dd>2) Does the Cheney incident teach us anything about Aaron Burr or the Hamilton-Burr Duel? No. Since the Cheney incident teaches us nothing about Burr, it really doesn't belong in the Burr article.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This second point isn't true in every case regarding historical figures. Here's a counter-example. What does <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> teach us about <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Johnson_cfbb.html" title="Robert Johnson">Robert Johnson</a>? The answer is quite different. Robert Johnson's innovations (and others) significantly influenced Elvis’ early compositions, and Elvis said as much. Indeed, we can hear some of Johnson's rhythms in a lot of early rock. As a result, it's fully appropriate to mention this in Johnson's article because it illustrates the impact Johnson had on modern music. This teaches us something about Johnson’s talents. The same can't be said about Burr's impact on Cheney.</dd>
<dd>Lastly, one might consider adding a note to the Burr article to the affect that since the Hamilton-Burr duel, no other sitting executive has participated in a gentlemen's duel. I wouldn’t recommend it, though, unless we mean to infer that this duel may have had an impact on the perception of acceptable behavior in the executive branch. This would not be an acceptable inference for Wikipedia, though, unless we could find some historical support for the point. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 17:45, 17 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Like the Presley article - which could plausibly mention Johnson as an influence - and the Johnson article - which could plausibily mention later influencing Presley - the Cheney article should surely mention he was only the second sitting vice president to shoot another person, and the Burr article can certainly <i>mention</i> he was "one of only two sitting Vice presidents to shoot a person. The second was Vice President Dick Cheney, who accidentally shot a person during a 2006 hunting trip." That's it. Period. End of entry. No further analogies work, or are warranted, since this wasn't a duel and, as Rklawton says, we learn nothing from further elaboration. Anyone who wants to re-hash the fact that Cheney might have been drunk or having an affair HERE, in THIS article on Burr, is POV-pushing, and such entries should be reverted immediately. <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> 18:14, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First of all, I seriously wonder if there might not be some copyright violations in here. Large sections of it read like they were pulled from a single biography. But that's just a suspicion, I have no evidence.</p>
<p>However, I must say, this article is sorely in need of balance. At every turn we are confronted with St. Aaron the Misunderstood. Look this guy may have gotten an unfair shake from history, I don't doubt that. But this article could have been written by his mother. The answer, I think, will be documentation.

<dd>I think your first paragraph is a hundred times better than what was there. It's almost perfect, except for possibly one thing, which is hard for me, a Hamilphile, to judge. Would you really say that Burr is "beloved" by his supporters? Reviled by his enemies, yes, but I would think his supporters would merely defend his honor almost begrudgingly. I don't know, like I said, given my leanings, I'm perhaps not able to judge.</dd>

But you've already improved it significantly with that opening paragraph. <a href="../../../u/n/s/User%7EUnschool_e4b4.html" title="User:Unschool">Unschool</a> 18:47, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Seeing that there is something of a debate going on, I won't presume to do any editing. I have some comments though.</p>
<p>The assertion, "Burr continues to be misunderstood and disgraced to the present day," should be removed. Not only is it questionable English - (Burr, being long dead, does not continue to do anything) - but it is sneaky. Passive verbs are weasel words. Exactly who continues to misunderstand, and what is it that they believe which is not true? Presumably whoever wrote the sentence thinks <i>he</i> understands, and that Burr's purported disgrace is undeserved. In other words, it sounds like a cheap shot at a straw man.</p>
<p>I have been reading <i>Founding Brothers</i> by Joseph J. Ellis. The book won the Pulitzer Prize. I have not studied either the book or this article deeply, but it seems to me that the two are frequently at odds. Given that footnotes in the book cite many references while this article cites very few, I am inclined to believe the book is probably more authoritative.</p>
<p>There has been an enormous amount written about the duel over the centuries. A neutral POV survey with references seems in order. <a href="../../../j/i/v/User%7EJive_Dadson_68fb.html" title="User:Jive Dadson">Jive Dadson</a> 23:31, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hmmmm. Of course you are correct that passive verbs can be used as weasel words. You are also correct that Burr does not "do" anything today, due to his assumption of ground temperature. But I believe, genrally speaking, in such a case, that passive words may be wholly appropriate, and that in this case, may be the best way to state things. To say that Burr (regarding whom I count myself amongst the detractor crowd) is "misunderstood" seems to be perfectly acceptable usage. If you want documentation, then fine, that's a reasonable request (and a doable request, at that), but I disagree that passive verbs are out of place. The issue of weasel words seems to be a much more significant problems with debates of contemporary issues, where people are trying to create gray-shaded "truths". <a href="../../../u/n/s/User%7EUnschool_e4b4.html" title="User:Unschool">Unschool</a> 20:25, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Passive verbs make for better writing. Most academic writing is in passive tense. They are not "weasel words." The emphasis by people like Strunk and White on verbs that denote action is to dumb writing down for the illiterate and other lowest common denominator types. If you want that, try the Simple English wikipedia. —<a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplorerCDT_cbe5.html" title="User:ExplorerCDT">ExplorerCDT</a> 20:28, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>P.S. I'm hoping to bring this article up to snuff after seeing in what shambles it was previously in. To date, I've rewritten the entire introduction. I would like to get this ready for an eventual Featured Article candidacy.

<p>In the section on the duel here, it says "he lay in the house of a friend", but in the <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burr-Hamilton_duel_4287.html" title="Burr-Hamilton duel">main article</a> on the duel, it says "Burr shot and wounded Hamilton, who died the following day from his wounds at his home, The Grange, in northern Manhattan." Did he die at his friend's home or his own home?
