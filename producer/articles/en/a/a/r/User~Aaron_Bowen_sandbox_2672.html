<p><a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Soprano_ac73.html" title="Tony Soprano">Anthony "Tony" Soprano</a> (<a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Gandolfini_c836.html" title="James Gandolfini">James Gandolfini</a>) is the boss of the DiMeo crime family and patriarch of the Soprano household. He is troubled with personal and professional problems and sees a therapist for his panic attacks, the first of which occurred after witnessing his father lop off a meat-store owner's pinky. His therapist is <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Melfi_b29f.html" title="Jennifer Melfi">Dr. Jennifer Melfi</a>, (<a href="../../../l/o/r/Lorraine_Bracco_0523.html" title="Lorraine Bracco">Lorraine Bracco</a>), also an Italian-American. She is very professional and feels responsible for helping Tony with his panic attacks. Dr. Melfi struggles to maintain her ethical and professional position despite being endangered and threatened by Tony and his criminal lifestyle.</p>
<p>Tony's immediate family consists of his wife <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmela_Soprano_ecc8.html" title="Carmela Soprano">Carmela Soprano</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Edie_Falco_9f09.html" title="Edie Falco">Edie Falco</a>), daughter <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meadow_Soprano_f0fd.html" title="Meadow Soprano">Meadow Mariangela Soprano</a> (<a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamie-Lynn_Sigler_87df.html" title="Jamie-Lynn Sigler">Jamie-Lynn Sigler</a>) and son <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Soprano%2C_Jr._d284.html" title="Anthony Soprano, Jr.">Anthony "A.J." Soprano, Jr.</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Iler_df29.html" title="Robert Iler">Robert Iler</a>). Carmela is a proud mother and devoted wife who struggles to accept her husband's criminal activity and infidelity as well as her own financial insecurity. She maintains a social network with other Mafia wives and widows. A.J. is initially a typical adolescent and struggles with an unconfirmed diagnosis of ADHD and teenage rebellion. Meadow is a gifted student who rationalizes her father's business and grows up hoping to pursue a career in either law or medicine.</p>
<p>Tony's extended family includes his mother <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livia_Soprano_3558.html" title="Livia Soprano">Livia Soprano</a> (<a href="../../../n/a/n/Nancy_Marchand_505b.html" title="Nancy Marchand">Nancy Marchand</a>), sisters <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janice_Soprano_8e68.html" title="Janice Soprano">Janice Soprano</a> (<a href="../../../a/i/d/Aida_Turturro_6b4d.html" title="Aida Turturro">Aida Turturro</a>) and <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barbara_Soprano_Giglione_b619.html" title="Barbara Soprano Giglione">Barbara Soprano Giglione</a> (Nicole Burdette), uncle <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junior_Soprano_20ff.html" title="Junior Soprano">Corrado "Junior" Soprano</a> (<a href="../../../d/o/m/Dominic_Chianese_dee4.html" title="Dominic Chianese">Dominic Chianese</a>), cousin <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blundetto_acf8.html" title="Tony Blundetto">Tony Blundetto</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Buscemi_12a3.html" title="Steve Buscemi">Steve Buscemi</a>) and nephew <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Moltisanti_28b2.html" title="Christopher Moltisanti">Christopher Moltisanti</a> (<a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Imperioli_106f.html" title="Michael Imperioli">Michael Imperioli</a>). Livia is a shrewd manipulator and has emotional problems of her own, mainly being incapable of showing love or compassion of any kind. Junior has seniority over Tony in their criminal empire and strives to maintain power. This desire to be boss coupled with Livia's manipulative ways lead to a fudged assassination attempt on Tony in the first season. As a result, the relationship between Tony and his uncle Junior is intriguing throughout the series. Janice, who has had a child in Quebec, ran off to Seattle at a young age, but returns to New Jersey decades later and gets into disruptive relationships with some of Tony's colleagues. Barbara has moved away to start her own family. Blundetto grew up with Tony, but was convicted of armed robbery in their youth. He is finally released from prison in season five of the show. Christopher is Carmela's second cousin, but Tony considers him his nephew and protege in the crime family, helping him rise through the ranks.</p>

Phil Leotardo, however, is more difficult to deal with, ambitious and not hesitant to use or order violence against Tony's crew.</p>

Tony Soprano in an early episode.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The series begins with <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Soprano_ac73.html" title="Tony Soprano">Tony Soprano</a> collapsing after suffering an <a href="../../../a/n/x/Anxiety.html" title="Anxiety">anxiety</a> attack, which prompts him to begin <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychotherapy.html" title="Psychotherapy">therapy</a> with <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Melfi_b29f.html" title="Jennifer Melfi">Dr. Jennifer Melfi</a>. Gradually, the storyline reveals that Tony's <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livia_Soprano_3558.html" title="Livia Soprano">mother</a> was manipulative and possibly psychotic, his children have troubled futures, someone in his organization is talking to the <a href="../../../f/b/i/FBI_73d2.html" title="FBI">FBI</a> and his own Uncle is plotting his death. Tony's Uncle Junior had been installed as boss of the family while Tony controls things from behind the scenes. Furious at Junior's plan to have him killed, Tony responds to the attempt on his life with a violent reprisal and confronts his mother for her role in plotting his downfall. She has a psychologically triggered pseudostroke. Tony's Uncle Junior is arrested by the FBI.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_Sopranos_episodes_0e46.html#Season_2:_.282000.29" title="List of The Sopranos episodes">second season</a>, Richie Aprile is released from prison and proves to be uncontrollable in the business arena as well as starting a relationship with Tony's sister Janice. Tony's friend "Big Pussy" returns to New Jersey after a conspicuous absence and Tony realizes he is an FBI informant. Forced to face up to these problems, Tony personally kills Big Pussy and Janice kills Richie in a violent argument before Tony is forced to deal with him.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_Sopranos_episodes_0e46.html#Season_3:_.282001.29" title="List of The Sopranos episodes">third season</a>, the ambitious Ralphie Cifaretto returns to Tony's organization after a long absence in Florida. He gets involved with friends of Tony's family and, despite a personal animosity, Tony promotes him. Jackie Aprile, Jr. becomes involved with Tony's daughter and then descends into an increasingly reckless life of crime. Tony initially attempts to chalk up Jackie Jr.'s erratic behavior to a forgivable incident of his youth, and tries to prevent an escalation by having a frank and direct talk with Jackie. Despite Tony's counsel--and warning--Jackie crosses a bright line by organizing a botched robbery attempt on his own borgata. Tony decides to give <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Cifaretto_7e12.html" title="Ralph Cifaretto">Ralph Cifaretto</a> the responsibility of making a decision regarding whether to give Jackie Jr. a pass or not. Ralph ultimately decides to have Jackie Jr. killed.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_Sopranos_episodes_0e46.html#Season_4:_.282002.29" title="List of The Sopranos episodes">fourth season</a>, Tony murders Ralphie in a violent rage after Ralphie kills their racehorse Pie-O-My in a stable fire. Ralphie's behavior up to that point had become increasingly erratic and senselessly violent, including the murder of one of Silvio's working girls. Tension between Tony and Carmela comes to a head when Tony's former goomara Irina calls the house. Their marriage finally breaks down and Carmela leaves him. Tony is approached by Johnny Sack, his friend in the Lupertazzi Crime Family, with a proposal to murder Carmine Lupertazzi, which he eventually turns down.</p>
<p>In the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_Sopranos_episodes_0e46.html#Season_5:_.282004.29" title="List of The Sopranos episodes">fifth season</a>, Tony's cousin Tony Blundetto is released from prison alongside other mob figures. Carmine dies unexpectedly and his failure to nominate a successor leads to a power struggle in New York. Despite trying to avoid returning to organized crime, Blundetto gets involved in the war against Tony's orders. When Blundetto kills the brother of <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Leotardo_27a6.html" title="Phil Leotardo">Phil Leotardo</a>, Johnny demands that Tony turn him in. Refusing to do so provokes the New York faction, and eventually Tony elects to kill Blundetto himself rather than hand him over to be tortured. Tony manages to convince Carmela to take him back. Christopher discovers that Adriana is an FBI informant and tells Tony. Tony, with Christopher's understanding, orders Silvio Dante to kill Adriana. Just as Tony and Johnny are about to put an end to the bloodshed between the families and get back to business, Johnny is arrested by the FBI.</p>
<p>In the first part of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_Sopranos_episodes_0e46.html#Season_6:_.282006-2007.29" title="List of The Sopranos episodes">sixth season</a>, Tony is shot by Uncle Junior, now senile and confused. Following the shooting, Tony has a strange experience while in a coma. This changes his outlook and he tries to change his actions. However, he is faced with more problems in his business life. Christopher Moltisanti, after getting married and buying a new home, becomes romantically involved (and begins using drugs again) with an attractive female real estate agent that Tony is attracted to as well. <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vito_Spatafore_2d76.html" title="Vito Spatafore">Vito Spatafore</a> is outed as a homosexual and Tony is urged to deal with the problem by Phil Leotardo, now boss of New York with Johnny Sack in prison. When Tony fails to act, Phil intervenes and kills Spatafore. Tony's crime family commits a reprisal murder and once more it appears that the families are on the verge of all-out war.</p>

<p>A distinct aspect of <i>The Sopranos</i> are the dream sequences. They are employed in an unusual way<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, using heavy symbolism and foreshadowing, to convey what characters (particularly Tony) are thinking and feeling, but not saying<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. The dream sequences include Tony talking to Big Pussy as a fish and realizing his friend is an FBI informant. The dream reveals that Tony subconsciously should have known all along that Pussy was a snitch. In the dream, Pussy (the fish) tells Tony, "You shouldn't have passed me over for promotion." Another famous dream is the sequence in "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Test_Dream_%28The_Sopranos_episode%29_8f04.html" title="The Test Dream (The Sopranos episode)">The Test Dream</a>" that is over 20 minutes in length.</p>
<p>Season six contains the longest continuous "dream" sequence with Tony as a regular man having his identity mistaken for a man named Kevin Finnerty. The "Kevin Finnerty" dream appears to symbolize Tony's fears of life after death<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. The name "Kevin Finnerty" is discussed in the dream as containing the word "infinity". In the dream, Tony is stuck in a city he had traveled to for business, and because of mistaken identity, he cannot travel home.

<p>In The Sopranos, the sun holds a significance in suicide. Whenever the camera points to the sun, a character in the story either attempts to commit suicide or successfully commits suicide.</p>
<p>An example of this occurrence can be seen in the episode "<a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobody_Knows_Anything_a3a1.html" title="Nobody Knows Anything">Nobody Knows Anything</a>", before Makazian commits suicide, the camera pans off to the sun.

<p>In The Sopranos, eggs foreshadow the occurrence of something unfortunate, generally a loss of life, loss of sanity, or both.</p>
<p>Some examples include: In "<a href="../../../c/o/m/Commendatori_%28The_Sopranos_episode%29_9b1a.html" title="Commendatori (The Sopranos episode)">Commendatori</a>" Pussy's wife drops a carton of eggs when Pussy comes down stairs and he later kills an acquaintance who spotted him with his FBI handler.

<p><br />
Other tenuous examples exist. <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richie_Aprile_48af.html" title="Richie Aprile">Richie Aprile</a> offers to make Tony eggs when Tony finds him sleeping in Janice's house. He is shot and killed by Janice at the season's conclusion.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Bowen_sandbox_2672.html" title="Edit section: Animals">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Animals</span></h3>
<p>Animals are often used as symbolism in the show. Ducks are used in the first season to represent Tony's family. Squirrels are used in the fourth season to represent the changing times. A black bear is used in Season Five to represent Tony himself. In the season one finale a rottweiler is seen barking at Mikey "Grab Bag" Palmice as he is jogging and before he is gunned down on Tony's orders. In Season Three, after Dr. Melfi is raped leaving work, she has a dream in which a <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rottweiler.html" title="Rottweiler">rottweiler</a> appears to save her from her attacker. She later realizes the significance of the rottweiler as a descendant of Roman guard dogs, loyal but fierce, relating it to the nationality and nature of Tony, whom she trusts.</p>
<p>Tony has shown a certain fondness for animals that, as Dr. Melfi points out, he does not show towards people, apparently as a form of displaced affection. Tony's depression originally began when the family of ducks left his pool. The race horse Pie-O-My in Season Four brought out Tony's soft side, and the animal's death in a stable fire demanded as bloody a payback as if she had been a member of his family. Tony showed more anger at Christopher when finding out that he had accidentally killed Adriana's dog, Cosette, than when he discovered that Chris was still using drugs. Tony was deeply upset when he found out that his father had given away his childhood dog, Tippy, to his mistress, Fran Felstein.</p>

<p>The time "three o'clock" seems to have some significance.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> The time was first mentioned in the Season One episode "<a href="../../../m/e/a/Meadowlands_%28The_Sopranos_episode%29_3ce1.html" title="Meadowlands (The Sopranos episode)">Meadowlands</a>" when Tony dreams that he sees his mob associates visiting Dr. Melfi's office and she says, "Heshie? He has a three o'clock." In the Season Two episode, "<a href="../../../f/r/o/From_Where_to_Eternity_%28The_Sopranos_episode%29_05b7.html" title="From Where to Eternity (The Sopranos episode)">From Where to Eternity</a>," Christopher comes out of a coma thinking he was in hell and gives a message to Tony and Paulie from <a href="../../../b/r/e/Brendan_Filone_8f4f.html" title="Brendan Filone">Brendan Filone</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikey_Palmice_cb17.html" title="Mikey Palmice">Mikey Palmice</a>: three o'clock. Also in Season Two in the episode "Full Leather Jacket", Tony mentions to Melfi that his appointment is on a Tuesday at 3pm.</p>
<p>In Season Six, Vito calls Silvio at 3:00 AM from a cheap motel room after he realizes that his sexual preference for men has been discovered by New York mob members, in hopes of determining whether the news had yet spread to the Soprano family. Later in the Season Six episode, "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ride_%28The_Sopranos_episode%29_7bdc.html" title="The Ride (The Sopranos episode)">The Ride</a>," Paulie wakes up at 3:00 to call his doctor to find out whether or not he has prostate cancer. At the beginning of Season Six when Tony goes into cardiac arrest it can be deduced that the event of his near death occurs at or near 3:00 PM. Prior to the event, Paulie enters the room and the clock shows that it is 2:25. After Tony is resuscitated we get a brief glimpse of the clock and the time is 3:15.</p>
<p>It might also be notable that the time three o'clock in fact holds great significance in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Catholic_Church_7422.html" title="Roman Catholic Church">Catholicism</a>.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> It is generally held among many Catholics today, in part due to the various visions and insight of Roman Catholic Augustinian nun <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anne_Catherine_Emmerich_447c.html" title="Anne Catherine Emmerich">Anne Catherine Emmerich</a>, that three o'clock in the afternoon was the time of day that Jesus died.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>

<p>The mobsters in the series are depicted as tough and savvy street-smart toughs lacking education and common sense. The characters are frequently oblivious to the humorous usage of their language and ignorance. The <a href="../../../m/a/l/Malapropism.html" title="Malapropism">malapropisms</a> are often a source of humor for the viewers. Paulie pronounces "Mayhem" as "Mayham" in the third episode of season six, giving the episode its title. New York mob boss Carmine Lupertazzi's first appearance in Season 3 sees him reassure Tony that seeing a therapist is nothing to be ashamed of: "There's no stigmata." In the second episode of season one, Paulie "Walnuts" Gualtieri laments to "Big Pussy" that Americans are stealing Italian culture and making money as a result (pizza, calzones, etc. are cited as examples). Paulie also cites "Expresso" (emphasis on "X") coffee as something stolen by Americans from Italian culture and sold in the mainstream for profit; the coffee is actually pronounced "Espresso". Bobby Baccalieri once drew the ire of Tony while discussing world events and biblical prophecy by erroneously stating that "Quasimodo predicted all of this." Tony then corrected him by saying that he meant Nostradamus and that Quasimodo was the Hunchback of Notre Dame. Baccalieri then continued the conversation by mentioning the backfield of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team, now thinking that a hunchback is like a full back. Christopher has often used the expression "irregardless", as well as confusing <i><a href="../../../s/p/e/Law_%26_Order%7E_Special_Victims_Unit_16bb.html" title="Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></i> (SVU) with the acronym for a sports utility vehicle by calling the show <i>Law &amp; Order: SUV</i>. Tony has had several instances of misused language. In a season 2 episode, he mentions his uncle's "cathode" when referring to a catheter. In season four, he attributes a quote of Rodney King, "Why can't we all just get along?", to "the Reverend Rodney King Jr". Tony apparently inherited this trait from his father, Johnny Soprano, who once told his wife, Livia, she was an "albacore around his neck."</p>
<p>Key plot lines of the show highlight the characters ineptitude and frequent misunderstandings of history and common knowledge. Paulie is the character best known for humorous use of language. When he mentions what he thinks caused the extinction of the dinosaurs and a lady diner queries, "Wasn't that a meteor?", Paulie dismissively replies "they're all meat-eaters". Paulie also believes snakes can reproduce spontaneously. When Tony Blundetto becomes involved in a business dealing with a <a href="../../../k/o/r/Koreans.html" title="Koreans">Korean</a>, Paulie reminds him to "remember <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearl_Harbor_865a.html" title="Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>". Much of the episode "<a href="../../../p/i/n/Pine_Barrens_%28The_Sopranos_episode%29_cb77.html" title="Pine Barrens (The Sopranos episode)">Pine Barrens</a>" was devoted to the failings of Paulie and Christopher as they attempted to survive a single day and night in a snowy wilderness after a botched execution. In this episode, Tony tells them to be careful with the subject of their execution as he once allegedly killed 16 Chechnyan rebels as part of the Russian Interior Ministry. When Paulie later repeats this claim, he says that the subject killed 16 Czechoslovakians and was an interior decorator. Although the phone call had a bad connection because Paulie was lost in the woods at the time, it is implied that he probably was not smart enough to know the difference between the two groups, similar to mistaking Austrians with Australians. Earlier in the same episode Christopher shows his bad knowledge of history when he talks about Russians with Paulie. Paulie happens to mention the <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cuban_Missile_Crisis_79ac.html" title="Cuban Missile Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a>, Christopher is surprised and asks, "That was real?" because he had seen a movie and thought it was fiction. In the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sopranos_%28Pilot_episode%29_b836.html" title="The Sopranos (Pilot episode)">pilot</a>, Christopher explains his understanding that <a href="../../../p/o/l/Poland.html" title="Poland">Polish</a> people are from <a href="../../../c/z/e/Czechoslovakia.html" title="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>. In Season 4, he believes his girlfriend has two uteri.</p>
<p>Tony often repeats things that Dr. Melfi says to him elsewhere, only to get the phrase entirely wrong or completely miss the point. When Melfi told him that his relationship with Gloria can be described as "Amour Fou" ("crazy love"), Tony later repeats the phrase to Gloria, describing their affair as "Our Mofo". In the tenth episode of the fifth season, "<a href="../../../c/o/l/Cold_Cuts_%28The_Sopranos_episode%29_4d8d.html" title="Cold Cuts (The Sopranos episode)">Cold Cuts</a>", Tony says "revenge is like serving cold cuts" only to be corrected by Dr. Melfi saying, "Revenge is a dish best served cold". In "<a href="../../../c/o/m/Commendatori_%28The_Sopranos_episode%29_9b1a.html" title="Commendatori (The Sopranos episode)">Commendatori</a>" Paulie travels to <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a> and attempts to blend in with the locals, but does not realize that he is repeatedly being mocked. On another occasion Tony remarks to Dr. Melfi that he remarks that he has read a book she recommended, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Art_of_War_4a07.html" title="The Art of War">The Art of War</a></i> by <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun_Tzu_68bf.html" title="Sun Tzu">Sun Tzu</a>, but that many of his compatriots have read <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prince_Matchabelli_f63b.html" title="Prince Matchabelli">Prince Matchabelli</a>, a malapropism that simultaneously alludes to a perfume and the book <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Prince_2d6a.html" title="The Prince">The Prince</a></i> by <a href="../../../n/i/c/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli_0587.html" title="NiccolÃ² Machiavelli">NiccolÃ² Machiavelli</a>. Dr. Melfi once remarks that she enjoyed the movie <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Prince_of_Tides_fd22.html" title="The Prince of Tides">The Prince of Tides</a></i> and Tony shows up at his next appointment brandishing a gaudily wrapped bottle of "Tide" laundry detergent. On another occasion in season one, Melfi refers to a resort hotel at <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antibes.html#Cap_d.27Antibes" title="Antibes">Cap d'Antibes</a>, while Tony thinks she's referring to a hotel owned by someone named "Captain Teebs". In one episode, Christopher says "..You know, to stir up some dysentery amongst the ranks." He meant dissension.</p>
<p>Ineptitude is displayed when the Family bought a gravestone for Joseph Pepperelli that bore the deceased gangster's nickname "Joey Peeps" rather than his actual name because some the characters were apparently unaware of his real name. Throughout the series jokes are often told at funerals. At the funeral of Ray Curto, many Family members commented on what a "standup" guy he was, oblivious to the fact that he was an FBI informant.</p>

<p>Characters, particularly Tony, are often shown watching movies or TV shows on television. Tony is often seen watching documentaries on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_History_Channel_d430.html" title="The History Channel">The History Channel</a> or noir classics such as <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Cagney_83fe.html" title="James Cagney">James Cagney</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Public_Enemy_ce0f.html" title="The Public Enemy">The Public Enemy</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../w/h/i/White_Heat_5761.html" title="White Heat">White Heat</a></i>. The use of certain scenes in these documentaries and movies are used to foreshadow events that are going to happen, or to symbolize the situation that Tony and/or other characters are in. An example of this is Uncle Junior watching a <i><a href="../../../p/a/t/Paths_of_Glory_fe13.html" title="Paths of Glory">Paths of Glory</a></i> scene in "<a href="../../../m/e/m/Members_Only_%28The_Sopranos_episode%29_3da7.html" title="Members Only (The Sopranos episode)">Members Only</a>" that had <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolphe_Menjou_689e.html" title="Adolphe Menjou">Adolphe Menjou</a>'s character (General Broulard) telling <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kirk_Douglas_0072.html" title="Kirk Douglas">Kirk Douglas</a>'s character (Colonel Dax) "You've spoiled the keenness of your mind by wallowing in sentimentality... You are an idealist, and I pity you as I would the village idiot." This was used to symbolize the deterioration of Uncle Junior's memory and his relationship with Tony.</p>
<p>Also, FBI warnings of piracy and "illegal" distribution of pirated DVDs are always shown in their entirety (lasting a number of seconds) whenever characters begin watching a movie - e.g when Chris watches a bootleg DVD of <i>The Godfather</i>, and when Carmela and friends watch <i>Citizen Kane</i>. These two FBI warnings were displayed when a known informant was in the room. (Big Pussy was present when Chris watched <i>The Godfather</i>, and Adriana was at the viewing of <i>Citizen Kane</i>.)</p>
<p>Movies are also a source of inspiration for the show. Christopher's obsession with becoming a screenwriter has been a long-running storyline on the show. In the first and second seasons, he wrote a script called "You Bark, I Bite" but struggled to complete it. In season six, he hired former AA sponsor, JT Dolan, to write a script titled "Pork Store Killer" (later renamed "Cleaver"). On occasion, he uses movie references to describe the situation he is in. In addition, <a href="../../../r/a/l/Ralph_Cifaretto_7e12.html" title="Ralph Cifaretto">Ralph Cifaretto</a> had a fascination with gladiator movies. Ridley Scott's <i><a href="../../../g/l/a/Gladiator_%28film%29.html" title="Gladiator (film)">Gladiator</a></i> (2000), in particular, seems to stimulate Ralph's bravado and he can be heard quoting several lines from the film during the third season. When he quotes "Pride and Honor", Tony hand Ralph his empty glass and says, "Scotch and Soda".</p>
<p>Media theorist <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshall_McLuhan_b107.html" title="Marshall McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a> serves as inside joke in "House Arrest", aired in the second season. Junior gets a visit in the hospital from a Michael McLuhan, who is a U.S. Marshal. The nurse asks if his name is really 'Marshal' McLuhan. Junior wonders what the "joke" is.</p>

There has been a total of 24 actors who have appeared in both productions.</p>
<p>There are several nods to <i><a href="../../../g/o/o/Goodfellas.html" title="Goodfellas">Goodfellas</a></i> in the show, including Christopher shooting a bakery store cashier in the foot, muttering "it happens". (Imperioli's character, Spider, was shot in the foot in the film.) Another character, <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phil_Leotardo_27a6.html" title="Phil Leotardo">Phil Leotardo</a>, shot <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Sopranos_in_the_Lupertazzi_Crime_Family_be6c.html#Angelo_Garepe" title="List of characters from The Sopranos in the Lupertazzi Crime Family">Angelo Garepe</a> in the trunk of a car (<a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Vincent_591b.html" title="Frank Vincent">Frank Vincent</a>'s character in <i>Goodfellas</i> was shot and stabbed in the trunk of a car).

<p>Additionally, the opening of almost every season (<a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Soprano_ac73.html" title="Tony Soprano">Tony Soprano</a> picking up a newspaper at the end of the driveway in his bathrobe) is a nod to the final scene of <i><a href="../../../g/o/o/Goodfellas.html" title="Goodfellas">Goodfellas</a></i>, where <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Liotta_3388.html" title="Ray Liotta">Ray Liotta</a>, as <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Hill_724f.html" title="Henry Hill">Henry Hill</a>, does the same thing.</p>
<p><a name="The_Godfather" id="The_Godfather"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Bowen_sandbox_2672.html" title="Edit section: The Godfather">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><i>The Godfather</i></span></h4>
<p>Many of the characters are interested in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Godfather_f51f.html" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a></i> series of movies and some of the actors who portray them also appear in the films. For example in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Godfather_Part_II_7ee4.html" title="The Godfather Part II">The Godfather Part II</a></i>, Dominic Chianese (Junior Soprano) plays Johnny Ola. It has become a myth that Tony Sirico was in the film, but that is untrue (He did appear in "Goodfellas" as Tony Stacks, one of the wiseguys during the section of the film when Henry Hill was growing up). Danny Aiello played the hit man that Sirico has been reported to have played. In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Godfather_f51f.html" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a></i>, Tony Lip (Carmine Lupertazzi) and Lou Martini, Jr. (Anthony Infante) appeared as wedding guests. In <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Godfather_Part_II_7ee4.html" title="The Godfather Part II">The Godfather Part II</a></i>, Richard Maldone (Albert Barese) had a small role as Joey.</p>
<p>Christopher Moltisanti is practically obsessed with the films' depictions of the Mafia. They have all watched the films so often that Paulie, for example, refers to <i>The Godfather</i> star <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Pacino_b483.html" title="Al Pacino">Al Pacino</a> in conversation simply as "Al", the Horn on Paulie's car plays the theme from the Godfather, and several of the characters refer to the movies by their numbers: the first movie in the trilogy is simply referred to as "one". Tony and his crew sometimes discuss favorite scenes from the films: e.g. Tony's favorite is when <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vito_Corleone_8e11.html" title="Vito Corleone">Vito Corleone</a> returns to <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicily.html" title="Sicily">Sicily</a>. Silvio Dante in the early seasons would impersonate Al Pacino, from <i><a href="../../../g/o/d/Godfather_Part_III_d86f.html" title="Godfather Part III">Godfather Part III</a></i>, saying "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in." He has done impersonations of the scene in <i>The Godfather Part III</i> between Michael Corleone and Al Neri where Michael says "Our true enemy has yet to reveal himself," (followed, tellingly, by an immediate cut to a shot of Big Pussy.) The mobsters compare themselves to the cinematic images of organized crime in <i>The Godfather</i> trilogy, as well as other well known films about the Mafia, such as <i><a href="../../../g/o/o/Goodfellas.html" title="Goodfellas">Goodfellas</a></i>.</p>
<p>There are also various visual homages to the <i>Godfather</i> trilogy. Just before Tony is shot in a failed assassination attempt in Season One, he buys a bottle of orange juice, a reference to Vito Corleone buying oranges during a similar attempt on his life. In Season Five, <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carmine_Lupertazzi_f80f.html" title="Carmine Lupertazzi">Carmine Lupertazzi</a> suffers a fatal stroke while eating brunch. At the table, all the glasses are filled with water, except Carmine's, which has orange juice. In addition, following the death of <a href="../../../l/i/v/Livia_Soprano_3558.html" title="Livia Soprano">Livia Soprano</a> in Season Three, there is a point-of-view shot of Tony taking an elevator to the funeral home basement. The scene is a direct homage to the scene in <i>The Godfather</i> where Vito calls on a favor to Bonasera following the murder of his son, <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonny_Corleone_5996.html" title="Sonny Corleone">Santino</a>. In "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Test_Dream_%28The_Sopranos_episode%29_8f04.html" title="The Test Dream (The Sopranos episode)">The Test Dream</a>" we hear <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annette_Bening_70c3.html" title="Annette Bening">Annette Bening</a> make a reference to the line "not coming out of the toilet with only his cock in his hand", and we see Tony reach behind the cistern for a gun in the same way Michael does in <i>The Godfather</i>. In the Season Six, Part I episode <i><a href="../../../m/a/y/Mayham.html" title="Mayham">Mayham</a></i>, Anthony Junior plans to avenge the shooting of his father by killing Uncle Junior. A.J. tells Bobby and Christopher that getting to Junior would be "difficult, not impossible" (<a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocco_Lampone_139d.html" title="Rocco Lampone">Rocco Lampone</a> made this identical remark to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Corleone_5c0c.html" title="Michael Corleone">Michael Corleone</a> concerning the assassination of <a href="../../../h/y/m/Hyman_Roth_f133.html" title="Hyman Roth">Hyman Roth</a> in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Godfather_Part_II_7ee4.html" title="The Godfather Part II">The Godfather Part II</a></i>.)</p>

<p>The show has been a vehicle for David Chase's views on life and the world at large since the first season. Many episodes reference real life events such as the <a href="../../../o/2E/j/O.J._Simpson_murder_case_9e04.html" title="O.J. Simpson murder case">O.J.

There have also been many plot devices and stories that offer a commentary on modern society. One example is when Tony realizes that Johnny Sack is lying to him about not stealing Vespa scooters from Port Newark when he sees a news story about the flaws of port security. Another example being the storyline of Tony selling the property leased by Caputo's Poultry Store, a small business, to <a href="../../../j/a/m/Jamba_Juice_31cf.html" title="Jamba Juice">Jamba Juice</a> <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,20910-2233055,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,20910-2233055,00.html" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, a large corporate juice chain.

<p><i>The Sopranos</i> is one of the most critically acclaimed shows of its time.<sup id="_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#_note-16" title="">[17]</a></sup> It has been consistently hailed as one of the best shows on television and has been judged the top drama series of all time by <i><a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Guide_969f.html" title="TV Guide">TV Guide</a></i> and appears as the fifth highest show on their Top 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time list (behind only <i><a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../i/_/l/I_Love_Lucy_f6db.html" title="I Love Lucy">I Love Lucy</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Honeymooners_1699.html" title="The Honeymooners">The Honeymooners</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All_in_the_Family_80eb.html" title="All in the Family">All in the Family</a></i>). The show topped virtually every "Best TV Show" list in its debut season in 1999, with the <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> calling it "the greatest work of American popular culture in the last 25 years." <i><a href="../../../n/e/w/Newsweek.html" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a></i> has said in the past that it was "far and away, the best show on television."</p>
<p><i>The Sopranos</i> is the most successful cable series of all time, reaching a peak of 13.4 million viewers for the fourth season premiere. As a sign of its popularity, advertisements for the show starting with the fourth season feature just a promotional shot of the regular cast with the title of the show omitted from the advertisement. This perhaps signifies that the characters are so recognizable that people viewing the advertisement don't need to see the words "The Sopranos" to know what it is.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup> Early sixth season promotional posters just had the premiere date of "March 12" with a hand holding a gun replacing the "r" in March. Despite diminished ratings for the sixth season due to competition from the hit ABC series, <i><a href="../../../d/e/s/Desperate_Housewives_828f.html" title="Desperate Housewives">Desperate Housewives</a></i>, <i>The Sopranos</i> was the #1 cable series for the season.</p>
<p>However, the show has faced a variety of criticisms. It has been called anti-Italian<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, with discrimination directly aimed at Italian-Americans due to a certain mob stereotype. The discrimination claim, which has occurred throughout the show's entire run, resulted in an event where the cast was banned from participating in the Columbus Day Parade weeks after "<a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_%28The_Sopranos_episode%29_a498.html" title="Christopher (The Sopranos episode)">Christopher</a>", an episode that revolved around the threat of mob violence when local Native Americans threatened to protest a Columbus Day parade, aired.<sup id="_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#_note-17" title="">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>The National Italian-American Foundation, a frequent critic of <i>The Sopranos</i>, and what it views as negative depictions of Italian-Americans on the series, supported the decision made by The Columbus Citizens Foundation to exclude cast members from the parade. The NIAF also expressed dismay at Mayor Bloomberg's decision to include cast members from the series in New York City's annual Columbus Day Parade. The show has referenced these criticisms, including a satirical portrayal of an organization similar in nature to the NIAF, in various episodes, particularly those written by Michael Imperioli.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to its 'anti-Italian' nature, the show has never been successful in <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italy.html" title="Italy">Italy</a>: it was initially broadcasted as a <a href="../../../s/a/t/Saturday.html" title="Saturday">Saturday</a> <a href="../../../l/a/t/Late_night.html" title="Late night">late night</a> show on <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canale_5.html" title="Canale 5">Canale 5</a>, but it achieved low ratings and then it moved to <a href="../../../s/k/y/SKY_Italia_7671.html" title="SKY Italia">SKY Italia</a>'s <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox.html" title="Fox">Fox</a> and became an <a href="../../../%C3%A9/l/i/%C3%89lite.html" title="Ã‰lite">Ã©lite</a> show.</p>
<p>Some criticism of the show involves the on-screen violence<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. The beating and subsequent death of Tracee and the rape of Dr. Melfi from the third season are two examples of the show pushing the envelope when it comes to scenes of this nature. However, some fans have criticized the fourth season for lacking the violence that the other seasons contained.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Many viewers have also been frustrated by how many storylines are left unfinished<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>, the most frequent examples being the missing Russian, Valery, from "<a href="../../../p/i/n/Pine_Barrens_%28The_Sopranos_episode%29_cb77.html" title="Pine Barrens (The Sopranos episode)">Pine Barrens</a>" and Dr. Melfi's rapist from "<a href="../../../e/m/p/Employee_of_the_Month_%28The_Sopranos_episode%29_8e47.html" title="Employee of the Month (The Sopranos episode)">Employee of the Month</a>". David Chase has insisted that both storylines were self-contained and not meant to be long running story arcs.<sup id="_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#_note-18" title="">[19]</a></sup> The writers of the show are known for building certain storylines very slowly and seemingly forgetting about them for months and even years and then bringing them up briefly in certain episodes before paying off the storyline, one of the best examples being the Raymond Curto/FBI informant storyline.</p>
<p>The first part of the sixth season, in particular, has been criticized for being slow-moving and unfocused. The meandering nature of the season left many fans and critics unsatisfied about the lack of resolution in many episodes <sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. HBO and David Chase have maintained that the sixth season is an extended 21 episode season split into two parts, not two separate seasons of 12 and 9 episodes.<sup id="_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#_note-19" title="">[20]</a></sup><sup id="_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#_note-20" title="">[21]</a></sup> The practice of separating a long season into two parts has been used for the final season of HBO's <i><a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_and_the_City_edf3.html" title="Sex and the City">Sex and the City</a></i> (which also split its 20-episode final season into 12- and 8-episode parts), the second season of the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Sci_Fi_Channel_%28United_States%29_da7f.html" title="Sci Fi Channel (United States)">Sci Fi Channel</a> series <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlestar_Galactica_%282004_TV_series%29_aaae.html" title="Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)">Battlestar Galactica</a></i>, the first season of the <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Broadcasting_Company_86ee.html" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">FOX</a> drama <i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison_Break_4011.html" title="Prison Break">Prison Break</a></i> and the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_Network_9169.html" title="USA Network">USA Network</a> series <i><a href="../../../m/o/n/Monk_%28TV_series%29_d046.html" title="Monk (TV series)">Monk</a></i>.

<li>When the show was a <a href="../../../f/o/x/Fox_Broadcasting_Company_86ee.html" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">FOX</a> project, it was known as <i>Made in Jersey</i>. Other titles that were considered included <i>The Family Guy</i> and <i>Red Sauce</i>.</li>

<li>The character of <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Soprano_ac73.html" title="Tony Soprano">Tony Soprano</a> was originally named Tommy.</li>
<li>The show has become notorious for its long hiatuses and delays. Whereas most TV programs experience a 3-5 month wait in between seasons, <i>The Sopranos</i> has taken a longer time in between each season finale and premiere. This is mostly due to scheduling conflicts for the actors and the time David Chase has asked HBO to have in developing storylines for the series. Chase has said in the past that he intended the show to last only one or two seasons (hence the shorter gap between the first two seasons as compared to later ones), but its success led to a lengthier run, and thus he had to write most of the later episodes from scratch.

<p>An original aspect of the show is its sparse, often minimalist use of incidental music. While most TV series rely on musical scores to emphasize tension or dramatic moments, <i>The Sopranos</i> rarely uses this resource. The most brutal scenes are often unaccompanied by any sort of background music.</p>
<p>In an episode during the 4th season, Tony's son A.J. is listening to the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_metal.html" title="Death metal">death metal</a> band <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deicide_%28band%29.html" title="Deicide (band)">Deicide (band)</a>, Tony pounds on the wall and tells A.J. to turn it down.</p>

Paulie, Silvio, Tony, and Christopher in the Sopranos video game</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In May 2006, <i>The Sopranos</i> videogame was announced titled <i><a href="../../../r/o/a/The_Sopranos%7E_Road_to_Respect_3313.html" title="The Sopranos: Road to Respect">The Sopranos: Road to Respect</a></i>. The story was partly written by David Chase and was developed by 7 Studios and published by THQ Inc.<sup id="_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#_note-29" title="">[30]</a></sup> Voice talent was done by the show's stars, including <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Gandolfini_c836.html" title="James Gandolfini">James Gandolfini</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Imperioli_106f.html" title="Michael Imperioli">Michael Imperioli</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steven_Van_Zandt_6ec1.html" title="Steven Van Zandt">Steven Van Zandt</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Sirico_1dbd.html" title="Tony Sirico">Tony Sirico</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Gannascoli_9f2f.html" title="Joseph Gannascoli">Joseph Gannascoli</a>, <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincent_Pastore_7f30.html" title="Vincent Pastore">Vincent Pastore</a>, and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Iler_df29.html" title="Robert Iler">Robert Iler</a>. The game was released around the Christmas period of 2006.</p>
<p>The game's storyline takes place between the fifth and sixth seasons and centers around Big Pussy's illegitimate son, Joey LaRocca, as he makes his way through the family business. The character is voiced by Christian Maelen, who was David Chase's second choice to play Christopher Moltisanti. The player is able to take missions from the main characters during this era. <i>The Sopranos</i> differs from other mob-influenced games in that it is in a linear, story driven action game as opposed to <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Theft_Auto_8e91.html" title="Grand Theft Auto">Grand Theft Auto</a>'s open-world type gameplay. However, players are able to play Texas Hold 'Em with members of the Family and visit the Bada Bing. Unlike the TV show, the game focuses almost exclusively on the Mafia aspect of <i>The Sopranos</i> rather than the blend of family/business/therapy that <i>Sopranos</i> fans have become accustomed to. The game was not well-received; as of January 2007, it had a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metacritic.html" title="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> score of 46%, characterized as "generally negative reviews".<sup id="_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#_note-30" title="">[31]</a></sup>. One chief complaint among gamers is that the game is very short and can be completed within four hours or less. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stern_%28gaming_company%29.html" title="Stern (gaming company)">Stern Pinball</a> released a <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sopranos_%28pinball%29_4b28.html" title="The Sopranos (pinball)"><i>Sopranos</i> pinball machine</a> in 2005.</p>
<p>Additionally, a web-based game was created in 2006 in support of the broadcast of the first season of <i>The Sopranos</i> on <a href="../../../a/%26/e/A%26E_Network_d385.html" title="A&amp;E Network">A&amp;E Network</a>. Described as a "<a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasy_sports.html" title="Fantasy sports">fantasy sports</a> meets <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scavenger_hunt.html" title="Scavenger hunt">scavenger hunt</a>" experience, <i>The Sopranos A&amp;E Connection</i> combines real-world media â€“ such as billboards, phone kiosks and magazine ads â€“ with an online game board synched to A&amp;Eâ€™s real-time broadcast of the show. The game's website is at <a href="http://www.suitcaseofcash.com" class="external text" title="http://www.suitcaseofcash.com" rel="nofollow">www.suitcaseofcash.com</a>.</p>

<p>There has been talk of a <i>Sopranos</i> feature film that was to be released after the series had ended. While this idea was reportedly scrapped in favor of "The Final Nine" episodes that are set to debut in April 2007, creator David Chase did not rule out the possibility of a <i>Sopranos</i> movie at a future date.<sup id="_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#_note-31" title="">[32]</a></sup></p>
