<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Montgomery_Ward_03fc.html" title="Edit section: Early Years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early Years</span></h2>
<p>Aaron Montgomery Ward was born on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_17.html" title="February 17">February 17</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/4/1844.html" title="1844">1844</a> in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chatham%2C_New_Jersey_6ae1.html" title="Chatham, New Jersey">Chatham</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>. When he was about nine years old, his father, Sylvester Ward, moved the family to <a href="../../../n/i/l/Niles%2C_Michigan_c3ab.html" title="Niles, Michigan">Niles, Michigan</a>, where Aaron attended public schools. He was one of a large family, which at that time was far from wealthy. When he was fourteen, he was apprenticed to a trade to help support the family. According to his brief memoirs, he first earned 25 cents per day at a cutting machine in a barrel stave factory, and then stacking brick in a kiln at 30 cents a day.</p>
<p>Energy and ambition drove him to seek employment in the town of St. Joseph, a market for outlying fruit orchards, where he went to work in a shoe store. This was the initial step toward the project that later sent his name across the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a>. Being a fair salesman, within nine months he was engaged as a salesman in a general country store at six dollars per month plus board, a considerable salary at the time. He rose to become head clerk and general manager and remained at this store for three years. By the end of those three years, his salary was one hundred dollars a month plus his board. He left for a better job in a competing store, where he worked another two years. In this period, Ward learned retailing.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Montgomery_Ward_03fc.html" title="Edit section: Field Palmer &amp; Leiter Years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Field Palmer &amp; Leiter Years</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../1/8/6/1865.html" title="1865">1865</a>, Ward located in Chicago, and worked for Case and Sobin, a lamp house. He traveled for them, and sold goods on commission for a short time. Chicago was the center of the wholesale dry-goods trade, and in the <a href="../../../1/8/6/1860s.html" title="1860s">1860s</a> Ward joined the leading dry-goods house, Field Palmer &amp; Leiter, forerunner of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marshall_Field_9c89.html" title="Marshall Field">Marshall Field</a> &amp; Co. He worked for Field for two years and then joined the wholesale dry-goods business of Wills, Greg &amp; Co. In tedious rounds of train trips to southern communities, hiring rigs at the local stables, driving out to the crossroads stores and listening to the complaints of the back-country proprietors and their rural customers, he conceived a new merchandising technique: direct mail sales to country people. It was a time when rural consumers longed for the comforts of the city, yet all too often were victimized by monopolists and overcharged by the costs of many middlemen required to bring manufactured products to the countryside. The quality of merchandise also was suspect and the hapless farmer had no recourse in a caveat emptor economy. Ward shaped a plan to buy goods at low cost for cash. By eliminating intermediaries, with their markups and commissions, and drastically cutting selling costs, he could sell goods to people, however remote, at appealing prices. He then invited them to send their orders by mail and delivered the purchases to their nearest railroad station. The only thing he lacked was capital.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Montgomery_Ward_03fc.html" title="Edit section: Montgomery Ward &amp; Company Years">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Montgomery Ward &amp; Company Years</span></h2>
<p>None of Ward's friends or business acquaintances joined in his enthusiasm for his revolutionary idea. Although his idea was generally considered to border on lunacy and his first inventory was destroyed by the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Chicago_Fire_f6b6.html" title="Great Chicago Fire">Great Chicago Fire</a>, Ward persevered. In August of <a href="../../../1/8/7/1872.html" title="1872">1872</a>, with two fellow employees and a total capital of $1,600, he formed <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgomery_Ward_3457.html" title="Montgomery Ward">Montgomery Ward &amp; Company</a>. He rented a small shipping room on North Clark Street and published the world's first general merchandise mail-order catalog with 163 products listed. It is said that in <a href="../../../1/8/8/1880.html" title="1880">1880</a>, Aaron Montgomery Ward himself initially wrote all catalog copy. When the business grew and department heads wrote merchandise descriptions, he still went over every line of copy to be certain that it was accurate.</p>
<p>The following year, both of Ward's partners left him, but he hung on. Later, Thorne, his future brother-in-law, joined him in his business. This was the turning point for the young company, which grew and prospered. Soon the catalog, frequently reviled and even burned publicly by rural retailers who had been cheating the farmers for so many years, became known fondly as the "Wish Book" and was a favorite in households all across America.</p>
<p>Ward's catalog soon was copied by other enterprising merchants, most notably <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_W._Sears_d8e4.html" title="Richard W. Sears">Richard W. Sears</a>, who mailed his first general catalog in 1896. Others entered the field, and by <a href="../../../1/9/7/1971.html" title="1971">1971</a> catalog sales of major U.S. firms exceeded more than $250 million in postal revenue. Although today the <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sears_Tower_1d9d.html" title="Sears Tower">Sears Tower</a> in Chicago is the United States's tallest building, there was a time when Montgomery Ward's headquarters was similarly distinguished. The Montgomery Ward Tower, on the corner of Michigan Avenue and Madison Street in Chicago, reigned as a major tourist attraction in the early-<a href="../../../1/9/0/1900s.html" title="1900s">1900s</a>.</p>

<p>Ward fought for the poor people's access to Chicago's lakefront. In 1906 he campaigned to preserve <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grant_Park_%28Chicago%29_a6fd.html" title="Grant Park (Chicago)">Grant Park</a> as a public park. <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Burnham_0f09.html" title="Daniel Burnham">Daniel Burnham's</a> famous 1909 <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burnham_Plan_8454.html" title="Burnham Plan">Burnham Plan</a> eventually preserved Grant Park and the entire Chicago lakefront.</p>

<p>Montgomery Ward died in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a>, at the age of 69. His wife bequeathed a large portion of the estate to Northwestern University and other educational institutions. Despite the collapse of its catalog and department stores in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgomery_Ward_%26_Co._4ad1.html" title="Montgomery Ward &amp; Co.">Montgomery Ward &amp; Co.</a> still adheres to the once unheard philosophy of "satisfaction guaranteed" as an <a href="../../../o/n/l/Online_retailer.html" title="Online retailer">online retailer</a>.</p>
