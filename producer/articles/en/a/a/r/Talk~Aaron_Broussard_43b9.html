<p>As I read this wiki entry on January 24, 2006, it contains a section that reads:</p>
<p>Finally all of the Jefferson Parish residents were appalled by Broussard’s performance on MSNBC where a tearful Broussard recounted a tale about the death of the Jefferson Parish Emergency Management’s mother. This story was in fact wrong and contrived with people reporting that Broussard was practing crying before his appearance. Source: <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9179790/" class="external free" title="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9179790/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9179790/</a></p>
<p>The website linked to is actually just the transcript of the MSNBC appearance. I can provide sources for the allegations that Broussard contrived the story and practiced crying and I stand by this statement as fact.</p>

<p>Why are the links to transcripts on Thinkprogress.org and informationclearinghouse.info necessary? This appears to me to be a ploy by a leftist to get this article linked to a liberal site when it is not necessary.</p>
<p>The MSNBC Link of the transcript is from the original media outlet that Broussard appeared on and should be necessary.</p>
<p>In addition, I find it interesting that Meet the Press did not mention that Broussard is a Liberal Democrat, as documented in Google searches done with his name. (<i>unattributed edit by <a href="../../../a/g/g/User%7EAggieSpirit_b7b3.html" title="User:AggieSpirit">User:AggieSpirit</a></i>)</p>

<dd>I'd vote for inclusion. It seems like a significant item about the guy. It would be nice if there was more detail, rather than the not-quite-NPOV "drawn in". I mean, a person could be subpoenaed and "drawn into" a corruption probe without being even suspected of having done wrong himself, merely because he (say) was deemed to have evidence that bears on the guilt or innocence of someone else. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Callender_e1e2.html" title="User:John Callender">John Callender</a> 21:12, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>On Thursday, 8 September 2005, CNN's Newsnight program aired an interview with Tom Rodrigue, the local government official who has been identified as the subject of Broussard's tearful story about the mother dying in the nursing home. Here's the <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0509/08/asb.01.html" class="external text" title="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0509/08/asb.01.html" rel="nofollow">transcript</a>:</p>
<dl>
<dd>COOPER: Yes. No, that's true. And especially when you consider CDC says -- I mean, there are high levels of E. Coli in this water. Some had worried about cholera in the water. That has not turned out to be the case. So, yes, we are lucky indeed, Aaron.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And, you know, every day, new numbers frame the story here in New Orleans. One of the grimmest numbers from yesterday was this: More than 30 bodies found inside a nursing home in St. Bernard Parish. Why weren't these people evacuated before the storm struck? That is a question that is both glaring and tonight remains unanswered.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here's CNN's Susan Candiotti.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>SUSAN CANDIOTTI, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Tom Rodrigue is living a nightmare. He knew his 92-year-old mother, Eva, was in deep trouble. And he was helpless to get her out of harm's way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>TOM RODRIGUE, VICTIM'S SON: We've had numerous storms before, and they know that, if they evacuate, she needs to go with them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>CANDIOTTI: His mother, Eva Rodrigue lived, and apparently died, with more than 30 others in St. Rita's Nursing Home, which was flooded after Katrina swept into New Orleans. Some were evacuated, but many were not moved to safety in time and drowned.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>RODRIGUE: She didn't have Alzheimer's. She knew who people was. She remembered things. And she could still get around on a walker. So she wasn't an invalid, you know? So she could move around.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>CANDIOTTI: Tom Rodrigue, himself a former emergency management director for Louisiana's National Guard, was out of town when Katrina turned toward New Orleans. He started calling the nursing home Saturday, urging that it be evacuated.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>RODRIGUE: You know, they indicated they were not going to leave. CANDIOTTI: Sunday night, as Katrina struck, Rodrigue was 30 miles away directing emergency personnel for Jefferson Parish. He called the nursing home in St. Bernard Parish again, pleading with officials to get the residents out. He was told they were going to try.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>RODRIGUE: I called the St. Bernard officials again and, you know, told them that, you know, they've got to get, you know, these people out. And they said they notified them, and that they weren't -- they refused to leave. And I said, "Well, you need to send the sheriff's office down there and make them leave." And he said, "I'm doing everything I can."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>CANDIOTTI: On Wednesday, 10 days after Katrina struck, authorities began removing bodies from St. Rita's Nursing Home. Eva Rodrigue's remains have not yet been found.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>CNN has been so far unable to reach the nursing home owners to find out whether they had an evacuation plan and if the workers did all they could to clear the place out. CNN reviewed St. Rita's records on the state's web site. It indicates the home's license expired last July, but we couldn't reach state authorities to confirm that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For Tom Rodrigue, the pain is overwhelming.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>RODRIGUE: She may not have been able to withstand the ordeal, even if they would have rescued her. But she deserved the chance, you know, to be rescued, instead of having to drown like a rat.</dd>

<p>In an attempt to make the article less cute in terms of tap-dancing around the issue of Broussard's honesty, I've modified the editorial comments on the possibility of the mother surviving the Monday flooding, and am now just saying that mainstream media sources have offered no explanation for the apparent discrepancy between Broussard's account and the reporting on the St. Rita's nursing home deaths. I'm not sure what else we could say that would be true to the Wikipedia spirit; if the facts as reported point pretty strongly in one direction (that Broussard was lying for political purposes), but no media sources are actually saying that, I guess it's not appropriate to push that point of view on Wikipedia. But maybe someone else will have a clearer idea of how to address the issue. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Callender_e1e2.html" title="User:John Callender">John Callender</a> 22:07, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>For an article supposedly on Aaron Broussard, it is very thin on information about him. For example, when and where was he born? How long has he been President of Jefferson Parish? Did he do anything of note or hold any poltical offices before Katrina? Is there anything like a biography of him on the web?

<dd>As no one else bothered to do it despite dozens of edits, I added a birth date and a bit of other biographical information about Aaron Broussard to the article about Aaron Brousard. -- <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfrogmation_bc10.html" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> 00:24, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I reversed the edits made by 35.11.147.205 on 2 April 2006, 07:11, primarily because of their non-NPOV, but also because of other significant errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>The editor altered a direct quote from a PACE article under "Pre-Katrina events" - it was written in the present tense and he changed it to past tense.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Removed the false and non-NPOV claim "With exception of the day he quoted everything Broussard said has proven true." The day of Eva Rodrigue's death was incorrect. The days of the phone calls were incorrect. Some of the other claims he made have been disputed, and have certainly not been *proven*.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The claim that the "Jefferson Parish Action Committee" opposes all criticism the Federal Government's response appears rather absurd and is not supported in any way. Their web site appears to contain only anti-Broussard material.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The editor added multiple words like "alleges" and "claims" to the list of charges made by JPAC. JPAC did not charge that he allegedly did these things -- it charged that he did them. It may not have been clear that these were supposed to be charges made by JPAC, so I bulleted the list of charges.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Without explanation, the editor changed the amount of the purchased ads from $38,000 to $4,000, even though the cited TP article says $38,000, so I reverted that.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The edits made to the JPAC charges concerning appropriation of private property are unintelligible and do not agree with the JPAC web site. I reverted them.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also removed the non-NPOV claim made by 72.150.1.19 on 10 January 2006, 23:04, that Broussard claimed that FEMA would pay for the TP ads "in an attempt to deceive the voters of Jefferson Parish". If the editor has some hidden insight into Broussard's motives, he should provide a citation.</p>
