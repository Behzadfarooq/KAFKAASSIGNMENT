<p>Aarchiba: Thanks for copyediting my article. It's always good to have a native speaker go over one' English, and I actually learn something from it&#160;;-) Next project bould be to write something about this other radioactive waste accident, where they melt a cobalt source with scrap metal to make beams.

<p>I'm impressed. You're very knowledgable about the various systems of Kali/Escrima, as well as inosanto and JKD. You basically wrote up all the stuff I was too lazy to&#160;:-).

<dd>Well, thanks. I don't really know all that much, but the school I train in teaches several different systems of kali, so I know maybe a little more about how they relate to each other.

<dd>Well, it would be nice to have some picture for "C programming language"; an example of what C code looks like would be nice to have; this is short and standard. If you really think there's no point to it, I can take it off the page, but it does seem handy. (And if the article is to be on the front page, a picture is probably necessary; it need not be in the article.)</dd>
<dd>What is the standard way of writing hello.c? Is it more correct to define it to return int but just fall off the end of the function? Does it also need to take but ignore its arguments? Sorry, it's been a while since I used C much. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarchiba_0a61.html" title="User:Aarchiba">Andrew</a> 10:43, Apr 27, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Um, that was silly; I didn't notice the presence of "hello.c" in the article text. I'll fix the code to match; feel free to take the image off the page if you think that's appropriate. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarchiba_0a61.html" title="User:Aarchiba">Andrew</a></dd>

<dd>I'm pretty sure that <tt>main</tt> in C will return the evaulation of the last statement you execute, without an explicit return or if you declare a function <tt>void</tt>, which means that <tt>main</tt>'s return status will be basically undefined - because of this, when you are using a function returning <tt>void</tt> you ignore what that function returns (because you are never using or depending upon it). But the environment you're running a C program in <i>does</i> use the program's return type (<tt>main</tt>'s return type indicates error status), so giving it some random rubbish is not a Good Thing to do!&#160;:)</dd>
<dd>I don't think you need to create an explicit picture of "Hello World". Here's some code that does a similar thing (look at the wikitext)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>That works, more or less, but it hangs out the right-hand side of the box, it doesn't do syntax highlighting, and it's much bigger (on my monitor). But it may be more appropriate for the C page. I'll keep the picture around in any case for use on the front page, if appropriate; should we take this to <a href="../../../c/_/p/Talk%7EC_programming_language_1acc.html" title="Talk:C programming language">Talk:C programming language</a>? --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarchiba_0a61.html" title="User:Aarchiba">Andrew</a> 11:01, Apr 27, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>There are obvious problems with using divs, which could be fixed by futzing with the div width (one could probably get better results with the new table image syntax, but it's probably getting to be too much effort for it's worth), but you could achieve syntax highlighting by using &lt;font color="..."&gt; tags (I think syntax highlighting's ugly anyway&#160;;)...</dd>
<dd>I don't see much problem with the image now, now that you've fixed it&#160;:) <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysprosia_bc6d.html" title="User:Dysprosia">Dysprosia</a> 11:14, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yack. I really don't want to go through and highlight everything manually, make sure the div fits, and so on... I think barring objections over on <a href="../../../c/_/p/Talk%7EC_programming_language_1acc.html" title="Talk:C programming language">Talk:C programming language</a> I'll put the (fixed!) picture back.

<p>Thanks for digging into this! You don't know how hard it is to find teeter totters on playgrounds any more, or jungle gyms, or lots of what *I* think of as play equipment because they're all so "unsafe". Nice photos, too; we can probably come up with some generic playground climing equipment article name but I'm not sure what. <a href="../../../e/l/f/User%7EElf_e89c.html" title="User:Elf">Elf</a> | <a href="../../../e/l/f/User_talk%7EElf_54a3.html" title="User talk:Elf">Talk</a> 03:25, 28 Apr 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I live in a somewhat dubious neighborhood, so I think it's the last to get converted to newer playground equipment. The lighting in the pictures is not great, partly because it's still grey and cold here and partly because in the nice weather they're all filled with kids (and I don't think I should put kids' pictures on the public without getting model release forms from their parents...) But it's a good time of year to take walks and to take pictures of things. Next visit to the local playground I can get one of those fort/slide/bridge things and a set of big kid swings. I haven't seen a merry-go-round in ages, though. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarchiba_0a61.html" title="User:Aarchiba">Andrew</a> 03:39, Apr 28, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"Montreal has a number of other ethnic districts, including the Latin Quarter. Some regions (separate cities until the merger) are also almost entirely anglophone, including Westmount and the West Island."</p>
<p>In a sense, I would normally say that the Latin Quarter, which is around the former downtown buildings of Université de Montreal and the present day-buildings of UQAM, is more of a cosmopolitan zone than an area filled with one particular ethnic group. In fact, with the recent expansions of UQAM it is mostly filled with students! Westmount is largely anglophone but it is not the WASP enclave it once was (just go by their seventh day adventist church on sundays or their synagogues on any feast day or wedding day), and the West island is a patchwork of French and English language areas with a very relative and variable English majority.</p>
<p>And on top of that the whole paragraph seems more suited up in the intro next to the other notes on language and culture than in the section of places. I am befuddled. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlainV_3261.html" title="User:AlainV">AlainV</a> 03:54, 2004 May 4 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You're quite right; now that you point it out, I don't really know what to do with it either. Maybe it should be ditched; I only put it in to make the Chinatown thing not seem so out of place.

<p>Hi Andrew -</p>
<p>Just wanted to let you know I added a whole chunk of text on Sierra Sam to fill a history void, and did a second copyedit. For the most part, I was comfortable with your edits - as I say on the talk page, when I marvel at my turn of phrase and it turns out to be someone else's, I gotta say "great job!". Anyway, if you wouldn't mind taking another look at it, I'd appreciate a review. Thanks. Oh, and BTW, I like your idea for a Six Degrees of Freedom project. Wiki has several different projects going, and I think you might run this one past <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a> to see if it's doable. Seems to me I remember something a while back -- someone had a long list of six-degree links on a talk page somewhere. I consider Angela our best admin -- head locked on solid, super reasonable. <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwindrim_6e1c.html" title="User:Dwindrim">Denni</a> 05:36, 2004 May 7 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don't know about much better, but I took the picture before I ever looked at yours, only to discover that I had stood probably less than a hundred feet from where you must have stood to take the picture. But it's a litte less obstructed and more cropped, and the resolution is higher, so I thought it'd be okay. I went back there today, so I have a few more pictures, but the wall of crutches was candlelit so the picture didn't turn out.

<dd>I don't know either what kind was being washed up; I went out looking to confirm the story in the article and found only a few of those.

<p>You commented that you would like to vote for the <a href="../../../w/e/a/Weather_lore.html" title="Weather lore">Weather lore</a> pictures as a group, but they were not all in large, copyright-free form. Some are; I did not self-nominate any of these; I simply provided them for someone else who asked so that he could. I am happy to have my pictures nominated, of course, and would be willing to provide said larger images (I use a cc-by-sa release) at about 400x600 pixels - how does that sound? Some are improved over what is currently in the article; I've just been doing some image filing and have run across originals of some of these, so no longer have to work from third or fourth generation prints. If you feel that (a) it would be politically correct, and (b) that my work in doing so has a reasonable chance of reward (it looks to be so), then I would happily take the time to contribute these new images. <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwindrim_6e1c.html" title="User:Dwindrim">Denni</a> 18:15, 2004 May 22 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good point. TV antennas are another area where Yagi's get mixed-in with log-periodics, trapped elements, corner reflectors and just about any other trick the designers can think of.

<p>I understand your concern that the article on the many worlds interpretation in its current state is hard to read (maybe even incomprehensible), and your effort at making an improvement is really commendable, given the nature of the article and the material. However, I think some of the statements you made were incorrect (for instance the theory doesn't try to explain superposition); since it would be very difficult to correct them in a systematic way, I reverted it. However, I do think your input is important to produce a readable and comprehensible article. What we should do is try to improve the intro, explaining the point of the whole theory.</p>
<p>Maybe we can discuss improvements on the talk page to Many worlds. I've added some comments there already.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hey Andrew. Thanks for giving me the heads up about verifying the New York State Government guidelines on releasing material to the public domain. I was wondering if you could point me in the right direction to go about researching this?

<dl>
<dd>The short answer is that the images are almost certainly not in the public domain any more than those on microsoft.com.</dd>
<dd>For any one website, you can go looking for a statement of copyright or of usage permission; if you don't find one, you can't use it (except possibly for fair use). They're often stashed with the privacy statement. Failing that, you can email one of the contact addresses for the website.</dd>
<dd>For the government in general, I don't really know where to look for copyright policy, but some googling would find an official declaration if one exists on the Web. Also a possibility would be looking for webmaster contact addresses on the state's official site. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarchiba_0a61.html" title="User:Aarchiba">Andrew</a> 06:00, Apr 11, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We can change it back if you like, but those are at the resolution they actually occur in the PDF (obtained with pdfimages), rather than rescaled to some higher resolution.

<li>Do I need to create an account on the Commons to Submit pictures?</li>
<li>Do I need to recreate the voting page from the the Wikipedia FPC on the commons, or can I insert the templete alread on the FPC here and have it work in the commons?</li>

<p>Hello. Looking back in the history of the article <a href="../../../p/o/l/Pollution.html" title="Pollution">Pollution</a>, I believe you might have added mention of the slogan: "Solution to Pollution is Dilution" back in 2004. There was recently a deletion of this text and I reinserted it as I thought it was quite relevant and descriptive of an older way of thinking. Trying to corroborate the specific assertion that it was taught in schools, I thought I should ask what you might cite as a source for it? -thanks, <a href="../../../o/n/c/User%7EOnceler_94a0.html" title="User:Onceler">Onceler</a> 20:20, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm afraid not - I heard it from a roommate. I'm not quite sure I put it in, rather than copied it from elsewhere in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarchiba_0a61.html" title="User:Aarchiba">Andrew</a> 02:18, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In a nuclear meltdown, the fuel rods in the core of the reactor simply melt. They do not have to melt through the ground to the water table, although this is a chief concern in the event of one.</p>

<p>Hey, are you still hanging around Wikipedia? I hope so... anyway, I have a question. In Turbulence.jpg, what exactly are we looking at? It's a compelling picture, but I can't tell just what it's a picture of. What's the black thing? Is that water? Is it in three dimensions or two? Which way is up? Is that the sky? And so forth...

<p>It appears that on April 27, 2004 you introduced this paragraph in the article <a href="../../../r/a/d/Radionuclide.html" title="Radionuclide">radionuclide</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... When radioactive carbon, for example, is in the atmosphere, it rapidly becomes separated from its decay products. Once it is bound up in a solid, such as wood or paper, its decay products must remain in place. So by measuring how much of these decay products has accumulated, one can estimate the time when the carbon was captured into solid form. ...</p>

<p>I wish to refer to it but I need a direct reference. Can you please tell me which was the source of the quoted statement?</p>
