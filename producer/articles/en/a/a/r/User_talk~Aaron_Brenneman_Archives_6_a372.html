<p>Thank you! Thank you! for clearing out DRV. The closure above was a bit strange as the page in question redirects to protected empty page <a href="../../../u/s/e/Userbox.html" title="Userbox">Userbox</a>. It should redirect to <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUserboxes_3753.html" title="Wikipedia:Userboxes">Wikipedia:Userboxes</a> (I think.) I'd do this myself, but apparently <a href="../../../u/s/e/Userboxes.html" title="Userboxes">Userboxes</a> remains protected too -- or, at least, I can't edit it. Hence, this gets laid in your able lap.&#160;:) Best wishes, <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 05:38, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I have requested peer review of this article because I intend to request Feature Article status and have made numerous changes regarding feedback from administrators and contributors. Once again, boobydoop and mikeandike have reverted the article to a version several months old. these users are not logging in but sockpuppeting to revert. Administartor Sceptre has reverted the first revert, yet, they summarily ignored his reversion to my last edit with one several months old, summarily wiping out all of my work.

<p>Aaron,</p>
<p>About a year ago, there was extensive discussion as to whether or not failed or minor-party candidates were inherently notable enough for inclusion on Wikipedia. The consensus/compromise decision was that such candidates did not deserve separate bio pages, but that list pages would be acceptable. There is now a fairly well-established Wikipedia precedent in favour of allowing such pages, and several pages of this sort in fact exist on the project.</p>
<p>I recognize that not everyone will find the histories of CHP candidates important, but I don't believe there's any due cause for deletion here. I would request that you reconsider your afd request.</p>
<p>I hasten to add that I have nothing to do with the CHP, and that I do not support their ideology. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 04:41, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If you're not convinced of the notability of these pages, could I at least request that you defer from adding more to afd until the current discussions are resolved? <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 05:16, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>As nicely as possible, this is really not the place for this discussion. I nominated the second page simply as a result of the faulty logic displayed by <i>"we can't delete <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foo.html" title="Foo">Foo</a> if we keep <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar.html" title="Bar">Bar</a>."</i> That line of reasoning is simply <b>begging</b> for Bar to be deleted, and I'm only happy to comply. If people keep using equally deleteable articles as reasons to keep, I'll keep nominating them. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000">brenneman</font></a><span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="#000000" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 05:33, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Regarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pat_Robertson&amp;diff=48956329&amp;oldid=48942666" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pat_Robertson&amp;diff=48956329&amp;oldid=48942666" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, and other similiar ones. I don't see the purpose of this. I think converting to "&lt;references&gt;/&lt;ref&gt;" is great *if* you're going to include all the relevant source information, such as the article title, author, and date. This is very useful for articles, where the url goes, and informing readers who we base our info on (without making them visit the place); and is the reason for this approach. For instance "&lt;ref&gt;<a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1058/is_22_116/ai_55670890" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1058/is_22_116/ai_55670890" rel="nofollow">www.findarticles.com</a>/&lt;ref&gt;" is useless. It doesn't even say the name of the publication ("FindArticles" is essently the equivilent of a library carrying a magazine, and <i>Christian Century</i> is what should be named). If this link dies, we have nothing. Now, I certainly don't expect you to personally add all the information to these references, as it's not your job to fix what others did. But, I suggest, instead of changing all these links, in multiple articles: doing it completely for just one or a few links would actually be more useful, and other people can fix the other links. To be clear, you didn't make things worse. I just don't see how it makes things better. -<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 06:33, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>That's a fair question. I tend to do this a lot whenever I see an article with more than a few external links in the text as "references." Often it's just the same page six times, and using the "ref" method makes this explicit. It also gives licence to cull the (sometimes long) list of <i>other</i> external links. I'll dig up an example, but as for now are you going to be bothered if I keep doing it? Because I have a few edit windows open right now...<br />

<dd>I'm sorry that your wikilove is dropping. I'd have thought that my preference for a leaner encyclopedia was well known, and if you do some wikistalking <i>*hint* look for edit summaries with "spam" in them*</i> you'll see that I'm not so much screaming for deletion as looking for reasons to keep.</dd>
<dd>As to why: I like consistancy and order, and feel that (particularly with regards to Canadia) there is systemic bias out the arse. These pages aren't so much listings of election results as holding grounds on the order of "They'd get chucked out in thirty seconds otherwise." Additionally, every nomination for deletion is a little experiment, testing (and retesting) consensus. In this deletion debate I'm about 85% certain that we're seeing a strongly biased sample, but it looks like the only sample to be had right now.<br />
Don't be a stranger.<br />

There's a section a few up from this one where I've left myself a note to complete the job. It's a bit unusual for a fairly obscure article llike this to have been recreated so quickly, but *shrug* that's what I get for leaving the job half done. I'll fix it up, thanks for letting me know.<br />

<dd>I fail why this has caused so much controversy. I have not removed any content from the article and do not intend to any time soon. I do not understand why the article was reverted to its uncited version after it was split into two articles. I did mention on the article's talk page that as the article "List of shock sites/Uncited" was now redundant due to this needless and undiscussed revert, I would redirect it to this article, though I did not mention the name change, which I felt to be insignificant. If someone insists on reverting the name change, I will let it be. If the fact that I inserted Brenneman's tag from the previous article into this one (which mentioned something about deletion) is what has made you angry, you should be happy to know that I altered it so that it read that the article <b>may</b> be deleted after sources have been cited and content imported to the cited list of shock sites, now found on the <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_site.html" title="Shock site">Shock site</a> page (and even if that occured, the content would remain intact, so it would not make a difference; it would just be transferring content from one area to another, not a true deletion). I have also created a link at <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shock_site.html" title="Shock site">Shock site</a> to this article which has an explanation of the current situation written beside it. - Conrad Devonshire 03:14, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's caused controversy because everyone was trying to stop the edit warring. You're an increadibly disruptive user, and you ignore everyone else in your desperate attempts to hide the information. I don't see how blanking an article is not removing content, either. It appears to me that Devonshire does not intend to abide by the truce you have proposed, Mr. Brenneman. It also appears as if you do not intend to block him in accordance with it. Since there are no double standards, I see no reason to restrain myself any longer.--<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrimetime_bbeb.html" title="User:Primetime">Primetime</a> 05:15, 22 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>I'm telling you that you're wasting your time! The new references don't give the page numbers and when people add new references, they have to retype the information all over again! Several of the references have the same number, so readers have to look at the list, then look back, count the number of references with the same number to figure out the letter, then look back at the list again!

<p>Were they aimed at me, or at Zoe?

<dd>There were lots of other options that you didn't have a go at. Zoe's talk page would have been a good place to <i>start</i> as opposed to notifying her after the fact. The article talk page(s) would have been a a good choice as well.</dd>

<dd>All that aside, it was unacceptably curt of me to comment in the manner that I did. I should have given you more credit for trying to do the right thing. I was scandalised by the "two wrongs make a right" logic I saw in your posts, but my incivility didn't help. I apologise.</dd>

<dd>Actually I had entered the conversation at DR hours earlier, but that was a totally unrelated issue, AFAICT. As for requests for unprotection - I'd say that, given the edit-warring over that article, page protection was probably in order - just not page protection by one of the edit-warriors, and protection a page <i>after</i> reverting is totally out of place.</dd>

<dd>I realise that the best course of action would have been to post a comment on her talk page and wait for her to do the right thing, but based on her past actions (deleting the page after it closed "no consensus", re-deleting the page when it was restored; making no reply to my previous question about her use of rollback) there's no reason to believe that she would have been the least moved. Her latest actions, edit warring on a protected page, shows that she has no interest in behaving like a member of the community. Oh well.

<p>Hi Aaron. I've been involved in a long-running dispute over the article on <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Brignell_b7e2.html" title="John Brignell">John Brignell</a> with User:Engjs who also edits using an IP address 125.255.16.233. Engjs takes the view that anyone critical of Brignell should not be allowed to edit the entry. (Apart from trying to push this view he does not contribute to Wikipedia). He took this claim to arbitration (following unsuccessful mediation) and was rejected, and has now resorted to regularly blanking all but the introductory paragraph of the page, stating that he plans to do this three times per day (the 3RR limit) and "If you don't like it, tough shit." I've made good faith attempts to deal with him, and much of the existing article was contributed by him, but all efforts have failed. I thought it might be a good idea to ask someone uninvolved to take a look, and, if you agree with my assessment that his conduct is unacceptable, take steps to warn him to change his ways and, if necessary, block him. If you see some merit in his position, I'll certainly take your views seriously. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 05:14, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I could suger-coat this but here's the straight dope: I think that the close was sub-optimal at best. An incrediably contentious and multiply discussed and debated article and you've gone with vote counting? Its more than a little bit important that we help people to understand two things: <b>1)</b> AfD isn't a vote becasue we're not a democracy, and <b>2)</b> Some things aren't open to debate, like verification.</p>
<p>Your close tells the <i>opposite</i> story. Would you be willing to un-close this?</p>

<dd>I've also been looking a bit closer at the keep comments and all but nineteen appear to be, well, outside the norm. "It exists and everyhere already lost it," "not hurting anything,"I don't have any sources," "I learned to play... at camp." If this goes to deletion review it will be a god-aweful mess, but if we stick to policy there's no problem: A single source in a non-english language that is only available by subscription does not pass the verification requirement. Actually, we don't have to go part the first phrase, as multiple reliable sources are the baseline. So I'm switching from <i>"would you please"</i> to <i>"ultra strong lesbian penguin begging"</i> for you to re-think this close. If you're not comfortable with making a Hai2U-style close yourself, just rollback and let someone else look it over.</dd>

<dd>FWIW, I agree with Brenneman, though for a different reasoning. The reason for overturning the third AfD was supposed to be the 'De Morgen' newspaper "source".

<p>Oh dear. That is a fairly significant weakness in Cite. I haven't seen a workaround. The obvious method is to make a template like the one I just deleted, {{Multiref}}, but that doens't work because you can't pass template arguments to the extension. I haven't seen a workaround, I'm afraid. Perhaps the only option is to use an alternative footnote style. Or, perhaps, to establish the possibly-useful convention that page numbers to a multiply-used reference should be done in the way you suggests. It's a pretty sensible solution that would also minimise the work needed when Cite is eventually fixed up. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 13:39, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Howdy Aaron,</p>
<p>I'd almost think you were trying to get my attention.&#160;:) We've discussed this before, gently, and I'll take up the matter again, gently. With respect, I'd suggest that (even considering your own nation's history with indigenous people), you are not in position to evaluate the daily lives of folks of color in the Americas. In the Western Hemisphere generally, and the US particularly, the long history of slavery, constituting the greatest forced migration of people in recorded time, has scarred the psychology of just about everybody. This is not to <i>excuse</i> Deeceevoice, for I'm sure she can be abrasive, but her intent is a sound one -- to bring a differing, legitimate perspective in an effort to counter a systemic bias inherent not just in Wikipedia, but in most written works of history before very recent years. I think your comment above is an overgeneralization at best, and it is certainly grossly inapplicable to my own lived experience. If you'd like to carry on an extended discussion of race, my email is open. Best wishes always, <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 15:52, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Pardon the buttinksi here, and you do have a point, but I think Aaron had one too. People to whom race is a very important issue are a highly questionable bunch. If everything turns into a race issue for some person, the problem is more likely with that person than with the world in general. Yes, racism clearly exists- among people who are mentally ill. Racism should never be responded to with more racism, that's how the whole thing got started in the first place. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 16:11, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I must say, it's a pleasure to have a little Xoloz on my talk page again! It's been too long. There's a conflation of three issues here: DCV's attitude about race, the attitudes of those she interacts with, and <i>the shared perception</i> of these attitudes. I was not attempting to touch upon the first two in any way. I'll do that now, but only to highlight that it's the final issue that's the important one.</p>
<p>DCV makes it clear that race in important to her. I not only do not but probably <i>cannot</i> fully understand her race-thoughts. That doesn't mean that I think that they aren't well founded: It's just crazy<sup>1</sup> and alien to me. Thus I agree fully with your assessment here. But her POV is unabashed, and despite her bull-in-a-china-shop approach I'm always a sucker for a maverick. I've got a sweet spot for her, and my early efforts on her (first?) RfC were predicated by thinking that she could be a highly valuable asset to Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Zoe is the most ham-fisted, brute-force, kill-them-all-and-let-god-sort-them-out admin we've got. She's almost always right, too, but that's not why I love her. I've never seen the slightest indications that she cares about race. The fact that I like Zoe and make jokes with her doesn't mean I think that she's right, just that I can understand her motivations.</p>
<p>Any interaction between these two was going to be spectacular. But if DCV fails to understand that Zoe's worldview is <i>not like hers</i> than any succesful resolution is unlikely. If we fall back to my history with Nicodemus75, something similar occured: He assumed based upon <i>his</i> experiances that I was concerned about his race.</p>
<p>Old habits die hard. DCV may have a long history of interactions with people who actually are racist, misogynist, or both. But if that leads her to seeing these things when they <i>aren't there</i> then there's a problem. For her, and for everyone who come across her.</p>
<p>Thanks for caring enough to come and drop me a note, <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000">brenneman</font></a><span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="#000000" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 00:38, 21 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><small>1. As in "whimsically strange; odd".</small></p>

<dd><small>Well, your motive is fine, and your point is good, but... let me try to explain it this way. (I'll speak on DCV's behalf here as an apologist, because I have a history of trying to explain "blackness" to whites and vice versa, but I don't know how much of what I say represents her.) My guess that DCV has a very fine "bullshit detector" when it comes to talking to whites about race, probably with good reason, as she has likely encountered many white Southerners in her time. Whatever points you're trying to get across to her, avoid inaccuracies and overbroad statements, because she'll find them, and use them to undermine your credibility in her eyes. Be very careful, and recognize that she is likely justified (in general) in her suspicions, born of a lifetime of living under racism. You haven't suggested any defense for the statement that I highlighted to begin this exchange: I don't see one, anyway. With DCV, modulate language precisely, and avoid phrases that suggest race is irrelevant or unimportant. By no means should race be the focus of <i>everything</i>, but neither (thanks to the evils of racism) should it be ignored. DCV is not a NPOV person, and her edits are going to run afoul of WP policies more often than usual, but her perspective is important, and her production prolific. You will gain her cooperation through empathy, not by saying that "race doesn't matter." When one has been degraded one's whole life for the color of one's skin, that well-meaning suggestion rings hollow, if not idiotic. If you, Aaron, are truly so removed from the experience of the American South, South America, and South Africa, places where race very much <i>does matter</i> (unfortunately), than you should have the good sense not to say very much.</small></dd>

<dd><small>Point two is DCV's "project" here, <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrocentrism.html" title="Afrocentrism">Afrocentrism</a>. Now, as it happens, I spent my academic life studying "white history" mostly, of the United States, as well as of Japan (long story), so I know pathetically little of African history outside of the modern era, despite my own African ancestors. I recognize, however, that Africa is the most likely "cradle of humanity", the place where the genus Homo, and our species, Sapiens, arose. The recent genetic work of <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalli-Sforza_26a3.html" title="Cavalli-Sforza">Cavalli-Sforza</a> only confirms this: humanity has lived on the African continent longer than anywhere else. Yet, since the rise of <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonialism.html" title="Colonialism">colonialism</a>, it is the Europeans and their descendants who have written most of the history books, at least those available to speakers of English, the modern global lingua franca. I am not an Afrocentrist, but I respect that the history of the continent is a narrative largely untold, or mistold by conquerors of white skin tone, who certainly did believe that race mattered. Work to recover the lost history of Africa is undergoing at many of America's finest universities (including my <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard.html" title="Harvard">alma mater</a>, until some recent disagreements sent most of our African studies faculty to <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton.html" title="Princeton">the enemy</a>. Whatever her deficits in interpersonal relations, DCV's field of interest is valid, and brimming with academic work at present. She doesn't deserve to be handled with <i>kid gloves</i> (nor would she want to be demeaned that way), but she will respond better if you engage her with this essential understanding of the importance of recovering African history, and of role of race in it. Again, race isn't <i>everything</i> (and it is, sociologically speaking, probably a <i>fiction</i>), but it does matter in studies of history, it matters to many folks today, and, by Jimbo, the study of it and its effect are certainly the domain of any responsible encyclopedia.</small></dd>

<dd><small>I do try, as much as possible, to avoid "saying very much" about things I don't know about. And please don't worry about being harsh with me, I can take it from you if from anyone. I re-read the post that (happily!) brought you back to my page, and I still believe it: Most of the people she's tarring with the broad brush don't give a rat's arse what colour she is. Or what colour <i>anyone</i> is as far as I can tell. I'm not trying to say that she's wrong to care about colour herself, but that she's wrong to think <i>everyone</i> does. I'm composing a note on her talk right now, and I will do my best to take everything you've said into my hat. Thank you again for your unending patience with my ignorance.</small></dd>

<p><small>No, one group is Licinius, <strike>NSWelshman</strike><small>The man from OZ</small>, J_is_me and now numerous abusive sockpuppets; the other group is Jebus Christ, Jimididit and NSWelshman. The latter group is the one that you wanted to reform, and we've hardly heard a peep out of these accounts this month. What's causing the confusion is some socks of Licinius are trading on my original belief that the two groups were one by trolling around claiming to be NSWelshman, even signing posts as NSWelshman. I have blocked Jisme indefinitely as a (self-confessed) troll sock of blocked user Licinius. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 07:36, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<p>I think you mean the first group was Licinius, J_Is_Me and now numerous sockpuppets.

<p>There is evidence presented <a href="../../../j/_/i/User_talk%7EJ_is_me_2c3e.html#As_Further_Evidence" title="User talk:J is me">here</a>, by Licinius of all people!, that Jebuschrist/NSWelshman/Jimididit is also <a href="../../../f/a/c/User%7EFactoid_Killer_8122.html" title="User:Factoid Killer">Factoid Killer</a>. On further investigation, the evidence is clear and incontrovertible. For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Australian_rules_football&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=28991848" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Australian_rules_football&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=28991848" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>, where FactoidKiller edits un-logged-in from the acknowledged <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aaron_BrennemanArchives/6&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=45850729" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aaron_BrennemanArchives/6&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=45850729" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> IP of Jebuschrist/NSWelshman/Jimididit, then logs in as Factoid Killer to change his signature.</p>
<p>Even when NSWelshman was apparently coming clean and owning up, he continued to claim that he never used his socks to stack the vote at <a href="../../../f/o/o/Talk%7EFootball_91b5.html" title="Talk:Football">Talk:Football</a>; this is now shown to be false, as both Factoid Killer and NSWelshman voted.

<li>(After two edit conflicts...) Bah, I was unblocking before you put the template up. I find it immensely silly that this went beyond a single revert. It shouldn't have. That's for both of you. Come on guys, we're all mature admins here. That was a <i>waaay</i> inappropriate block. No matter what the problem is, there is no excuse for a block that's punitive, not preventative. RFAr can function perfectly even with an edit war over a <i>section heading</i>. No warning was given and both blockers have been involved in previous arbitrations with Aaron. Please discuss this on the talk page, also. Absolutely unnecessary, all of it. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 04:31, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I too think it was a statement (an absolutely correct one, but nevertheless just a statement), not something official, and I see where you were going with changing the tagging to reflect that.

<p>Now many, many years ago, when I was twenty-three, I was married to a widow who was pretty as could be. This widow had a grown-up daughter who had hair of red. My father fell in love with her, and soon they, too, were wed.</p>
<p>This made my dad my son-in-law and changed my very life, My daughter was my mother, cause she was my father's wife. To complicate the matter, even though it brought me joy, I soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy.</p>
<p>My little baby then became a brother-in-law to Dad, And so became my uncle, though it made me very sad. For if he was my uncle, then that also made him brother Of the widow's grown-up daughter, who, of course, was my stepmother.</p>
<p>Father's wife then had a son who kept him on the run, And he became my grandchild, for he was my daughter's son. My wife is now my mother's mother, and it makes me blue, Because, although she is my wife, she's my grandmother, too.</p>
<p>Now if my wife is my grandmother, then I'm her grandchild, And everytime I think of it, it nearly drives me wild, For now I have become the strangest case you ever saw As husband of my grandmother, I am my own grandpa! --<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 03:23, 29 April 2006 (UTC) <b>=</b></p>

<p>Hi - Did you not notice the message from Hamilton, above? He's wondering what to do next.

<p>Thank you for getting back to me on this article. I am very open to the use of the footnote system, however I find the WP:footnote page somewhat confusing. My best learing on the site usually comes from observing really well written articles and observing their specific use of a particular format. If you could, I would appreciate it if you could point to a few articles you feel are great examples of proper use of the most current WP footnote procedure(s).I can see how this would be extremely helpful in specifically pointing a reader directly to a veried source rather than have to go through all links to find the cooresponding article for the section they may be looking to source. How do I resubmit this as an article once I place the finishing touches on it? I am anxious to improve my knowledge of proper format and acceptable or user friendly style so that I may help to improve some articles out there that I believe could be spruced up in certain music catagories. Thanks Again,</p>

<p>Hi Aaron, I was going through the entry on Data Warehouse (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse</a>) and I feel that a lot has to be added to it to make it useful. The information currently in there is not sufficient or detailed. I wish I knew enough about the subject to improve the entry.</p>
<p>Reading the Talk page (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Data_warehouse" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Data_warehouse" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Data_warehouse</a>) I figured that some other users have also found the information insufficient. However, I did find a lot of good links in the External Links section (which you have moved from the main DataWarehouse page to the Talk page).</p>
<p>I am sure that Data_Warehouse is a very important topic that a lot of readers like me would be exploring. However, very few of them would be going to the Talk page to find out about these links. I went through the Wikipedia policies for external links as well as recommended by you.</p>
<p>However I feel that in the absence of more robust content, we should at least let some of the useful External Links stay on the Data Warehouse page. Some of these links have a lot of good information that Wikipedia readers should be able to get easily on the main Data Warehouse page instead of the talk page (which a lot of people don't even know about).</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this? I'd think we should move the External Links back to the main page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not Aaron, and I don't even play him on TV, but users who want to find websites that have information on data warehousing are better served by Google than by Wikipedia.

Hmmm, well adminship renewal just isn't it. In several sports (chess, go), repetition of moves just leads to boredom. It won't actually make for a better game.</p>
<p>Same for discussions. Repeating the same discussion over and over won't ever actually resolve anything&#160;;-) You have to try for new ideas instead.</p>
<p>It helps to "think outside the box" from the outset.&#160;:-)</p>
<p>One thing that might help the diverse adminship discussions would be if people were to clearly write down what should be expected of admins, and gain some kind of consensus over it.</p>
<p>Mind you, I suspect that the first draft would require admins to be demigods... so it might need some tweaking&#160;;-)</p>

<p>I find your warning to be unnecessarily hostile and confusing. I've already received threatening email over this stupid matter, so I'm in no need of your attempt to kick me in the groin. I have no clue what you are referring to with "fox-hunting and similar antics". In short, I feel like you wrote to me just to be a dick.

<dd>I'm finding this new and <i>delicate</i> persona of yours some what off-putting. I liked it better when you were calling me an arsehole and telling me to either stay out of wikispace or preferably leave entirely. But, to be fair, I'm as changeable as the clouds myself. Anyway, I'd listed the "antics" that I was referring to on your user page, but you chose to blank that. If you ever actually want to attempt to talk, as opposed to the startling combination of fabrication and obfuscation we've had to date, my talk page is always open and unblanked.<br />

<dd>The manner in which you've chosen to speak to me is completely unacceptable. Of course, this being wiki-space, there's very little I can do about it but to think that you are not a very nice person. You might take a <i>small</i> hint from your own message: Jimbo's daily dose of "bullshit" is delivered via high-pressure firehose, yet he still magages to respond to Primetime politely. If you are unable or unwilling to emulate him in this manner, it might be best if you confined yourself to Wikipedia activities for which lack of social skills are not a hinderance.

<p>I am honored by your support in my recent successful request for adminship. As an administrator, I am your servant, ready to help however I can. (In your case, since you've had the tools longer than I, my best use might be menial labor!) My talk page is always open; should you need anything, or should you see me making a mistake -- probably a common occurrence -- please do let me know.

<p>PSS. Without becoming involved specifically, I must also commend a comment of your not too far above this one for its gumption. I would lack the nerve and the wit to put things so incisively.</p>

<p>I can't manage the rhyming couplet; for that I apologize. I noticed that on mboverload's page you left a backhanded comment about Tony. I don't know what it is with you two and frankly I really don't care. But, as you said on the noticeboard, we have a responsibility as administrators to set a good example, and sniping at other users behind their backs really strikes me as inappropriate. Which isn't to say, of course, that I've never done it myself, but it's something I strive to avoid, and I hope other sysops do too.

<li>If the very small joke <i>"I'll block you if you do"</i> on User talk:Mboverload is what you're talking about, it takes a pretty good stretch to make that about Tony, as he's not the one who blocked that fellow.</li>
<li>If <i>"by playing tag-team with Tony you're hardly walking with the angels?"</i> on User talk:Cyde is what you're talking about... It's pretty mild, really. I could make a long list of vituperation that Tony's directed at me in the last few weeks <i>far</i> worse than that. However, in deference to your polite request, I shall attempt to moderate myself further in the future.<br />

<p>Greetings. I would like to thank you for trying to be bring some peace to the chaos. I would also like to ask you if there is anything that can be done to restore my userpage (long enough to modify it to <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde</a>'s liking). I feel it was unfair to delete it without warning first. I haven't tried to settle this with <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde</a> because frankly, I don't think he would listen (and I don't trust him).

<p>Your comments at <a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html#What.27s_the_point.2C_really.3F" title="User talk:Cyde">Cyde's talk page</a> are right on the money. Process is important. It's all we've got to make sure that the structure of this project changes in an orderly, consensual way. I never much cared about userboxes before, but, seeing how a small group of people have gone after them, I sure have changed my mind. They're my favorites, all of them. &#160;:-) I've asked Cyde to talk to me about these deletions, but received no response. Ignoring consensus like that simply brings more fighters to the battle, which is the last thing we need. OK, it's all out of my system. I'll step off my soapbox now. But, before I go, consider this entry from his <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Cyde_7ff4.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Cyde">request for adminship</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd just like to make one thing clear: I've never deleted a userbox and I don't forsee myself getting involved with that in the future. Why? Because I now realize that my actions weren't helping matters, so I've decided not to get involved with that anymore. There's plenty other stuff to do on Wikipedia. I'll leave the userboxes up to other people. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font style="background: #000000" face="Impact" color="#00A5FF">Cyde Weys</font></a> 20:43, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So, if he's leaving the userboxes up to other people, what is he doing effectively mass-deleting them, albeit one by one?--<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 19:09, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He answered already, I forget where, saying that his expectation was that "other people" would have solved the problem by now and when they did not, he felt it necesssary to step in and do what he thought was right. I can't necessarily fault him for that, doing what you think is right is a good thing, nor for what he thinks of the boxen (I've come around to that thinking myself). Where I think he's in the weeds is in the implementation, which is a bit dodgy.

<dd>Cyde &amp; I part company on the issue of userbox templates. I see this push as an attempt to solve a social/behavioral problem with a technological solution. Without getting into the <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a>, there are other ways of accomplishing the same kind of networking that those against userbox templates seem most vocal about. That's the way it's always been with using technology to regulate human behavior.

<dd>That said, here &amp; now my only issue is with Cyde's taking unilateral action while the rest of the community is trying to reach consensus. If he chops down all the userboxes, there won't be a point in having a userbox policy. Also, since userbox deletions are currently allowed, but userbox creations aren't, actions like Cyde's exacerbate the power imabalance between those favoring userbox deletion, and those favoring userbox retention. It's offensive to our community standards.--<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 22:03, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I will withdraw Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Steve block if you mediate us fairly and impartially. What else do I have to do to withdraw? Where are better (lower level) ways to handle something like this one? I tried RfC because I could not find somewhere else or another admin who would be willing to mediate.

<dd>I'm famously careful in mediation, and although I've worked with Steve before I'm about as impartial as they come. One thing I am not, however, is fast, so you may want to take that into consideration. I'll look over the history of it if you unlink it from the main RfC page. You can copy the body of it to my talk, and we'll work from there. Dropping him a note to make sure he agress to me mediating would be a good idea. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000">brenneman</font></a><span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="#000000" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 14:18, 21 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Mediation is probably an idea. It seems to me that wires have become crossed here, and I'd gladly offer an apology if that wasn't thought to be inappropriate. I had attempted to say that I wasn't being critical in any way, only that the tag which was used was an incorrect tag, although the fault for that was in the than in the user's actions. The problem seems to be in the conflicting advice at <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> and <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImages_and_media_for_deletion_08f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion">Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion</a>. Do I need to respond to the RFC or do I wait until it's been certified? I've never been through one before.</li>

<li>On the issue itself, I clearly failed to understand Jusjih's points, much as it appears he failed to understand or address mine. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJusjih_8bf7.html" title="User:Jusjih">User:Jusjih</a> came to me stating that the template appeared to suggest his usage was correct, I responded that the speedy criterion conflicted with this, and then we simply seemed to restate our positions to each other. I didn't fully understand the point <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJusjih_8bf7.html" title="User:Jusjih">User:Jusjih</a> was making at the time, that the two pieces of advice were conflicting. I had hoped that by pointing Jusjih to a forum where discussion relevant to our situation was being discussed would broaden out the discussion, allow Jusjih to better understand my angle on things and also allow a forum where other users could contribute. I still stand by the comment that anyone nominating an article or image for speedy deletion has the burden of proof on them to show why it meets one of the criterion at <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>. This, I believe, is established in the text at that page which states "These criteria are worded narrowly, and generally so phrased that, in most cases, reasonable editors will agree what does not or does not fall under a given criterion." The image does not meet any criterion listed on the page and so I feel I was correct to state that "the burden of proof is on you to show me how this meets any of the speedy deletion criteria". Had Jusjih simply told me he didn't wish the image deleted under the criterion, I would suggest this whole issue could perhaps have been avoided, and we could have explored other options, such as {{<a href="../../../f/a/i/Template%7EFair_use_disputed_0413.html" title="Template:Fair use disputed">fair use disputed</a>}} or listing the image at <a href="../../../i/f/d/WP%7EIFD_bb01.html" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a> and opening the discussion there. That said, I should have attempted better to seek a happier resolution. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 08:43, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
