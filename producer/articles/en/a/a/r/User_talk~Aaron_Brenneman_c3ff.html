<dd><b>The ballad of the really nasty snake</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>In an office sits a man</i></dd>
<dd><i>hands on his chin,</i></dd>
<dd><i>sad and upset because</i></dd>
<dd><i>the money is not in.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Really he has all the,</i></dd>
<dd><i>most wonderful wares</i></dd>
<dd><i>But no one will buy them 'cause,</i></dd>
<dd><i>nobody cares.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Nobody knows about,</i></dd>
<dd><i>the things he can sell</i></dd>
<dd><i>Adspace is really dear so,</i></dd>
<dd><i>things are not all well.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>But he has found a most,</i></dd>
<dd><i>wonderful <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">paradise</a>,</i></dd>
<dd><i>where everyone will see the pills.</i></dd>
<dd><i>that work so well on mice</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>A link to the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panacea_%28medicine%29.html" title="Panacea (medicine)">cure all pills</a>,</i></dd>
<dd><i>the powders and what's more?</i></dd>
<dd><i>Links to the frills and thrills,</i></dd>
<dd><i>his spirits start to soar!</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Anyone can add things here,</i></dd>
<dd><i>so why cannot he?</i></dd>
<dd><i>And really the best thing of all,</i></dd>
<dd><i>is that it is so free.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>But in this fruitful paradise</i></dd>
<dd><i>lies a nasty <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">snake</a></i></dd>
<dd><i>who kills and strikes at everything</i></dd>
<dd><i>the man leaves in his wake.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The poor links the cure all pills</i></dd>
<dd><i>the powders... Oh, my, my!</i></dd>
<dd><i>When the snake sets eyes on it,</i></dd>
<dd><i>we wave the links bye-bye.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>The snake in its malevolence,</i></dd>
<dd><i>to be really mean.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Tells people off for spamming more,</i></dd>
<dd><i>than any we have seen.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>And so poor old businessman,</i></dd>
<dd><i>who's sad tale I just sang.</i></dd>
<dd><i>He would have all the treasures now,</i></dd>
<dd><i>but for the snake's black fang.</i></dd>

<dd>Err, yes of course. However, since this was a page move requested by a user as "housekeeping" and no adminstratorial action was required in fixing up the <i>huge number</i> of redirects, I left a note on the user talk asking him if he minded doing the grunt work. I'm not anyone's slave, you know.<br />

<dd>A)They don't appear on article pages, B) They are on the list of "always transclude". I mean, what's going to happen, some user's warnings get altered? We're not expecting these templates to appear on the Virgin Mary's page, for goodness' sake. If you're concerned, get a bot to subst them. Otherwise, propose changes to the protection policy that expands protection.<br />

<dd>The only reason those templates haven't been shot to hell over is the fact that they were fully protected. What's the harm in protecting them, the chances of it needing changes are next to nil and they are vandal magnets. The template is still widely used (unsubsted) on many many pages. Do you know what hell it is for the job queue when someone changes it (especially if it's vandalism) -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 00:02, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, if you're worried about the job queue than run some python or use AWB to subst them all. The harm is that we do not protect things "just in case" when there is any other solution available. Which there is.<br />

<dd>There is <b>no harm</b> in protecting said pages. There is a major tradeoff here between resources (subst'ing templates by bot does eat up hard disk space and is generally discouraged due to load/diskspace issues) and the job queue on update is also a major resource hog -- <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 00:07, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Please, I was born at night but not last night. Disc space is cheap, almost free these days. The developers are dead clear that performance is their problem not yours. You're suggesting a problem, but are unwilling to accept the reonable solution: This template should always be substituted, there is no reason for it not to be subsituted, the tools exist for it to be easily substituted.

<dd>At the same time, you don't find out that the template is vandalized until you subst a monumental phallus on a poor sod's talk page. I have to agree with Tawker on {{<a href="../../../t/e/s/Template%7ETest_d929.html" title="Template:Test">test</a>}} (not really due to job queue concerns, but more due to the social costs of vandal templates), but not about the "remove when AFD is done" template.

<dd>Titoxd, I understand what you're saying, but you're still talking about <b>preventative</b> protection. Which we do only in extreme cases. "Test" gets used more than the neighborhood bike, and (leaving aside the question of hitting preview first) any vandalism to it will get reverted super-quick smart. And there <u>is</u> harm in protecting these pages: The more we use that tool when we don't need to, the less resistance there is to using it the next time.<br />

<li>About the Class templates: They are transcluded at least twice (often more) for every page listed on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Statistics_2d98.html" title="Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Statistics">Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Statistics</a>, so from a server load basis, these are painful. Last time I checked, sure, we're supposed to <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_worry_about_performance_45ae.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't worry about performance">not worry about performance</a>, but at the same time, <a href="../../../c/y/b/User_talk%7ECyberSkull_Archive_1_62ae.html#Regarding_Template:Cvgproj" title="User talk:CyberSkull/Archive 1">developers don't like us playing around with templates when we don't need to</a>, and this seems to me to be a case where the "if it's plain something could cause drastic problems, hold fire and check" clause the devs gave us applies.</li>
<li>Besides, these templates have a history: every time they're edited, as seen on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia_talk%7EVersion_1.0_Editorial_Team_Assessment_489f.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment">Wikipedia talk:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/a/Template_talk%7EGrading_scheme_b582.html" title="Template talk:Grading scheme">Template talk:Grading scheme</a>, there's an angry mob of users asking why they were modified. (Yes, even removing one word from two of the least-used templates sparked a talk page thread). We eventually had a fairly-long discussion about colors, and these particular values were selected. As a result, there really is no reason for anyone to come and edit the pages. So, having them unprotected is a bad idea, at least from my standpoint. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">xd</span></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 01:40, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Please do not delete this article. There appears to be some confusion with this band (from Ireland and in existence since 1989) and a band in the UK who are illegally operating under the same name; ‘The Hitchers’. I have added more release information and a link to the BBC John Peel Hitchers page and an NME review to help assuage any doubt as to the bone fides of the band. <a href="../../../a/i/r/User%7EAirwave_c0ba.html" title="User:Airwave">Airwave</a> 15:00, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Good job on list of Romanians. That list was really getting out of hand. A lot of people were just adding any University professor they could find.

<p>My biggest theoretical worry is that bad deletion is just as harmful to the wiki as bad inclusion. There are a lot of influences, recently, where people are taking up the kind of attutude warned against <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DisagreeByDeleting" class="external text" title="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DisagreeByDeleting" rel="nofollow">here</a>, the so-called "disagree by deletion". There are articles that should be deleted that don't get deleted and instead shuffled off to cleanup. There are articles that should be kept that get killed instead. SPEEDY deletions , in particular, are a source of worry for me, since some people don't know what they're doing. Any thoughts you have are very welcome. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 23:05, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ok, I've tried. It was really the lead that had seemed awkward to me, plus little ticky tacky things like extra spaces. The problem seems to be that there are two things being discussed in the article and all the articles that feed the article. On the one hand, we have the literal payaos, which is just a float and catch platform, and then the FAD, which is another kettle of fish altogether. It seems like the two terms have begun to take over each others' significance. The FAD is bad juju for fishes, but the payaos is no worse than a boy down at the ol' fishin' hole. If I'm right, then the article should say, flat out, "The payaos was initially a handline fishing platform. However, the term now encompasses all forms of FAD congregated together into a "fish house" arrangement. Therefore, although the traditional payaos had little to no demonstrable effect on fish stocks, commercial and artisan fisheries employing FAD's raise serious concerns about overfishing and over exploitation of natural resources." Something like that, if I'm right. If I'm wrong...well, it's just a normal day if I'm wrong. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 23:46, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aaron, I see you've been involved in Ophthalmology articles. I've created [[Category:WikiProject Ophthalmology articles]] to generate more interest and edits in Ophthalmology related articles. I think the whole area as far as categorising and disambigs are concerned is pretty much neglected. e.e why does laser eye surgery/treatment not have an article of its own? <a href="../../../f/r/u/User%7EFrummerThanThou_10f7.html" title="User:FrummerThanThou">frummer</a> 01:38, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>&lt;nose poking&gt;<br />
Goodness, it's getting hot in here, isn't it? Since this doesn't seem to be heading anywhere good anytime soon, and since I've already been called "meddlesome" more times than I can recall, I'm going to pipe up with a few comments: There can be no doubt that everyone involved here has the long-term good of the project at heart. &lt;Some|None|All&gt; of the parites may be woefully misguided, but no one is trying to screw anything up on purpose. Fair use is a thorny question, one that we alternate between over-reacting to and ignoring. I don't see much disagreement on it being complex and subjective. An equitable solution is unlikely at the pace we're going now. Descent into acrimony almost certainly precludes a positive outcome. Is there any way that this can be pulled back from the brink at all? That we can return to discussin it all "hip-hip, I say chap" -like and less "I spit on your grave" -ish?<br />

<dd>Thanks for your persistance with this. My two cents:
<dl>
<dd><b>.01</b> I'm the happy-fluffy-bunny kind of adminstrator when there is <i>any</i> chance that the person is simply new as opposed to malicious. "Banning" is what gets done to people who are either going out of their way to hurt the encyclopedia or have demonstrated (after a <i>long</i> time usually) that they do not work and play well with others. See the <a href="../../../b/a/n/Wikipedia%7EBanning_policy_2e63.html" title="Wikipedia:Banning policy">banning policy</a>.</dd>
<dd><b>.02</b> This user has at least once used their talk page saying "tell me how to follow the forms required" so try giving him the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">benefit of the doubt</a> and engage with him. First get him to use his talk page, then yours, get him to indicate that he's read the applicable policies and guidelines, etc. Just remember that <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">we were all n00bz once.</a></dd>

<dd>Once you've tried communication and it either hasn't worked or he hasn't responded, <i>then</i> it's time to move from the carrot to the stick. As it were. Sticking with the bunny theme, I mean.</dd>

<p>I recently had occasion to read your discussion with <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde</a> on <a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html#DRV_concerns" title="User talk:Cyde">his talk page</a>. I wanted to tip my hat to you for making a point about Cyde's approach (the white knight method) and what it implies about his evaluation of his beliefs versus others (or the community's). You approached the subject with a great deal of tact which I have heretofore been unable to successfully muster.</p>
<p>There's a recurring refrain in Cyde's actions, usually a variation on the idea that because what he's doing is "the right thing," process can be ignored. I've experienced this first-hand in some of his deletions, as well as his rearranging pages in my userspace, and in other areas. I think he acts from the best motives 99% of the time, but I think he is less successful at achieving a result that's good for the project as a whole, because of his penchant for ignoring <a href="../../../p/i/i/WP%7EPII_aa8e.html" title="WP:PII">established process</a> and community consensus.</p>
<p>I'm still smarting from my run-ins with him, which is why I'm all the more impressed by your approach and phrasing in broaching the subject with him. I felt that needed to be said. I don't think we take the time to let our fellow editors know when what they write is so <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civil</a> and devoid of even a scintilla of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attack</a> that it can only be described as impressive.

<p>I suppose one of the side-effects of using IRC so much is that it can look like I am doing things unilaterally or without discussion. I can assure you, I am not. I don't really think the "white knight" comparison is appropriate in this regard. As for Aaron ... I do not know why it is that I am <i>perpetually</i> butting heads with him, but I can assure all of the onlookers, we've both gotten quite good at it. I suspect it's more for show than for anything else — we've certainly gotten in enough practice such that nothing really incivil or disruptive is ever said. --<a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde"><font color="#FF66FF"><b>Cyde Weys</b></font></a> 04:04, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is the place where Aaron has it over me in spades. He is so much better at "taking cydes" (I can't resist a bad pun) with you than I am. When you and I interact, I get upset, and I'm smart enough to know that nothing good comes from discussing things without having a cool head. True, it sometimes look like you're taking action unilaterally, but where I get upset is when there is what I referred to above as the "white knight" approach. I haven't been here as long as you have, so I'm probably going to be wrong more often than you. When I've brought concerns to you, I don't always get a sense that you see the validity of differing points of view. I mean this nonconfrontationally, but I don't seem to have the brenneman knack for expressing that well. --<a href="../../../s/s/b/User%7ESsbohio_59da.html" title="User:Ssbohio">Ssbohio</a> 05:18, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I didn't want to add to the shouting match on DRV, so I'm coming here. I really am troubled by your argument there. We know (FACT) we have self-identified paedophiles active on Wikipedia. There will be (logical deduction) more that have not self-identified. We have already had one messy issue with a child receiving inappropriate communications from an adult through Wikipedia (anecdotal). We have a number of anti-paedophile activist groups who have complained about our tolerance and jammed OTRS with angry shouting in the past (may be news to you). Perhaps these categories will not be used for nefarious purposes - we can get paranoid. But, they serve no encyclopaedic purpose and have the potential to be extremely harmful and certainly to bring us into media disrepute. That means that the encyclopedia is undoubtedly better served without them. Deleting these things is all gain and no loss. You want to fight a process battle on IAR, please fight it on another topic (go through my logs you'll find plenty of material) not child safety. Do we need a real incident before we take action? Do you really want that on your conscience? Cyde can be right, occasionally. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a><sup>g</sup> 10:58, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi - I honestly don't see the need to delete it - for a start, there is no WP: namespace - it's just a prefix in the mainspace, so to follow that arguement, one oulw have to delete every WP: shotcut on Wikipedia. About the "not official project" bit - <a href="../../../v/p/2/WP%7EVP2_4e4b.html" title="WP:VP2">WP:VP2</a>, <a href="../../../v/p/r/WP%7EVPRF_2210.html" title="WP:VPRF">WP:VPRF</a> and <a href="../../../w/d/m/WP%7EWDM_00ef.html" title="WP:WDM">WP:WDM</a> are a few examples, along with hundreds of user-space essays which have the WP prefix, but which are by no means official (NPW has had quite a lot of interest (surprising amount, actually)). Also, if I were to delete it, it would be in cotravention of CSD, as I'm not the creator (and it surprised me to find it).

<p>Hi, Aaron,</p>
<p>About your comments at Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Nandesuka#brenneman -- I completely agree that if evidence were provided and the articles were under a barrage of inappropriate anon edits (as does happen in controversial topics, such as Objectivism!) then semi-prots would be in order. Evidence was what I had repeatedly asked for -- but Nandesuka repeatedly refused to acknowledge. I'm willing to allow the <i>possibility</i> that all the edits were from the same individual, who was banned from editing. However, making assumptions based on the notion of "quacks like a duck" (as Nandesuka has stated is his "evidence") is contrary to the ideals of WP:AGF. I know we all can occasionally fall into the habit of seeing anonymous users as being "suspect editors", but so long as Wikipedia holds that anon IPs be granted editing rights, we shouldn't jump the gun on thinking every unknown editors is some sort of boogey-man sockpuppet :) Regards, --<font size="-2"><strong><a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">Leflyman</a><sup><a href="../../../l/e/f/User_talk%7ELeflyman_3737.html" title="User talk:Leflyman">Talk</a></sup></strong></font> 05:18, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I replied with a clarification on the ongoing AfD for openoffice, hope that makes things more clear. It's a tricky issue I admit, though I'm usually a fan of letting decisions stand (the con law student in me I guess :p) I can see your concerns are completely valid. I'm willing to be persuaded either way, but as it stands I still don't know enough to formulate an opinion.

<p>Aaron, I'm really sorry about any unintended implications of the "with salt" comment. As embarrassed as I am to say this, I still don't actually know what the analogy refers to, or where it comes from. I've seen it used when a topic keeps coming up, again and again. I hope I didn't put my foot into something; the "salt" word seems to have pushed some buttons, so I'd better figure out what the implications are.

<dd>As I'm old enough that I should have known better than to use a term I don't even know - I feel pretty stupid about that, and it didn't help a touchy situation. And I really hate AfD - I'm pretty sure I've never set foot in there that I haven't made a fool of myself. Guidelines don't apply, consensus isn't consensus, and what applies on one AfD doesn't apply on another - arrrrgh - AfD and Images/Fair Use are two areas of Wiki I just cannot get my arms around. Anyway, still sorry for any unintended agida; no hard feelings here, because it was my fault.

<dd>Thanks for that. Despite being up to my arse in this deletion debate, I'm woefully underqualified to contribute much to the guideline! I'm mostly trying to facilitate more structured debate, while at the same time trying to <i>avoid</i> looking like I'm crafting the guideline to get the result I want in a deletion debate... tricky business. For me, if a consensus guideline emerges that has clearly defined borders about "distro" and that Group Office is kept as a result, that's a win all around.

I see that you are so against it that you don't even have a userpage, except for many subpages which should perhaps be condensed into one main userpage.

<p>Here is the quote that you speak of: "Anything that builds a spirit of friendliness and co-operation and helps people get to know each other as human beings seems to me a good thing." Wow, in that case, it looks like these signature books <i>aren't</i> in the spirit of friendliness, and <i>should</i> be deleted.

<p>Reywas92, Clyde is right; there was no need to lose control. Aaron did speak calmly and I applaud him for that. Now to reply to him: yes I would consider speedy deleting it if it were requested. Any concern/request gets my attention. It would, however, take a strong/good argument to actually convince to do it. I enjoy collecting signatures and signing other signature books and if I have to be miserable while contributing to the encyclopedia (which is something I try to do as much as possible), then I might as well stop editing. <b><a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETennis_Dynamite_41b4.html" title="User:Tennis Dynamite"><font color="red">T</font><font color="green">ennis</font></a> <a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETennis_Dynamite_160a.html" title="User talk:Tennis Dynamite"><font color="green">Dy</font><font color="red">N</font><font color="green">ami</font><font color="red">T</font><font color="green">e</font></a></b> <sup>(<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETennis_Dynamite_My_Autograph_Book_4daf.html" title="User:Tennis Dynamite/My Autograph Book">sign here</a>)</sup> 00:55, 13 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well, you could have it deleted, but that wouldn't be done merely to clear out some page histories. Is there any reason why you want the history deleted? Is there something in there? If not, and you just want to tidy it up, really, don't worry about it.

<p>I like your closing, though I'd have liked to have seen those previous discussions mentioned a lot earlier during the debate. Now people probably weren't aware of them and probably haven't looked at them. *sigh*</p>
<p>I'm also not happy with yet another Deletion review in this case, since I'd deliberately been aiming to prevent one.</p>
<p>Too bad that no one has been talking with each other much. I did get people discussing with Phil during this AFD, but he claimed he'd gotten ill, so no more came of that.</p>
<p>So, I guess I'm just dissapointed that no one has actually tried to really make any work of a consensus, and most of what has happened is a lot of dry procedure with no actual human thought involved. Hence also the AFD/DRV yoyo we'll be seeing more of, I suppose.</p>
<p>So the situation is somewhat imperfect, but I think your contribution to it was very helpful :-)</p>

<p>I wanted to bring this up on your talk page before taking it to DRV. I did a head-count (dropping the six users with fewer than 50 edits) and I came to a 10 vs 10 split (not counting merges, and there were only a few of these). I definitely understand the closing admin's perogative of judging on the quality of the arguments, but keep in mind that there were several (I think) valid arguments on both sides (as well as an option for no-concensus). There is a legitimate point from <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a> (from a larger notability standpoint) that small parts of a work should be merged with larger list. There is also a legitmate counterpoint, however, that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>. I find this latter argument particularly cogent considering the staggering impact of Tolkien's work and the great impact that <i>even small</i> elements have had on later work. Consider a comparison to the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> (for which Wikipedia rightly has more detailed coverage than other volumes with lesser impact). I recall a statistic mentioning that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_c961.html" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a> was the 2nd-most read book after the bible in the 20th century. Certainly that merits some detailed analysis. There have been volumes written on Tolkien's work, but it suffers in some ways from depth of external criticism because it is not an <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alegory.html" title="Alegory">alegory</a> but a constructed <a href="../../../h/i/s/History.html" title="History">history</a>, thereby diminishing its appeal among the academics circles of literature. Scholarly historical points can be brought up, but these are often mistaken as "cruft" whereas scholarly alegorical references rarely suffer from the same fate.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">WP:POKEMON</a> was also brought up, for whatever that is worth, it is certainly true. As for the verifiability issue that was mentioned by some opposers: these are good arguments, but they were refuted by one of the socks (or new users) who provided verifiable (and highly notable) references. I can vouch for the legitimacy of those references and provide page numbers if you so desire.</p>
<p>I honestly think that the article should eventually be merged with <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenway_%28Middle-earth%29_361c.html" title="Greenway (Middle-earth)">Greenway (Middle-earth)</a>, but I voted for keep to avoid having bad precident set for the deletion of large swaths of Tolkien articles. Would you be willing to change your decision to keep and merge to/from <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greenway_%28Middle-earth%29_361c.html" title="Greenway (Middle-earth)">Greenway (Middle-earth)</a> based on those arguments (and the fact that Greenway and Old South Road really are basically a content fork? I would be more than happy to promptly perform the move. Best, <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIrongargoyle_444b.html" title="User:Irongargoyle">Irongargoyle</a> 16:41, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm almost always happy to restore material on any good-faith request. Looking at Greenway, though, I must admit feeling that even a merged article would be vulnerable to another AfD.

<dd>I personally think a narrower and more appropriate compromise would be <a href="../../../r/o/a/Roads_of_Middle-earth_fa34.html" title="Roads of Middle-earth">Roads of Middle-earth</a>, but I'm not really interested so much in the undeleted history to make a merge like that, rather the precedent that calling it <b>Delete</b> sets.

<p>A big thank you for your <a href="../../../n/m/a/User_talk%7ENmaster64_4fed.html" title="User talk:Nmaster64">comments</a> as well. That's the kind of thinking I was looking for. Obviously we two are of different extremes in policy thinking on the matter, but I hold a strong respect for open-mindedness and a willingness to find new solutions, even if at times I may myself come across as overly stubborn. Despite the accusations, I feel I'm the one at odds with an army, and in such cases it often takes a little extra voracity and stubbornness to try to push forth even the concept of a middle-ground resolution. I do apologize for some of my conduct in that particular AfD though, there are certainly things I wish I could have taken back after I said them. Alas, I am only human (regrettably), and my frustration has peaked a few times throughout this event.</p>
<p>I've not operated under the assumption the article could be saved for quite some time, practically from the beginning even. It's been my intention now for some time now to try to get out the idea of a finding a different approach to such situations, as this does not seem an isolated incident. I bear no ill will to you or any policy writers, I simply seek a resolution that will allow users to find the information their looking for, and it seems webcomics is a particular area that has some trouble. I'm aware it may not come immediately, but if I may use the analogy, I'd like to get the biggest snowball I can and start it rolling down the mountain.</p>
<p>To bounce my ideas off you, lemme quickly tell you what's churnin' in my head for endgoals. First and foremost, a clarification on notability policy. Specifically, what counts as an "independent source" and how many of these does one need? When considering webcomics especially, because who else besides blogs really talk about webcomics? Second, the policy does seem to be a little less strict. There simply isn't many big websites out there that ever acknowledge webcomics. I would think that most would agree if a webcomic has like half a million active readers, it's notable regardless if it's been in the New York Times or not. The tough part of course is proving that reader base, as there's no magical counter to tell us that. Personally, I think traffic rankings, if pullable from an independent source (i.e. not the author's claim), should be taken into account <i>on a small level</i>. For example, something along the lines of "if Alexa shows it in the top 500,000" or "the site gets at least 3000 hits a day", then "this counts as a single 'independent source'". That way, nothing could be either kept or deleted based soley on that, but at will at least be acknowledged in the smallest way that it does have a decent reader base. The other change I would like to see is really just regarding what in my own opinion should count as "independent source", but those details can be discussed later.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm looking at Comixpedia with quite a few thoughts floating around. I think it would be beneficial for Wikipedia and Comixpedia to have a much stronger bond and collaboration. Comixpedia seems infantile and in need of a hell of a lot of work, but it's obviously a budding project, and not but yesterday I noticed <a href="../../../d/u/e/Dueling_Analogs_9422.html" title="Dueling Analogs">Dueling Analogs</a> spoke of interest in it. It may so happen Comixpedia needs to "grow up" a bit first, but still it seems to me a solid idea to begin some collab to work towards a point where the Wikipedia can hand less notable can be handled through Comixpedia somehow. I don't think a second set of guidelines for this case is out of the question. Thus, a hierachy is established to where highly notable comics get their own article (ex. Penny-Arcade, CAD, etc.), less notable ones (this would be the category I would say for ones that obviously have some solid popularity, but don't quite meet the notability spec) get a stub that simply provides a brief summary and redirect to Comixpedia article (ex. ExtraLife, Press Start to Play, F@NB0Y$, etc.), assuming a Comixpedia article exists for that comic that's within Wikipedia guidelines (i.e. if the Comixpedia can't even manage a quality article for the comic, then the Wiki shouldn't be expected to link to it) . Possibly even less notable ones could simply redirect to a section of a Wiki Comixpedia article, directing users to check the Comixpedia list to find what they are looking for.</p>
<p>Well, that's my two-cents. That's of course not an overnight job, I realize. But that's what I myself would like to see begun to be worked towards. There are a lot of little details and small things that need to be worked out for all that, but those can be discussed as their come to. I welcome your thoughts and opinions on the matter and any suggestions on as to how to move forward.</p>

<p>Well, you started a discussion at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28web%29_b1bd.html#Web_Cartoonist.27s_Choice_award" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (web)">Wikipedia_talk:Notability_(web)#Web_Cartoonist.27s_Choice_award</a>, but apparently considered the discussion over after about... one hour (time between your first and last post there), so you most likely never noticed my post. While my post there is more detailed (and I'd be happy if you read it), the basic thought is: I was (and still am) really wondering about your judgment in that case since you pretty much completely dismissed the two notable, independent, non-trivial sources that have been named in the Discussion Deletion. I assume you had a good reason for deleting it despite having multiple notable third-party sources, and I would love to hear it. I (and quite a few others) reasoned that the notability guideline had been fulfilled, so obviously we had been wrong somewhere.</p>
<p>If we weren't wrong, I would really appreciate an undeletion of the article... :) --Sid 3050 22:05, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The print article's comparison to the oscars<sup>TM</sup> is clearly facetious, and everything that gets coverage on every show (however small its audience) doesn't automatically get an article. If you're unhappy with this close, take it to deletion review.

<dd>At the very least, the last four Keep votes were based on the existence of the two non-trivial sources. And they came from established editors, from what I can see. So I'm not exactly "bulwarking" or trying to "sound like a git".</dd>
<dd>Even without the Oscars quote, the NYT article still covers the WCCA in a non-trivial manner. And Attack of the Show is a notable show in my eyes. It's at least notable enough to get its own article (and never went through AfD since its creation almost two years ago), so I figure it counts for notability if an entire episode covers this event. So I really don't see how it still fails the Notability rule, and you haven't answered that question, either.</dd>
<dd>And no, I most likely won't push this to Review since I have better things to do than artificially increasing the size of my Wiki-Dick just so my point of view actually counts.--Sid 3050 12:24, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Just a point of fact, there's pretty widespread unhappiness with Wikipedia over its treatment of webcomics with accusations of bias occurring pretty frequently. There's even something called "Wiki Watch" that's getting geared up<a href="http://www.schlockmercenary.com/blog/index.php/2007/02/05/webcomics-wikiwatch/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.schlockmercenary.com/blog/index.php/2007/02/05/webcomics-wikiwatch/" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> because they are of the general opinion that "several short-sighted, empire-building editors" are acting badly by their habit of deleting webcomics that have been long-lived and award winning. One of the tactics that seem to be used is to destroy notability by knocking out industry awards like the WCCA and then turning around and further deleting articles that rely on the now deleted awards for notability. I don't make judgments as to who is sounding or acting like a git. I don't have a good working definition for one thing, but it doesn't sound like something that raises the tone of the conversation so could we leave git and other insults by the door? <a href="../../../t/m/l/User%7ETMLutas_c6d7.html" title="User:TMLutas">TMLutas</a> 07:23, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If that came across as an insult, I didn't mean it that way. There is a large gap between saying something like <i>"editors User:Foo, User:Bar, and User:FUBAR all commented thusly"</i> and <i>"I (and quite a few others)..."</i> the first has <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falsifiability.html" title="Falsifiability">falsifiability</a> the second does not. To be frank, I could give a rat's arse what some other random website has to say.

<dd>Hello Monkey Boy!</dd>
<dd>Anyone who suspects me of bias based upon the tragically small sample of my recent furry-related-deletions really needs to understand that the world is larger than their own concerns: Have a look at my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman&amp;page=" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=delete&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman&amp;page=" rel="nofollow">overall deletions</a> to see that I hate all of God's creature's equally. It's worth pointing out that articles in a similar area (like cosplay, or webcomics, of ninjas) tend to actually <b>link each other</b> so it should be no suprise that nominsations and deletions are "clumpy." If I recall, I began gettin the "why do you hate furries so!" e-mails after closing several AfDs on the webcomics notice board. Perhaps the community should vent it's spleen on whomever it was that nominated them, since they're the one who started me on the self-destructive but seductive path of wiping the furry scourge from the planet. ^_^</dd>

<dd>I'm painfully aware of the flame-fest that accompanies the deletion of whatever-the-groundbreakingly-important-webcomic-I've-deleted-today. It's ironic that the dark lord of Webcomics regularly impugnes my character by painting me as a "webcomic hater." (Like I'm a furry-hater, I guess.) I think you'd be hard pressed to find many who have worked harder on creating sensible, consistant guidelines for webcomics than me. There's no argument that the current guidelines exclude the vast majority of webcomics... the only argument appears to be that those comics that are "clearly" important to the webcomics community resist any sort of metric as to <b>ehy</b> they are important. Snowspinner wants to include anything he says is important, for example. That's clearly unworkable, but some new debate at the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">web guideline</a> is always welcome. That would mean <i><b>new</b></i> debate, of course, as opposed to re-running old debate. Oh! Or here!!<br />

<dd>Good luck.

<dd>Well, fine: those guidelines say that if there is likely to be controversy about whether an article is notable, it should be discussed via AfD. I don't think this is a clear-cut case of a non-notable site, by any means: it seems just as notable as, say, <a href="../../../b/a/k/Bakotopia.html" title="Bakotopia">Bakotopia</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/t/Hotpads.com.html" title="Hotpads.com">Hotpads.com</a> or <a href="../../../n/e/t/Netvibes.html" title="Netvibes">Netvibes</a> to pick a few examples at random: AFAICS, none of those articles "assert their own notability" any more than the Remember the Milk article did. 90% of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Website_stubs" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Website_stubs" rel="nofollow">Category:Website stubs</a> could be speedy-deleted with just as much rationale, I think.

<dd>If I delete those now, will you think I'm just being mean? The easiest thing to do is to re-write the article at User:Neilc/Remember The Milk providing evidence of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> so that the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">web inclusion guideline</a> can be shown to be satisfied. - <font color="black"><strong class="selflink">brenneman</strong></font> 06:52, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you were to speedy-delete those website articles, I would think you'd be inappropriately using your admin powers, not "being mean". If you were to nominate those articles for deletion via AfD, I would disagree that they should be deleted, but I wouldn't have a problem with the procedure you used. As I said before, I think you should err on the side of only speedy-deleting content that is <b>clearly</b> non-notable -- for articles for which there might be controversy, I think AfD is the appropriate forum. As for the RTM article in particular, the notability guidelines for web content suggest that a site is notable if there have been "multiple non-trivial published works" about the site. RTM certainly meets this requirement: it has been the subject of quite a <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/about/press.rtm" class="external text" title="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/about/press.rtm" rel="nofollow">few</a> <a href="http://blog.rememberthemilk.com/2006/12/surrounded-by-milk.html" class="external text" title="http://blog.rememberthemilk.com/2006/12/surrounded-by-milk.html" rel="nofollow">different</a> press articles, been mentioned on TV, etc. Googling for <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22remember+the+milk%22+task&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22remember+the+milk%22+task&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8" rel="nofollow">"remember the milk" task</a> yields &gt; 100,000 hits. RTM is <b>plainly</b> either notable, or not so obviously non-notable that speedy deletion is appropriate. As for improving the article, I'll see if I can find the time (it wasn't me who rashly deleted it!). I think a reasonable start would be to just restore the deleted article, which is better than having no article at all. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeilc_4027.html" title="User:Neilc">Neilc</a> 16:54, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You're totally missing the point:
<ol>
<li>The article said in effect "here is a thing ,it exists."</li>
<li>The speedy deletion criterion is, as you say, for uncontroversial cases.</li>
<li>This was one of those cases.</li>
<li>There's no burden placed upon a speedy deleting adminstrator to do any detective work when deleting something.</li>

<dd>It seems to me:
<ol>
<li>The RTM article was pretty bad and incomplete, but the subject is sufficiently notable to deserve an article.</li>
<li>Doing a minimal amount of research would have confirmed #1 (e.g. using Google, or reading the RememberTheMilk.com website).</li>
<li>Improving the article to "justify its own notability" could have been accomplished in a sentence or two. It seems much more sensible to me to, say, add those two sentences, or flag the article as a candidate for deletion, than just to delete it outright.</li>
<li>I think the burden of proof <i>is</i> on the deleting admin to justify why this case is an uncontroversial violation of the notability criteria, beyond just asserting that this is true.</li>
<li>Leaving aside the question of Wikipedia policy for a moment, my objection is more that you shouldn't have done what you did: you should have <i>at least</i> nominated the article for deletion via AfD, or even done a bit of research first.

<dd>I'm quite happy to keep having this discussion, but there's a real gap in your currect understanding. You can be utterly 100% right about RTM being article-worthy and I can still be utterly correct in speedy deleting it. The whole rest of your thesis depends upon this misconception.

<li>If, for example, I wrote an article "<a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> went to my school, and he could really sing. He's dead now." that would be speedy delete-able.</li>
<li>The theory is somewhat <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinite_monkey.html" title="Infinite monkey">infinite monkey</a>-like in that it presumes that if an article "deserves" to be written someone will write it regardless of if there's a crap article there first or not.</li>

<p>Dear Mr. Brenneman:</p>
<p>It looks like you removed iWoorx, www.iwoorx.com from the online spreadsheets reference.</p>
<p>Can you let me know why you did this?</p>

<dd>Ahh yes. You're talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_online_spreadsheets&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106001341" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_online_spreadsheets&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106001341" rel="nofollow">this</a> edit, I finally figured out. Most adminstrators make a <i>lot</i> of edits, so it always helps to include a link. (See <a href="../../../d/i/f/Help%7EDiff_d48e.html" title="Help:Diff">Help:Diff</a> for how.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Anyway, there is a guidline at <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a> that states that "entry on the list should have a Wikipedia article." I know there are caveats, but in almost every case, make the article first and <i>then</i> put it in the list.</dd>

<p>Thanks Aaron. There was an article, but I guess it did not have enough attribution so it was removed. Even though I am a noob to this process, I understand the need for attribution. &lt;personal rant&gt; It does seem however that many software-ish article are long on advertising and short on attribution.&lt;/personal rant&gt; We have a few article from online magazines (not blogs) that mention our site favorably as something new. We really do have a new "species" of online software. We have just released pre-beta, so I think that is not bad for validation. Can you point me in a direction to learn how an article must be posted to NOT be removed? I would greatly appreciate it!</p>

<dd>Ahhh... embarrasing. I looked in the logs and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=iWoorx" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=&amp;page=iWoorx" rel="nofollow">I'm the deleting admin</a> admin! See what I mean about "we do lots and sometimes they run together?" I've examined the history, and the content of the deleted page, and here's how it happened:
<ul>
<li>I ended up on the IWoorx page. I like to click randomly and see where I get, so who knows how I got there.</li>
<li>There was nothing in the article to demonstrate signifigance, or even to <i>claim</i> it.</li>
<li>Thus is fell under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#Articles" title="WP:CSD">article speedy deletion criterion seven</a>.</li>
<li>I deleted it, and went to clean up the incoming links, one of which was the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_online_spreadsheets.html" title="List of online spreadsheets">List of online spreadsheets</a>.</li>
<li>While there I did a general clean-up.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Which is fascinating I'm sure &lt;/saracasm&gt; but doesn't answer your question, does it?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The best place to start would be the <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">software inclusion page</a>. It's not "official" yet, but it's a start. Also, of you don't have a copy of the article before it was deleted, just ask and I can restore it to a subpage in your user space to work on.</dd>

Thanks for the help and direction. I would appreciate it if you could restore the previous version for me to work on. If you could point me to it, I would also appreciate that. I will add the article references, etc. and do some more research about what the article should look like. And thanks for your quick and complete responses to my questions.</p>

Thanks. I noticed you also edited the wikiCalc article and removed articles from ZDNet and some other third party publications that were probably important. Also removed were some references to Dan Bricklins blog. I think he would be considered clearly one of the top experts in the domain of spreadsheet software, and therefore his blog comments could be referenced. Please let me know your thoughts on this.

<dd>Ok, I'm <b>not</b> going to enter into the quagmire on that page. It's already in mediation, and I don't want to be accused of being spammed for support. (I haven't even looked at the actual article, just it's history and the talk page.) I'll comment here on both your position and the way you've handled it, since I reckon in the longer run that's what's important.
<ul>
<li>With regards to the actual definition: I beleive that you're correct. That it's fairly important to give a long-term historical view, and the lead should reflect the article asa whole.</li>
<li>With regards to how you've carried the point: I think it could have been handled a <i>bit</i> better.
<ul>
<li>You (like me!) tend to be prolix, and that can make it hard for people to come to grips with whatever issues are at hand. Concise is better. Two boxed-off versions of the lead would have saved a few hundred words, for example.</li>
<li>I understand your frustrations, but "Give me a break. What is your problem?" is never going to help. This is coming from <a href="../../../k/e/t/WP%7EKETTLE_583e.html" title="WP:KETTLE">someone who knows better</a>. Really.</li>

<p>An editor has asked for a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html#Web_Cartoonist.27s_Choice_Awards" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a> of <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_Cartoonist%27s_Choice_Awards_888a.html" title="Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards">Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards</a>.

You knew that one was coming. With the amount of dismay going around, any idea why it took so long? Much more importantly, is it acceptable to notify commentators and AfD participants? I was significantly delayed by real world issues and imagined ADHD, and fear that several of those who felt that the decision was unjust have already resigned to it or might not notice. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 01:51, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>My first reaction to this was indeed "Well that took long enough." The only reason I can posit is that many of the current webcomic agitators are fairly new accounts. (This isn't meant as any sort of insult, just a statement of fact, we were all new once after all.) So they may not have been comfortable with (or even been aware of) bringinging something to that forum. I sometimes notify one or two people, but it's usually asking for trouble to ping <i>everyone</i> from the afd. If you put a note on the deletion discussion's talk page, though, then it would show up on their watch list. There's also the wp:web talk page, as well as the comics deletion notice board. All of those would be acceptable "canvassing" I think. Thanks for the note. - <font color="black"><strong class="selflink">brenneman</strong></font> 02:58, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>My thanks. I will add this week <a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETotalnerduk_0f92.html" title="User:Totalnerduk">TNUK</a> 22:14, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wait. Eek. You're asking a lot if you want me to add "indications that this has been discussed in other published works", I mean, this is a <i>webcomic</i> for crying out loud. Sure, it's notable because it's part of what is considered by many a "breakthrough" medium, because it's one of a small number of webcomics to attract mass audiences, etc. However, it's not likely that something as new as Erfworld has featured in other published works as yet. I suggest that you refine your criteria. The pages that you reference set out specifics that many such articles on Wikipedia do not meet, and do in fact say that whilst certain standards are not subjective, there should be exceptions made in <b>objective</b> cases. This is clearly an objective case. Notability may be hard to reference via third party sources, but a valid argument can be made for it nonetheless.</p>
<p>I will ask the guys on the Giant In The Playground forums to assist me in collating all possible arguments on why and how this meets the standard of notability required by this wiki (according to the spirit of the rules, and also the letter if you take into account that the page on notability is notable in recommending that exceptions be made sometimes).</p>
<p>We will get back to you. Once again, thanks for listening. <a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETotalnerduk_0f92.html" title="User:Totalnerduk">TNUK</a> 22:28, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>And again I'm back. A cursory glance would seem that it meets notability conditions set out on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">this page</a> of wikipedia, as it is hosted on the Giant In The Playground website, itself considered notable by wikipedia. Furthermore, the site itself conforms to more than one definition of notable.</p>
<p>This means that I must now make a case for the "notability" of the article on Erfworld '<b>in its own right,'</b> I assume? I'll be back shortly. <a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETotalnerduk_0f92.html" title="User:Totalnerduk">TNUK</a> 22:46, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay. Done (some). Take a look. I can supply more if needed, but this should be enough for you to re-instate the article so that the fan community for the comic can work on bringing it properly up to the wikipedia standard. <a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETotalnerduk_0f92.html" title="User:Totalnerduk">TNUK</a> 02:16, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sweet. Just two things: If I made it appear that an article has to meet the web criteria to avoid speedy deletion, that was not my intention. Something only has to make a reasoble <i>claim</i> to signifigance to elude instant death. Secondly, a copy-paste move isn't a good idea, it violates the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> for the article. When it was done, I'd have happily moved it back for you... We self righteous agenda-driven shithead goosefuckers aim to please!<br />

<dd>Take a look at the history. I wasn't the one who copy-paste moved the thing. There are other people reading this page. Since when did I call you a "self righteous agenda-driven shithead goosefucker", anyway? I happen to think that you've been extremely reasonable about providing support to myself (and the unseen others) who wanted the article re-instated. There are others active on wikipedia who are far less approachable, and far less helpful. <a href="../../../t/o/t/User%7ETotalnerduk_0f92.html" title="User:Totalnerduk">TNUK</a> 22:28, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>I need some serious help. I only know how to use Wikipedia as far as editing pages is concerned, and I have no idea how to use any of the report forms to report vandals. I see that you're an admin, so I'm hoping you can help me out. My talkpage has come under attack by either a bunch of vandals or just one who's using a bunch of different IP addresses. I know where these vandals are coming from. If you could block those addresses from editing my pages, that would be fantastic. Thank you very much.

<p>Good move. Very good move. Suggesting that there's a "purge" against $ARTICLECLASS when a bunch of them are nominated, as well as being a failure to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and maybe <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>, is rather like accusing me of engaging in a purge against faecal matter every time I flush.

<p>Hi Aaron</p>
<p>I notice that you appear to have deleted a number of pages of examples of palindromes (Palindromic words, Palindromic phrases and Palindromic phrases (English)). Before the deletion discussion was moved or removed (I can no longer find it), I counted 9 votes to keep, 10 votes to transwiki (which I understand to mean move to Wiktionary) and only then delete from Wikipedia, and 8 straight deletes. If these pages have been moved to Wiktionary then I wonder if you would be good enough to restore and update the links on the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palindrome.html" title="Palindrome">Palindrome</a> page. If they have been deleted outright then please either restore them or explain why you have made this decision contrary to the majority opinion in the deletion discussion. Please reply here.
