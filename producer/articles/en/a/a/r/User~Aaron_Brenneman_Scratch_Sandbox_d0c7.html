<li><b>Support</b>. I was in the neutral column last time due to the IgnoreAllRules incident, but since then Aaron has matured greatly and is much more patient now than a few months ago. His handling of the Webcomics Arbcom case was calm and ordered. He has made a number of very good contributions to policy discussions. Aaron has a firm understanding of policy, and of the nature of the encyclopedia.

<li><b>Support</b>. Aaron's a fine, sensible Wikipedian, who <i>understands</i> Wikipedia like few admin candidates seem to.

<li><b>Support</b> Fine wikipedian, with a good sense of humour. He's dedicated and an independent thinker. He appreciates process, but is not a slave to it. He can be a very bold and forthright (an Aussie thing?), but has the neccessary humility to go with it. My only concern is that he has an long-running spat with Tony_Sidaway; but that is two-sided. My support would be stronger if Aaron was willing to pledge never to revert Tony's actions (there plent of others to do <i>that</i>). --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 09:08, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Every time I see that brenneman's made a contribution to an issue that I'm interested in, I look forward to reading it.

<li><b>Support</b>: Aaron can be prickly, but he has been dedicated since arrival to setting up standards by which the controversial matters can be assessed dispassionately. Instead of relying on "IAR" and "experts," he wants to have guidelines (not rules) by which we can agree. For this he has gotten the wrath of people who believe in a divine right of admins. For this, he has the support of <b>this</b> admin, 100%. This is a guy who wants to use administrator tools to help administrators work by the same rules as everyone else. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 12:18, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b>. This would be unqualified, but I think he has a Tony-sized hole in his judgment and that sometimes he lets his big mouth get the better of him; I should hope that he will make more of an effort not to let this happen.

<li><b>Support</b>. Karmafist put it well; WP is fortunate Brenneman wants to be an admin. He is well qualified: a good contributor, he has experience, a knowledge of policy and norms few may claim to equal (even among admins), thoughtfulness, a natural ability to listen and consider other points-of-view (and not, as is too often the case, the better to rebut them, but too actually understand what the other guy really thinks), and the willingness to reach out and try to find solutions or compromises. This has led to many improvements in those areas that he has involved himself. Sees and admits mistakes. Is passionate about the project. His troubles, such as they are, seem to have stemmed in the past (on his part) from a quick temper: I agree with Splash's caution, but also with Sjakkalle's opinion that this is much improved. I do not see a good reason to oppose this request, but much to support it.

<li>I'm very disappointed by the factionalism I'm seeing here. It was sort of to be expected, but it's clear how the people piling on supports are those from the faction that, er, oppose the faction opposing. (Karmafist, Geogre, SlimVirgin, et al vs Tony Sidaway, Phil Sandifer, David Gerard, Ambi, et al.) Brenneman can be rough and rude at times, but this is often no worse than some of the things I've consistently seen from Tony and Phil. I think the people from both factions are really great guys, but this RfA just reeks of factionalism to me (though I'm not sure how the lines are drawn -- it's something to do with Kelly Martin or admin actions, I'd presume). Oh, and sorry for hijacking your RfA as a soapbox, brenneman. I'm sure any good you'll do as an admin will outweigh any bads. (And if you start acting like an ass with the mop and bucket, I'll be the first to try to get you desysoped.&#160;:p) <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 05:42, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> Aaron is one of those users that inspires strong feelings, largely because in turn he's passionate himself. Sometimes he could stand to temper his comments, but then who couldn't? Regardless, I hope he'll take this particular critique to heart -- administrating is no easy task, and pushing an administrator button usually causes a large target to appear on one's backside. But the bottom line is that Aaron has been a tireless contributor who <b>cares</b> about Wikipedia. Does he hold some views that are heretical to some in the establishment (deletion comes to mind)? Probably. But opinions are no crime. The only question that's left, then, his dedication clearly established, is whether he'll act properly in regards to his new buttons. I have no reason to think he won't be responsible with his new privileges. That he's clashed with other people is no reason to deny such a serious and long-time contributor, when we routinely hand the keys over to people because they're good vandal fighters. I have no doubt he'll be a good addition. · <a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_967f.html" title="User:Katefan0"><b>Katefan0</b></a><sup><a href="../../../k/a/t/User_talk%7EKatefan0_4566.html" title="User talk:Katefan0">(scribble)</a></sup>/<small><a href="../../../k/a/t/User%7EKatefan0_Poll_b43b.html" title="User:Katefan0/Poll">poll</a></small> 06:43, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> - I have a nagging bad feeling about this candidate. Too often, his personality has struck me as agressive or abrassive.

The findings in the <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Webcomics_64ce.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Webcomics">Webcomics RFAr</a>, especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Webcomics#Aaron_Brenneman.27s_warnings_to_new_users" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Webcomics#Aaron_Brenneman.27s_warnings_to_new_users" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, are too negative and too recent for my taste. Looking at his recent contributions, I don't have any smoking guns, but there is still a lot of what I percieve as veiled hostility towards some users, e.g. Tony, and apparent frustrations with the culture of Wikipedia. Aaron also seems to have a strong tendency to do things his own way. In the distant past that manifested as unannounced changes to deletion policy, and more recently by applying his own style to RFA and RFC. This isn't necessarily bad, but I worry that he hasn't matured as an editor to the point that he would avoid being disruptive in the process. Altogether, I can't really say that he won't be a good admin, and I certainly do believe his heart is in the right place, but I can't shake my sense of uneasiness about this nom, so I am opposing. In many ways, I think this is a shame because there are a number of times where I can recall agreeing with comments and opinions Aaron has offered in the past. Sadly, the last time I felt like this, the RFA succeeded anyway and a few months later sysophood was revoked by ArbCom. If this succeeds, and it certainly looks like it might, I certainly hope that Aaron manages to control his behavior and avoids a similar fate. If this fails, I would be happy to reconsider given several more months of good behavior. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 02:52, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

On a relatively unrelated issue, while I don't mind refactoring pages, especially not when you let people know up front, this refactoring doesn't work so well, since when you try to click on one of Aaron's responses (reference #17 as of this writing), it goes to the bottom of the page, and gives no indication as to which note at the bottom of the page you're being directed to. &#160;:-p <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 16:51, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</strike> going neutral for now, pending outcome of bright light in discussion regarding resolution to the Tony thing. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 05:09, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
