	    <p>"Aaron David" Polley, son of Ray Polley and Cindy Spear Ross, was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, October 10th, 1987.</p>
<p>His father having been married before, Aaron came into the world with two older brothers: Jon and Paul. Paul was much older and had already moved out by the time Aaron was born. Jon was only 10 years older, leaving a brother to grow up with and come to love.</p>
<p>Very close to his mother, having been "under her elbow" all of the time and being home schooled by her until grade 5, it was very hard for Aaron when his parents had a divorce in 1997.</p>
<p>His mother had many health problems and was forced to move to a country with a warmer climate than Canada: Australia. Unable to take him, Aaron would live with his father until he finished school. As a result, Aaron made a total of six visits to Australia, during his summer breaks, between 1998 and 2004.</p>
<p>Aaron's transition into public school was a hard one, at first, with many kids teasing him. The kids at St. George Elementary claimed is was only because he was "The New Kid". Academically, he started school very well with a high 80/low 90 average, and continued to adjust through the grades. Aaron Graduated from Fundy High School in 2005, a top member of his class, receiving many awards for distinction in extra-curricular activities and academics. He graduated on the Principals Merit List for maintaining an above 90% average for his entire high school career.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his teen years, he joined a church in St. George called Family Worship Center, where he began his spiritual, technological, and musical development. Though he had been a devout Christian his whole life, he arrived at FWC at the critical point when "it all clicked".</p>
<p>He started as an "overhead guy" changing the overheads on the projector, so people could see the words to the songs. Not long after, Aaron became in charge of it and soon transformed it into a "PowerPoint Ministry", with the aid of a new laptop and a computer projector the church was not using.</p>
<p>With a growing interest in the piano (having taken lesson for two years when he was 7), Aaron decided it was time to train someone to take his place. A younger and eager prospect was found and Aaron soon found himself taking piano lessons again.</p>
<p>After 8 months, summer came and Aaron went to Australia to visit his mother. His young apprentice took charge of the PowerPoint Ministry and Aaron practiced piano in Australia. When he came back, the overhauled overhead ministry was better than ever and he began playing piano in the main and youth music teams. His father was, and still is, the Worship (music) Leader for the church, and close friends were in the youth band, so the adjustment came easy.</p>
<p>A growing interest for web site design got Aaron involved as the youth group's web site creator &amp; administrator. He had already played with different design ideas on his own freebie web sites and this lead him to learn even more. He went on to create and administrate his high school's web site (FHS), and the web site for his mother's fishing rod business, Black Diamond Tailored Rods.</p>
<p>In 2004/2005, his last year of high school, his talents exploded. He started tutoring people in guitar and piano at the local music shop (having only learned guitar 4 months earlier). He became the youth music leader in his church and appeared twice as a guest star in the local idol singing competition. He became the first to design an original yearbook cover for his high school yearbook and created the school's web site (as mentioned before). Due to his huge involvement with other activities, he was forced to manage the senior boys basketball team, rather than play, as he had done the past 4 years. His awards commendation summed up his amazing grade 12 year.</p>
<p>Having been accepted to attend Hillsong International Leadership College in Sydney, Australia, Aaron worked the post-graduation summer as a Summer Day Camp Leader in local town in Canada. He enjoyed working with the kids and made a small web site for them during his time there: Blacks Harbour Day Camp.</p>
<p>He left Canada on September 11, 2005, to live with his mother, step father, and 6 year old half sister (Angela) and prepare to go to college in February 2006. Upon arriving he became the new multimedia specialist for Black Diamond Tailored Rods.</p>
<p>He has recently joined the worship team at South Coast City Church Thirroul and will be doing weekend ministry there as he attends college.</p>
