<p>this is by no means encyclopedic, but i would just like to say that this guy is doing a tremendous job of exposing the phallicies of the USA. This was a great country but it got hi-jacked in 1913 by the federal reserve, and has been on a downward spiral ever since. peace</p>

<p>Dear fellow editors: I have moved the new information on the above-referenced film from the Aaron Russo article to the article on the film itself. I argue that the information on Russo's personal tax problems, when presented in the article on the film itself, is much more helpful to Wikipedia readers in evaluating the import of the film and in evaluating the motivation of the filmmaker. Also, the point about the film being screened "at" Cannes when, according to the referenced New York Times article, it was screened on the beach and was not actually part of the Cannes film festival, says a lot (in my opinion) if it's true -- so that information should be in the article on the film as well.

<p>Dear fellow editors: Prior to my reversion of materials added by an anonymous user on 6 August 2006, the section on the film <a href="../../../f/r/o/America%7E_From_Freedom_to_Fascism_fa77.html" title="America: From Freedom to Fascism">America: From Freedom to Fascism</a> read as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Russo directed, produced, and wrote America: Freedom to Fascism, a documentary that, among other claims, restates the arguments of the Tax Honesty Movement regarding the U.S. Federal income tax.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In an extremely biased review, The New York Times notes that early in the film Mr. Russo, asserts that every president since Woodrow Wilson and every member of Congress has perpetrated a hoax to tax people’s wages and issue them dubious currency. This assertion is supported by the Texas Congressman, Ron Paul.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The documentary includes interviews with a host of people who are experts, scholars and whistle-blowers. All deny the legitimacy of the income-tax laws, including Irwin Schiff, who is now in jail because a judge refused to allow Irwin to introduce the law in the courtroom to defend himself. The judge stated that he would decide what the law was.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The movie is absolutely fantastic. It had many people in tears. One of the most revolting parts,in terms of what has become of our country, was a woman who was shot with a Taser gun by two police officers who had pulled her over and discovered that her license was "expired". Once she was shot and screaming in pain they pulled her from the car and threw her on the ground. The cops kept yelling for her to put her hands behind her back. Because of the electrical current from the Taser she was unable to and kept telling the cops she couldn't. So the cops "tased" her again. It was sickening to see our law enforment [sic] officers behaving as terrorist [sic] and basically torturing an American citizen. The lady, after being forceably handcuffed, asked what she was being arrested for, "your license is expired" was the reply.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>First, I would argue that this material, to the extent it can be re-worked as encyclopedic material, should be shown in the article on the film itself, and not here in the biographical article on Mr. Russo himself (to avoid unneeded duplication of material).</p>
<p>The first paragraph, beginning with the words "Russo directed, produced, and wrote [ . . . ]" does not appear to be particularly objectionable.</p>
<p>Regarding the second paragraph, beginning with the words "In an extremely biased review, the New York Times notes [ . . . ]" is in my view objectionable. Wikipedia does not need to inform its users that the New York Times article is "biased." Readers are free to read the Times article themselves and make their own determination, if desired, about whether the article is biased. This paragraph can be modified, however, and saved in part.</p>
<p>Regarding the third paragraph, beginning with the words "The documentary includes interviews with [ . . . ]", the statement "Irwin Schiff, who is now in jail because a judge refused to allow Irwin to introduce the law in the courtroom to defend himself" is non-neutral point of view. The statement "The judge stated that he would decide what the law was" may well be correct, but is misleading without elaboration. Here's why.</p>
<p>In an American court of law, defendants are <b>not allowed</b>, as a <i>general rule</i>, to introduce their own version of what <i>they contend the law is</i> as "evidence" before a <b>jury</b> to defend themselves. Prosecutors also are not allowed to introduce "as evidence" their version of what they contend the the law is as <i>evidence before the jury</i>.</p>
<p>The general rule (with limited exceptions) is that "what the law is" is not "evidence." The prosecutor and the defendant <b>are</b> allowed to present <i>to the judge</i> (not to the jury in a jury trial) their contentions about what the law is. The judge then makes a ruling about what the law is.</p>
<p>What Mr. Schiff and a few other tax protesters have tried to do repeatedly (and usually without success) is to try to present -- TO THE MEMBERS OF THE JURY, not merely to the judge -- <i>written materials</i> such as copies of statutes, court decisions, and <i>tax protester commentary</i>. This tactic MAY in certain cases be allowed IF the defendant is merely trying to prove that he or she did not act with the <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mens_rea.html" title="Mens rea">mens rea</a> requirement of "willfulness" in the sense of "awareness of an actually known legal duty." The defendant's argument is something like: "Hey, these materials show my understanding of what the law is, and these materials seem to indicate there's no law requiring me to file tax returns or pay taxes. Therefore, I was not aware that I was violating the law."</p>
<p>However, U.S. law requires that this kind of material NOT be shown to a JURY if, basically, the real reason the defendant (or prosecutor, for that matter) wants to show the jury the materials is to PERSUADE THE JURY ABOUT WHAT THE LAW IS. Under the U.S. legal system, neither the prosecutor, nor the defendant, nor the defendant's attorney, nor the bailiff, nor the court reporter, nor the court clerk, nor members of the jury themselves, are allowed to present materials TO THE MEMBERS OF THE JURY THEMSELVES on WHAT THE LAW IS OR MAY BE. Under our legal system ONLY THE JUDGE may instruct the jury on what the law is. Sorry, but that's the way it is, and that's the way it's always been. The members of the jury are not allowed to review the statute books and court decisions themselves and make their own conclusions about what the law is. Members of the jury are not even allowed (or should not be allowed) to look at <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black%27s_Law_Dictionary_b51d.html" title="Black's Law Dictionary">Black's Law Dictionary</a>. Allowing the jury to evaluate the law itself arguably would be a procedure that could result in a catastrophe for equal justice under law.</p>
<p>Under the U.S. legal system, what the jury does in a trial -- civil or criminal -- is to determine what are called "questions of fact," and not "questions of law." Did the defendant write his name on that particular lease document with the intent to authenticate that document and bind himself to make rent payments? Did the defendant take that particular gun and shoot that particular victim on such and such a date? And so on.</p>
<p>Thus, look at the statements again:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>All deny the legitimacy of the income-tax laws, including Irwin Schiff, who is now in jail because a judge refused to allow Irwin to introduce the law in the courtroom to defend himself. The judge stated that he would decide what the law was.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The above statements tend to leave the incorrect impression that the judge <i>did something wrong or incorrect</i> from a legal standpoint, or that the judge's ruling was somehow unusual. The statements tend to leave the arguably false impression that Mr. Schiff somehow was not given his fair day in court.</p>
<p>Indeed, the judge may actually have been doing Mr. Schiff a favor by not allowing the jury to see Schiff's materials. Mr. Schiff -- like virtually all protesters -- tends to cite court decisions. All court decisions essentially contradict his own positions. For example, like many protesters Mr. Schiff has been known to rely on the <i>Merchants' Loan</i> case. Many protesters cite this case for the argument that only "corporate profits" can be "income" -- despite the fact that the U.S. Supreme Court in that case ruled that gain on the sale of stock by the <i>estate of a dead person</i> (a non-corporate taxpayer) is INCOME and is TAXABLE.</p>
<p>The paragraph beginning with the words "The movie is absolutely fantastic [ . . . ]" seems to speak for itself. This needs major re-working to make it neutral point of view.</p>
<p>Stay tuned. Yours, <a href="../../../f/a/m/User%7EFamspear_93da.html" title="User:Famspear">Famspear</a> 01:39, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Footnote to my August 7th comments: The excised material also included the statement that the film "includes interviews with a host of people who are experts, scholars and whistle-blowers [ . . . ]" I'm not sure about the term "whistleblower," but I don't think Wikipedia can take a position in an article that that a particular person is an "expert" or "scholar" with respect to something as technical and complex as U.S. Federal income taxation, at least not in that way.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>You could say, for example, that a particular person is being quoted as having a particular view on elementary particle physics and that, in connection therewith, that person has a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard. Or you could say that this Ph.D. in physics has published these specific articles on physics in peer reviewed scientific journals (naming the articles, with full citations). You could even say that such a person was designated <i>by a court</i> as an expert witness under the Federal Rules of Evidence in a specific court case, etc. (again, with full citations to the cases). Those kinds of statements might be VERIFIABLE for purposes of Wikipedia. The reader could then reach his or her own conclusion, if desired, about whether that person was an "expert" in that field.

<dd>Excuse me Famspear, but are you a lawyer? It seems so and you've elaborated so much on that. Thank you for shedding some light. Yet one thing.</dd>
<dd>"Under our legal system ONLY THE JUDGE may instruct the jury on what the law is."</dd>
<dd>I couldn't agree more but since you've pointed out that this is a <b>legal</b> system... then shouldn't the judge instruct the jury on what the law is? And since there is no law, the judge should instruct so. Right?</dd>
<dd>What I mean is that do you just try to tell common people that "THEY DON'T KNOW THE LAW, IS THE JUDGE WHO DOES." (!?). Well I hope he DOES! And if he doesn't then he should be taught! Your whole arguement fails. (I mean it's correct that judge should give the law, but if he is wrong since there is no law, do you propose not to protest against the judge?) What exactly is your opinion on that? You bring an argument:</dd>
<dd>"that gain on the sale of stock by the estate of a dead person (a non-corporate taxpayer) is INCOME and is TAXABLE."</dd>
<dd>I don't see how does it relate to the income of a living person? The estate of a living person and of a dead person is something completely different. How would you argue with the statement that "labour is an EXCHANGE between employee and an employer"? Can you elaborate more, yet a bit shorter? Thanks.--<a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalvNaut_b0e8.html" title="User:SalvNaut">SalvNaut</a> 03:55, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear SalvNaut: No, you are incorrect when you say there's "no law" (if by that you mean there is no law in the USA imposing the legal obligations to file Federal income tax returns and pay income taxes on compensation for personal services "exchanged" between employee and employer, whether called wages or salaries or whatever, and imposing civil and criminal penalties for willful failure to do so). So, obviously the judge is right and you are wrong.</p>
<p>You seem to be confused about the statement "that gain on the sale of stock by the estate of a dead person (a non-corporate taxpayer) is INCOME and is TAXABLE." You say you don't see how "it" relates to the income of a <i>living person</i>. You apparently are referring to the <i>Merchants' Loan</i> decision and the <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_protester.html" title="Tax protester">tax protesters'</a> phony "corporate profits" argument. Therefore, you might want to consider reading <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_protester_constitutional_arguments.html" title="Tax protester constitutional arguments">Tax protester constitutional arguments</a> (especially the section on "Taxing labor and income from labor") and <a href="../../../t/a/x/Tax_protester_statutory_arguments.html" title="Tax protester statutory arguments">Tax protester statutory arguments</a> very carefully. The statutes and some of the court decisions on taxation of income of <i>living people</i> are listed in those articles.

<p>quote from the article "The Times notes that Schiff introduced into his criminal case the notes of his psychiatrist, who concluded that Mr. Schiff is delusional, believing he alone could properly interpret the tax code, as a way to avoid acknowledging reality." doesn't seem to make any sense [above question posed by user S Sepp on 8 August 2006]</p>

<p>I take issue with this. If the issue is willfulness based on the defendant’s interpretation of the law how can a judge tell the jury what the law is in his own words and deny the defendant from providing his interpritation along with the relevant sections? That assumes the defendant could have only interpreted the law as the judge describes it. If the jury can be confused by the defendant’s interpretation of the law along with seeing the law itself then certainly it’s reasonable to believe the defendant could also be confused by his own interpretation of the law. Surely, if 12 jurors can be confused with a judge sitting there explaining the law and the prosecution arguing the defendant acted willfully then certainly it's reasonable to believe the defendant was honestly confused and failed to act willfully. To say otherwise ignores common sense. In my humble opinion the mere fact that a judge would claim the law itself might confuse the jury is an admission that it’s likely that the tax protestor failed to act willfully. This of course assumes the tax protestor based his belief on what he has read within the law.</p>
<p>The crux of the issue which many judges disregard in many tax protestor cases is that the defendant is not telling the jury what the law is. By your own admission a defendant doesn’t have the power to say what the law means, so no matter what they might say it will not be the “law”. The defendant is merely providing the jury with his belief of what he thought the law means and no matter what he might say it will never amount to anything more than that. There is nothing that prevents a judge from explaining the true meaning of the law to the jury and making sure the jury understands that the defendant’s interpretation is incorrect. To deny evidence that possibly negates willfulness would be a violation of someone’s sixth amendment right.</p>

<dd>In this case, if Cheek asserted that he truly believed that the Internal Revenue Code did not purport to treat wages as income, and the jury believed him, the Government would not have carried its burden to prove willfulness, however unreasonable a court might deem such a belief. Of course, in deciding whether to credit Cheek's good-faith belief claim, the jury would be free to consider any admissible evidence from any source showing that Cheek was aware of his duty to file a return and to treat wages as income, including evidence showing his awareness of the relevant provisions of the Code or regulations, of court decisions rejecting his interpretation of the tax law, of authoritative rulings of the Internal Revenue Service, or of any contents of the personal income tax return forms and accompanying instructions that made it plain that wages should be returned as income.</dd>

<dd>It was therefore error to instruct the jury to disregard evidence of Cheek's understanding that, within the meaning of the tax laws, he was not a person required to file a return or to pay income taxes and that wages are not taxable income, as incredible as such misunderstandings of and beliefs about the law might be.</dd>

<p>CHEEK v. UNITED STATES, 498 U.S. 192 (1991). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.242.156.150 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.242.156.150_28f5.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.242.156.150">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<p>Dear anonmyous user at IP 24.242.156.150: Again, the verbiage in question that was removed from the article was:</p>

<dd>All deny the legitimacy of the income-tax laws, including Irwin Schiff, who is now in jail because a judge refused to allow Irwin to introduce the law in the courtroom to defend himself. The judge stated that he would decide what the law was.</dd>

</dd>

<p>I think if you look at Mr. Schiff's own web site, you will see comments like these (presumptively copyrighted material, excerpted under the Fair Use Doctrine]:</p>

<dd>Therefore, how did Judge Dawson prevent me from proving that no income tax law imposed a "duty" upon me, and that I knew of such a "duty" – thereby sparing the government the need of having to prove these first two elements of its burden, while preventing me from proving that none of the Government’s IRS witnesses had any legal authority to do what they testified they did. [ . . . ] How could I prove that no "law" imposed any "duty" upon me (and therefore I "knew" of such a "duty") if I could not bring up the law itself?<a href="http://www.paynoincometax.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.paynoincometax.com/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></dd>

<p>I think the judge in the Schiff case concluded that Schiff's real <i>purpose</i> was not merely to try to prove Schiff's alleged "lack of willfulness" or "misunderstanding" of the law. I suspect the judge concluded that Schiff's <i>purpose</i> during the trial was to <i>prove to the jury that there is no law</i> imposing the income tax obligations on him, etc. -- in other words, that Schiff's real purpose was to convince the jury that <i>Schiff's interpretation of the law was the correct interpretation</i>. That's not permissible under the U.S. legal system. Leaving the excised verbiage in the article would have been misleading to Wikipedia readers as to why Schiff was not allowed to present evidence of "the law" to the jury.
