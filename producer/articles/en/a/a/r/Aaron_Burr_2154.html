<p><b>Aaron Burr, Jr.</b> (<a href="../../../f/e/b/February_6.html" title="February 6">6 February</a> <a href="../../../1/7/5/1756.html" title="1756">1756</a> – <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_14.html" title="September 14">14 September</a> <a href="../../../1/8/3/1836.html" title="1836">1836</a>) was an <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">American</a> <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politician.html" title="Politician">politician</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Revolutionary_War_48ec.html" title="American Revolutionary War">Revolutionary War</a> hero and <a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventurer.html" title="Adventurer">adventurer</a>. He served as the third <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice_President_of_the_United_States_d4a8.html" title="Vice President of the United States">Vice President of the United States</a> (1801–1805). As a politician, a soldier and a man Burr has been both zealously defended and bitterly denounced. Despite the passage of two centuries, his legacy and Burr himself remain enigmatic.</p>
<p>A formative member of the <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic-Republican_Party_%28United_States%29_21fc.html" title="Democratic-Republican Party (United States)">Democratic-Republican Party</a> with a political base in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a>, Burr served in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_State_Assembly_965b.html" title="New York State Assembly">New York State Assembly</a> (1784–1785, 1798–1801), as <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_State_Attorney_General_dc95.html" title="New York State Attorney General">New York State Attorney General</a> (1789–1791), <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senator_8a3a.html" title="United States Senator">United States Senator</a> (1791-1797), and for one term as Vice President of the United States (1801–1805) under <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_United_States_3dfd.html" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Jefferson_1b17.html" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> (1743–1826). A <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_1800_8f60.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 1800">candidate for President in 1800</a>, Burr tied Jefferson with 73 electoral votes, sending the election into the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._House_of_Representatives_5a56.html" title="U.S. House of Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>. After 36 ballots, Jefferson was elected President and Burr, Vice President. As Vice President, Burr was <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_Senate_31bf.html" title="President of the Senate">President of the Senate</a>, and in such role, presided over the <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impeachment.html" title="Impeachment">impeachment trial</a> of <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Chase_feb6.html" title="Samuel Chase">Samuel Chase</a>.</p>
<p>During an unsuccessful campaign for election to <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_of_New_York_2cf3.html" title="Governor of New York">Governor of New York</a> in 1804, Burr was relentlessly defamed in the press, often by the writings of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Hamilton_3fe5.html" title="Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> (1755-1804), a long-time political rival. Taking umbrage at remarks made by Hamilton at a dinner party, <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burr-Hamilton_duel_4287.html" title="Burr-Hamilton duel">Burr challenged Hamilton to a duel</a> on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_11.html" title="July 11">11 July</a> <a href="../../../1/8/0/1804.html" title="1804">1804</a>, at the <a href="../../../w/e/e/Weehawken%2C_New_Jersey_9c89.html" title="Weehawken, New Jersey">Heights of Weehawken</a> in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Jersey_5ac9.html" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> at which he mortally wounded Hamilton. Arguably the most famous <a href="../../../d/u/e/Duelling.html" title="Duelling">duel</a> in American history, the duel had immense political ramifications. Burr, who survived the duel, was indicted for murder in both New York and New Jersey (though these charges were either later dismissed or resulted in acquittal), and the harsh criticism and animosity directed towards him would bring about an end to his political career in the East. Further, Hamilton's untimely death would fatally weaken the fledging remnants of the <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federalist_Party_990c.html" title="Federalist Party">Federalist Party</a>, which combined with the death of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> (1732-1799) five years earlier, was left without a strong leader.</p>
<p>After Burr resigned the Vice-Presidency in 1805, he journeyed into the American West, particularly in the lands in the <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_River_8c4c.html" title="Ohio River">Ohio River Valley</a> and the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louisiana_Purchase_fb97.html" title="Louisiana Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a>. While historians are uncertain as to Burr's particular activities, he was accused in turns of having committed <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a>, of a conspiracy to steal Louisiana Purchase lands away from the United States and crown himself a King or Emperor, or of an attempt to declare an illegal war against <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas_40db.html" title="Spanish colonization of the Americas">Spanish possessions</a> in <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexico.html" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> (a process known then as <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filibuster_%28military%29.html" title="Filibuster (military)">filibustering</a>). Burr was arrested in 1807 and brought to trial on charges of <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a>, for which he was acquitted. After several years in self-imposed <a href="../../../e/x/i/Exile.html" title="Exile">exile</a> in Europe, Burr returned to practicing law in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> and lived a largely reclusive existence until his death.</p>

He originally studied <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theology.html" title="Theology">theology</a> at Princeton University, but abandoned it two years later and began the study of law in the celebrated law school conducted by his brother-in-law, <a href="../../../t/a/p/Tapping_Reeve_ba12.html" title="Tapping Reeve">Tapping Reeve</a>, at <a href="../../../l/i/t/Litchfield%2C_Connecticut_3ef7.html" title="Litchfield, Connecticut">Litchfield, Connecticut</a>.

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Burr_2154.html" title="Edit section: Military service">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Military service</span></h3>
<p>During the Revolutionary War, Aaron Burr took part in General <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benedict_Arnold_6b5d.html" title="Benedict Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a>'s expedition into <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> in 1775, an arduous trek of over 500 miles in winter. Upon arriving before the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Quebec_%281775%29_983f.html" title="Battle of Quebec (1775)">Battle of Quebec</a>, Burr was sent up the St. Lawrence River to make contact with General <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Montgomery_7346.html" title="Richard Montgomery">Richard Montgomery</a>, who had taken Montreal, and escort him to Quebec.</p>
<p>Montgomery promoted Burr to Captain and made him an Aide-de-Camp. Although Montgomery was killed in the attack, Burr distinguished himself with brave actions against the British.</p>
<p>His courage made him a national hero and earned him a place on Washington's staff in <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manhattan.html" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, but he quit after two weeks because he wanted to return to the field. Never hesitant to voice his opinions, Burr may have set Washington against him (however, rumors that Washington then distrusted Burr have never been substantiated). General <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_Putnam_4842.html" title="Israel Putnam">Israel Putnam</a> took Burr under his wing, and by his vigilance in the retreat from lower Manhattan to Harlem, Burr saved an entire <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigade.html" title="Brigade">brigade</a> from capture.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Hamilton_3fe5.html" title="Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> was an officer of this group. In a stark departure from common practice, Washington failed to commend Burr's actions in the next day's General Orders (the fastest way to obtain a promotion in rank). Although Burr was already a nationally-known hero, he never received a commendation. According to Burr's stepbrother Matthew Ogden, Burr was infuriated by the incident, which may have led to the eventual estrangement between him and Washington. (Source: "Burr," Lomask, '82 and Shachner, "Aaron Burr," '37).</p>
<p>On becoming <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lieutenant_Colonel_7041.html" title="Lieutenant Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> in July <a href="../../../1/7/7/1777.html" title="1777">1777</a>, Burr assumed the command of a <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regiment.html" title="Regiment">regiment</a> called the "Malcoms". During the harsh winter encampment at <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valley_Forge_a32e.html" title="Valley Forge">Valley Forge</a>, he guarded the "Gulph," a pass commanding the approach to the camp, and necessarily the first point that would be attacked.</p>
<p>On <a href="../../../j/u/n/June_28.html" title="June 28">June 28</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/7/1778.html" title="1778">1778</a> at the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Monmouth_0742.html" title="Battle of Monmouth">Battle of Monmouth</a>, his regiment was decimated by British artillery, and Burr suffered a <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heat_stroke.html" title="Heat stroke">stroke</a> in the terrible heat from which he would never quite recover. In January 1779, Burr was assigned to the command of the lines of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westchester_County_d3e7.html" title="Westchester County">Westchester County</a>, a region between the British post at <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kingsbridge%2C_Bronx%2C_New_York_c838.html" title="Kingsbridge, Bronx, New York">Kingsbridge</a> and that of the Americans about 15 miles to the north. In this district there was much turbulence and plundering by the lawless elements of both <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whig_%28American_Revolution%29_1b04.html" title="Whig (American Revolution)">Whigs</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/r/Tories.html" title="Tories">Tories</a>, and by bands of ill-disciplined soldiers from both armies. Burr established a thorough patrol system, rigorously enforced <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martial_law.html" title="Martial law">martial law</a>, and quickly restored order.</p>
<p>He resigned from the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_Army_3e70.html" title="Continental Army">Continental Army</a> in March 1779 on account of ill health, renewing his study of <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law.html" title="Law">law</a>. Burr did continue to perform occasional intelligence missions for Continental generals such as <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_St._Clair_11c7.html" title="Arthur St. Clair">Arthur St. Clair</a> and on <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_5.html" title="July 5">July 5</a>, <a href="../../../1/7/7/1779.html" title="1779">1779</a> he rallied a group of <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale</a> students at <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Haven_5452.html" title="New Haven">New Haven</a> along with Capt. <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Hillhouse_a994.html" title="James Hillhouse">James Hillhouse</a> and the Second Connecticut Governors Foot Guard in a skirmish with the British at the West River.

<p>Despite this brief interlude, Burr was able to finish his studies and was admitted to the <a href="../../../b/a/r/Bar_%28law%29.html" title="Bar (law)">bar</a> at <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albany%2C_New_York_1b4f.html" title="Albany, New York">Albany</a> in 1782.

They had one child, a daughter, <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theodosia_Burr_Alston_8713.html" title="Theodosia Burr Alston">Theodosia Burr Alston</a>.

<p>Burr served in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_State_Assembly_965b.html" title="New York State Assembly">New York State Assembly</a> from 1784 to 1785, but became seriously involved in politics in 1789, when <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Clinton_%28politician%29_0b92.html" title="George Clinton (politician)">George Clinton</a> appointed him <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_State_Attorney_General_dc95.html" title="New York State Attorney General">New York State Attorney General</a>. He was commissioner of Revolutionary War claims in 1791, and that same year he defeated a favored candidate, General <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philip_Schuyler_74da.html" title="Philip Schuyler">Philip Schuyler</a> — for a seat in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Senate_7d74.html" title="United States Senate">United States Senate</a>, and served in the upper house until 1797.</p>
<p>While Burr and Jefferson served during the Washington administration, the Federal Government was resident in <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philadelphia.html" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. They both roomed for a time at the boarding house of a Mrs. Payne. Her daughter <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolley_Madison_09ab.html" title="Dolley Madison">Dolley</a>, an attractive young widow, was introduced by Burr to <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Madison_5b50.html" title="James Madison">James Madison</a>, whom she subsequently married.</p>
<p>Although Hamilton and Burr had long been on good personal terms, often dining with one another, Burr's defeat of General Schuyler, Hamilton's father-in-law, marks the beginning of their personal quarrel. Nevertheless, their relationship took a decade to reach a status of enmity.</p>
<p>As a U.S. Senator, Burr was not a favorite in President <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Washington_2730.html" title="George Washington">George Washington</a>'s eyes. He sought to write an official Revolutionary history, but Washington blocked his access to the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Archives_ddd8.html" title="National Archives">archives</a>, possibly because the former colonel had been a noted critic of his leadership, and because he regarded Burr as a schemer. Washington also passed over Burr for the ministry to <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>. After being appointed commanding general of American forces by President <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Adams_7525.html" title="John Adams">John Adams</a> in 1798, Washington turned down Burr's application for a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brigadier_general.html" title="Brigadier general">brigadier general</a>'s commission during the <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quasi-War_6098.html" title="Quasi-War">Quasi-War</a> with France. Washington wrote, "By all that I have known and heard, Colonel Burr is a brave and able officer, but the question is whether he has not equal talents at intrigue." It is significant to remember that, Hamilton, who by then despised Burr, still had Washington's ear. At an earlier point in time, Burr had told Hamilton that "he despised Washington as a man of no talents and one who could not spell a sentence of common English." However, Washington's wartime strategies may have colored Burr's opinion of the General. (Sources:Schachner; Lomask.)</p>
<p>According to a <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> review of "Revolutionary Characters," a 2006 book by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_S._Wood_52cd.html" title="Gordon S. Wood">Gordon S. Wood</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What most members of the founding generation shared, Mr. Wood argues, was a "devotion to the public good," a gentlemanly belief in the importance of disinterested public service, and a self-conscious seriousness about their duty to promote the common welfare."<br />
Among the founding fathers' circle, one who did not share this outlook was Burr. As a senator from New York, Burr used "his public office in every way he could to make money," Mr. Wood says, and his "self-interested shenanigans" alarmed colleagues on both ends of the political spectrum. When the presidential election of 1800 was thrown into the House of Representatives, Hamilton — who would later be killed in a famous duel with Burr — "spared no energy" in persuading his fellow Federalists to support his longtime rival Jefferson over Burr; after more than 30 ballots in the House, Jefferson finally became president.<br />
That bitter enemies like Hamilton and Jefferson joined forces against Burr, Mr. Wood writes, was an indication that they believed he "posed far more of a threat to the American Revolution than either of them ever thought the other did."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bored with the inactivity of the new U.S. Senate, Burr ran for and was elected to the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_state_legislature_e8ef.html" title="New York state legislature">New York state legislature</a>, serving from 1798 through 1801. During <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Adams_7525.html" title="John Adams">John Adams</a>'s term as President, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_parties.html" title="Political parties">national parties</a> became clearly defined. Burr loosely associated himself with the Democratic-Republicans, though he had moderate <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Federalist_Party_06ea.html" title="United States Federalist Party">Federalist</a> allies, such as Sen. <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Dayton_0d7a.html" title="Jonathan Dayton">Jonathan Dayton</a> of New Jersey. Burr quickly became a key player in New York politics, more powerful in time than Hamilton, largely because of the <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tammany_Society_4fb3.html" title="Tammany Society">Tammany Society</a>, later to become the infamous <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tammany_Hall_cbf4.html" title="Tammany Hall">Tammany Hall</a>, which Burr converted from a social club into a <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_machine.html" title="Political machine">political machine</a> to help Jefferson reach the Presidency. In 1796, Jefferson chose Burr as his vice-presidential running mate, but they lost to John Adams. In 1799 Jefferson and Madison requested Burr's help for a second run for the Presidency in 1800. Of the 16 states' electoral votes, only seven states were for the Jeffersonians, but Federalist New York had an electoral vote coming up before the election. Burr fielded a slate for Jefferson (Hamilton fielded the other for the Federalists) and won. This led to ultimate victory for Jefferson and drove another wedge between Hamilton and Burr. Burr became Vice President.</p>
<p>During the <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_Revolution_970a.html" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>, French diplomat <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Maurice_de_Talleyrand_817b.html" title="Charles Maurice de Talleyrand">Charles Maurice de Talleyrand</a>, in need of sanctuary to escape the Terror, stayed in Burr's home in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> but also spent much time at Hamilton's house. When Burr, after the Hamilton duel and treason trial, traveled Europe in an attempt to recoup his fortunes, <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talleyrand.html" title="Talleyrand">Talleyrand</a> refused him entrance into France. Talleyrand was an ardent admirer of Alexander Hamilton and had even once written: "I consider Napoleon, Fox, and Hamilton, the three greatest men of our epoch, and if I were forced to decide between the three, I would give without hesitation the first place to Hamilton. He had divined Europe."</p>

<p>Because of his influence in New York city and the New York legislature, Burr was asked by Jefferson and Madison to help the Jeffersonians in the election of 1800. Burr sponsored a bill through the New York Assembly, creating the money needed for Jefferson's campaign. Another crucial move was Burr's success in getting his slate of New York City and nearby Electors to win over the Federalist slate, which was chosen and backed by Alexander Hamilton, who lost. This event drove a further wedge between the former friends. Burr is known as the Father of modern political campaigning. He enlisted the help of members of <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tammany_Hall_cbf4.html" title="Tammany Hall">Tammany Hall</a>, a social club, and won the election. He was then placed on the Democratic-Republican presidential ticket in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_1800_8f60.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 1800">1800 election</a> with Jefferson. At the time, <a href="../../../s/t/a/State_legislature.html" title="State legislature">state legislatures</a> chose the members of the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._Electoral_College_5364.html" title="U.S. Electoral College">U.S. Electoral College</a>, and New York was crucial to Jefferson. Though Jefferson did win New York, he and Burr tied for the presidency with 73 electoral votes each.</p>
<p>It was well understood that the party intended that Jefferson should be President and Burr Vice President but the responsibility for the final choice was that of the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_House_of_Representatives_fcb5.html" title="United States House of Representatives">House of Representatives</a>. The attempts of a powerful faction among the Federalists to secure the election of Burr failed, partly because of the opposition of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_Hamilton_3fe5.html" title="Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> and partly because Burr himself did little to obtain votes in his own favor. He wrote to Jefferson underscoring his promise to be Vice-President, and during the voting stalemate in the Congress wrote again that he would give it up entirely if Jefferson so demanded. Ultimately, the election devolved to the point where it took thirty-six <a href="../../../b/a/l/Ballot.html" title="Ballot">ballots</a> before <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_A._Bayard_8682.html" title="James A. Bayard">James A. Bayard</a>, a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delaware.html" title="Delaware">Delaware</a> Federalist, submitted a blank vote. Federalist abstentions in the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vermont.html" title="Vermont">Vermont</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryland.html" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> delegations led to Jefferson's election as President, and Burr’s moderate Federalist supporters conceded his defeat.</p>
<p>Upon confirmation of Jefferson’s election, Burr became <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vice_President_of_the_United_States_d4a8.html" title="Vice President of the United States">Vice President of the United States</a>, but despite his letters and his shunning of any political activity during the balloting (he never left Albany) he lost the trust of Jefferson after that, and was effectively shut out of party matters. Some historians conjecture that the reason for this was Burr's casual regard for politics, and that he didn't act aggressively enough during the election tie. Jefferson was tight-lipped in private about Burr, so his reasons are still not entirely clear. However, Burr's even-handed fairness and his judicial manner as <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_the_Senate_31bf.html" title="President of the Senate">President of the Senate</a> was praised even by his bitterest enemies, and he fostered some time-honored traditions in regard to that office.</p>
<p>At least one historian (Forrest MacDonald) has credited Burr's judicial manner in presiding over the impeachment trial of Justice <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Chase_feb6.html" title="Samuel Chase">Samuel Chase</a> with helping to preserve the principle of judicial independence.</p>

<p>When it became clear that Jefferson would drop Burr from his ticket in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_1804_df70.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 1804">1804 election</a>, the Vice President ran for the <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor_of_New_York_2cf3.html" title="Governor of New York">governorship of New York</a> instead. Burr lost the election, and blamed his loss on a personal smear campaign believed to have been orchestrated by his own party rivals, including New York governor <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Clinton_80ac.html" title="George Clinton">George Clinton</a>. Hamilton also opposed Burr, due to his (still controversial) belief that Burr had entertained a Federalist secession movement in New York. But Hamilton exceeded himself at one political dinner, where he said that he could express a "still more despicable opinion" of Burr. After a letter regarding the incident written by Dr. <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Cooper_5942.html" title="Charles Cooper">Charles D. Cooper</a> circulated in a local newspaper, Burr sought an explanation from Hamilton.</p>
<p>Hamilton had written so many letters, and made so many private tirades against Burr, that he could not reliably comment on Cooper's statement. Burr demanded that Hamilton recant or deny anything he might have said regarding Burr’s character, but Hamilton, having already been disgraced by the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Reynolds_64ff.html" title="Maria Reynolds">Maria Reynolds</a> scandal and forever mindful of his own reputation and honor, did not. Burr responded by challenging Hamilton to personal combat under the <i><a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_duello.html" title="Code duello">code duello</a></i>, the formalized but largely antiquated rules of dueling. Both men had been involved in duels in the past (for Hamilton 21, for Burr 1), and Hamilton's eldest son, Philip, had died in a duel in 1802.</p>
<p>Although still quite common, dueling had been outlawed in New York and also New Jersey, but Hamilton and Burr were not citizens of New Jersey, so on July 11, 1804, the enemies met outside of Weehawken, New Jersey, and Hamilton was fatally shot. There has been some controversy as to the claims of Burr's and Hamilton's seconds; while one party indicates Hamilton never fired, the other claims a 3 to 4 second interval between the first shot and the second shot.<a href="http://www.thedailystar.com/opinion/columns/2004/07/10/ham.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thedailystar.com/opinion/columns/2004/07/10/ham.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Hamilton's shot missed Burr, but Burr's shot was fatal. The bullet entered Hamilton's <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_abdomen.html" title="Human abdomen">abdomen</a> above his right <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_%28anatomy%29.html" title="Hip (anatomy)">hip</a>, piercing Hamilton's <a href="../../../l/i/v/Liver.html" title="Liver">liver</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Vertebral_column.html" title="Vertebral column">spine</a>. Hamilton was evacuated to Manhattan where he lay in the house of a friend, receiving visitors until he died the following day. Burr was later charged with multiple crimes, including <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murder.html" title="Murder">murder</a>, in New York and New Jersey, but was never tried in either jurisdiction. He fled to South Carolina, where his daughter lived with her family, but soon returned to Washington to complete his term as Vice President. As leader of the Senate he presided over the impeachment (trial) of Samuel Chase. It was written by one Senator that Burr had conducted the proceedings with the "impartiality of an angel and the rigor of a devil." Burr's heartfelt farewell in March 1805 moved some of his harshest critics in the Senate to tears.</p>

<p>After the expiration of his term as Vice President on <a href="../../../m/a/r/March_4.html" title="March 4">March 4</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/0/1805.html" title="1805">1805</a>, broken in fortune and virtually an exile from New York and New Jersey, Burr went to Philadelphia. There he met Jonathan Dayton a friend and classmate from Princeton, with whom he is alleged to have formed a conspiracy, the goal of which is still unclear for some historians. His detractors said (and some still do) that the plan may have been for Burr to make a massive new nation in the west, forged from conquered provinces of Mexico and territory west of the Appalachian Mountains. Burr was to have been the leader of this Southwestern republic. Some detractors claim that it was his dream to create a Latin American empire that could control much of the farms and commerce of North America, and that had he succeeded, the United States could have fallen into a full-scale civil war. All these accusations were voiced by Burr's political enemies.</p>
<p>This was a crucial time in American expansion westward. Spain held the Mexican territories, including the Southwest and California. Mexico was agitating for rebellion, and, if war broke out, the U.S. Government was anticipating seizing some or all of the land for itself.</p>
<p>Burr and his friends always fiercely denied any treasonable plans to overthrow the U.S. Government by force. The Louisiana Purchase (which, according to the conspirators, was never included in their plans) at the time was up for the taking, legally, because it was not yet declared a Territory of or in the United States by Congress. Many French, Spanish, Indians and Americans who were unhappy with taxes and the government lived there. (A short time later Jefferson, who realized that if the territory turned into industrialized States his idea of an agrarian Democracy would be threatened, suggested that maybe the territory's separation wouldn't be a bad idea.) Burr had leased 40,000 acres of land in the Texas part of Mexico, in the "Bastrop" lands from the Spanish government. His "conspiracy," he always avowed, was that if he settled there with a large group of (armed) "farmers" and war broke out, he would have an army with which to fight and claim land for himself, thus recouping his fortunes. The war, however didn't occur until 1836, the year of Burr's death.</p>
<p>In 1805, General James Wilkinson, chosen by Jefferson to be the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Army at New Orleans and Governor of the Louisiana Territory, actually was a traitor. (It was revealed years later that at the time he was a spy, secretly in the pay of the Kingdom of Spain.) Wilkinson had his own reasons for aiding the so-called Burr conspiracy. As Territorial Governor, he could have seized power for himself, as he had attempted in earlier plots in Kentucky. Ignorant of the General's treason, Burr enlisted Wilkinson and others to his plan in a reconnaissance mission to the West in April 1805.</p>
<p>Another member of the Burr conspiracy was the Anglo-Irish aristocrat <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harman_Blennerhassett_3920.html" title="Harman Blennerhassett">Harman Blennerhassett</a>. After marrying his niece, Blennerhassett had been forced out of <a href="../../../i/r/e/Ireland.html" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. He came to live as a quasi-<a href="../../../f/e/u/Feudal.html" title="Feudal">feudal</a> lord, owning an island now bearing his name in the <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_River_8c4c.html" title="Ohio River">Ohio River</a>. Highly educated, Blennerhassett maintained a scientific laboratory and an impressive villa on the island. It was there that he met Burr and agreed to help finance the ambitions of Burr's group.</p>
<p>Like many Americans, including Jefferson, Burr anticipated a war with Spain, a distinct possibility had someone other than Wilkinson commanded U.S. troops on the Louisiana border. In case of a war declaration, <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Jackson_463e.html" title="Andrew Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> stood ready to help Colonel Burr, who had already purchased the land shares in <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a>. His expedition of perhaps eighty men carried modest arms for hunting, and no war <i><a href="../../../m/a/t/Materiel.html" title="Materiel">materiel</a></i> ever came to light, even when <a href="../../../b/l/e/Blennerhassett_Island_a61c.html" title="Blennerhassett Island">Blennerhassett Island</a> was seized by <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio.html" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militia.html" title="Militia">militia</a>.</p>
<p>After a near-incident with Spanish forces at <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natchitoches%2C_Louisiana_9243.html" title="Natchitoches, Louisiana">Natchitoches</a>, Wilkinson decided he could best serve his conflicting interests by betraying Burr's plans to President Jefferson and his Spanish paymasters. Jefferson's passivity throughout most of 1806 remains baffling to this day, but he finally issued a proclamation for Burr's arrest, declaring him a traitor even before an indictment. Burr read this in a newspaper in the <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orleans_Territory_47e6.html" title="Orleans Territory">Orleans Territory</a> on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_10.html" title="January 10">January 10</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/0/1807.html" title="1807">1807</a>. Jefferson's warrant put Federal agents on his trail. He turned himself in to the Federal authorities twice. Two judges found his actions legal and released him. But Jefferson's warrant followed Burr, who then fled for <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Florida_6d5f.html#Second_Spanish_Rule" title="History of Florida">Spanish Florida</a>; he was intercepted in the vicinity of the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missouri_Territory_d2dc.html" title="Missouri Territory">Missouri</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alabama_Territory_cd91.html" title="Alabama Territory">Alabama</a> Territories on <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_19.html" title="February 19">February 19</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/0/1807.html" title="1807">1807</a> and confined to <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fort_Stoddert_f188.html" title="Fort Stoddert">Fort Stoddert</a>.</p>
<p>Burr was treated well at Fort Stoddart. For example, in the evening of <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_20.html" title="February 20">February 20</a>, <a href="../../../1/8/0/1807.html" title="1807">1807</a>, Burr appeared at the dinner table, and was introduced to the wife of the commandant, who was the daughter of the man responsible for the legal arrest of Burr, Judge Harry Toulmin.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> In the evening, Burr played chess with her and during his confinement at the fort, was often her competitor in that intricate game.<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Burr's secret correspondence with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthony_Merry_f7c1.html" title="Anthony Merry">Anthony Merry</a> and the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlos_Mart%C3%ADnez_de_Irujo_y_Tac%C3%B3n_d8c7.html" title="Carlos Martínez de Irujo y Tacón">Marquis of Casa Yrujo</a>, the British and Spanish ministers at Washington, was eventually revealed. It had been, it would seem, to secure money and to conceal his real designs, which were probably to overthrow Spanish power in the Southwest, and perhaps to found a dynasty in what would have become former Mexican territory. This seems to have been a <a href="../../../m/i/s/Misdemeanor.html" title="Misdemeanor">misdemeanor</a>, based on the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutrality_Act_0045.html" title="Neutrality Act">Neutrality Act</a> passed to block <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filibuster_%28military%29.html" title="Filibuster (military)">filibuster</a> expeditions like those questionable enterprises of <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Rogers_Clark_c17e.html" title="George Rogers Clark">George Rogers Clark</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Blount_65b2.html" title="William Blount">William Blount</a>. But Jefferson sought the highest charges against Burr, even though his informant, Wilkinson, was notoriously corrupt. It seems that both Jefferson and Burr gravely misjudged Wilkinson's character - Jefferson had personally put him in charge of the Army at New Orleans.</p>
<p>In 1807, on a charge of <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a>, Burr was brought to trial before the United States <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuit_Court_9224.html" title="Circuit Court">Circuit Court</a> at <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond%2C_Virginia_2b80.html" title="Richmond, Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>. His defense lawyers were <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Wickham_%281763%29_453e.html" title="John Wickham (1763)">John Wickham</a> and <a href="../../../l/u/t/Luther_Martin_b9e5.html" title="Luther Martin">Luther Martin</a>. Burr was arraigned four times for treason before a grand jury indicted him. This is surprising, because the only physical evidence presented to the Grand Jury was Wilkinson's so-called letter from Burr, proposing stealing land in the Louisiana Purchase. During the Jury's examination it was discovered that the letter was in Wilkinson's own handwriting - a "copy," he said, because he had "lost" the original. The Grand Jury threw the letter out, and the news made a laughingstock of the General for the rest of the proceedings. The trial, presided over by <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States_cbf9.html" title="Chief Justice of the United States">Chief Justice of the United States</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Marshall_1427.html" title="John Marshall">John Marshall</a>, began on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_3.html" title="August 3">August 3</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/r/t/Article_Three_of_the_United_States_Constitution_bc68.html#Section_3:_Treason" title="Article Three of the United States Constitution">Article 3, Section 3 of the United States Constitution</a> requires that treason either be admitted in open court, or proved by an overt act witnessed by two people. Since no two witnesses came forward, Burr was acquitted on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_1.html" title="September 1">September 1</a>, in spite of the fact that the full force of the political influence of the Jefferson administration had been thrown against him. Immediately afterward, he was tried on a more appropriate misdemeanor charge, but was again acquitted.</p>

<p>By this point all of Burr's hopes for a political comeback had been dashed, and he fled America and his creditors for <a href="../../../e/u/r/Europe.html" title="Europe">Europe</a>, where he tried to regain his fortunes.

<ul>
<li>According to his detractors, Burr could be unscrupulous, insincere, devious and amoral. In fact, towards his friends and family, he was a moral and virtuous man, pleasing in his manners and generous to a fault. Although he proved irresistible to many women, few historians doubt Burr's devotion to his first wife and daughter, while they lived. He was profligate in his personal finances, and gave lip service to <a href="../../../a/b/o/Abolitionism.html" title="Abolitionism">abolitionism</a> even though he owned slaves. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Quincy_Adams_2c9a.html" title="John Quincy Adams">John Quincy Adams</a> said after the former Vice President's death, "Burr's life, take it all together, was such as in any country of sound morals his friends would be desirous of burying in quiet oblivion." This was his own opinion: his father, (President) John Adams, was an admirer and frequent defender of Burr, as were many other prominent Americans of the time, despite the duel and the treason trial.</li>
