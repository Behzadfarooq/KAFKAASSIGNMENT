<p>One interpretation of the arguments presented in favour of keeping schools is <i>"Schools are almost never deleted, thus showing that the majority of Wikipedians favour the inclusion of schools."</i><br />
A possible rebuttal is this would be <i>"This is the result of bloc voting, not consensus."</i><br />
<br />
By examining voting patterns on sample of votes, it may be possible to confirm or refute one or both of these statements.<br /></p>

<p>Please be aware that there is an extensive <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">discussion of schools</a> page, and general comments are well placed there.<br />

<ul>
<li>Over 65% voted less than three times</li>
<li>As number of votes increase, voting consistance moves to upper and lower bounds.</li>
<li>There exist individuals whose voting patterns deviate strongly from the norm.</li>
<li>Assigning <b>putative</b> groups to those who voted three or more times and with greater than 60% consistancy:
<ul>
<li>The <i>Keep</i> group has greater consistancy than the <i>Delt</i> (+1 consistancy versus -.9)
<dl>
<dd>(That is to say, people who vote often tend to always vote the same way, but some more than others.)</dd>

<p>Very similar to before, with automagic importation of data for larger sample size. It's got a few rough bits, but it's well and truly on the good side of 80/20 anlysis. Read in all (non "list") schools from Schoolwatch deletion archive. Known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beefstew (or other link) screws up the username attribution.</li>
<li>Very long opinions will have the username truncated.</li>
<li>Malformed opinions will be recorded as "Unknown" (e.g. <b>Delett</b> or <b>Keeep</b>.)</li>
