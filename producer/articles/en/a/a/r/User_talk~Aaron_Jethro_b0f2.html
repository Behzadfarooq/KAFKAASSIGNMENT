<p>For some odd reason, my first guess was going to be '94 for the second TV ad and after doing some research on the actress, seeing that she didn't start movies until '95, I was positive that it had to be that year. But then after doing some Yahoo researching I found several links stating it was much later, in '98, although I could swear I remember seeing that commercial many years before. I don't think all the sources with '98 would be wrong unless they all got their info from another source with incorrect info'. - <a href="../../../b/u/z/User%7EBuzda_c03f.html" title="User:Buzda">Buzda</a> 20:19, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm having trouble understanding the distinction on this page between a <i>bootleg copy</i> and a <i>pirated copy</i>: they both redirect to the same article. Can you clarify what the difference is? - <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussBlau_27b9.html" title="User:RussBlau">Russ Blau</a> (<a href="../../../r/u/s/User_talk%7ERussBlau_9049.html" title="User talk:RussBlau">talk</a>) 01:04, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>A bootleg is a recording of a music concert/gig or [rejected] studio material that is released without the artist's or the record label's legal concent. This is material which, in all likelyhood, would not enter the public's hands, were it not for the illegal release of them by underground companies - although, interesting, there was a legislative loophole which allowed the activity to thrive in Italy for a while in the 1990s. For example, the only way you can hear the complete sessions for <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Dylan_8d40.html" title="Bob Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>'s 'Basement Tapes' or the original takes for his <i>Blood On The Tracks</i> LP is on a bootleg. On the other hand, a pirated album is nothing more than an illegal copy of a release already commercially available, with the quality of the duplication and the packaging being known to vary, although it is near-always unfavourable. For example, you could purchase a new chart hit album for a fraction of the price that you would pay for a genuine copy bought from a high-street chainstore. Both phrases are incorrectly used interchangably by the media, thus you have a "bootleg copy". I hope that clears things up for you.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Well, yes, but what you have described is a "<a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootleg_recording.html" title="Bootleg recording">bootleg recording</a>". The disambiguation page draws a distinction between that and a bootleg copy, and there doesn't seem to be any real difference between a "bootleg copy" and a "pirated copy". BTW, I don't think it is helpful to say that one usage is "correct" and the other is "incorrect", as I don't think you will find a lot of prescriptivists in the Wikipedia community; our goal is to describe what people mean when they use a particular term, not what some authority thinks they should mean. - <a href="../../../r/u/s/User%7ERussBlau_27b9.html" title="User:RussBlau">Russ Blau</a> (<a href="../../../r/u/s/User_talk%7ERussBlau_9049.html" title="User talk:RussBlau">talk</a>) 13:58, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please allow me to expand my clarification. When I edited the Bootleg disambiguation page, I didn't actually notice that one of the links was for a "bootleg copy", let alone did I click on said link. Due to "bootleg" and "pirate" being commonly and - in terms of their actual, true definitions - incorrectly used as a synonym for one another, whoever did add the term to the page was incorrect in doing so. A "bootleg copy" can only, mistakenly, mean either a "pirated copy" or a "bootleg recording", which are the proper terms for the above-described. The inclusion of the term, "bootleg copy", should be brought up with whoever added it there in the first place, yet I can assure you it does not belong there. Although I hadn't noticed the phrase's existance there, I had nonetheless written a brief note on the difference between the two to clear up these kind of confusions. To summarise: there is a clear difference between a "bootleg" and a "pirate", whilst anything that goes under the name of a "bootleg copy" is one of the two, but not clearly labelled as to which. The term "bootleg copy" should never exist in Wikipedia because it is an erroneous and misleading description.
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for the pointer to this discussion in your edit summary, Aaron. I was working on cleaning up links on <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Bootleg_5c83.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Bootleg">Special:Whatlinkshere/Bootleg</a> and a great many music/television/movie pages used "bootleg" in a way that was clearly common usage in the subject matter, but just as clearly meant "pirate copy" as you defined it above. Rather than alter the usage in the articles to something jarring in context, I elected to create "bootleg copy" (as a redirect) to distinguish that meaning from <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootleg_recording.html" title="Bootleg recording">bootleg recording</a>. I have since edited the lead section in <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright_infringement.html" title="Copyright infringement">copyright infringement</a> to make it more understandable when people get redirected there from a link which reads "bootleg", (I also added a paragraph on "bootleg recording" there). With that edit, that particular redirect may be less necessary now if you really wish to delete it; if you do, please clean up links listed on <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Bootleg_copy_da6f.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Bootleg copy">Special:Whatlinkshere/Bootleg copy</a> as well. (In fact, it looks like people have already edited some to point directly to copyright infringement. Ah well...it seemed like a good idea at the time). I agree with your edits to Bootleg, although with Russ I think the "incorrect" comment should probably be removed. Thanks for the rational discussion! - <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatherineMunro_0200.html" title="User:CatherineMunro">Catherine</a>\<sup><a href="../../../c/a/t/User_talk%7ECatherineMunro_06c5.html" title="User talk:CatherineMunro">talk</a></sup> 01:42, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I feel the best thing to do is delete the "bootleg copy" redirect page and make sure that anything that linked there used the actually intended term in each article and therefore any internal links will go directly to either the "<a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootleg_recording.html" title="Bootleg recording">bootleg recording</a>" or "<a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright_infringement.html" title="Copyright infringement">copyright infringement</a>" pages, as things should be. Secondly, having quickly skimmed through the copyright infringement article for the first time, I can see that it needs a good rewrite - regardless of your own additions, Catherine, for which I thank you - which makes two jobs that I might as well undertake myself before the week is out. Your thanks for the "rational" discussion is much appreciated, although I am starting to wish that I was still unaware that there was an issue, if you get what I mean.</dd>
