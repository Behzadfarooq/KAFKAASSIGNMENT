<p>Hi, AaronS. Thanks for the comment you left on my page. You said, "I'd appreciate it if you didn't attack some of the users who are editing anarchism." I attcked the editors of <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a>? You mean on the anarchism article talk page? Where did I do this? To be honest with you I would appreciate it if some of these editors would stop attacking <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a>. Its sure looking to me like an attempt at destroying an excellent article. I would also appreciate it if some of you would stop attacking Hogeye, RJll, Vision Thing and me. Anyway, I would rather live in peace than war and in kindness than in meanness, so it would probably be a good idea if we all started to treat each other in a more considerate way.

<p>I'm good! How have you been? Are you still going to (was it Dartmouth?)

<dd>Yeah, I quit flag for good some time ago. Things are pretty normal with me, my mate is begining her last year of med-school, my daughter is spending the summer playing and learning to swim better, and I've finally gotten coverage for a medication that treats my arthritis. So its hard to complain when everyone is relatively happy and relatively healthy. How are your studies progressing, what subjects particularly interest you now? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> 10:18, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your degree is very similar to mine, a double major in English Literature and Philosophy. I had enough for a minor in Women's Studies, but didn't feel like writing the thesis required for it. I'm also planning on going back to the university and picking up my masters, which I had to quit years ago when my arthritis got bad and someone needed to stay home to take care of my daughter. I'm also hoping to eventually go into teaching, so maybe someday we will be colleagues&#160;;) <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> 05:43, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is a very heated and controversial topic, and it often times can be hard to be objective about, often simply due to the fact that the subject matter has an extremely complex history which is often misrepresented and distorted by primary sources on all sides of the matter. While I tend to disagree occasionally with your edits, you do tend to keep a cool head when discussing them, which I must credit you for. Two-Bit Sprite 00:17, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

I'd support it for featured status. However, of course, one thing I've learned from reading WP:FAC almost daily is that it's really difficult to anticipate the faults other editors will find with the article. In any case, if it doesn't make it, you'll get some ideas for improvement. Presently, Peer Review isn't bringing enough feedback, so that's one way to get a larger part of the community to comment on the article.</p>
<p>Again, thank you for your contributions to the article.</p>

<p>I told myself I would stop reading it, but to the degree it doesn't flat out scare me its just too damned funny to ignore. Honestly, I get a good laugh from almost every post. Perhaps this is a sly joke being played out for our benefit? I mean, how often to you hear an "anarchist" denounce the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Lingeron" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Lingeron" rel="nofollow">traitorous rhetoric</a>?</p>

<dd>Lol! Things have been really funny lately. I thought it would get better with RJII and Hogeye gone (at least from their main accounts) but it seems to be worse. Oh well.

<p>I find that half the fun of Wikipedia is the fact that I end up places I ordinarily would have no interest in. While I do make the rounds of my primary interests, most articles I end up getting really wrapped up in editing are things I never would have expected. Half of them I couldn't even tell you how I reached them. I'll try not to get burned out on the anarchism discussion, but it was an interesting find when I spotted it while reporting a vandal on the noticeboard.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 16:50, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Considering all of the good discussion that's going on at <a href="../../../a/n/a/Template_talk%7EAnarchism_dbc2.html" title="Template talk:Anarchism">Template talk:Anarchism</a>, this is highly disruptive and tendentious of you.

<dd>Again, follow the discussion. Namely the part where there is nearly a consesus (save for you and <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheIndividualist_25e6.html" title="User:TheIndividualist">TheIndividualist</a>) that there is a dispute, here. That's the definition of a dispute -- people disagree. One source says one thing, another source says another. There are plenty of sources on <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> that don't even mention <a href="../../../m/u/r/Murray_Rothbard_a505.html" title="Murray Rothbard">Murray Rothbard</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-capitalism.html" title="Anarcho-capitalism">anarcho-capitalism</a>. --AaronS 21:33, 30 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are plenty of sources on <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> that don't mention Stirner or Tucker. You have not provided any sources that say that anarcho-capitalism is not anarchism, while I have provided sources that say it is. Intangible 21:40, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Again, see my argument regarding the burden of proof. I don't need to provide you with a source to back up the claim that faeries aren't real, for instance. --AaronS 00:51, 31 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's difficult to say we get so many good article nominations (which is good) that you learn to say yes or no very quickly. Definitely remove the single sentences and take the time to make sure the article reads properly. With that done I think you will have a pretty good article. For an article this size, shortening the article is always an option but I think the article at the moment is pretty focused so it's not really a problem.

<dd>How was anyone supposed to guess that AceLiner is a banned users sock? Someones sock, yes. Furthermore, if you're reverting a banned user, you should make that clear in the edit summaries and/or talk <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_M._Connolley_7af8.html" title="User:William M.

<dd>If anybody had bothered to contact me, considering that I am a long-time editor in good standing, I could have informed them of the situation. Alternatively, they could have simply looked at the edit history and user contributions. My first revert had the following edit history: <i>rv boring sock; get some new material, please</i>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;diff=68458604&amp;oldid=68456715" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anarchism&amp;diff=68458604&amp;oldid=68456715" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> --AaronS 17:19, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here's hoping the block expires soon. I'm getting a bad case of head meets wall over the continuing debate on the anarcho-capitalism talk. Well, I suppose it's not a debate so much as Uiofvnondc claiming the word "political" is a violation of NPoV, and ignoring any evidence or consensus to the contrary.--<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERosicrucian_a63e.html" title="User:Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a> 02:31, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Given the information I have now, I would not have blocked you, as at least one of the four reverts was reverting a banned sock. However, given the information available at the time, I feel I acted correctly. Apologies for any inconvenience caused. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> (<a href="../../../s/t/i/User_talk%7EStifle_2330.html" title="User talk:Stifle">talk</a>) 14:48, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for your note. I appreciate the apology, although it wasn't even necessary, since I know that you were acting in good faith, and, with the information you had, it was the right thing to do. My comment on WP:AN/I was not directed towards you, but rather to the greater community of administrators, just so that they understand the context of the situation a little bit better. Best of luck! --AaronS 14:55, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That would be fine and good if it were true that I'm a sock trying to get around a ban but I'm not. I consider the allegation a personal attack. Hopefully he sincerely thinks I'm a banned sock and not just making a false claim in order to delete the edits of other users with impunity. He shouldn't be throwing claims around like that and system operators shouldn't consider the claim to be true without evidence. The system operators did the right thing. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThat%27sHot_b6db.html" title="User:That'sHot">That'sHot</a> 03:10, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>I looked into "Anarchism" article in UK Encarta, but I didn't find that most forms of anarchism reject capitalism and private property. Can you direct me where exactly is that said? <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 15:26, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks, but that's not quite it. First qoute is already included so there is no need to repeat it, and others are in past tense (beliv<b>ed</b> and 1872). Also, I'm more intresed in property quote. (that most schools perceive private property as authoritarian institution) <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">-- Vision Thing --</a> 15:41, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
