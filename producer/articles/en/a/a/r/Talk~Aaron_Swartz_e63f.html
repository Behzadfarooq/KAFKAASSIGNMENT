<dd>Check the history, please. User AaronSW made two tiny edits - linking to his personal site (perfectly valid, IMO, since the article is about him) and to clarify who runs the Summer Founders Program in which he participated. And he did it with his existing Wikipedia account, completely transparently, not as an anon IP. This is a perfectly valid article about a notable individual. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVary_c05b.html" title="User:Vary">Vary</a> | <a href="../../../v/a/r/User_talk%7EVary_f3a1.html" title="User talk:Vary">Talk</a> 05:34, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As I noted on the talk page, I didn't create the article. Someone I'd never heard of before (or since) did and emailed me to let me know. I checked the page, made a couple small corrections, and have otherwise left it alone except to revert vandalism and things. If you like, I can introduce you to the person who created the page and you can verify he's not me, but I don't see why it matters. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronSw_9541.html" title="User:AaronSw">AaronSw</a> 19:55, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Raban: Maybe Aaron was emailed the creator. There are a number of possible explanations. Aaron is a noteable wikipedian with thousands of edits. He has said that he didn't create the page on the original AfD proposal. But <i>even if he did create the page</i>, we've still already gone through a AfD and it failed because enough people thought he was notable. —<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Mako_Hill_1ad0.html" title="User:Benjamin Mako Hill">mako</a> 16:13, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I fail to see why this is a notable individual. It's a guy who works at a startup company. Neither he nor his company are reputable, famous or successful. This person has no extensive academic or industrial record, so I baffled as to why he deserves anything remotely like an encyclopedic entry. It seems like yet another way to pimp one's company through Wikipedia.</p>
<p>There is also no evidence to support the claim that this person did not create his own page.</p>
<dl>
<dd>This article has previously proposed for delection and the proposal ended with a decision to <b>keep</b> this article. Please read the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aaron_Swartz_142a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aaron Swartz">AfD page</a> and decide if you think something has changed between then and now that would make Aaron less notable and a similar proposal end differently. Personally, I see no absolutely reason why that would be the case. —<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Mako_Hill_1ad0.html" title="User:Benjamin Mako Hill">mako</a> 16:03, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aaron is somewhat well known for being the co-author of RSS, that makes this page valid.</dd>

<p>The most notable thing about Aron Schwarz is his ego. His homepage is the temple of self-adulation. Maybe he is really talented, but if so, he still has to prove that. As long as he didn't do so, there's no need for an entry in the Wikipedia. RSS is a good idea, but as far as I know it was not his idea. He himself states that he co-authored RSS, which probably means that he is responsible for the specification, which is ridiculously bad and an expression of nearly total incomprehension of XML. Hm, maybe there's another notable thing about Aron: He is the perfect example for this errant hype about youth. If you wanna be really good at something, you have to learn and practice -- and this takes plenty of time. In the end, fortunately, nobody is hurt by the existence of this article, so what?! The nicest solution would be if Aron himself exercised some humility and proposed the deletion of this article. --<a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERaban_7c4c.html" title="User:Raban">Raban</a> 12:59, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Unfortunately, I don't think it's really appropriate for me to take a position on this article either way. Even if it was, I'm still bound by the same procedural limitation as you -- the article already failed at AfD. I'm curious what about my website is a temple of self-adulation. I simply describe the various things I've done, which seems to be standard practice. If you can give me some suggestions about what to change I'd love to fix it since that's definitely not what I want. As you rightly point out, my accomplishments are fairly trivial and due more to being in the right place at the right time than any personal talent. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronSw_9541.html" title="User:AaronSw">AaronSw</a> 19:55, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm ashamed by your calm response to my exaggerated accusations. Hereby I retract them. My impression of what was going on here wasn't quite right. But it seems that I'm not the first who, based on the available material, supposed that this is a case of disproportionate vanity. There are in fact a few things that render that picture. One may be that you talk about yourself in the third person on your homepage. Apart from that, homepages of people about themselves are always problematic and prone to being classified as self-adulation. How do you think about that, Mako? &#160;;-) Ok, I'm going to shut up now. --<a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERaban_7c4c.html" title="User:Raban">Raban</a> 13:10, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It makes me sick! Look at what his contribution to Zack Coburn (a <i>notable</i> intern at Arons firm) was: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zack_Coburn&amp;diff=45658304&amp;oldid=37082132" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zack_Coburn&amp;diff=45658304&amp;oldid=37082132" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zack_Coburn&amp;diff=45658304&amp;oldid=37082132</a> Nothing more than a reference to -- guess! --: Aron Schwarz. --<a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERaban_7c4c.html" title="User:Raban">Raban</a> 13:20, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Aaron's talk page is not a venue for you to vent about your frusterations with Aaron's ego, his age, the quality of the RSS specification, etc. If you think that new evidence that you have dug up is enough to get a different response on an AfD (I can't imagine that it is), please go ahead. Otherwise, please go vent privately somewhere. Also, as the article shows, his name is spelled Aaron. —<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjamin_Mako_Hill_1ad0.html" title="User:Benjamin Mako Hill">mako</a> 16:13, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is not Aaron's talk page. This is the talk page of an article about Aaron. However, your critique concerning my tone is justified -- I admit it. Nevertheless there are some things about this article that are clearly conflicting with the principles of Wikipedia. The fact that Aaron is a diligent contributor otherwise has absolutely nothing to do with this issue. In particular it doesn't give him the privilege to use Wikipedia as a <i>Aaron Swartz TM</i> public relations platform. Anyway, sorry for the tone and for the misspelling of his name. --<a href="../../../r/a/b/User%7ERaban_7c4c.html" title="User:Raban">Raban</a> 17:04, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
