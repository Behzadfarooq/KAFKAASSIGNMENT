<p>I've decided to bow out of the Stubble AfD. Though I still think the re-listing -- and immediate re-listing in general -- is a bad idea, the fact of the matter is the discussion has turned from the topic at hand to larger AfD issues that are already being discussed in multiple venues elsewhere. The deciding factor for me was Isotope23's belief that it doesn't matter in the context of AfD who the primary contributor to an article is. I disagree with <i>that</i> sentiment far more than I do the re-listing itself, but to argue it in Stubble's AfD would have been pointless. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 14:18, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I didn't see that you'd closed <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_LUEshi_%285th_nomination%29_9fd2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/LUEshi (5th nomination)">LUEshi (5th nomination)</a> in between when I put the {{<a href="../../../i/n/u/Template%7EInuse_2e6a.html" title="Template:Inuse">inuse</a>}} on it and when I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/LUEshi_%285th_nomination%29&amp;diff=42613806&amp;oldid=42610903" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/LUEshi_%285th_nomination%29&amp;diff=42613806&amp;oldid=42610903" rel="nofollow">closed</a> it.

<dd>Don't worry about it. I think that you are one of those who don't endorse the "binary" school of AFD closing, but I do (and of course, O know best right?&#160;:-)). In that school a "merge" result and "keep" result are the same thing, at least administrerially speaking, since they can be altered by any editor without needing the admin tools. If you think that it's better to merge the article then don't let a "keep" result prevent you from being bold and merging it. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:17, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I really have no idea what's going with the last AfD. You seemed to have been in the proccess of closing it, when <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> closed the AfD. You overwrote his decision, and then <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> reverted back to Sjakkalle's close.

<dd>I'm quite dissapointed that someone who had participated in the AfD chose to take this action without apparently looking at the respective talk pages or leaving me a note talking about it to me first. This is <i>very</i> bad form, especially in light of the fact that a "merge" results is a non-binding "keep".</dd>
<dd>If nothing else, it's given my a strong motivation to ensure that <i>both</i> of these articles conform to our verification policy. Since a website cannot be used as a source about itself (bias and all) I'm quite sure that if we shine the light of WP:V on these they will melt like last year's snowman.</dd>

<dd>Actually, since you seem so deeply confused about this, I'll try to spell it out:
<ul>
<li>From <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>:
<ol>
<li><b>"Facts, viewpoints, theories, and arguments may only be included in articles if they have already been published by reliable and reputable sources",</b> (bolding theirs), and</li>
<li>"Articles should rely on credible, <b>third-party</b> sources" (bolding mine).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I believe the mistake that your are making is that you are considering a werbsite to be a "primary source" with regards to itself, and thus we can take material directly from a website to place in an article about the website. This arguments makes a couple of conceptual flaws.
<ul>
<li>From <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>:
<ol>
<li>"A primary source provides direct evidence for a certain state of affairs. This may mean that the source observes a state of affairs directly, or that they observe indirect evidence of it," and</li>
<li>"Wikipedia articles may rely on primary sources so long as what they say has been published by a credible publication."</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So we <i>cannot</i> take material directly from a website about that website because they are niether a primary source nor (even if they were) are they a credible publication in most instances. Even if we were to allow that they were both a primary source <i>and</i> that they were a credible publication, Reliable sources further states <i>"...personal websites, weblogs (blogs), bulletin boards, and Usenet posts, [...] are not acceptable as sources."</i></dd>
<dd>I grant that in two places there is mention of things being used as sources "about themselves". These are asides, and contradict the explicit wording of the rest of the policy. I've started a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EReliable_sources_715d.html#Self_reference" title="Wikipedia talk:Reliable sources">discussion thread</a> on the talk page regarding them.</dd>
<dd>I welcome your input on this, but it's quite clear that we should never use websites, webcomics, or video games as sources about themselves.</dd>

<dd>Snowspinner, in my view, that level of sarcasm does not help keep things collegial. I apologise for any misunderstanding but I'll nevertheless ask again. Do you agree or disagree with "we can't use a source as a reliable source about <b>itself</b>"? If you disagree is that what you meant by "so wrong..." and why do you disagree? If you agree, then are you saying that what I said is not what Aaron said, or something else? Thanks in advance for clarifying. <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 06:14, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This happens because you were using the edit link on the daily-log page. Pressing that means you only open the page from the section heading down and don't see the closure tag that has been applied since you opened the daily log. Since you don't edit at the same time, there is no edit conflict and you don't realise until you actually see the debate subpage after pressing save. You'd see it if you were to explicitly click on the "Project page" button before closing a debate. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 13:21, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I have contributed new articles and will continue to contribute as best I can. I thank you for warning <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarglebutt_ee27.html" title="User:Garglebutt">User:Garglebutt</a> that his behaviour is outside Wikipedia policy. I hope there's immediate action if it continues. I specifically refer to his Talk page which continues to show a personal attack. Can you please ensure this is removed? It would be the easiest and most stupid thing in the world for me to respond with a personal attack on my user talk page about him. I don't wish to do so. I just wish the personal attacks to stop, and I call on you to bring them to an end. --<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2006BC_4eed.html" title="User:2006BC">2006BC</a> 01:32, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>We had an edit conflict there but I stand by the above and ask that you remove the personal attack on my behalf. If not, is it permissible for me to respond with a counter personal attack on my user:talk page? I really don't want to do so but feel you are leaving me with no choice. --<a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2006BC_4eed.html" title="User:2006BC">2006BC</a> 01:32, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Fair play and all, but if you address the original afd, I don't think any consensus ever developed over a decent version of the article. The vanity vote was addressed, the nonsense vote is itself nonsense, the POV and pointless comment is irrelevant. The cartoonist has been published in nationally published magazines, and I personally tend to feel that makes someone notable. I also think your edit summary referring to six deletions is somewhat biased, the actual article has only been deleted once, the rest were a result of beaurocratic warring.</p>
<p>I would also hope you would agree that no decent version of this article has ever been properly discussed at afd. The drv was damned contentious, and I don't think the issues were ever discussed, the whole thing was inane. There was no clear process that was under review; a non-admin kept the page, an admin over-ruled. Another admin over-ruled that over-ruling and it all went downhill. The article was nominated for deletion 8 days after creation, no-one had attempted clean up and it would be nice if the article had been given a chance. Can we not agree some sort of compromise on this issue?</p>
<p>If you look at the edit summaries of the article, it's been recreated by <a href="../../../g/a/i/User%7EGaius_Cornelius_c35a.html" title="User:Gaius Cornelius">User:Gaius Cornelius</a>, the same person who tagged the original article as POV. I notice a distinct lack of discussion from you on that user's talk page regarding this issue. Do you think you're moving this forward in the best manner? That template is for titles which should never have articles. Do you think that applies here? I look forward to your response on this. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 10:56, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I had concentrated too much on the multiple re-directs and sorting on the admin-antics. I had failed to do a more than cursory examination of the most important part, the deletion discussion.</p>
<p>Every concern that you raise above is spot on. I considered a note on the article's talk page, but thought that the link in the template to DRV was enough. In retrospect, it would have cost me nothing extra to make a note on the talk page, and in future I'll almost certainly do so. I had also composed a note on User:DollyD's talk page, but must have mistaken "preview" for save as I am wont to do. I've left that message now.</p>
<p>Thanks for the well-deserved ear-bashing, and please do keep letting me know when I screw up. Round two of the Treasure Hunt is coming up, and it will have an admin section!</p>

Sadly, point of <a href="../../../b/e/a/WP%7EBEANS_2a59.html" title="WP:BEANS">WP:BEANS</a> I'm keeping it under my hat, but I hope you'll trust me, it follows on from <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a> somewhat.

I'm tired of getting sucked into these draining debates about issues with people who seem to have already made their damn mind up or who can't address the underlying issue.

<dd>I find discussing the Patrick Alexander (cartoonist) article to be quite futile as very few people seem to care about anything beyond the superficial deletion polictics. However, I'll try to put it as plainly as I can.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The most recent Patrick Alexander (cartoonist) article did not fit any criterion for speedy deletion. It is not a recreation of deleted material. The copy in the new article bore little resemblence to what I originally wrote. It was written by a person with no link to me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Simple research can confirm that Patrick Alexander is notable enough to warrant an article on Wikipedia. Despite this, both attempts to create an article have been deleted.

<dd>Each of these decisions has received wide examination and each has been found to acceptable by the community.

<dd>Even ignoring the deletion of <i>original</i> Patrick Alexander article, again I say, the <i>new</i> Patrick Alexander article that you deleted was <b>NOT</b> a candidate for speedy deletion. The copy was not <b>"substantially identical"</b>. It was almost completely different.

<dd>The difference between the two version was that the old version cited several sources that the new version failed to include and a short and uncited paragraph regarding the drawing style. There is no question that <i>on those grounds</i> the speedy deletion was appropiate. There was no question that the closing admin was within the bounds of what is appropiate when it was originally deleted. We're not even arguing that point, because it's taken as read. No one seems to mind the idea of a relist, so I'm not sure why we're still discussing the old deletions. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000"><sup>{T}</sup></font></a><span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="#000000" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 06:18, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, sorry. The Patrick Alexander article that you deleted was <b>a new article on the same subject</b>. The new article was created in complete independence from the previous version, by a completely different user, and the differences are <b>far</b> beyond an additional paragraph and references. A comparison of the two articles will show that they bear almost no resemblence to each other. They focus on completely different aspects of the subject with minimal crossover. Again, this was clearly <b>a new article on the same subject</b>, which the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> specifically states that this <b>does not</b> count as "recreation of deleted material". <a href="../../../d/o/l/User%7EDollyD_8ed9.html" title="User:DollyD">DollyD</a> 07:04, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I didn't mean to disrupt the nomination cabal, which probably could have drafted a better nomination than I did, considering that I am not as familiar with smurrayinchester's contributions as some other users might be. I didn't really understand the purpose of the nomination cabal until just a few moments ago, when I investigated some the discussion surrounding it. Actually, I think it's a pretty good idea that can be implemented with the current RfA procedure even if nothing else comes of the DfA deliberations. It really is a minor detail, and I don't quite understand why it's receiving so much opposition. By the way, thanks for the unconventional comment on my talk page. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETantalumTelluride_d79e.html" title="User:TantalumTelluride"><span style="color:#CD6600;">Tantalum</span></a><a href="../../../t/a/n/User_talk%7ETantalumTelluride_f5d7.html" title="User talk:TantalumTelluride"><span style="color:#000080;">T</span></a><a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETantalumTelluride_Esperanza_ed66.html" title="User:TantalumTelluride/Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">e</span></a><a href="../../../t/a/n/User_talk%7ETantalumTelluride_f5d7.html" title="User talk:TantalumTelluride"><span style="color:#000080;">lluride</span></a> 05:03, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello Aaron, I need you help on an important issue. I'd really like your help in keeping an eye on user baku87. He is from azerbaijan and he recently joined wiki and is now adding baised edits to articles, mainly the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_of_Armenia_34b0.html" title="Military of Armenia">Military of Armenia</a> article and the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_of_Azerbaijan_e66f.html" title="Military of Azerbaijan">Military of Azerbaijan</a> article. I hope you will be able to help me with this problem, which has been escalating. Now they have three pro azeri users ganging up on me and trying to start a wiki war, which is always useless.</p>
<p>I also think that baku87 may have a sockpuppet, the new user's name is druffc. He just joined, and he edited some things on the Military of Armenia article which he claimed as being POV, but then added azeri POV. I am hoping you will take time to look at this problem and if it needs be, protect the Military of Armenia from edits.</p>
<p>Please get back to me as soon as possible, I really need your help.--<a href="../../../m/o/o/User%7EMoosh88_7095.html" title="User:Moosh88">Moosh88</a> 20:05, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>SuggestBot picks articles in a number of ways, from comparing articles that need work to other articles you've edited, to choosing articles randomly (ensuring that all articles with cleanup tags get a chance to be cleaned up). It tries to recommend only articles that other Wikipedians have marked as needing work. Your contributions make Wikipedia better -- thanks for helping.</p>

<p>I've just had to block an IP 31 hours for block evasion (I did not extend Resid's main block though, as the post was to his own talk page, which technically he should be able to do), but I've given him a warning about evading blocks. However, I do not feel he cares about most of what I say, so I'd appreciate any help you can offer. Also, do you think it would be wiser for me to drop arbitration? <a href="../../../n/s/l/User%7ENSLE_4a42.html" title="User:NSLE">NSL</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">E</font></a> <sub>(<a href="../../../n/s/l/User_talk%7ENSLE_f7ec.html" title="User talk:NSLE">T</a>+<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NSLE_ad4c.html" title="Special:Contributions/NSLE">C</a>)</sub> at 01:22 <a href="../../../c/o/o/Coordinated_Universal_Time_e510.html" title="Coordinated Universal Time">UTC</a> <small>(<a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/r/March_22.html" title="March 22">03-22</a>)</small></p>

<li>I think that we should <b>always</b> use RfArb as a last resort. I'm aware that the current RfC system doesn't produce that great a result most of the time, and that mediation requires some give-and-take from both parties so isn't suitable for someone truly recalcitrant, but I think that we should still "go through the motions". I've also (selfishly) avoided looking over the actual in-depth of this, but I'm not going to be able to avoid it, am I? ^_^<br />

<p>Hi. I didn't really appreciate your edit summary in that <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Llamacon_%282nd_nomination%29_c554.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Llamacon (2nd nomination)">AFD article</a>. As the person who closed the last debate I <i>of course</i> won't close the second one; I've also provided a rationale for my closure last time which most certainly not was just a numbers game. The reason for putting your "vote" into bold is that there are AFD bots which compile running tallies on AFD debates, and AFAIK they use the <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_AFD_summary_ce8b.html#Description" title="User:Dragons flight/AFD summary">bold formatting to produce their tally</a>.

<li>Err... you've read way too much into that. My comment had nothing to do with your last close at all. As to the bots, well that's not really my problem, my script also looks for the bolds but is smart enough to have error-catching for when it's not there. I'm also aware that there are quite a few people who think that it's a vote when it's not, and I don't see any reason to facilitate that misconception. And I'm sure that <i>you</i> didn't mean any offence, but altering someone's signed comment is always a little bit provocative and should really only be done when you've got no other choice. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000">brenneman</font></a><span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="#000000" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 10:58, 21 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yegads, I burn up 83% of my last 175 edits on my post-modernist bauhaus user page and almost the only comment I get is a complaint! There ain't no justice.

<p>I had to do some archaeology to work out what this was — it seems that I made it a redirect a couple of months ago, and it's since been repeatedly deleted and recreated, as it's a redirect to (and sometimes itself <i>is</i>) an article designed to attack a Wikipedia editor.</p>

<p>I noticed that you removed from the <a href="../../../c/h/o/Chocolate.html" title="Chocolate">Chocolate</a> the sections "Chocolate in the media" and "Significant chocolate makers". You, in your edit summary, referenced the talk page regarding your removal. When I looked at the talk page, however, I was not able to find your name (a word search for Aaron returned no results) nor any explanation for the deletion of the section. While some removal may be appropriate per <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External_links</a>, the majority of the section, I believe, is of encyclopedic value. Your other edit deleting the section describing vegan chocolate I also found somewhat cavalier, as the references to particular makers of vegan chocolate could be removed without destroying a relevant reference to the fact that most, but <i>not all</i> chocolate contains milk or other dairy products. For the meantime, to facilitate further edits before a consensus is reached for the deletion of this section, I will revert your last edit which deleted "Chocolate in the media" and "Significant chocolate makers". I <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_faith_4adf.html" title="Wikipedia:Good faith">assume your good faith</a>, and hope that we can improve this article without deleting potentially relevant information. If I've missed an important policy of Wikipedia, please correct me, but I believe that the sections I have referenced are an appropriate addition.

<li><span style="color:red;"><b>Remember that this is only a preview; changes have not yet been saved!</b></span></li>
<li>Hmmm. I clearly recall writing and previewing a medium-length message. I'd like to blame some MediaWiki bug, but I probably just pulled the rookie move of ignoring the big red letters. As to finding my comment, would have been easier and more efficient than a word search to look at the history of the talk page as my signature doesn't contain "Aaron." I like the word "cavalier" as it reminds me of <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_%28TV_series%29_99f0.html" title="Dungeons &amp; Dragons (TV series)">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>, but nothing was "destroyed" was it? As the reversion that you performed indicates, everything is nice and safe in history, just hidden. I'm not sure how reverting <i>"facilitate[s] further edits"</i> but that's ok with me. And I too will continue to assume good faith. Going to the talk now.<br />

<p>I believe that the cause of truth, justice and the American way is better served by encouraging contributors to popular culture articles to provide references, some references, <i>any</i> references... rather than edit-warring and making personal claims to expertise. I also believe that TheSkunk is making a (half-assed but good-faith) effort to supply references. I think this should be encouraged. I personally suggested that he put his list of (vague, un-page-numbered) citations into the article and try to tie them to the facts they support. He did move them into the article. Editors have removed the list of references, twice, without explanation.</p>
<p>I hope you'll help keep an eye on <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freddy_Krueger_1557.html" title="Freddy Krueger">Freddy Krueger</a>, the article, that is, and I'll hope you'll agree with me that references should not be removed from the article... at least, not without discussion and consensus being reached on the talk page, and preferably only when they can be replaced with better references. What I'd like to see is for whomever challenges TheSkunk's facts to supply references for <i>their own</i> interpretations... which of course is conspicuously not happening.</p>

<p>By vandalising through an anonymous IP within the duration of the 24-hour block, J is me became both a serial vandal and an avoider of blocks. The blocking policy clearly supports the application of a further block in such cases. I blocked for one week. Or rather, I believed that I blocked for one week, but the block log shows no evidence that I did so.</p>
<p>Within 24 hours, <a href="../../../6/0/2E/User%7E60.225.218.137.html" title="User:60.225.218.137">60.225.218.137</a> removed the sockpuppet tag from J is me's user page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:J_is_me&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=42765515" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:J_is_me&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=42765515" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>, despite J is me receiving numerous warnings not to continue doing so. I blocked J is me for a month, per the blocking policy on vandalism.</p>
<p>Within 24 hours, <a href="../../../6/2/2E/User%7E62.254.168.102.html" title="User:62.254.168.102">62.254.168.102</a> made an attack upon Grant65's user page, identical to previous attacks, except that the alleged puppeteer was Licinius instead of CambridgeBayWeather, and contained Grant65's signature, falsely attributing the edit to Grant65. The IP then followed up by vandalising numerous other user pages in the same way. Although the IP was different, I interpreted this as yet another incarnation of J is me, because the vandalism was so similar, and the initial target was Grant65.</p>
<p>The blocking policy states that "Logged-in users that repeatedly vandalise may... be blocked for... up to a month. However, by going on a vandalism spree tagging every participant in the debate as a sockpuppet, and by impersonating Grant65, the vandal had become severely disruptive. With regard to disruption, the blocking policy states that "New accounts may be blocked for any length of time or permanently". J is me has only 21 edits, of which only three are to the encyclopaedia. In my view, an account with only three edits to the main space qualifies as a new account. Therefore I felt that an indefinite block was warranted. Subsequent events have proven that J is me was a sockpuppet of Licinius, and a permanent block on those grounds was superimposed upon my block. Therefore the appropriateness of the outcome for J is me is not under dispute.</p>
<p>What is under dispute is the question whether I was justified in assuming 62.254.168.102 to be J is me. <a href="../../../n/s/w/User%7ENSWelshman_fa4a.html" title="User:NSWelshman">NSWelshman</a> aka <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimididit_d3ee.html" title="User:Jimididit">Jimididit</a> aka <a href="../../../j/e/b/User%7EJebus_Christ_e9a5.html" title="User:Jebus Christ">Jebus Christ</a> now claims to have performed the vandalism through that IP, for reasons that I interpret as a violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">POINT</a>. Although I do not endorse NSWelshman as a teller of the truth, I accept that it may be the case that I have made an error of judgement. Nonetheless I have acted in good faith and with due care; the presence of multiple vandals executing virtually the same vandalism against the same target, using IPs and working from the same timezone, is easily confused with a single vandal. Fortunately there were no inappropriate consequences for J is me, which has subsequently been shown to be a sockpuppet account and accordingly blocked indefinitely.</p>

<li>I have a problem with one point in the block justification section. I have never admitted to setting a trap for snottygobble and that is not what I did. I didn't have a problem with snottygobble until after he selectively reverted my sockpuppet allegations. As I explained. I'd like to ask snottygobble to stop putting words in my mouth please. Furthermore, I only have 1 sockpuppet and it was never used to vote.

<li>Further to the above point, I believe snottygobble is attempting to aply the <b>False Dilemma</b> <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/false-dilemma.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/false-dilemma.html" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> <a href="../../../l/o/g/Logical_Fallacy_fcf4.html" title="Logical Fallacy">Logical Fallacy</a>.

<li>I thought that NSWelshman had admitted to having vandalised the articles in order to test the evenhandedness of my reverts, but I cannot find the diff. I guess I misread one of xis comments. I will redact. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 12:01, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>That Jimididit is Jebus Christ is relevant for two reasons: firstly because it wasn't until I uncovered the link between Jebus Christ and 62.etc that NSWelshman came clean; heaven knows how long this farce would have continued if I had not found evidence to relate Jimididit to 62.etc <i>via Jebus Christ</i>. And secondly because it plays a key part in establishing a long-term pattern of behaviour of this user; for example Jimididit's comment about being on a mission to hold accountable "administrators on a power trip" requires an acknowledgement of Jebus Christ for context. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User_talk%7ESnottygobble_915d.html" title="User talk:Snottygobble">Snottygobble</a> 12:01, 29 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks mate, always good to keep a man honest. I read the article, and was already familiar with Savage. I'm open to the argument that this demonstrates that at least <i>someone</i> had been talking about it, making at a meme of sorts. Multiple sources like that one would have convinced me, but I'd call one simply not enough. I could have left a longer closing note, and will correct that oversight. Give me a few more references and I'll restore it myself.

<p>Hi. I'm not sure if you recall me (Tony's student, remember?), but I opposed your successful rfa, and looking over the majority of your contributions and talk, I must concede and bashfully admit I was incorrect in my stance. You are jolly good admin and a fine chap.

<dd>Indeed. One of the very best. Big (and kind) of you to say this Zero. As someone who had watched the brenneman RFA very closely and worried till the end that it'd fail, I wondered at the time at your firm opposition; if you might not be persuaded to see him in another light. But one need not be concerned about such things, I suppose. Good things have a way of making themselves known.

<dd>Actually, I was secretly rooting for it to fail, that early support was just a smokescreen... OK, maybe not. Aaron's indeed a fine admin, and I agree with both of you, well said.

<p>I notice that with the issue to do with the block, you have discharged your duties with the utmost dignity and prescience. Therefore, despite my "vandalism" which I will remind you that was never taken out on any actual Encyclopedic pages from memory but on user:talk pages, I would like you to look in my permanent banning for being a sockpuppet. The accusations of sockpuppet are taken as proven when this cannot be true because I am not a sockpuppet. I was banned permanently for actions I have never committed. This makes me slightly bitter. However due to my "vandalism" being very difficult to prevent and I note that you seek to prevent vandalism, I would encourage you to look over the sockpuppeting issue. I would submit to the judgement of someone who I have seen has executed his duties with clear purpose and honesty. I do not think that the administrators did such in my case, as Snottygobble has in fact admitted saying he wrongly banned me. There has been very distinct connections between Snottygobble, Ambi and Grant65 who I feel sought to exclude my vote from a debate at talk:football which I think that you are familiar with. So could you please look over the sockpuppeting issue? I will submit to your judgement if you do and will create a new accoun if you conclude that I am a sockpuppet. I will also stop the inane commenting.</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely</p>
