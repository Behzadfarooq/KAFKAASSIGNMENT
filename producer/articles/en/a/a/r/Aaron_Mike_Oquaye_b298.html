<p>Hon. Prof. Mike Oquaye was born on 4th April 1944 at Osu, Accra to Mr. E. G. N Oquaye of Osu, whose ancestry is traced to Ningo, Osudoku and Adenklebi, and to Mrs. Felicia Awusika Abla Oquaye (Nee Azu) of Odumase-Krobo. Her maternal ancestry is rooted in Shai-Osudoku. Prof. was brought up at Asamankese in the Eastern Region, where he attended the Roman Catholic Primary School and Presbyterian Middle School before proceeding to Presbyterian Secondary School (PRESEC), at Odumase-Krobo, and Apam Secondary School . Having obtained the GCE "O" and "A" Level Certificates, he entered University of Ghana and later University of London , Lincoln's Inn , London. He holds B.A. (Hons.) Political Science, L.L.B. (Hons.), B.L. and PhD.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>His working experience is largely in the fields of private legal practice and lecturing in political science at the University of Ghana, in both of which he attained distinction. He is a barrister of the Supreme Court of England and Wales, a senior member of the Ghana Bar Association, and a solicitor for some leading companies and financial institutions. As an academic, he won within four years, the coveted Rockefeller Senior Scholar Award in 1993 and the Senior Fulbright Scholar Award in 1997. He was Head of the Department of Political Science, University of Ghana, Legon, and member of the University's Academic Board, the highest authority at the level of the faculties. From 1997 to 1999, he was Vice-President of the African Association of Political Science (AAPS), headquartered in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hon. Prof. Mike Oquaye is a renowned writer, who has researched and written extensively on good governance, conflicts, political education, decentralization and development, human rights, military intervention in politics, NGOs, rural development and gender issues. He advocates women's rights, including affirmative action. He is the author of the award-winning book entitled "POLITICS IN GHANA - 1972-1979", in which he depicts, inter-alia, the military as the bane of Government and Politics in Africa and recounted instances of human right abuses, conflictual politics, economic mismanagement and national decadence. He also authored "POLITICS IN GHANA - 1982-1992", which deals with the politics of revolution, CDRs, Public Tribunals, popular power, positive defiance and human rights issues of the period. His scholarly write-ups have been published in international journals such as H uman Rights Quarterly-(US), Journal of Commonwealth and Comparative Politics-( UK), African Affairs-(UK), and Review of Human Factor Studies-( Canada).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hon. Prof. Oquaye's commitment and loyalty to the New Patriotic Party (NPP) is unquestioned. Indeed, he was a founding member of the Party in 1992. He was not only the first Regional Secretary of NPP for Greater Accra in 1992 but also the first Chairman of the Party for the Ga Rural Constituency, which later became known as Ga North and South. He was the secretary of the Research Committee and a member of the first National Campaign Team of the NPP in the third quarter of 1992.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>With courage and tenacity of purpose, he worked tirelessly with other NPP statwarts, including His Excellency President J. A. Kufuor, Hon Nana Akuffo-Addo, Mr. R. R. Amponsah, Prof. Adu-Boahen, Mr. Peter Ala Adjetey, Mr. B. J. da Rocha and Mr. Odoi Sykes to weather the storms for the eventual victory of the NPP in the 2000 general elections. His journalistic contributions to the campaign and other activities of the party between 1993 and 2000 leave no room for doubt that his role was enormous.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Hon. Professor Oquaye's political pedigree should explain his steadfast commitment to the ideology and ideals of the New Patriotic Party. His late father, Mr. E.G.N. Oquaye, was a founding member of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) at Asamankese. In fact, he was the treasurer and principal financier of the UGCC, Gold Coast Party (GCP), National Liberation Movement (NLM) and United Party (UP) at Asamankese, the then vortex of politics in the Akyem traditional area. The family of Prof. Oquaye had the enviable privilege of receiving dignitaries such as Dr. J.B. Danquah and Prof. K. A. Busia in their home. While the late Okyenhene, Nana Ofori-Atta II, was in banishment to Accra, he was a regular visitor to Mr. E.G.N. Oquaye's house at Asamankese.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As a student of the University of Ghana, Hon. Prof. Mike Oquaye championed the Danquah-Busia cause with some of his mates and seniors. He strongly supported Dr. Busia's call for quick return to civilian rule to prevent the militarization of the state, and helped, together with his family to establish in 1969 the Progress Party at Osu, Accra. They remain unswervingly loyal to the UP-PP Tradition, which is the blood of the NPP.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>From 2001 to 2004, Hon. Prof. Mike Oquaye was Ghana 's High Commissioner to India, and since February 2005 he has ably handled the important and onerous position of Former Minister of Energy and currently Minister of Communications. He is a Baptist Reverend Minister, who is married to a Senior Professional Nurse, Mrs. (Major Rtd) Alberta Oquaye (Nee Asafu-Adjei). Prof is truly a "cosmopolitan" Ghanaian - a Ga, Adangbe and Krobo by birth, an Akyem, Akwapem and Fante by upbringing, an Ashanti by marriage, a Brong, Northerner, Ewe and Nzima by close political association and collaboration.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As a full-blooded Ghanaian well known for his relentless advocacy of constitionality, the rule of law, human rights, social justice and order as well as for his proven fortitude, dynamism competence, academic excellence and moral uprightness.</p>
