<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/r/Aarch.html" title="Edit section: Past">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Past</span></h2>
<p>Akillian's greatest player, Aarch is a footballing legend to the football fans of Planet Akillian. He first started his athletic career in midfield offence as Striker for Planet Akilian and captained the last team to play under the Akillian colours before the Great Ice Age. He was also the last person to use the Breath of Akillian before its disappearance, using the Breath at the moment of the Meta-Flux explosion.</p>
<p>However, during a Shadow's match, the Meta-Flux exploded, causing a huge avalanche to fall upon the stadium. Although not all of the casualties were listed, Norata (Aarch's brother) lost his left leg due to this. The explosion (also referred to as the start of the <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_Age_b26a.html" title="Ice Age">Ice Age</a>) had done more damaged than a mere avalanche, it had been so powerful that Akilian had shifted on its axis, causing a change of climate and weather and the disappearance of the Breath, Akilian's own Flux.</p>
<p>After the onset of the Ice Age Aarch and his best friend Artegor were invited to join team Shadow. He left Akillian to pursue his football career, abandoning the injured Norata and his girlfriend Adium in the process. Among the Shadows the two players somehow absorbed the team's flux and were able to play with the Smog, allowing Aarch to regain and even exceed his previous abilities. However during a match against Team Cyclops Aarch lost control of the Smog and collapsed. Realising that the Smog was making him sick and that his life was in danger he decided to leave Team Shadow, an act which caused a rift between himself and Artegor that ended their friendship.</p>
<p>He was sent to the Wambas home planet, where he recovered slowly in the care and protection of a medic, Dame Simbai. What he did in the years after his recovery is unknown, but at some point he encountered Professor Clamp, a robotic expert and engineer, who encouraged him to return to Akillian and pursue his dream of reviving the planet's Akilian's once great football team.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/r/Aarch.html" title="Edit section: Personality">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Personality</span></h2>
<p>Fifteen years ago, Aarch was noted as an ambitious youth with dreams of becoming big in football. His passion in the game was so strong that, even after the start of the Ice Age on Akilian, Aarch continued playing as a member of the Shadows.</p>
<p>Now aged in wisdom and appearance, Aarch still retains his ambitions of becoming big, although now it is by being the coach of the GF Cup’s victors. He rarely loses his temper, although when he does it is usually when he feels let down by his friends and players, a good example being when the Snow Kid’s were to over-confident about their second match against the Wambas in the GF Cup. He is a fair man who believes he shouldn’t treat any of his players with special attention, regarding them as ‘just students’.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/r/Aarch.html" title="Edit section: Family &amp; Friends">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Family &amp; Friends</span></h2>
<p>The only relatives of Aarch shown in the series are his brother, Norata, sister-in-law Kira and nephew, Rocket.</p>

<p>Norata was also a player Team Akilian. His football career was brought to a halt when he lost his leg during the onset of the ice-age and had to have it replaced by a prosthetic model. Determined to remain behind to help rebuild Akillian, Norata was simultaneously abandoned by both his brother and his wife Kira, who left him to bring up their son, Rocket, alone. Afraid of what might happen to Rocket if he pursued his dream of becoming a footballer and still angry at his brother, Norata initially refused to let Rocket join the Snow Kids.</p>
<p>When Norata finally lets Rocket join Aarch’s team, he makes a bet. If the Snow Kids lose their next match, Rocket must stay with him. If they win, he can stay on the team. Unfortunately for Norata, the Snow Kids are victorious, leaving him alone once again. At one point he visits Rocket personally, only to find him asleep with Tia watching over him. After confessing how Rocket has no mother, Norata announces to Tia that she is now his responsibility and that he wishes to have no more business with his son anymore.</p>
<p>Although Aarch knows nothing of Tia and his brother’s private meeting, he takes on a somewhat fatherly role to Rocket after noticing on several occasions how Norata fails to appear to congratulate his son after the team’s victory like the other parents. He never misses an opportunity though to stress that their relationship here is only as a coach and his player, although Aarch still takes time out of his busy schedule to talk things through with his nephew concerning relationship problems or family issues.</p>
<p>How Clamp and Aarch first meet is unsure and unseen in the series, although they discuss it well and rely on each other a lot. Clamp knows nothing of his past at first, but when confronted by Bleylock, is forced to remember that he was the scientist that helped create the Meta-Flux in the first place. His planet of origins is unknown, although it can be suspected he is from Akillian also.</p>
<p>Dame Simbai is another member of the Snow Kid's staff whom Aarch is close with. Simbai having once taken care of Aarch on the Wamba's planet and nursing him back to health when he fell sick from the Flux. Aarch and Simbai were reunited when the Snow Kids traveled to Planet Wamba for a friendly match and Dame Simbai joined the team as its medical officer. Aarch seems unaware that Dame Simbai works for the Flux Society, or that she is investigating the Snow Kids.</p>
<p>Before the Great Catastrophe and the beginning of the Ice Age Aarch was involved in a relationship with his team mate Adium, now President of the Football League's Akillian branch. The relationship ended when Aarch left Akillian to join Team Shadow. Like Norata Adium felt Aarch abandoned her and refused to forgive him. Though they remain friends Aarch's attempts to rekindle a romantic relationship ended in failure.</p>
<p>With a broken-relationship beyond repair, Aarch is inspired to encourage Rocket and Tia's relationship, when he notices that his nephew has also been avoiding Tia. His advice helps a great deal and changes Rocket's views.</p>
