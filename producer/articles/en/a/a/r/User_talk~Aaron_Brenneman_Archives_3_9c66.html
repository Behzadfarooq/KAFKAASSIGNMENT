<p><font size="5"><font>Yes, I am familiar with the reasons under which the IP trace for evidence of sockpuppetry would only occur in dire circumstances. I was just curious about IgnoreAllRules as it seems he was targeting <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">User:Tony Sidaway</a> and I saw that you had reverted him several times.

<p><font size="5"><font>Not to further badger, but I was noticing that you didn't make any edits from this account from 02:15, October 18, 2005 to 02:46, October 18, 2005.

<li><font size="5"><font>Aaron, I don't fault the use of sock accounts, and respect that since you use your real name, one may come in handier for you than it would for me, not that you do use one. A brief spree of obvious vandalism, I could forgive that...no big deal...I know you and Tony are at odds and if indeed you performed these vandalisms, well, they weren't that bad overall, and at least you and others quickly reverted them. Now in regards to someone tracking your IP...I don't have that capability but noticed the vandalism while on RC Patrol..the username IgnoreAllRules (redlined) struck me as a potential vandal, but I was overedited by another with a faster trigger doing the revert. I often rely on <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">Occam's Razor</a> due to nature of my real life job...the easiest explanation is usually the right one. Now as far as a breach of admin ethics regarding an unauthorized IP query...I am not familiar with that set of rules but not sure they matter as proof any more than my little time flow above described...I mean, even if the IP was the same, you could always say that your little brother was messing around while you were away for a few minutes. I know you have morte integrity than to want to hide, so, as you've requested, I'll butt out.

<p><font size="5"><font>Aaron. I saw your note earlier in the day and am responding properly now. From what happened, and from what I see on Splash's page, I think you're currently under what has been called "wikistress". Wikipedia can be very callous, unfriendly, unfair, and sharp. The main reason it is so is because it is populated by humans.&#160;:)</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>It doesn't have to be though—or if it is, it doesn't have to affect you much. Don't let it. Realize this for what it is: an impressively imperfect project aimed at creating an impossible thing. It is, or can be seen as, noble, and I believe some day many years from now its descendent will be. <i>We</i> are the ephemeral, transitory, invisible, anonymous workers helping it toward that goal. When it is achieved we'll be long gone. It is altruism that keeps us here, now, while it is massively, almost unimaginably, imperfect. A little more imperfection, a few more silly edits, a bit of reverting here and warring there, someone being impossible—don't let it trouble you. If someone insists on a view that you believe is incorrect, by all means engage him and tell him why you think it should be done another way. Don't forget the other part of the bargain: listen to what he says. Try for a solution. If it is impossible, try to do the right thing (this can be hard). But whatever you do, if you find it includes feeling that it might be a good idea to vandalize a couple of pages, even if temporarily, even for a short while, it's likely best to take a break.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>With the current disagreement, I believe most editors who have an interest in deletion policy on WP will agree with the version you're trying to keep on WP:DRV. That can be seen very simply—that version is theirs. Tony feels that it is invalid, for two reasons. The first is he believes "if in doubt don't delete" is a kind of "chief precept" of deletion policy that should be prominently placed in DR. The second is he believes DR should not be restricted to questions of what has come to be termed "process". This second issue is actually more complicated than it appears. I think we're all actually closer to agreement than most think we are, but it will need to be discussed with some care in the coming weeks/months.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>The first issue is less complicated. One thing I'd like to say in Tony's defense is that he keeps being told that his addition of IIDDD to the template is inadvisable, but I don't recall anyone actually explaining (or attempting to explain) why (I may be wrong though. Has anyone?). It is true that the current version has wide acceptance among the editors who're actually involved with the running and working of DR. However, if someone says that something's not right with it because it conflicts with policy, that needs to be examined, whether or not most of us agree on the current version. I can post my view on this, later. Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong, but perhaps with a discussion on the actual merits of IIDDD, we might find ourselves—all of us, Tony, Kappa, Splash, Rossami, an everyone else—coming to an agreeable solution.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>You are an excellent editor, Aaron. Too valuable to loose. Please be happy and well. I'm going to be away for a while myself, so I will not be able to contribute to any ensuing discussion, but I'm sure everyone concerned will be able to decide something satisfactory.

<p><font size="5"><font>(Was just about to go to bed, forgive any thinkos and/or rambling) I don't know when I first encountered Tony, but it was months ago, and I think even before you did, just in the normal course of editing, and his talk page has been on my watchlist since. I've always respected his judgment, dedication, and helpfulness. Even after he restored one of my first, zealous, speedies. (As an aside, I don't know how it is possible for anyone to get on Radiant's bad side or vice versa, but it happened. Haven't talked much recently, but Radiant and I used to see each other a lot, indeed he nominated me for my adminship. He is one of the most open and reasonable people I know on WP.) I'm pretty sure I remember way back in the primordial depths of time when this <i>thing</i> between you and Tony started. It was about some VFD debate, likely a school, right? Then you encountered each other on VFD again and again, it spread to talk pages, and spread more. I'm not even sure when we met, Aaron, (though I just realized that silly note at the top of this page is from July), but I've had enough rational discussions with you, and seen you around as well, that I long ago came to the conclusion that I could trust and respect your judgment, dedication, and helpfulness. I think you (plural) are level-headed and reasonable, and I would point a needy editor to either of you. You (plural) can also be abrasive, stubborn, and, yes, coy. That happens, somehow, mostly only when you encounter each other, or the issues that spark this. My point is: <i>why?</i></font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>I must admit (don't know if I should be guilty about it, but I'm guilty about not knowing&#160;:) that your admission hasn't really changed my opinion of you (good judgment, dedicated, stubborn, etc.) in that I still have cmplete confidence that I would trust a decision by you, and that you still have that inborn WP hatred of all vandals. Not to compare them, but neither of Tony's RFC have changed my confidence in him either. I think, independent of each other and the general tussle, you are best. What have you gained from it, besides much undue stress and insanity? I'm sure it's been suggested before, but now would be the time to <i>just drop it</i>. It isn't anything that I think mediation, or another RFC, or even (Jimbo forbid) and RFAr could help. This doesn't mean you give in, or thatI think you two can become best wikifriends overnight. But how about if you refused to engage each other? Period (well, it was a question mark). I'm convinced that by now your banter does nothing but inflame each other. Watching this slowly spiral away has been painful for many I'm sure. I've seen both of you lose control in different ways and to different degrees. But if we all are to accept your apology as sincere (I certainly do) the least you could do is start over and give it a shot. Disputes between good-faith, trustworthy editors are worse that trolls and vandals: they divide the community, and create factions where none need to be. Don't ever forget how much good you can still do for this wonderful encyclopedia, but also try to think up how much more you could have done in that time you wasted thinking about Tony. Again, my point is: <i>why?</i> Not just why have this dispute, but why are we all here (including Tony)? Let that guide you.</font></font></p>

<p><font size="5"><font>Basically the transwiki process has become this kind of endless cycle that never gets completed. I wrote the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETranswiki_log_fe21.html#Instructions" title="Wikipedia:Transwiki log">instructions</a> there, and hope they make some sense. An article is transwikied because, presumably, it doesn't belong here. The TL, as a record of transwikied articles, is a list of articles that need cleanup in some way. Just take any article and deal with it appropriately (merge, send to AFD) and strike it out when you are done (or upon resolution of AFD) or if it is encyclopedic enough now (some are old enough to have changed substantially). Any stricken entry can be archived whenever. If we take <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corn_soup.html" title="Corn soup">corn soup</a>, I'd say find somewhere to redirect it or just take it to AFD as it was transwikied to Wikibooks Cookbook <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Corn_soup" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Cookbook:Corn_soup">wikibooks:Cookbook:Corn_soup</a> 2 months ago with out any changes since, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a how-to (recipe). Finally any resolved Wiktionary entries should have {{<a href="../../../t/r/a/Template%7ETranswikied_to_Wiktionary_a460.html" title="Template:Transwikied to Wiktionary">transwikied to Wiktionary</a>}} replaced with {{<a href="../../../t/r/a/Template%7ETranswiki_to_Wiktionary_Finished_cab7.html" title="Template:Transwiki to Wiktionary Finished">Transwiki to Wiktionary Finished</a>}}. (Very few of the archived ones do, but going back and fixing that is probably lower priority atm.) That's it in a nutshell, did it make sense?

<dd><font size="5"><font>Your proposal involved a breach of Wikipedia policy (admins are not permitted to stand for confirmation except in the rare case of being ordered to by the ArbCom, something which has only happened twice), and furthermore (if followed) would have extended conflict rather than reduced it. Wikipedia is not a dueling ground, and we do not need people exacerbating disputes through grandstanding. Fortunately, Scimitar and Tony, both being adults, were able to resolve their dispute and reach a position that was mutually acceptable to the both of them without having to go at it with swords and sticks in the middle of the public square -- something which you clearly would have desired. Your bloodthirstiness for Tony's sysop flag has been noted, and is that that of which you should be ashamed. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 15:08, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</font></font>

If there is a <i>policy</i> prohibiting voluntary reconfirmations, I'd like to know where it is, and I'd like to object to it.

<p><font size="5"><font>I think your argument is basically correct, and dispassionate. (I'm not sure if Mr. Sidaway's view is always binary -- he sees grey sometimes, but once he's certain, his grey becomes the <i>perfect</i>, only acceptable grey -- but the briefer way you've explained it is better for persuasion.) That said, I think it is highly likely that his response will be defensive, and it is also highly likely he will dismiss your view with a mention of the recent past events. Still, this is a good thing to have in the record. I'm also secretly hopeful that, whatever his defensive public face, he might privately take these criticisms to heart and work to improve.</font></font></p>

<p><font size="5"><font>Yes, you're right. I'm sorry. I've been rather virulent in that DRV debate, haven't I? I just don't see a whisker of reason to restore the first article, and the second is only teenage spewage (imio). And Chalst has twice recently tried to tell when/where I should or shouldn't edit, and anyone who tries to so lecture me is likely to be reminded of the first two syllables of the website's name.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>Anyway, yes, everything's ok (though RL is trying at present), and thanks for asking. I'll cool myself down. I just noticed the talk page for DRV. It fell off my watchlist in the move, and there's been <i>loads</i> going on. Annoying, but the outcome seems to be little change. I am concerned about the standing inconsistency between DRV and undel policy, though. The proposal changes the policy, after all, despite the protestations that such is somehow impossible. Perhaps today's frame-of-mind isn't the one with which I should make such a change, though. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 04:28, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</font></font></p>

<dd><font size="5"><font>So I learnt a new word. I didn't know one could recidivise(?). Anyway, no I won't, but then I won't give experienced editors who exhibit such sorry misunderstandings an easy ride, either. The trouble with your RfA is that I don't think a single incident need be taken as evidence of calamitous judgement from a familiar editor. But then, it was quite a serious infraction. But then, you certainly wouldn't do that again. But then others did point out some other lapses. But then they (the opposers) have so many sour grapes they could make wine, and I didn't want to join them. And I don't feel neutral about your RfA. So I'm left being unable to vote at all. Which is complicated.

<p><font size="5"><font>Well, I'm glad to see you're back to your usual levelheaded self. As you probably noticed, you recently had me thinking that you already were an admin (and IIRC, David thought the same).

<p><font size="5"><font>Aaron, I think you would be a good admin, but the timing of this RfA is awful. At any time, this would have brought out the worst type of partisan warfare in some. But two weeks after that incident, many of us who would otherwise have supported you will be unable to do so. I just opposed <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplefeltangel_71dc.html" title="User:Purplefeltangel">User:purplefeltangel</a> for vandalism three months ago, it would be hipocrisy to support this now. This <i>will</i> fail, and some of your more partisan critics will enjoy it. Can I suggest that either now, or immediately the trend becomes obvious, you in good spirit withdraw this - humbly aknowledging that the community's trust has been damaged by the sockpuppetry. If you do, you will score some credibility points with others, and I for one will be happy to support you in a month or so.

<dd><font size="5"><font>Hi! I've removed your nomination. The problem is the pileon votes which will increase. RFA is the forum to ascertain the suitability of a candidate for adminship. For feedback, an RFC on yourself would be better. Having your nomination go on would be pointless IMHO, and unnecessarily increase the server load. Regards, PS I think the latter pronounciation would be fine. <i>Nichalp</i> is a combination of a few letters of my name, and surname.

<ul>
<li><font size="5"><font>Oh. All right then. I must be honest and say that seems, well, overly officious. I'm aware that an RfC would be the place had I been <i>seeking</i> feedback, but here I was trying to elicit <i>more</i> of what had been forthcoming. As to the "pile on" I'm not sure how that's a problem, as if they had brought points that I could improve that hadn't been touched yet, that would be the <i>point</i>. Finally, server load... that leaves me gobsmacked. You've got a <i><b>templated sig</b></i>. I'm not fussed by the removal <i>per se</i> but, well, yeah.

<dd><font size="5"><font>Well, the general consensus is that if an RFA receives oppose votes exceed the support votes by 10, then the RFA should be removed. (Its in the WP:RFA talk page archives, about a month back). Do you still find it officious? I know I'm guilty of templated signatures, but its a few bytes only as opposed to an rfa bid which is in tens of kbs. I was actually referring to the fact that the page was ~400kb.

<p><font size="5"><font>My first experience with the school debate was with the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Benjamin_Cory_Elementary_School_f5b7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Benjamin Cory Elementary School">Afd for Benjamin Cory Elementary School</a>. You may remember that this discussion actually extended into the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_Benjamin_Cory_Elementary_School_441a.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Benjamin Cory Elementary School">talk page</a>. At about that time I started to experiment with essentially the redirect approach, as Hypocrite describes above. The first page I tried was based on a, then, recent <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Charlotte_High_School_5be9.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Charlotte High School">Vfd for Charlotte HS</a>. You can see my effort at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_Public_Schools_ae2a.html" title="Charlotte Public Schools">Charlotte Public Schools</a>. I was trying to create a template approach that could be used to see the hierarchy of the schools as well as make it relatively easy for people transfer the information to a new and better article if someone saw fit to expand one of the schools.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>After the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bartlett_High_School%2C_Bartlett%2C_Illinois_e270.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bartlett High School, Bartlett, Illinois">Afd for Bartlett High School</a> I again tried this approach at the <a href="../../../e/l/g/Elgin_Area_School_District_U46_ff28.html" title="Elgin Area School District U46">Elgin Area School District U46</a>.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>After the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Chester_County_High_School_b487.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chester County High School">Afd for Chester_County_High_School</a> I created the following <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chester_County_School_District_df6f.html" title="Chester County School District">Chester County School District</a> article to allow the school article to have some real context.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>And finally I experimented with a very long list of schools in hampshire after the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Court_Moor_School_f224.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Court Moor School">Afd Court Moor School</a> although I did not really complete the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_Hampshire_area1_2455.html" title="List of schools in Hampshire area1">school district list</a> to my satisfaction in that case.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>Early on I was labeled as a deletionist by Silensor and Nicodemus75 but I do not count myself as one. I have always tried to be a constructive voice in this debate. I know these pages are not perfect but i saw them as an experimental compromise. The most important thing for these school articles is that they are not hanging in cyber space with no context. I think this was summed up well by yourself at the recent <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2005_October_26_a69c.html#Grove_School_moved_to_Grove_School_.28Madison.2C_Connecticut.29" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2005 October 26">Afd for Grove School</a>:</font></font></p>

<p><font size="5"><font>I mean that sincerely. Some of your advice I will probably heed, however when it comes to Nicodemous, the only way he'll get any kind of olive branch from me is if he stops this hardline BS. I'm willing to compromise on the school issue, however I've not seen any indication he is at this time. And if an RFC is started against me it's started against me. From what I've seen of that process it's about as useful as the AFD School debates have been, (ie:nothing happens at all except more bickering with no ultimate conclusion one way or the other), so no worries on me keeping clear as I have no interest in that kind of garbage even if I am the topic.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 18:40, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</font></font></p>

And I knew you aren't friends with specifically at least one of them, so I knew it wasn't some wikifriends thing; yet all the users are recognizable admins, so I was really just curious.

<p><font size="5"><font>Since you're begging for it. As per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nicodemus75&amp;oldid=27179381" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nicodemus75&amp;oldid=27179381" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>, you're right - I <b>DO</b> think you are a "deletionist vandal" among other things. My earlier attempt to reconcile with you after your disgusting and inherently racist use of the term "nigger" in the context of saying "even they [them niggers] call each other that" was patently ignored <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aaron_Brenneman&amp;oldid=23388343#Gee.2C_that_was_fast" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aaron_Brenneman&amp;oldid=23388343#Gee.2C_that_was_fast" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> with no response on your page or on mine. My apologies on that occasion were not replied to, and my declaration that my use of the term "deletionist" is in no way intended as personal insult or attack went unanswered, and in fact you have since insisted on several occasions that my use of the term is a personal attack, including your removal of my comments including the term "deletionist" and even the phrase "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete" (which is just a statement of identification of behavior of certain editors and I am baffled at how that could be construed as a personal attack). Your ignoring of my attempt to mend the fence I see as typical of your behavior in general, which had included a block request against me for calling you a "deletionist". I see a continuation of this sort of nonsense in many of your actions including the most recent and shameful incident of your vandalism, motivated by your clear hatred for Tony and his positions.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>Now the current debate where you pontificate from on high as some well-read and researched editor on the history of consensus on school articles, from a <b>clearly</b> partisan pro-deletion perspective. I respect the fact that you may have a different philosophical position than I do on schools. What I do not respect are many of your comments and tactics. I am frankly sick and tired of you constantly insisting that you aren't a partisan, that you don't favour the deletion of school stubs and "non-notable" school articles defacto, when you clearly are every bit as much a partisan as I am. The constant self-righteous, holier-than-thou approach to school debating is offensive in the extreme, particularly when it is peppered with false statements to buttress your position. If I went around, claiming there clear, majority consensus keep on ALL elementary schools, you (and others) would <b>rightly</b> call me on it and be outraged that I was fraudulently trying to convince people of falsehoods. If I came back and claimed, "Oh that's how it was months ago" you would in all likelihood be rightly suspicious of my claims considering my history of participation in the debate or at least suggest that I get my shit in order when making claims and make sure they are backed up by the evidence - using a couple of selective AfD results on the fly, obviously wouldn't cut it.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>Based on the history of interaction, I am not sure how we can reconcile at this stage, because you don't respect anything I say, and I essentially consider you to be a <b>bad faith</b> contributor to many discussions on WP, admittedly backed by offense taken at your latently racist remark. (Just to be totally clear, it is not the word "NIGGER" that I am so offended by, it is the phrase "even <b>they</b> call each other that" stating by implication that "they" are the "niggers" in question). If you want to debate and even bandwagon for school deletion - fine. But I do not think false claims and the whole self-righteous act when it comes to AfD that "you are all partisans and I am not" is a bunch of condescending, insulting tripe that is intended to pander to certain elements of the WP community so your next go at adminship actually has something better than a snowball's chance in hell. To top it off, you make even more galling statements that "[Nicodemus] has done worse" than calling people jerks. When it is you who have insulted me (and others) with your disgusting use of a racial epithet while insisting "oh, but it was sarcasm" and "Oh I am not a racist". I'm sure you'll tell me next how you "even have some black friends" or some other nonsense.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>As far as I'm concerned, the ball is in your court to do something more substantive than just offer a string of glib apologies everytime you do something offensive.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 09:48, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</font></font></p>

<li><font size="5"><font>That reply was uncalled for. If <i>I've</i> misinterpreted that remark, than <i>others</i> might do the same. The phrase <i>"Special Olympics of Data where every factoid is on equal footing with every other factoid, where my fountain pen is on par with, say, New York City"</i> implies pretty strongly that the Special Olympics are in some way deficient. If I don't understand a remark, and try to engage you in some dialog about it, snapping that I "shouldn't criticize" means that the error could only be mine.

<dd><font size="5"><font><i>...openness to input is generally considered a positive trait</i> Buckie, you didn't provide "input", you scolded me -- without explanation -- for using a phrase in a way that you misread, simply telling me "don't do that": getting anything resembling an actual explanation out of you was like pulling teeth with scissors, and that's not input as I would describe it. If you want to provide actual input, be my guest, but if you're unwilling or unable to do so, don't bother.<br />
Ordinarily, I'm unsympathetic to writers who complain that they've been misunderstood, even myself, but in this case it's clear that you read the words "Special Olympics" and you ceased to see its context, metaphorical meaning, or anything else surrounding it. Your response was so knee-jerk you couldn't even get my name right, despite it being in my sig and in big letters at the top of my Talk Page.<br />
If you don't want to offend, back up, at least minimally, what you're talking about; understand what you're talking about; and don't force people to play Twenty Questions in order to figure out what you're trying to say.<br />
If there's any way phrasing is ambiguous I'll change it, but I stand by my usage of the term.<br />

<li><font size="5"><font>I know I said I was moving on, but that last reply was just hilarious. I didn't get your name wrong despite it being in giant flashing letters at the top of your user page. I simply mashed an extra key when I typed it. And your complaint that I was obtuse I find tempered by the fact that rather than simply saying "and there is no R in my name" you choose to make an oblique comment that it took another 75 words for me to understand.<br />
I have in fact gone and read and re-read your comment several times since we started this strange little dance. I still think that it was poorly worded. I'm not sure how you would have liked me to phrase that, however I did not intend to "scold" you. If you could tell me what I should have said, that would be great.<br />
I do seem to have gotten you on the wrong side of the bed, and I hope that no lasting damage has been done. You have been pretty abrupt with me, though, and I'd hope that even if you disagree with everything else I've been saying you'll consider that.<br />

<p><font size="5"><font><a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> states:</font></font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="5"><font>Vandalism is any addition, deletion, or change to content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of the encyclopedia (such as swearing, deleting letters to make inappropriate words, etc.)</font></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="5"><font>That establishes three criteria that must be met for an act to be considered vandalism:</font></font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="5"><font>The act must be performed intentionally</font></font></li>
<li style="list-style: none"></li>
<li><font size="5"><font>The act must cause harm to the encyclopedia proper (as opposed to the community SURROUNDING the encyclopedia)</font></font></li>
<li><font size="5"><font>The act must be performed with malicious intent</font></font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="5"><font>Now, that deletion meets criterion no. 1 is indisputable, unless you want to argue that all listings on AfD are done with a gun to the head.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>To see how deletion meets no. 2, one must realize that an encyclopedia, properly understood, is a repository of ALL human knowledge. WP:NOT may say otherwise, but WP:NOT is wrong and thus can be ignored. Thus, removal of knowledge from the encyclopedia directly causes harm to the encyclopedia by working against its proper aim of containing all human knowledge.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>For criterion no. 3, one must look at <a href="../../../a/y/n/Ayn_Rand_c548.html" title="Ayn Rand">Ayn Rand's</a> proof of how all bad acts (and I showed, above, how deletion of an article on any <i>bona fide</i> subject in an encyclopedia is a bad act) are necessarily done with malicious intent. Unfortunately, her explicit proof is not available on the Internet and her non-fiction writings are not widely available in publicly-accessible libraries (and I don't expect you to buy a book from a bookstore just to see one argument) but the entire theme of her novel <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> centers around that precise fact.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>Thus, as I have just shown, deletion is vandalism and may be properly called such. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 14:23, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</font></font></p>

<p><font size="5"><font>Could you please take a look at this? I think you have far more experience in these things than I do.

Predictably, the AfD is now a mess of anonymous, unsigned, and vandalized votes as well as incivility and personal attacks. Someoen changed my nomination to "keep this beloved webcomic," there's posts in there about how I'm "blatantly lying" and "Clearly, whoever put this up for deletion doesn't understand even the most cursory elements of the artistic field he's trying to 'edit,'" somebody created <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Megatokyo_1ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Megatokyo">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Megatokyo</a> to try to make a point, etc. I'm sure this isn't the first time bloggers have tried to disrupt Wikipedia by spamming AfD, so there has to be some policy or precedent for how to clean up this mess, isn't there? <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 02:23, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</font></font></p>

I'd suggest that your comments to me at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> were patronising at best. Despite my personal disregard for blogs in general, an examination of the argument shows that the "keep" side made no case: No links demonstrating mentions in media, no statements in parliment about Bloggin Toires, etc etc. Had they done so, I'd happily have seen this article kept. These aren't meant to be me-too pile-ons, they are meant to be debates. That I have a different view than you is no reason to malign my character.<br />

On the other hand, blogs are a subset of websites that probably warrant some attention of their own. They could be handled at Talk:WEB (sic) adequately, but there's already a whole load of concurrency there as it is. So maybe somewhere of its own, with a prominent link from both the project page of WP:WEB and its talk page (Snowspinner already put one on talk, I think) is enough? If that causes the discussion on blogs to go nowhere, it can be brought back to WP:WEB. I see what you mean about Balkanization, though. I don't think there was any need to for Snowspinner or Gerard to delete the redirected page, though, a redirect is easily reverted. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:45, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</font></font></p>

Another summer night you'll someday fly,
A dwindling world below your weary feet,
You cannot hope to know until you try,

Bright feathers grow, your fledgling wings spread fast,
You soar above red sand and blue-white ice,
Bright feathers grow, your fledgling wings spread fast,
You soar above red sand and blue-white ice,

Rise from your bed, worn body, and frayed skin,
Steel nights of silent pain; bronze days of rage,
Now leave behind a life that's closing in,
Fly far from death in evil wars they wage,

Fly free of summer's burn and winter's bite,
Someday In a blue heaven you'll alight.

<li><font size="5"><font>I wasn't impressed with the apparent coyness of the responses. True, 100% indicates everyone agrees and anything less is simply "rough", but I'm not going to place my bet blindly. If RI had (for example) said "here's a linked decision, and here's what I would have decided" then I would have had something to go on.</font></font></li>
<li><font size="5"><font>I generally vote "oppose" in any instance where I'm unsure. I recently did otherwise, and found upon closer conversation that the person was clearly not ready to be an administrator. Seeing as how it's effectivly impossible to dead-min someone, I'd prefer to err on the side of caution.</font></font></li>
<li><font size="5"><font>However, I'm way more worried about attacks upon people based upon their votes, especially when those attacks are, in effect, telling them to either "shut up or go away entirely."</font></font></li>

<p><font size="5"><font>Your comment: <i>"Use the talk page" doesn't mean "leave a notice that you've blindly reverted to your version"</i> seems unnecessarily harsh to me. Surely my detailed explanation of my reasoning does not count as leaving a notice that I've blindly reverted to my version. Indeed as I explained, Cryptic has evidently missed the point. Speedy deletion is always something that we should be prepared to reverse; it's always subject to challenge, and a good faith claim of authorship should be enough to justify undeletion in this case. We shouldn't engage in pointless alienation of new editors when we have a perfectly good mechanism for dealing with suspected copyright infringements.</font></font></p>

<p><font size="5"><font>I agree with you, we cannot just take the word of an expert or authority on deletion debates. They are not exempt from providing sources or evidence of notability when asked to do so.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>Most people who visit AFD value the opinions of experts, and so even if they are new to Wikipedia, they will usually be able to influence the debate as happened on the second Able and Baker AFD. However, in the end, if the expert only brought a lousy reason to keep (e.g. "<b>Keep</b>, I am an expert and this is notable"), their vote will not carry any more weight than any other one else. It is the responsibility of the expert to provide good enough arguments to prove that something should be kept, and if the community rejects their advice it has been rejected. The most valuable contribution an expert can come with is <i>references</i>. On <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Michael_Francis_Ward_c882.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Michael Francis Ward">this AFD debate</a>, I was at first quite unsure what to vote. But then <a href="../../../g/u/s/User%7EGustavus_faab.html" title="User:Gustavus">Gustavus</a>, who wrote the article and who obviously is quite knowledgable in the field of old British politics, provided the references I needed to be able to trust his judgment and vote "keep". There is a big difference between that and just asserting expertise. An expert needs to command respect, rather than demand it.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>There would be nothing preventing me from writing an article on myself. I could easily provide references that I have finished second in the B-group of a Grand Prix tournament <a href="http://www.sotrasjakk.net/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=17" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sotrasjakk.net/modules/sections/index.php?op=viewarticle&amp;artid=17" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>, <i>won</i> a junior chess tournament <a href="http://home.online.no/~sjakkfor/usf/bgp/fanas_hostturnering00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://home.online.no/~sjakkfor/usf/bgp/fanas_hostturnering00.html" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, and that I am the 1453rd strongest chess player in Norway. I could declare that since I have written a large number of chess articles, I must be an expert on the field (tsk tsk <a href="../../../e/l/o/Elo_rating.html" title="Elo rating">Elo rating</a> 1212 is a class 4 player, the second lowest class, in Norway, so please don't tell anyone...) and that an article on myself must therefore be encyclopedic.

<p><font size="5"><font>Hi. I saw your comment on the Lighthouse (chat site) article that I asked to be deleted, as the sole contributor, and it thus fulfilled the criteria for speedy deletion.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>I am now in the process of merging all of the articles about individual talkers in to the main <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talker.html" title="Talker">talker</a> article (which I may then reduce in size later), and have mostly done it as the vast majority of the articles I was the sole contributor. I speedy deleted Lighthouse (chat site), Crossroads (chat site) and Ncohafmuta on the basis of not being suitably notable, and merged the remainder - <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surfers_%28talker%29.html" title="Surfers (talker)">Surfers (talker)</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/s/Resort_%28talker%29.html" title="Resort (talker)">Resort (talker)</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foothills_%28talker%29.html" title="Foothills (talker)">Foothills (talker)</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lintilla_%28talker%29.html" title="Lintilla (talker)">Lintilla (talker)</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fantasia%27s_multiple_worlds.html" title="Fantasia's multiple worlds">Fantasia's multiple worlds</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleepy%27s_multiple_worlds.html" title="Sleepy's multiple worlds">Sleepy's multiple worlds</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat_Chat_%28talker%29_9250.html" title="Cat Chat (talker)">Cat Chat (talker)</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cheesehouse_%28talker%29.html" title="Cheesehouse (talker)">Cheesehouse (talker)</a> all in to the main <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talker.html" title="Talker">talker</a> article.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>But I have some problems, and I would appreciate your help.</font></font></p>
<ol>
<li><font size="5"><font>I would like to speedy delete <a href="../../../c/r/y/Crystal_Palace_%28chat_site%29_1672.html" title="Crystal Palace (chat site)">Crystal Palace (chat site)</a>, as I was the sole contributor until about 4 days ago, when a bunch of anons started vandalising it. I put it up for AFD, and the anons then all voted to keep it. What is the process there? AFAIK it fulfils the criteria for speedy deletion. Its clearly not suitably notable for its own article per Wikipedia guidelines, not having 5,000 regular users etc, not being mentioned in the media, not affecting anything else, not being the first of anything, and so forth. Its only claim to notoriety are the controversies associated with it, which, in retrospect, is not a good reason to make an article. Whilst I have mentioned the controversies in the talker article, I didn't explicitly refer to the talker (i.e. I didn't give their name), primarily because some people viewed that as an "attack", and there were views that no matter how factually and unbiased it was presented, it was nonetheless never going to be neutral. Given that its not referenced anywhere, I don't see the point in merging it. Given that all of the others have been merged, I can't see how it can justify being the only one that has its own article. Therefore, it should be deleted. I just don't see why it can't be speedied though, as it meets the criteria.</font></font></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><font size="5"><font>I have already merged all useful content from <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planes_of_Existence_%28talker%29_ec56.html" title="Planes of Existence (talker)">Planes of Existence (talker)</a> in to <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talker.html" title="Talker">talker</a>, and I was the only contributor to that article until 4 days ago, and remain the only contributor other than vandals. It was nominated for deletion to prove a point. I would like the page to simply redirect to Talker, and I believe that as the only real contributor, I can do that.</font></font></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><font size="5"><font>I didn't create the <a href="../../../u/n/a/UNaXcess_984a.html" title="UNaXcess">UNaXcess</a> page, so don't have authority to merge it. UNaXcess is the first ever talker, albeit it didn't connect to the internet (the first internet talker was Cat Chat). Again, for consistency, I would like for it to be merged. I have already merged all useful content in to <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talker.html" title="Talker">talker</a> and would like the page to be a simple REDIRECT.</font></font></li>
</ol>
<p><font size="5"><font>Now, based on the rules for inclusion, several of these articles are suitably notable in their own right - indeed most of them, other than CP, Sleepy's, Fantasia's and the ones that I speedied. I guess Cheesehouse might not be, as it wasn't the first of anything, but it was still sort of the first, since it was basically an extension of Cat Chat (opened on the same port, opened the day that cat chat closed, etc).</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>I personally don't mind either way if these articles should exist individually or as merged, but the general consensus seems to be that the talker community really only existed for about 5 years, had minimal impact and wasn't all that popular. It was really just an alternative to the more popular <a href="../../../i/r/c/IRC_b274.html" title="IRC">IRC</a>. Hence I'd like them to be merged.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>There are also the issues of these people who have come to Wikipedia to launch personal attacks on me and disrupt Wikipedia, but that's another issue, which I have raised elsewhere.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>Anyway, would you be able to help with the merge process? Thanks. Also, can you look at <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talker.html" title="Talker">talker</a> and see what tips you'd like to give? I gather that it probably should be shorter, however, since the <a href="../../../m/u/d/MUD_b442.html" title="MUD">MUD</a> article also includes 46 separate articles about individual MUDs, I personally think that the length is okay.

<p><font size="5"><font>Now I notice your delete vote; you forgot to bold it so I kept missing it when I went through. I only saw your response to others. You might want to fix that. As for which is it (no special knowledge or saying the spirit supports inclusion), it is my opinion the spirit of the law indicates the article should be included. This doesn't mean that's the only way it can be interpreted (i.e. my opinion isn't better than another's). You seem to have insinuated that I was putting my opinion above others, which I wasn't. I was stating my opinion so others could understand what I thought. That is, after all, what you're supposed to do with an AfD: state your opinion clearly.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>If you thought the "set a trend" criteria didn't apply, you should have stated that rather than launching an inappropriate rhetorical manuver to try and undermine my views in the eyes of others by citing irrelevant events (i.e. the edit history of WP:WEB). While you may have thought you were stating your opinion, you failed to do so effectively or in a way I think is appropriate for an AfD discussion. Light hearted banter or serious logical tones would be fine; but the sarcasm you use implies a feeling of bad faith towards those you interact with and is probably why you're in trouble right now! I suggest re-evaluating how you say what you mean so you avoid more trouble later on. Pointing out the logial flaws in a presented argument is one thing; trying to make the person you disagree with lose face (whether done knowingly or unknowingly) in an open forum is quite another. <a href="../../../x/u/a/User%7EXuanwu_83a2.html" title="User:Xuanwu">Xuanwu</a> 01:50, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</font></font></p>

<li><font size="5"><font>What I meant by pointing out the ArbCom thing was that, given you're already under scrutiny, engaging in what the "powers that be" could interpret as a personal attack on another member would not seem a wise course of action.

<p><font size="5"><font>Well... yipes. This RFC was not the best idea. Clearly, the lady has been subject to some guff (comments like Chameleon's are evidence of that); equally clearly, <i>from my best approximation of an objective point of view</i>, she sometimes overreacts.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>She feels outnumbered, not without some justification, because she is; she's also pre-conditioned to feel outnumbered by her experience as a minority, complicating things that much more. Basically, the best solution would be for a group of sensitive users to talk to her calmly. SlimVirgin and Anonym leap to mind as good choices, and I wouldn't mind giving it a try. Thing is, the RFC has her defenses up, and that's very bad. I'm not commenting there, because I don't know enough about the true origin of Crypto's complaints, though I might drop him a line.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="5"><font>She takes pride in her anger, which is a natural thing to do if one feels one has been shat on for the whole of one's life; however, somehow, she needs to understand that <i>encyclopedias</i> are not built through anger, however just the anger feels.</font></font></p>

<p><font size="5"><font><i>JJay,<br />
I've noticed that you're a bit, well, terse in AfD discussions. There are several reasons that this is less than desirable, most of which I've already mentioned. However, it also lends to the less-than-collegial atmosphere of the discussions. We expect that people who nominate will take a little bit of time to explain why they think something should be deleted, and anyone else who takes part in the discussion should also make</i> some <i>effort to add something other than a naked vote.</i></font></font></p>
<dl>
<dd><font size="5"><font>Thanks for the remarks. I assume you were/are trying to be helpful, however if you examined my AfD participation beyond a handful of votes, I doubt you would be concerned with my terseness. I also consider the practice of providing a link to a wikipedia policy or guideline page to be an insult. If I choose to vote without commenting it should be assumed that I have done so willfully. On the whole, my comments are sufficient, although my time is constricted by efforts to improve the articles that are nominated and the continual challenges I face in the discussions.</font></font></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><font size="5"><font>Moreover, while a short response seems to be one of your pet peeves, I fail to see how a statement such as <i>rpgcruft is like rust, it grows while we sleep</i> contributes to the <i>collegial atmosphere</i> of the discussions. Denigrating someone's contribution through the use of mindless slang is never attractive. Unfortunately, it is far too prevalent along with one word non-comments such as ad, cruft, vanity, etc.</font></font></dd>

<p><font size="5"><font>It pains me to bring this up, but given your position on user comments, I wonder if statements like: <i>burn voting with fire and feed the ashes to the sharks</i> are necessary? Isn't there a more polite way to make your opinions known? Perhaps sometimes no comment is better than a flippant remark designed merely to insult or cause pain. Behind every vote is a very real person trying to weigh the issues at hand. Also, since you do not feel that "Keep. seems notable" is a valid vote, I wonder if you believe that an AfD nomination that consists solely of "NN" or "not notable" is a valid nomination? -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:58, 6 January 2006 (UTC)</font></font></p>

To be honest most admins stick in one area (RC patrol, <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a> ecetra) and don't get involved what goes on outside it. Dealing with admins abuseing their power isn't really an admin task. Dispute resolution isn't either although every editor is free to try that. Part of the problem is that there have been far far to many acusations of admin abuse so the whole crying wolf thing kicks in. It's not so much turning a blind eye as not haveing the energy to spend the time investigateing the 1296th admin abuse claim.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 02:52, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</font></font></dd>

<p><font size="5"><font>I don't think you quite understand the situation, when you reproach me for making fun of the Wilerding account's writing skills. User:Hollow Wilerding claims on his/her userpage to be in real life Courtni Wilerding of Toronto, aged 24, a teacher of English among other subjects. I have doubted this identity since I first came across the editor, as I simply can't believe a native speaker with that background would write such poor English. (Even though Geogre says that's just because I've never met any Anglophone schoolteachers.) I wanted to express that doubt and if possible winkle some illuminating response to it out of him/her. Toronto teacher Courtni Wilerding is according to Google a real person, and I suspect somebody (a student of hers?) may have chosen to step into an available identity, probably in something of a hurry on the day "Winnermario" was blocked and "Hollow Wilerding" appeared. It'll be trouble for Courtni W, and trouble for Wikipedia, if I'm right. This was largely in my thoughts, though also, no doubt, I had a low desire to get in a pinprick in response to the shitstorm directed at me.

I am a bit surprised by <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant's</a> ominous language. I have looked at the links that Radiant has provided and do not see anything that looks remotely threatening. I also find the idea of "re-using" the comments and signatures of others in another context, where it is not immediately clear which context applies to be an unhealthy practice.

<p><font size="5"><font>Thanks for the note. &#160;:) It's just gotten nuts around here, Aaron. The ratio of garbage versus good edits is starting to tilt in favor of the garbage. No more anonymous edits has made the problem worse in my opinion. Tried to be a hero, but I may have wound up looking like a jerk. Anyway, I'm taking a rather long, protracted and very welcome break from Wikipedia and I'll be concentrating more on the radio control wiki I've been helping with over at Wikicities.

<p><font size="5"><font>Hi, Aaron. I reverted your changes to Deeceevoice's user page, and I wanted to explain why. Several others have tried to tone the page down, as well, but they have been consistenly rebuffed. Due to the fact that Deeceevoice is currently the subject of an Request for Arbitration, it seems best to let her have her say. Her user page is <i>her</i> user page, after all, and all of the offensive imagery and wording there was originally placed there by vandals. Expect others to revert any changes that are made to it by anyone by Deeceevoice herself, at least until the Arbitration is complete. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 14:46, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</font></font></p>

My point wasn't that those vandalizations wouldn't be visible unless Deeceevoice put them back on her page. I simply meant to say that until the Arbitration Committee rules that she needs to clean it up, we should leave her user page alone. If she had put that stuff on a mainspace article, I'd of course support toning down/removing it. For now, she seems to be using the page to help defend herself. (Others claim her attempts will probably backfire.) At any rate, the user page is an integral part of the arbitration process, IMHO.

<dd>Did you actually get banned from the main namespaces or is it self-imposed? As to the page itself, what do you want to edit/change? Your comment implied there were changes you wanted to make but couldn't/wouldn't. It's seemed pretty stable recently, whether that's because people's attention has become diverted or not, I couldn't say, but I'm thinking of re-applying the guideline tag after a week of stability. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 13:48, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh man! No, nothing even close to a ban! All self imposed. My aggressive editing of a deletion policy page <i>was</i> very bad form, and shouldn't have happened, and the uncivil edit summaries were over the top. But if we started banning for that, we'd be short quite a few admins in not much time. I'm actually happy with the guideline being in the hands it's in now, I'm just afraid that it won't stick when it's actually tested. The webcomic fans are fairly well organised, and won't roll over based upon stuff like <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>. The whole arbcom was over me trying to stop, err, someone pushing POV into policy. But now that there is a broader base of people involved, it should be ok. Thanks for asking, though!<br />

<dd>The beauty of the current system is that it is based on the same mechanisms as article editing. I think any random sample mechanism would not be possible without software changes (and re-reading my post, I realize the last sentence should have ended "..., but I'm not sure there's a viable alternative <i>to the current processes</i>"). With software changes, virtually anything would be possible, for example perhaps active votes are listed on a (likely protected) page somewhere and every non-bot edit has some random chance of being asked to enter a vote on one of the active votes (avoiding vote stuffing might be technically interesting, but I suspect it's doable). The votes would need to be kept on protected pages (possibly even "special:"s). I think this would amount to a <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statistical_survey.html" title="Statistical survey">statistical survey</a>, which I don't see any way to avoid if what we're really after is <i>commnity wide</i> consensus. This would avoid the "vote stuffing" problem I've raised lately at CfD as well, where folks are using membership in <i>wikipedians who believe in X</i> categories (via user boxes) to find and encourage like-minded folks to self-select into a CfD "consensus discussion". I actually think it's less of an issue at RfA, since I suspect at least 95% of users have good intentions (which is all that really matters) and any group of voters is likely to be able to recognize 90% of the rest who are obviously bad candidates. -- <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERick_Block_f5f2.html" title="User:Rick Block">Rick Block</a> <small>(<a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERick_Block_ba04.html" title="User talk:Rick Block">talk</a>)</small> 15:29, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<p><s>Aaron, we are in the middle of a WP:SHITSTORM, and no-one (myself included) is using their soundest judgement.

<dl>
<dd>Thanks for trying to be nice; I think that's important. I recognize my block may have been controversial, but I think it is a bit over the top to characterize it as totally out of line. A user had been previously blocked for making an attack template. He agreed not to make any more templates referring to other editors, was unblocked, and promptly created another one. I hate to block people and you'll often find me arguing against others' blocks or spending large amounts of time attempting discussion with people to try to avoid their being blocked. Of course, recognizing the potentially controversial nature of the block, I promptly reported it at <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#Attack_templates" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents#Attack templates</a>, as is standard procedure inviting review and feedback when making questionable judgment calls. The response was largely favorable. The reason I used a short block is that it did not appear that discussion was accomplishing anything; he immediately returned to creating a template.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If that's the <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">point</a> he's making, I don't agree that he has much of a point. It is naive to assume that praise and criticism can be treated equally. If a discussion is taking place and after I comment someone writes "I complete agree with Knowledge Seeker; as always, he shows himself to be a clear-thinking, intelligent editor," no one would be upset, if one were to write "That's stupid, Knowledge Seeker is a <i>something something something</i> [insert insult of choice; I'm not good at those]," it would probably be removed and the editor censured. Administrator status is irrelevant, with the exception that it is more difficult to take action against an administrator, although an administrator is quite unlikely to create an attack template in the first place. One may set one's standard for inclusion at different thresholds: perhaps both support and oppose templates (for anything) are acceptable; perhaps both are not, but there is certainly a wide middle ground where supports are acceptable but opposes are not. In this I make no judgment about the suitability of the support template nor of Ms. Martin's candidacy; however, the oppose template is clearly inappropriate.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't think it's that hard to admit a mistake, and I've certainly admitted them on Wikipedia before. But I still think the block was appropriate. I dislike blocking in general and try to use it as a last resort; perhaps in this case I jumped too quickly to blocking without first engaging in discussion. I realize that it might have been better to try to talk to him further instead of blocking first. All I had to go on, aside from my instincts, were that he had created an attack template, had been blocked, had agreed to stop creating templates about other Wikipedians, was unblocked, and then resumed. To me, that shows that discussion is not achieving its intended goal. Nevertheless, I do appreciate the admonishment and if this user continues to engage in inappropriate behavior, I will certainly attempt to see if we can come to an agreement over what is acceptable on Wikipedia and what is not.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not certain why you're asking me to think over how the edit to his user page looks, since it took place after my comment and block and I'd had no additional interaction with the user since then. If you simply were looking for outside opinion, it would probably be better to ask someone not directly involved with this editor.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Thank you for the feedback. I am always eager to know if other users feel I am doing a good job or a bad job as an administrator and editor, and how I can improve. I look forward to additional feedback from you in the future. — <a href="../../../k/n/o/User%7EKnowledge_Seeker_08dc.html" title="User:Knowledge Seeker">Knowledge Seeker</a> <a href="../../../k/n/o/User_talk%7EKnowledge_Seeker_711b.html" title="User talk:Knowledge Seeker">দ</a> 22:19, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>We start with a slightly tense situation. Doc had just blocked Dschor for making a personal attack template. Slightly edgy, no warning and all, but withing the realm of reason, and a discussion and unblocking followed. Everything is fine.</p>
<p>This Dschor makes <i>another</i> template. One that (I'm presuming, since I can't see its contents) was no more an attack than its (now deleted) opposite. If anyone got blocked over the creation of the "support" template, I'm not aware of it.</p>
<p>But Dschor gets blocked. While I do agree that his actions were ill-advised and inflammatory... wasn't the person whom he's just been blocked for "attacking" editing his user page <b>also</b> ill-advised and inflammatory?</p>

<p>Well, it <i>is</i> kind of inexplicable without the context. A few words could have helped. The <i>userbox</i> was incivil, because it was a "we don't like Kelly on ArbCom" box, and someone said that it came <i>from</i> Kelly Martin, but it wasn't that comment that was a block justification. My feelings on the user box support/oppose are known.

Editing a blocked user's page is pretty near vandalism, actually, whether it was for a "good" or "bad" cause, but this edit was kind of antagonistic rather than gloating, really.

<p>Way I see it, the entry consists of two parts: part A is the prose that takes up several paragraphs and would be well-placed in an article about sexual slurs. That's actually been copied into Sexual Slang already - my only objection to that is that I think an article specifically for sexual slurs would be better. Part B is the list, and that content I do object to preserving.

<p>Yes, that DRV is trying my patience a little, relying as it does mainly on petulance and a generalised complaint about the whole of deletion, rather than arguing for some error by AfD, regarding either procedure or product, with the article. My sarcasm to Kingturtle probably wasn't the best response, although what he is suggesting is plainly unreasonable (and, like I said, is just making noises about the deletion process generally, which he's entitled to hate but he can go hate it somewhere else). My last response...hmm...I see what you mean on re-reading it, but it does lay out several truths that appear to be otherwise in danger of getting overlooked. And I'm just about to add a sentence to it as well...I'll be careful. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 17:02, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm somewhat surprised to see you openly use the term "you're being sold a bill of goods" to describe the evidence that I presented to Charles Stewart, which you may note represents the full and complete dialog on Theresa Knott's user page. My part of the dialog in turn contained rather compendious evidence, all of which can be checked, to support my claim. The term you used normally denotes dishonest intent. Are you sure that you intended to se this term?</p>
<p>Another thing that I find puzzling is that you question my presentation of the information in a form that shows the complete dialog as one piece. Instead you suggest that I should have used two links. Why is this? There were three segments: Nandesuka's original request, my own elaboration of my case, and Nandesuka's response. This is how they appear on the page. Why would it be better to present them separately? It seems to me that you're again suggesting dishonesty.</p>
<p>Thirdly, you state, without presenting evidence to support it, that you "have, in fact, watched the entire drama unfold, and have seen Nandesuka attempt, on several occasions, to reach some accord with Tony." Where did he try to do this before I told him that I would not be letting the matter drop with his denial and his trollish imitation of my original request that he tone down his rhetoric?</p>
<p>It seems to me that you're almost going out of your way to allege dishonest intent, here. Please clear this up. The election period should not be marred by personal attack upon personal attack--no not even, I'm sure you'll agree, statements having the <i>appearance</i> of personal attacks. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 17:38, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll be as brief as I can, Tony, as I must admit I consider every keystroke here a wasted one.</dd>
<dd>We assume good faith, but we're not suckers. You lined Nandesuka up but good. He's a hard working, conscientious, and thoughtful editor, and I imagine that you were pretty sick of him pointing out to you the error of your ways.</dd>
<dd>He tried very <i>very</i> hard to engage you, to discuss what he saw as issues with your behavior. You rebuffed, in your inimitable way, every one of those attempts. It's unfortunate that his frustration was expressed in ways that made for pithy diffs.</dd>
<dd>He'll learn, in due course, not to be baited into providing you with ammunition to use against him, but perhaps not today.</dd>

<p>Aaron, I've asked you to tell me <i>where</i> Nandesuka made these attempts to engage me, which I purportedly rebuffed. I'm asking you to present your evidence.</p>
<p>Your reply is not helpful. Having given the appearance of accusing me of dishonesty you compound it by confirming, with words such as " I consider every keystroke here a wasted one", "We assume good faith, but we're not suckers", "You lined Nandesuka up but good", and so on. Instead of presenting evidence so that I can know what approaches you're talking about, you present an edit from someone else who agrees with you.</p>
<p>Aaron, I'm not asking for you to prove that some people agree with you--clearly some people agree with me, so we're not better off. So that we can make progress, I'm going to ask you, once more, if you will comply with my request. Where, specifically, did Nandesuka make honest attempt to bring issues with my behavior to my attention? You refer to my evidence as "pithy diffs". Well yes, they're pithy, and I think do show a prima facie case. I'm asking for you to help me to progress this by establishing that, on the facts of the case, there is a side to this other than Nandesuka's persistent denigration. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 18:09, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for giving me an easy task:</dd>

What I said, in full, in the first instance, was the following:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>You've got a point there. I am technically (having deliberately joined the case because that's what I do if I'm going to comment on an arbitration case) a party to the case, while you technically (although you're doing much the same thing) not a party to the case. I did wonder if it was appropriate at the time, but decided "fuck it" and that your words were just clutter anyway.</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tony_Sidaway&amp;diff=30822434&amp;oldid=30821781" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tony_Sidaway&amp;diff=30822434&amp;oldid=30821781" rel="nofollow">[21]</a></dd>
</dl>
<p>It's easy to miss nuances between an internal process that is expressed in retrospect (it was my opinion that I was only removing useless clutter from the workshop--an activity that the arbitrators had encouraged in my discussions on the subject) and an outright declaration to Nandesuka: "fuck it, I was removing your clutter." I might have expressed myself more clearly. You will, I presume, readily admit that I did indeed apologise for the inappropriate removal at that point, and duly entered a remedy censuring myself for over-eager factoring, which was however rejected by the arbitrators. These additional details certainly give the lie to any erroneous reading of the above as some kind of deliberate slur.</p>
<p>On the second instance, you mistake the circumstances. The approach was not made by Nandesuka to me, but by me to Nandesuka. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ANandesuka&amp;diff=32911214&amp;oldid=32891765" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ANandesuka&amp;diff=32911214&amp;oldid=32891765" rel="nofollow">Here</a> on 27 December at 20:46 I made an edit on Nandesuka's talk page titled "Your recent conduct on Wikipedia" in which I listed two separate instances that had occurred in separate contexts. These were inflammatory, snide and unhelpful. Nandesuka's response was apparently an attemot to inflame matters even more:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"I have merely tried to extend to you the same amount of credit, assumption of good faith, and comradeship, that you have extended towards other editors, such as Aaron Brenneman, Dragonfiend, Zoe, Geogre, others, and myself. I have simply followed your lead in carefully choosing my language (your own prose, for example, is replete with terms such as "cronies," that most people would view as a personal attack.)"</dd>
</dl>
<p>I had of course removed references to cronies as inappropriate and unworthy more than two weeks prior to that, so Nandesuka's decision to invoke my use of the word as some kind of excuse--however disingenuously and trollishly he presented his defence, for it was all of that--is most puzzling.</p>
<p>You state that you have presented evidence of my having attempted unsuccessully to steer arbcom but that I have deleted it. While it is true that I deleted your statements as inappropriate and unproductive, and apparently attempts to talk to third parties through the medium of my user talk page, it is false to claim that your presented such evidence. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tony_Sidaway&amp;diff=34449570&amp;oldid=34449392" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tony_Sidaway&amp;diff=34449570&amp;oldid=34449392" rel="nofollow">This</a> is the extent of the material that I removed. What you did present was a table of webcomics-RFAR-related stuff, which you assured unnamed onlookers contained evidence that my own presentation of specific, verifiable citations was revisionism. But you stopped short of presenting any refutation.</p>
<p>You state that I won't be listening if you do present such evidence. Try me. I assure you that I shall be listening very hard indeed.</p>
<p>But perhaps the best way that I can refute your vague claims that I'm engaged in revisionism is to point out that most of the findings of fact in the arbitration case, and the whole of the remedy applying to you on consensus and policy, were drafted by one single person. That single person was me. The words that you read when you were informed that you must seek consensus when making a policy change--those were drafted by me.</p>
<p>Now there's the matter of one of the remedies in the case, which is either closed or about to close. The reason I think I should remind you of it is that you don't seem to be sticking to it:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>All parties cautioned to remain civil</b></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>2) Aaron Brenneman, Dragonfiend, Snowspinner, and Tony Sidaway are all cautioned to remain civil even in stressful discussions.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>You slurs on me are breaches of this caution. In the claims you have made against me of dishonesty, and in their presentation, you have failed to observe this caution. Please let's progress this case further by correcting this. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 19:44, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Tony, oh Tony, I'd quote from <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>: <i>"[I]ncivility is roughly defined as personally targeted behavior that causes an atmosphere of greater conflict and stress."</i></p>
<p>Is there anyone, <i>anyone</i> in this entire Wikipedia who is involved to a greater degree in conflict that you? I there <b>anyone</b> whose daily existance is littered with people, of every stripe, telling them that <i><b>they aren't making things better?</b></i></p>
<p>You may not have noticed this Tony, but I get along with everyone else. We disagree, we have misunderstandings, sometimes we are rude, but we're able to work things out. I do not observe you <i>working things out</i> with anyone. Conflict that you are engaged in seems, on the whole, only to deepen. You are, as I ironicly note that Nandesuka spent a good deal of time trying to tell you, the uncivil one.</p>
<p>You are also, and this is a simple statement of fact, an impediment to the continuing functioning of this encyclopedia. You waste my time, you waste your own time, you waste <b>everyone's</b> time. The multiple requests for comment, the infantile requests for arbitrarion, the endless bickering. God's teeth, the tremendous energy that several productive editors had to divert on the bloody arbcom is documented <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_Webcomics_Workshop_Withdrawn_e362.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Webcomics/Workshop/Withdrawn">here</a>.</p>
<p>So, go away. I won't be responding to you anymore, directly or indirectly. I won't read what that you have written, I won't even bother to delete it. I have no idea why you are here, although the above seems to indicate it is for self-aggrandisement. But I have an encyclopedia to write.</p>

<p>You weren't too strident and I was glad you made your point because I didn't think I clearly addressed similar points raised by others before you. It gave me a chance to clarify what I was trying to say. By the way, I do think that the AfD procedure is not scaling very well. Over the last few months, I have cut back my time on AfD drastically as the number of articles listed daily has continued to grow, even with the loosening of the standards for speedy deletion. The answer that interested editors should keep every article on their watchlist is not realistic, either. I have thousands of edits but only about 200 pages on my watchlist. I don't want to miss edits to articles that I have a great interest in by having them outnumbered 10 to 1 by articles that I made drive-by contributions to. That doesn't mean I would like to see an article I spent time cleaning up tossed out unceremoniously by two or three editors, particularly when it frequently seems that many editors are not really looking at the articles or its talk pages and history, but merely going on the comments of the nominator or other voters. I don't have a better solution but I do think as we continue to grow, the faults of the current AfD process will become more transparent.</p>
<p>I agree we have to get rid of the junk, but I am very concerned that we are alienating good editors, which ultimately is our most valuable resource. The user box dust-up, overly negative oppose votes on RfA, speedy deletion of articles without notice to the article's creator, and many other things we have done recently cause me to worry that in our quest to concentrate on "building an encyclopedia" we are undermining our ability to do just that. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/s/1/User_talk%7EDS1953_dfdb.html" title="User talk:DS1953"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 17:32, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Take it as mixture of both. While I don't approve of what I would term wikilawyering, I do approve of anyone trying to keep people's heads clear and minds set on doing what we're doing, whilst being calm, collected and civil about it. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobchurch_62ba.html" title="User:Robchurch">Rob Church</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobchurch_99c1.html" title="User talk:Robchurch">Talk</a></i></sup> 00:55, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Aaron, you do seem to becoming something of a wiki-'public defender'. That could be useful. If you are sticking up for folk who have been treated harshly, or who could perhaps be made into good editors with a little more encoragement from the community and TLC from admins - then you are engaged in a worthy task. However, just be careful you don't end up defending obnoxious trolls against some well-meaning admin who's forgotton to cross the Ts on the search warrant.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 01:05, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's funny, I've just been doing my normal stuff: goofing around on talk pages, doing tidy-work, talking to people who seem confused, trying to be good. (Also shooting my mouth off, redacting, using &lt;s&gt;... &lt;/s&gt; here and there. Normal stuff for me, too.) Heck, I've offered a really angry and clueless user help in drafting an RfC against <i>myself</i> before.</dd>
<dd>But all the sudden my talk page is running hot. Not just mine: As an unrepentant snoop and avowed wikistalker, I can't believe what I'm seeing. "Threats" and "warnings" on WP:ANI, talk of "blackmail", RfXs and blocks flying thicker than cream pies at a Three Stooges festival.</dd>
<dd>I don't want to be a public defender. I don't want any extra attention. I'm just doing what I thought that we were all meant to do: Look out for the encyclopedia, and look out for each other.</dd>

<p>I think you must be taking me wrongly in this. While I am still a bit annoyed, it has become fairly funny. I don't particularly expect my vote to count after having it drubbed out twice. But I do wish for it to be known that it was drubbed for a lack of 11 votes. I would like it known for many reasons, first of which is that whoever put up the arbcom election notices should probably put the requirements there. If I had known I needed 150 to vote, I would have had 150. Perhaps this situation won't occur for someone else in the future. Secondly, and this point I only mention here to air it out, is that the whole allowing anyone to edit thing is really getting tossed. Leaving aside semi-protection, I myself have been here for almost 2 years editing anonymously. I am annoyed that those contributions mean nothing in the judgement of whether my opinion on who should serve on the arbcom is heard or not. Lastly, as I said in my earlier comments, I rather agree with the interpretation of the requirements that most are using. I am admittedly being contrary, because I believe my vote should count because of what I've done here, not because my logged in account has(had) 139 edits. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkon_a61e.html" title="User:Arkon">Arkon</a> 03:55, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Keeping you sense of humour is the most important thing. We just seemed to be heading really rapidly into "dead horse + flogging" territory. Did you edit anonymously from the same maching/isp as the one you have now? Those edits could amount to "special pleading" is they can be tied to you. (He says, knowing full well that now <i>he's</i> wiki-lawyering.) It's also been suggested that if you've got any deleted edits, that should count towards suffrage. Have you ever tagged a page for speedy deletion, or otherwise edited a page that was later deleted? Not <i>sure</i> that those edits would not have been counted, but it's worth asking.</li>
<li>Or conversly we could just let it go. Flogging and all.</li>

<dd>Well, I can see some logic for doing that, but you'd have to make it pretty clear that it wasn't the <i>target</i> that had been nominated, but the redirect.

<p>Hi, I'm tempted to revert the changes you just made to this list. Firstly, I can't make the slightest sense out of your edit summaries.

<p>I appreciate you giving your reason for an oppose on my Rfa. I'm not sure I follow your reasoning. I am of the view "if it isn't broke, I don't try to fix it", and that I don't try to fiddle with policies I feel are working well does not mean I don't <i>read</i> them.

Thanks for the note. I also appreciate that you brought this here rather popping a bullet point under my vote. I haven't been frequenting RfA much, and but was sucked in by your username. Which is a bit unfair, because my default position is "strong oppose". I looked over your contributions thoroughly. I didn't find anything objectionable, and you do good work. In some ways, RfA is RfC <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Aaron_Brenneman_f59c.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Aaron Brenneman">on the small</a>. In that light, take my tokenish "weak oppose" as a reminder that we've got a zillion+three policy pages and that they change all the time.<br />
You'd have to delete the main page for you to fail to get promoted now.

<p>Aaron, I see you removed two links from the Busch Stadium article. I would point out that (1) <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a> is only a style <i>guideline</i>, (2) <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EExternal_links_4b9d.html" title="Wikipedia talk:External links">Wikipedia talk:External links</a> clarifies that in some cases such links are appropriate, (3) it is almost impossible to convey the months-long demolition without the time lapse photos, and (4) I like the links (I watched one of them several times when it was first posted). I think that they add tremendous value to the article.</p>
<p>I agree with you that the web cam of the new stadium should not be on the page. Whether it should be at <a href="../../../b/u/s/Busch_Stadium_III_e6e9.html" title="Busch Stadium III">Busch Stadium III</a> is a debate for another day, since I have never edited that article.</p>
<p>I propose to add the other two back, but I do think that the one should be moved from the main text to the "External links" section.</p>
<p>If you have a strong objection, I will post my arguments on the talk page before I take the action, but if you don't, I would like to just do it. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/s/1/User_talk%7EDS1953_dfdb.html" title="User talk:DS1953"><font color="green">talk</font></a></sup> 03:33, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I reverted the restoration of the links. Wikipedia is not a link farm (and blatantly calling Scientology a cult is not on).

<p>Good luck. I've never had anything featured either, normally because I don't get so involved in things once I've started them. &#160;:) Plus I write about obscure films and actors that I can't find very much on. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 00:38, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seemed pretty inevitable that it would be reverted again. At first it appeared as if User:69.233.40.145 was just a sockpuppet of User:Tenka Muteki (using the same general reasoning, same professional sentencing in edit summaries, etc.), but after the anon just reverted the how-to back, Tenka removed the section when he/she removed the list of screamers to add a link to its own page. I'm not sure if that was an accident, or if it's just coincidence and not sockpuppetry. <a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 02:05, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Tenka blanked List of Screamers after you AfDed it. I believe it can be speedily deleted now if the creator wants it deleted and no one else has edited it but the creator (your AfD addition aside). <a href="../../../n/u/f/User%7ENufy8_2e28.html" title="User:Nufy8">Nufy8</a> 02:18, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Since they were flagged for deletion, I had them all deleted from the main article. I might add, I have two computers, but was only signed in on one of them, and forgot this detail when I posted.--Tenka Muteki 02:21, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, I've heard of it, but lupin's popups adds such a rollback feature as well. (what I really want to do is find godmode.js, its got to be in someone's monobook file), but I plan on accepting one of the nominations for admin I've received soon(sometime before February), and that will(if I succeed) add true rollback, among other features and responsibilities. I hope you will vote there.</p>

Eh, whatever. Even if I did, if she doesn't chill out, the arbcom would just call her a British anti-Kelly Deeceevoice and indef again, i've tried my best to chill her out, but the cabal has claimed another victim I think.</p>
