	    <p>The <b>AAR wheel arrangement</b> system is a method of classifying locomotive (or unit) wheel arrangements that was developed by the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_American_Railroads_b5f2.html" title="Association of American Railroads">Association of American Railroads</a>. It is essentially a simplification of the European <a href="../../../u/i/c/UIC_classification_c653.html" title="UIC classification">UIC classification</a>, and it is widely used in <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a> to describe <a href="../../../d/i/e/Diesel_locomotive.html" title="Diesel locomotive">diesel</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/e/Electric_locomotive.html" title="Electric locomotive">electric locomotives</a>. It is not used for <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_locomotive.html" title="Steam locomotive">steam locomotives</a>; instead, the <a href="../../../w/h/y/Whyte_notation.html" title="Whyte notation">Whyte notation</a> is used. This system counts axles instead of wheels. Letters refer to powered axles, and numbers to unpowered (or idler) axles. "A" refers to one powered axle, "B" to two powered axles in a row, "C" to three powered axles in a row, and "D" to four powered axles in a row. "1" refers to one idler axle, and "2" to two idler axles in a row. A dash ("–") separates <a href="../../../b/o/g/Bogie.html" title="Bogie">trucks</a>, or wheel assemblies. A plus sign ("+") refers to articulation.</p>
