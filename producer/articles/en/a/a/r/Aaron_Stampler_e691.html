<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Stampler_e691.html" title="Edit section: In Primal Fear">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">In <i>Primal Fear</i></span></h2>
<p>The novel reveals that Stampler was born and raised in the tiny (fictional) <a href="../../../a/p/p/Appalachian.html" title="Appalachian">Appalachian</a> <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mining.html" title="Mining">mining</a> town of Crikside, <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kentucky.html" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, and subjected to systematic <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_abuse.html" title="Child abuse">physical</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/o/Emotional_abuse.html" title="Emotional abuse">emotional</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_abuse.html" title="Sexual abuse">sexual abuse</a> from a young age. In public, he often appeared meek and frightened, with a severe <a href="../../../s/t/u/Stutter.html" title="Stutter">stutter</a>. He went down into the mine as a child with his father, and was so terrified by the cramped, dark space that he vowed to never go down there again. From then on, he would have a lifelong fear of being trapped in the dark.</p>
<p>He lost his <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginity.html" title="Virginity">virginity</a> at age 14 to Rebecca Nolan, one of his (much older) teachers.</p>
<p>At 16, Stampler ran away to <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chicago.html" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, where he was <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeless.html" title="Homeless">homeless</a> until he was taken in by Rushman, the city's beloved Archbishop, who gave him a home in a mission for disadvantaged youth. Rushman seemed to dote on Stampler, making him head of the mission's alter boys and featured <a href="../../../s/o/p/Soprano.html" title="Soprano">soprano</a> in the choir, and introducing him to his first real girlfriend, Linda. There was a darker, hidden side to their relationship, however; Rushman was a <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophile.html" title="Pedophile">pedophile</a> and forced Stampler, Linda, and his fellow altar boys to perform in videotaped <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_pornography.html" title="Child pornography">child pornography</a>. This went on for three years until Stampler finally snapped and brutally murdered Rushman, dismembering him and carving a <a href="../../../d/e/w/Dewey_Decimal_System_f757.html" title="Dewey Decimal System">library reference number</a> to a quotation from <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathaniel_Hawthorne_7ca2.html" title="Nathaniel Hawthorne">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scarlet_Letter_cf68.html" title="The Scarlet Letter">The Scarlet Letter</a></i> into his chest: "A man who wears one face to himself and one face to the multitude may become confused as to which one is the true."</p>
<p>Arrested immediately after the murder covered in Rushman's blood, Stampler was dubbed "the Butcher Boy" in the media and became the most hated man in Chicago — attracting him to Martin Vail, a hotshot defense <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney.html" title="Attorney">attorney</a> who wanted to represent him for the <a href="../../../p/u/b/Publicity.html" title="Publicity">publicity</a>. Stampler swore to Vail he didn't kill Rushman, claiming that he had been with the archbishop but had blacked out, awakening to find him dead.</p>
<p>One day, after Vail questioned him harshly, Stampler flew into a rage and suddenly became (literally) like a different person; his stutter gone, he now appeared to be a violent <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sociopath.html" title="Sociopath">sociopath</a> and began identifying himself as "Roy." He then bragged about killing Rushman. Vail and court <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychiatrist.html" title="Psychiatrist">psychiatrist</a> Molly Arrington realized that Stampler suffered from <a href="../../../m/u/l/Multiple_personality_disorder.html" title="Multiple personality disorder">multiple personality disorder</a> and that the "Roy" persona had in fact committed the murder, as well as several others beginning when Stampler was as young as five. Arrington explained that "Roy" took over whenever "Aaron" felt threatened, and acted out on the violent impulses Stampler was too <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trauma.html" title="Trauma">traumatized</a> to express.</p>
<p>"Roy" came out in the middle of the trial, attacking prosecutor Jane Venable in the middle of her <a href="../../../c/r/o/Cross-examination.html" title="Cross-examination">cross-examination</a>. Stampler was found <a href="../../../i/n/s/Insane.html" title="Insane">insane</a> by the court and sentenced to a <a href="../../../m/e/n/Mental_institution.html" title="Mental institution">mental institution</a>. Vail, who by now had come to care about Stampler, felt that justice was done — until Stampler revealed to him that he had been faking multiple personality disorder the whole time. In reality, the shy, stuttering "Aaron" persona had been an act, and he was merely being himself when he became the cunning, sociopathic "Roy." Angered that Vail had not introduced Rushman's child porn tapes into evidence, Stampler taunted Vail by admitting that he had been perfectly sane each time he committed murder; he was confident that Vail would never reveal the truth for fear of ruining his career.</p>

<p>In the sequel to <i>Primal Fear</i>, set 10 years later, Stampler was released from the institution and persuaded his former lover Nolan to kill the other alter boys and Linda, to get <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revenge.html" title="Revenge">revenge</a> on people he thought had betrayed him without casting suspicion on himself. Vail found him out, tracked him back to <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virginia.html" title="Virginia">Virginia</a>, and foiled his plan. Vail paid a price for it, however, when Stampler killed Arrington, who had also briefly been Vail's lover, and beat Venable (who was now in a relationship with Vail) so badly that she lost an eye. Nolan was killed in a shootout with police and Vail chased Stampler to the feared coal mine of his childhood, which he fell into to his (apparent) death.</p>

<p>In the final novel in the series, however, it was revealed that he survived the fall. He then traveled to rural <a href="../../../t/e/x/Texas.html" title="Texas">Texas</a> and disguised himself as a <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blind.html" title="Blind">blind</a> <a href="../../../b/a/p/Baptist.html" title="Baptist">Baptist</a> preacher, part of a scam to bilk people out of their money and get access to their teenage daughters. He aligned himself with a <a href="../../../s/u/r/Survivalist.html" title="Survivalist">survivalist</a> <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militia.html" title="Militia">militia</a>, which attracted the attention of his archenemy Vail, who now worked for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Attorney_82a9.html" title="United States Attorney">U.S. Attorney</a>'s office. As the militia surrendered to federal agents in what turned into a <a href="../../../w/a/c/Waco%2C_Texas_3edc.html" title="Waco, Texas">Waco</a>-like shootout, Stampler tried to escape in the clothes of an agent he'd killed, but justice finally caught up with him: He was shot and killed by an agent after Vail, who had accompanied federal authorities to see that his case didn't end in violence, recognized him.</p>
