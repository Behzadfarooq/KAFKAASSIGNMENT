<p>Some comments on your reasonning:</p>
<ul>
<li>His arbitrary removal of a "spurious" nomination to VfD - perhaps I misspoke in my edit comment. The vfd notice was simple vandalism by an anon. Check the history <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Noncommutative_geometry&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Noncommutative_geometry&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> - the vfd notice had been removed twice over, by others.</li>
<li>His alteration of another editor's VfD vote... again, I think you're being unfair (and your wording implies that I changed the vote). I didn't change his vote, merely removed wikipediafascism - VFD isn't a soapbox for people ranting and insults; it's there for voting.</li>
</ul>

Tony -<br />
Ok, I'm just going to be straight, rather than careful and precise.<br />
There are two possibilities here: either you're a nice guy or you're not. Being a nice guy in no way precludes you from disagreeing with me, or even agreeing with me while thinking I'm a jerk. Since I'll never actually know, I have to use <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">faith</a> and treat you like a <i>misguided</i> nice guy.<br />

</dl>
<p>Intentionally or not, this is condescending. Both <i>upset</i> and <i>distress</i> mean "mentally perturbed". But not using the word <i>anger</i> or an analog, you deny even the possibility that the other person has a <b>reason</b> to be angry. Being "dumbfounded" at their "distress" compounds this further.<br />
<br />
I'd like you to go back to <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_The_20_Cent_Quest_55d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/The 20 Cent Quest">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/The 20 Cent Quest</a> and try and look at your comments with a fresh set of eyes. Whatever your intentions, you don't <i>sound</i> like a nice guy here. You sound like seomone who made a claim, didn't like it being challenged, and made subtle and artful attacks rather than backing up your claims. And it made me angry, no question.<br />
<br />
It would be dishonest of me to say that this exchange had nothing to do with the RfC. I <i>believe</i> I would have done the same thing had it not occured, but I don't <i>know</i>. There are a lot of strong feelings being expressed, and I'm listening to what people have to say. Your comments to date do not give the appearance that you're doing the same. I would only ask that you try and learn something from all of this, just as I will.<br />

Aaron, let me just say that your comments frequently cause me utter and complete bafflement. Interacting with you on the movie VfD was almost painful because however politely I tried to make my statements you reacted as if to some slight. My "comment" is met with an "irritated comment", which comprises all kinds of quite bizarre accusations and bear an edit summary "Reply to Straw man.". I politely rebut the accusations, inasmuch as I can understand them, apologising for upsetting you, and you launch into a tirade accusing me of using loaded language, describing my actions as "pernicious". Aaron, please think it possible that if I say I find your statements baffling, eyebrow-raising, and inappropriate, it may be because you seem to be disposed to take expressions of disagreement as personal slights. The least I can do in the circumstances is to endeavor to avoid upsetting you further by having any more to do with you.--<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 06:42, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Tony - did you even <i>read</i> anything I wrote? You're reply is exactly what I'm trying to illustrate to you. Please, <i><b>please</b></i>, try and see someone else's point without being "baffled". If you are actually incapable of doing so, have someone else look over that exchange. Pick someone with whom you disagree but respect, and ask them if it's really so incredible that I would feel that you were not being straightforward. There is no question I can sometimes be a pig: curt, sharp, and prone to excitability. The only question is will you take <b>any</b> responsibility, or simply contine to be baffled.<br />

<dd>Aaron, please try to understand that I long ago lost patience with your antics. I don't know whether this is an irritable, passive-aggressive persona that you consciously adopt or whether it's the real you. Enough, I'm done, I've given up trying to cope with your tantrums and accusations. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 07:07, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, it's clear now that the problem isn't me. How could I have been nicer above? How is that a "tantrum"? Do you not notice that you've totally ignored everything I've said? I suspect that we'll have to work together here for a long time, and that we'll be treading a lot of the same ground. You really do have a choice, to continue <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikihate_20c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikihate">as is</a>, or try to make things better. Do you <b>like</b> making people mad? Wouldn't you rather have spent this time writing articles? Come on man, it doesn't have to be like this.<br />

<p>Please don't edit the response section of my RfC again. If you had only checked , you would have seen that I had moved the comment to the talk page and replied.

<p>Tony, oh captain of good faith, you've just accused me of making "yet another false, baseless and personal allegation" for saying "Answering it is better than deleting it, then it doen't look like you're trying to hide anything". And, if you'll check the timing:</p>

<li>13:39, 7 August 2005 I replace RF's comment</li>
<li>13:40, 7 August 2005 You make a note on the talk page.</li>

<p>How about this: get someone else to tell me I've been nasty. Not that I've been <i>wrong</i>, because that's something else entirely. Find someone <i>other than yourself</i> who will look over my contributions and find personal attacks or somesuch. And get them to tell me so nicely, with specifics.

<li>Please understand that I am trying to be as straight-forward as possible here. Comments such as <i>"I won't request that your profile be deleted for violating official policy,"</i> tend to demonstrate that you <i>don't</i> understand policy. More to the point, as I've mentioned before, you appear to not understand some of the basics of Wikipedia.<br /></li>
<li>That's not an insult, and I'm sorry because I know that it sounds like one. It takes a long time to understand the interactions, unwritten rules, complex mix of rules, guidlines, precendents, and dictatorship that make Wikipedia work. And once you think that you understand everything, some one points out <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> and does what they want anyway! Two thirds of the time I have no idea what is going on.<br /></li>
<li>By looking at your edit history, I cannot help but notice that you've confined yourself to contributing to a narrow set of topics. Perhaps if you tried editing some other articles, get involved in some collaboration, a bit of back-and-forth over POV, and produce a shiny finished product, you'll get a better feel for things.<br /></li>
<li>Because I can't imagine you're having any fun right now. I imagine instead that you're angry and frustrated and this is a <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_thing.html" title="Bad thing">bad thing</a>.<br /></li>
<li>But if you continue like this things aren't going to get any better for you. Really. I'm going to keep trying to produce a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">great online encyclopedia that anyone can edit</a>, I'm going to continue to make <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">crazy edits</a>, I'm going to keep working for <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">balance</a>. I'm going to keep being <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">patient</a>, I'm going to continue to avoid <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">insults</a>. I am going to keep <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">believing</a>.</li>
<li>If you think I'm out of line, maybe I am. I'd be mad to deny even the <i>possibilty</i> that I'm doing the wrong thing. I've included some links, the next step would probably be <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequest_for_comment_fd68.html#General_user_conduct" title="Wikipedia:Request for comment">Request for comment (RfC)</a>, as we don't seem to be able to communicate. I was recently chewed up and spat out in an RfC I raised, but it <i>is</i> the next step if you feel I'm "after" you. I'd imagine <a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbitOne_44d2.html" title="User:OrbitOne">OrbitOne</a> would provide the second signature for you.</li>
<li>Oh, it appears I was mistaken about the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Adult_Baby_af0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Adult Baby">VfD</a>. The consensus appears to be a merge into <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantilism.html" title="Infantilism">Infantilism</a>. Which means I'll probably end up heavily involved in the content of that article, too!<br /></li>

<p>Well, you're right, I am new, and I don't fully understand all the vagaries of Wikipedia. But I have seen the rules for deletion, and understand them. I understand that you're violating them. I have seen requests for User Profiles to be deleted. I ahve seen references to User profiles that have been deleted. I have seen the reasons why. I have seen the majority of them have been deleted for vandalism. I understand that quite well. I also understand what vandalism is. And, I understand that it is what you are doing. Do you understand what you are doing? And do you understand what the consequences are? When the time comes, there won't be any more opportunities for you to reverse course. Before you bite off more than you can chew, make sure you think about what you are doing. Because as verbose as you may be, the moderator who deletes your profile will not be giving you a long speech about it when it happens. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavy_Blue_c6f5.html" title="User:Davy Blue">Dave</a> 20:40, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dave,<br />
I think that you may have been confused as to whom the author of the comment you were responding to actually was. While this is understandable, and in fact the reason I'm always clucking on about signatures, your response was not appropiate. I've placed some comments beneath yours, and I really suggest that you ask some one else for their advice. Find an <a href="../../../a/m/a/Wikipedia%7EAMA_Requests_for_Assistance_1619.html" title="Wikipedia:AMA Requests for Assistance">advocate</a> and drop a note on the page, please. Because "Why don't we just delete you" is a <i>threat</i>, and I will not tolerate another.<br />

<p>I just noticed two edits of yours, reverts on this article:</p>
<ol>
<li>01:49, 9 September 2005 (hist) (diff) Essential tremor (Removed material added re-added (twice now) without use of talk page. Please use talk page before re-adding this material. Also please use preview.)</li>
<li>01:32, 9 September 2005 (hist) (diff) Essential tremor (Please note that reverts without an edit summary or use of a talk page are fair game for removal. If there is a reason this section should go in, please use talk page.)</li>
</ol>
<p>This seems a little OTT to me. Couldn't you just have edited the section to remove the superfluous external links? Insisting that the fellow go to a talk page about adding a section on support groups for a neurological condition to an article about that condition that already contains links to those same groups' websites seems, well, somewhat unnecessary. If they're worth linking to they're worth writing about. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:45, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I did edit the section to remove the extra links. Then there was nothing left, so I removed the section. When an editor repeatedly adds material back without edit summary than another use is removing, asking for use of the talk page is reasonable.<br />

</ul>
<p>I don't think you were very reasonable there. It is simply false to say that there was no informational content other than superfluous links. Since you did revert twice, I'd have prefered to see you actually use the talk page yourself to explain why you kept doing it. I still don't really know why you did it. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 03:28, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Tony,<br />
Thank you for your suprising interest in this issue. You'll note that the section was:</p>
<dl>
<dd>The <a href="http://www.tremoraction.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.tremoraction.org/" rel="nofollow">Tremor Action Network</a> is widely regarded as being the most supportive group for those with essential tremor. Also known as <a href="http://www.tremoraction.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.tremoraction.org/" rel="nofollow">TAN</a>, the <b>Tremor Action Network is based in the USA</b>, and has messageboards open to all for sympathtic and informed support.</dd>

<dd>The <a href="http://www.tremor.org.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.tremor.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">National Tremor Foundation</a> is a friendly and supportive organisation <b>based in Essex, UK.</b></dd>
</dl>
<p>I've bolded the section that was neither repeated nor NPOV. If you believe that this information warrented inclusion in the article in a little subsection all it's own, you are of course welcome to argue that. As to the rest, my edit summaries were quite clear, as seen above. I would do exactly the same with any persistant adding of external links without edit summary or use of talk page.<br />
<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 03:57, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>It's not so much the fact that the information you repeatedly removed warranted inclusion where it was NPOV (it obviously did, and you were obviously easily able to identify it) it was your bullying approach and your utterly false claim that someone must use a talk page prior to adding information to an article. That kind of behavior isn't only contrary to policy, it can be extremely damaging in an environment where we must do everything we can to cultivate, not alienate, new editors. If you do it again I'll come back and remind you of this. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 04:27, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the acknowledgement! I've (hopefully) addressed your concerns on the AfD page. Collating the list did take a while, but it was what I felt like doing at the time, so there was no particular virtue in doing it, nor do I have an unhealthy attachment to it. If you're convinced it's actually harmful, please feel free to delete it! Personally, I certainly don't think it should be read <i>instead</i> of the discussion above it, but I feel that in the proper context, it's a useful bit of info. Cheers, and thanks again!&#160;:) --<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshenai_4e13.html" title="User:Ashenai">Ashenai</a> (<a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshenai_68df.html" title="User talk:Ashenai">talk</a>) 23:14, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I was wondering if you had a fix for my wording on Deletion Review? We can do it here, if you like or there, I don't particularly mind. As it stands, I don't think it will cause confusion, particularly with the help of Septentrionalis's addition to the 1st line.</p>
<p>I think we're almost there in terms of making the move, although the speedies question is a bit of a millstone. I think the immediate remedy to that is to accept the <i>status quo</i> and continue the debate through the move. After all, the main reason for the change is to being kept debates into scope rather than to stir up the speedy process. I'm going to put a to-do list on the talk page in a little while, but I'm happy to fiddle with the words. I don't think we should worry about them overly having said that, since they will probably need amending once first used anyway. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:20, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ok, thanks. I'll give it a final nudge later today. As for the rant, well, I quite agree. If people checked their egos and politics at the door, we'd all get on famously. It is a fact that this place operates without consequences for most, and the ArbCom are about to amply demonstrate their lack of spine by referring Steve to RfA. When they do so, I'll register my opposition and write a stinging inditement of the Committee to go with it. The reason we don't have revolutions (often) in real-life is that the government knows it'll get a kick in the teeth if they screw up. If admins here screw up, they just find a friend to cheer for them and it's all ok. Even when they do their research so carefully and act with so much thought as to summarily undelete copyright infringing text.

<p>Aaron, do please stop being unreasonable. You've twice falsely claimed that I should use the talk page or block you for 3RR. Since you've come nowhere near to breaking the 3RR, and I have no intention of doing so, and I have used the talk page whereas you have simply taunted me in edit summaries, it's becoming utterly surreal.

<p>Yes, I am familiar with the reasons under which the IP trace for evidence of sockpuppetry would only occur in dire circumstances. I was just curious about IgnoreAllRules as it seems he was targeting <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">User:Tony Sidaway</a> and I saw that you had reverted him several times. I noticed that IgnoreAllRules was vandalizing articles that Tony had edited.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 04:24, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, most who know my editing know I tend to not be circumlocutory so would you say that User:IgnoreAllRules is your sockpuppet account? --<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 04:39, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Not to further badger, but I was noticing that you didn't make any edits from this account from 02:15, October 18, 2005 to 02:46, October 18, 2005. User:IgnoreAllRules made 11 edits in 3 minutes between 02:41, October 18, 2005 to 02:44, October 18, 2005. All eleven edits had as edit summary; "I'm Tony! I know best!!". In light of recent issues between you and Tony and other rather strange coincidences that can be elaborated further if need be, well, I really like people that are straight forward and honest. For the record, I log in from two locations, both in Nebraska (armpit of middle Earth). --<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 04:52, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Aaron, I don't fault the use of sock accounts, and respect that since you use your real name, one may come in handier for you than it would for me, not that you do use one. A brief spree of obvious vandalism, I could forgive that...no big deal...I know you and Tony are at odds and if indeed you performed these vandalisms, well, they weren't that bad overall, and at least you and others quickly reverted them. Now in regards to someone tracking your IP...I don't have that capability but noticed the vandalism while on RC Patrol..the username IgnoreAllRules (redlined) struck me as a potential vandal, but I was overedited by another with a faster trigger doing the revert. I often rely on <a href="../../../o/c/c/Occam%27s_Razor_046a.html" title="Occam's Razor">Occam's Razor</a> due to nature of my real life job...the easiest explanation is usually the right one. Now as far as a breach of admin ethics regarding an unauthorized IP query...I am not familiar with that set of rules but not sure they matter as proof any more than my little time flow above described...I mean, even if the IP was the same, you could always say that your little brother was messing around while you were away for a few minutes. I know you have morte integrity than to want to hide, so, as you've requested, I'll butt out. Respectfully, I do not want to hound anyone.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 05:24, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Aaron, you just deleted all but one of the links to the sari article -- including several that were referenced IN the article, several that consisted only of instructions on HOW to wrap a sari, and several that went to commercial sites, yes, but to the "all about saris" sections of commercial sites.</p>
<p>I've been busting linkspammers for a year and a half, and I don't think I've let any "buy my saris" links past me. I'm restoring the links.

<p>Aaron. I saw your note earlier in the day and am responding properly now. From what happened, and from what I see on Splash's page, I think you're currently under what has been called "wikistress". Wikipedia can be very callous, unfriendly, unfair, and sharp. The main reason it is so is because it is populated by humans.&#160;:)</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be though—or if it is, it doesn't have to affect you much. Don't let it. Realize this for what it is: an impressively imperfect project aimed at creating an impossible thing. It is, or can be seen as, noble, and I believe some day many years from now its descendent will be. <i>We</i> are the ephemeral, transitory, invisible, anonymous workers helping it toward that goal. When it is achieved we'll be long gone. It is altruism that keeps us here, now, while it is massively, almost unimaginably, imperfect. A little more imperfection, a few more silly edits, a bit of reverting here and warring there, someone being impossible—don't let it trouble you. If someone insists on a view that you believe is incorrect, by all means engage him and tell him why you think it should be done another way. Don't forget the other part of the bargain: listen to what he says. Try for a solution. If it is impossible, try to do the right thing (this can be hard). But whatever you do, if you find it includes feeling that it might be a good idea to vandalize a couple of pages, even if temporarily, even for a short while, it's likely best to take a break.</p>
<p>With the current disagreement, I believe most editors who have an interest in deletion policy on WP will agree with the version you're trying to keep on WP:DRV. That can be seen very simply—that version is theirs. Tony feels that it is invalid, for two reasons. The first is he believes "if in doubt don't delete" is a kind of "chief precept" of deletion policy that should be prominently placed in DR. The second is he believes DR should not be restricted to questions of what has come to be termed "process". This second issue is actually more complicated than it appears. I think we're all actually closer to agreement than most think we are, but it will need to be discussed with some care in the coming weeks/months.</p>
<p>The first issue is less complicated. One thing I'd like to say in Tony's defense is that he keeps being told that his addition of IIDDD to the template is inadvisable, but I don't recall anyone actually explaining (or attempting to explain) why (I may be wrong though. Has anyone?). It is true that the current version has wide acceptance among the editors who're actually involved with the running and working of DR. However, if someone says that something's not right with it because it conflicts with policy, that needs to be examined, whether or not most of us agree on the current version. I can post my view on this, later. Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong, but perhaps with a discussion on the actual merits of IIDDD, we might find ourselves—all of us, Tony, Kappa, Splash, Rossami, an everyone else—coming to an agreeable solution.</p>
<p>You are an excellent editor, Aaron. Too valuable to loose. Please be happy and well. I'm going to be away for a while myself, so I will not be able to contribute to any ensuing discussion, but I'm sure everyone concerned will be able to decide something satisfactory.

I'm not, Aaron. I've turned down 5 or 6 nom offers now, I think. I might go up for it in a couple of months, but I'm afraid I can't do any blocks for you at the moment.&#160;:)</p>

<p>(Was just about to go to bed, forgive any thinkos and/or rambling) I don't know when I first encountered Tony, but it was months ago, and I think even before you did, just in the normal course of editing, and his talk page has been on my watchlist since. I've always respected his judgment, dedication, and helpfulness. Even after he restored one of my first, zealous, speedies. (As an aside, I don't know how it is possible for anyone to get on Radiant's bad side or vice versa, but it happened. Haven't talked much recently, but Radiant and I used to see each other a lot, indeed he nominated me for my adminship. He is one of the most open and reasonable people I know on WP.) I'm pretty sure I remember way back in the primordial depths of time when this <i>thing</i> between you and Tony started. It was about some VFD debate, likely a school, right? Then you encountered each other on VFD again and again, it spread to talk pages, and spread more. I'm not even sure when we met, Aaron, (though I just realized that silly note at the top of this page is from July), but I've had enough rational discussions with you, and seen you around as well, that I long ago came to the conclusion that I could trust and respect your judgment, dedication, and helpfulness. I think you (plural) are level-headed and reasonable, and I would point a needy editor to either of you. You (plural) can also be abrasive, stubborn, and, yes, coy. That happens, somehow, mostly only when you encounter each other, or the issues that spark this. My point is: <i>why?</i></p>
<p>I must admit (don't know if I should be guilty about it, but I'm guilty about not knowing&#160;:) that your admission hasn't really changed my opinion of you (good judgment, dedicated, stubborn, etc.) in that I still have cmplete confidence that I would trust a decision by you, and that you still have that inborn WP hatred of all vandals. Not to compare them, but neither of Tony's RFC have changed my confidence in him either. I think, independent of each other and the general tussle, you are best. What have you gained from it, besides much undue stress and insanity? I'm sure it's been suggested before, but now would be the time to <i>just drop it</i>. It isn't anything that I think mediation, or another RFC, or even (Jimbo forbid) and RFAr could help. This doesn't mean you give in, or thatI think you two can become best wikifriends overnight. But how about if you refused to engage each other? Period (well, it was a question mark). I'm convinced that by now your banter does nothing but inflame each other. Watching this slowly spiral away has been painful for many I'm sure. I've seen both of you lose control in different ways and to different degrees. But if we all are to accept your apology as sincere (I certainly do) the least you could do is start over and give it a shot. Disputes between good-faith, trustworthy editors are worse that trolls and vandals: they divide the community, and create factions where none need to be. Don't ever forget how much good you can still do for this wonderful encyclopedia, but also try to think up how much more you could have done in that time you wasted thinking about Tony. Again, my point is: <i>why?</i> Not just why have this dispute, but why are we all here (including Tony)? Let that guide you.</p>

<p>Haha. You're right. I guess I wouldn't blame someone if they changed my name to 'fresh eats figs'. I just started using a template because I thought the code was unnecessarily long and it clogged up the AfD listings every time I put a vote. Didn't really think of the concequences on the server. I just saw <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplefeltangel_71dc.html" title="User:Purplefeltangel">User:Purplefeltangel</a> doing the same thing and thought it was a good idea. I'll work on simplifying the code as much as I can and revert it back.</p>

<p>Yeah, I'd do it in a heartbeat. I'm not terribly worried about losing my adminship, because I stand firmly behind almost all of my actions, and despite Tony's doubts, I don't doubt my motivations. Anyway, even if I did lose my admin priveleges, I could still edit, and I could get out of all the messy politics associated with the position. Besides, if I didn't get re-adminned, then I probably wasn't doing a terribly good job in the first place, and I could probably learn a lot from the experience.

<p>Basically the transwiki process has become this kind of endless cycle that never gets completed. I wrote the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Wikipedia%7ETranswiki_log_fe21.html#Instructions" title="Wikipedia:Transwiki log">instructions</a> there, and hope they make some sense. An article is transwikied because, presumably, it doesn't belong here. The TL, as a record of transwikied articles, is a list of articles that need cleanup in some way. Just take any article and deal with it appropriately (merge, send to AFD) and strike it out when you are done (or upon resolution of AFD) or if it is encyclopedic enough now (some are old enough to have changed substantially). Any stricken entry can be archived whenever. If we take <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corn_soup.html" title="Corn soup">corn soup</a>, I'd say find somewhere to redirect it or just take it to AFD as it was transwikied to Wikibooks Cookbook <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Corn_soup" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Cookbook:Corn_soup">wikibooks:Cookbook:Corn_soup</a> 2 months ago with out any changes since, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a how-to (recipe). Finally any resolved Wiktionary entries should have {{<a href="../../../t/r/a/Template%7ETranswikied_to_Wiktionary_a460.html" title="Template:Transwikied to Wiktionary">transwikied to Wiktionary</a>}} replaced with {{<a href="../../../t/r/a/Template%7ETranswiki_to_Wiktionary_Finished_cab7.html" title="Template:Transwiki to Wiktionary Finished">Transwiki to Wiktionary Finished</a>}}. (Very few of the archived ones do, but going back and fixing that is probably lower priority atm.) That's it in a nutshell, did it make sense?

<dd>Your proposal involved a breach of Wikipedia policy (admins are not permitted to stand for confirmation except in the rare case of being ordered to by the ArbCom, something which has only happened twice), and furthermore (if followed) would have extended conflict rather than reduced it. Wikipedia is not a dueling ground, and we do not need people exacerbating disputes through grandstanding. Fortunately, Scimitar and Tony, both being adults, were able to resolve their dispute and reach a position that was mutually acceptable to the both of them without having to go at it with swords and sticks in the middle of the public square -- something which you clearly would have desired. Your bloodthirstiness for Tony's sysop flag has been noted, and is that that of which you should be ashamed. <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelly_Martin_056a.html" title="User:Kelly Martin">Kelly Martin</a> (<a href="../../../k/e/l/User_talk%7EKelly_Martin_a543.html" title="User talk:Kelly Martin">talk</a>) 15:08, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Randomly happened by the page. I don't wish to condone everything said against Mr. Sidaway, but I see nothing wrong per se with a <i>request</i> that Mr. Sidaway stand for reconfirmation. Only the Arbcom could compel him to do so, of course, but asking him (in light of the recent controversy), seems perfectly reasonable to me. Of course, such request should be made politely. If there is a <i>policy</i> prohibiting voluntary reconfirmations, I'd like to know where it is, and I'd like to object to it. Anyone should be free to voluntarily re-stand. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 18:40, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm sorry about that,</p>
<p>I tried to be as judicious as I could -- I can't pick out particular comments from you, because I feel much as you do and as strongly as you do on these issues. My intent was only to distinguish your specific conduct from a general example. Sadly, the "vandal" stuff makes your conduct an honest sticking point with the opposition, and I cannot defend that logically (though a part of my <a href="../../../i/d/_/Id.html" title="Id">id</a> clearly enjoyed it, to be honest!)</p>
<p>Relatedly, Mr. Sidaway acknowledges that he is an admitted unabashed egotist. I have no problem saying anywhere -- and for all times, places, and people -- that unabashed egotists always fail eventually. Because he knows what I've told you, and I've said it to him directly, this can hardly be considered a personal attack, or even, really, a comment "behind his back." So, you see, we are of like minds in much of this issue.</p>
<p>If I am restrained, it comes from having dealt with the insults of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_South_e815.html" title="American South">Southern</a> <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigots.html" title="Bigots">bigots</a>, and yet having defended their right to speak in my former job with the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_Liberties_Union_b228.html" title="American Civil Liberties Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>. Comparately, Mr. Sidaway is a saint. Only comparatively.&#160;:)</p>
<p>You do fine work, and I commend you (despite the recent lapse with which I firmly disagree),</p>

<p>I think your argument is basically correct, and dispassionate. (I'm not sure if Mr. Sidaway's view is always binary -- he sees grey sometimes, but once he's certain, his grey becomes the <i>perfect</i>, only acceptable grey -- but the briefer way you've explained it is better for persuasion.) That said, I think it is highly likely that his response will be defensive, and it is also highly likely he will dismiss your view with a mention of the recent past events. Still, this is a good thing to have in the record. I'm also secretly hopeful that, whatever his defensive public face, he might privately take these criticisms to heart and work to improve.</p>
<p>In any case, if IAR isn't used sparingly, I expect tensions to accelerate, so I have hope that the problem will remain under control. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 06:51, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes, you're right. I'm sorry. I've been rather virulent in that DRV debate, haven't I? I just don't see a whisker of reason to restore the first article, and the second is only teenage spewage (imio). And Chalst has twice recently tried to tell when/where I should or shouldn't edit, and anyone who tries to so lecture me is likely to be reminded of the first two syllables of the website's name.</p>
<p>Anyway, yes, everything's ok (though RL is trying at present), and thanks for asking. I'll cool myself down. I just noticed the talk page for DRV. It fell off my watchlist in the move, and there's been <i>loads</i> going on. Annoying, but the outcome seems to be little change. I am concerned about the standing inconsistency between DRV and undel policy, though. The proposal changes the policy, after all, despite the protestations that such is somehow impossible. Perhaps today's frame-of-mind isn't the one with which I should make such a change, though. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 04:28, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So I learnt a new word. I didn't know one could recidivise(?). Anyway, no I won't, but then I won't give experienced editors who exhibit such sorry misunderstandings an easy ride, either. The trouble with your RfA is that I don't think a single incident need be taken as evidence of calamitous judgement from a familiar editor. But then, it was quite a serious infraction. But then, you certainly wouldn't do that again. But then others did point out some other lapses. But then they (the opposers) have so many sour grapes they could make wine, and I didn't want to join them. And I don't feel neutral about your RfA. So I'm left being unable to vote at all. Which is complicated. I'll stab you in the back some other time, if you like. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 01:44, 3 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>Well, I'm glad to see you're back to your usual levelheaded self. As you probably noticed, you recently had me thinking that you already were an admin (and IIRC, David thought the same). I realize this may turn out controversial because of the recent events, but I believe that whenever I think someone is an admin and it turns out he isn't, he deserves to be nominated.

Or would you prefer to wait awhile? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">R</a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">adiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_<font color="orange">&gt;|&lt;</font></a> 10:52, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Aaron, I think you would be a good admin, but the timing of this RfA is awful. At any time, this would have brought out the worst type of partisan warfare in some. But two weeks after that incident, many of us who would otherwise have supported you will be unable to do so. I just opposed <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurplefeltangel_71dc.html" title="User:Purplefeltangel">User:purplefeltangel</a> for vandalism three months ago, it would be hipocrisy to support this now. This <i>will</i> fail, and some of your more partisan critics will enjoy it. Can I suggest that either now, or immediately the trend becomes obvious, you in good spirit withdraw this - humbly aknowledging that the community's trust has been damaged by the sockpuppetry. If you do, you will score some credibility points with others, and I for one will be happy to support you in a month or so. Then I suspect it may (and will deserve to) succeed.<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 14:40, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>You already have at least four sections about your RFA, so <i>here's another one!</i></p>
<p>You have no idea how many other, less respected, names went through my head when I saw a section heading calling me a "Cheeky Monkey." I actually thought "<i>Ugh</i>. Who's going to be bitching at me now about a 3RR block?" (check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dmcdevit&amp;diff=27134087&amp;oldid=27093106" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dmcdevit&amp;diff=27134087&amp;oldid=27093106" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Boothy443&amp;diff=27136680&amp;oldid=27135395" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Boothy443&amp;diff=27136680&amp;oldid=27135395" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>). This admin thing is actually <i>sparing</i> you a lot of trouble.&#160;:-) Really, community respect/trust is much more important than a few extra buttons. I would part with them easily if I didn't think I was doing the community some good by pressing them once in a while. Just keep cool. Really.In fact, I'd like to nominate you when the time's right.</p>
<p>About the TL, the truth is, I have no idea. The purpose of it right now is as a list of articles that need cleanup/deletion, as the fact that they were transwikied means they were improper. I think the word transwiki tends to scare people away for some reason, though. Basically, very few people have ever touched that page (and if the software upgrade hadn't broken my bot, it would be five times as big, at least). Take a look at the archives and you'll see some old resolved entries, almost entirely done by just me, by hand. If you take a bit out of that page, I might give you something special! <small>(meaning a picture of something special, oooh...)</small></p>
<p>My talk page is always there for you, if you ever want an opinion on something, (or want to know what I think before saying something stupid&#160;:) I have to admit, sometimes you just make me laugh, and maybe that's why I like you. Remember that edit summary discussion on Splash's talk page...? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Splash/Archive5&amp;diff=24353170&amp;oldid=24350118" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Splash/Archive5&amp;diff=24353170&amp;oldid=24350118" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>&#160;:-) Take care. <a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 03:51, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi! I've removed your nomination. The problem is the pileon votes which will increase. RFA is the forum to ascertain the suitability of a candidate for adminship. For feedback, an RFC on yourself would be better. Having your nomination go on would be pointless IMHO, and unnecessarily increase the server load. Regards, PS I think the latter pronounciation would be fine. <i>Nichalp</i> is a combination of a few letters of my name, and surname. Regards, User:Nichalp/sg 06:01, 3 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh. All right then. I must be honest and say that seems, well, overly officious. I'm aware that an RfC would be the place had I been <i>seeking</i> feedback, but here I was trying to elicit <i>more</i> of what had been forthcoming. As to the "pile on" I'm not sure how that's a problem, as if they had brought points that I could improve that hadn't been touched yet, that would be the <i>point</i>. Finally, server load... that leaves me gobsmacked. You've got a <i><b>templated sig</b></i>. I'm not fussed by the removal <i>per se</i> but, well, yeah.

<dd>Well, the general consensus is that if an RFA receives oppose votes exceed the support votes by 10, then the RFA should be removed. (Its in the WP:RFA talk page archives, about a month back). Do you still find it officious? I know I'm guilty of templated signatures, but its a few bytes only as opposed to an rfa bid which is in tens of kbs. I was actually referring to the fact that the page was ~400kb. May I have the liberty of giving you a few tips for a sucessful nomination? User:Nichalp/sg 06:31, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I was interested to the recent comments by Hypocrite at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2005_October_26_a69c.html#Grove_School_moved_to_Grove_School_.28Madison.2C_Connecticut.29" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2005 October 26">Afd for Grove School</a></p>

<dd><i>I would be happy to help. I assume the intention is to take a bunch of stubs from a geographic district, create an article "High Schools in x,x,x" and then replace the individual school articles with redirects - for example, where I live now: "High Schools in Brooklyn, New York, USA?" Can I suggest that notable schools with longer articles be shortened and included in stub-format in the list, with a link from their name to their main article? Suggest a starting location!</i> Hipocrite - «Talk» 13:10, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>My first experience with the school debate was with the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Benjamin_Cory_Elementary_School_f5b7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Benjamin Cory Elementary School">Afd for Benjamin Cory Elementary School</a>. You may remember that this discussion actually extended into the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_Benjamin_Cory_Elementary_School_441a.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/Benjamin Cory Elementary School">talk page</a>. At about that time I started to experiment with essentially the redirect approach, as Hypocrite describes above. The first page I tried was based on a, then, recent <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Charlotte_High_School_5be9.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Charlotte High School">Vfd for Charlotte HS</a>. You can see my effort at <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_Public_Schools_ae2a.html" title="Charlotte Public Schools">Charlotte Public Schools</a>. I was trying to create a template approach that could be used to see the hierarchy of the schools as well as make it relatively easy for people transfer the information to a new and better article if someone saw fit to expand one of the schools.</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Bartlett_High_School%2C_Bartlett%2C_Illinois_e270.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bartlett High School, Bartlett, Illinois">Afd for Bartlett High School</a> I again tried this approach at the <a href="../../../e/l/g/Elgin_Area_School_District_U46_ff28.html" title="Elgin Area School District U46">Elgin Area School District U46</a>.</p>
<p>After the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Chester_County_High_School_b487.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chester County High School">Afd for Chester_County_High_School</a> I created the following <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chester_County_School_District_df6f.html" title="Chester County School District">Chester County School District</a> article to allow the school article to have some real context.</p>
<p>And finally I experimented with a very long list of schools in hampshire after the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Court_Moor_School_f224.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Court Moor School">Afd Court Moor School</a> although I did not really complete the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_schools_in_Hampshire_area1_2455.html" title="List of schools in Hampshire area1">school district list</a> to my satisfaction in that case.</p>
<p>Early on I was labeled as a deletionist by Silensor and Nicodemus75 but I do not count myself as one. I have always tried to be a constructive voice in this debate. I know these pages are not perfect but i saw them as an experimental compromise. The most important thing for these school articles is that they are not hanging in cyber space with no context. I think this was summed up well by yourself at the recent <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Log_2005_October_26_a69c.html#Grove_School_moved_to_Grove_School_.28Madison.2C_Connecticut.29" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2005 October 26">Afd for Grove School</a>:</p>

<p>The reason I use "a different construction" is because I'm only... ah, "half-black", whatever the hell that means. Going back three generations I am African-Anglo-Scots/Irish-Cherokee-Polish (ethnic Jew). If you saw me, you'd know I wasn't Caucasian, but you'd probably be undecided about the rest. When I typical Southerner see me, then I am black.&#160;:) This gives me a nuanced view of "race" (which I attest doesn't exist biologically, but certainly does sociologically.)

<p>I mean that sincerely. Some of your advice I will probably heed, however when it comes to Nicodemous, the only way he'll get any kind of olive branch from me is if he stops this hardline BS. I'm willing to compromise on the school issue, however I've not seen any indication he is at this time. And if an RFC is started against me it's started against me. From what I've seen of that process it's about as useful as the AFD School debates have been, (ie:nothing happens at all except more bickering with no ultimate conclusion one way or the other), so no worries on me keeping clear as I have no interest in that kind of garbage even if I am the topic.<a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 18:40, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hmm. As for mediation skills in general, I don't know very much about them, but being honest, it <i>did</i> seem like you were going after <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony's</a> head in his RFC. So, perhaps, try not to get too much into a problem like you did before. Remember not to lose your head like you did with the IgnoreAllRules vandal, and the best way to do it is to remember that if you share the same goal as the other user (that is, building an encyclopedia), you eventually can come to agreement. If the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Wikipedia%7EStaying_cool_when_the_editing_gets_hot_762d.html" title="Wikipedia:Staying cool when the editing gets hot">things get too heated</a>, just go do something else for an hour or so: go improve an article listed on <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">FAC</a>, go speedy tag junk on <a href="../../../n/e/w/Special%7ENewpages_26cd.html" title="Special:Newpages">Special:Newpages</a> so I can delete it, go <a href="../../../w/p/s/WP%7EWPSS_d6e8.html" title="WP:WPSS">sort stubs</a> or something else until your head cools off.

<p>As for my comments on your RfA, you must know that the timing was awful; I couldn't in good conscience support so soon after, and your interactions with Tony are not the high point of your Wikipedia career.

Could be better, but not too bad; I don't expect every prospective admin to be Mother Teresa, and you do have a talent for finding a contentious mess and jumping into it.

<p>If you want to know about it's popularity or whatever, I have plenty of sources!</p>
<p>Mugglecast is a very popular podcast from Mugglenet.com,<a href="http://www.mugglenet.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mugglenet.com/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> which does have it's own Wiki page. Mugglenet gets millions of users a month, from hundreds of countries. It's been on Yahoo a few times, here are the links. <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/051108/sftu076.html?.v=35" class="external autonumber" title="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/051108/sftu076.html?.v=35" rel="nofollow">[9]</a><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/051102/25187.html?.v=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/051102/25187.html?.v=1" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> Also, it's been mentioned repeatedly by the CEO of iTunes, for example, it's in their newsletter this week. <a href="http://www.mugglenet.com/mugglecast/ITunesNewsletter.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mugglenet.com/mugglecast/ITunesNewsletter.shtml" rel="nofollow">[11]</a></p>
<p>70,000 people are subscribed to Mugglecast on iTunes, and it has always been at LEAST in the top 60 podcasts, usually much higher though. The first month it was on iTunes, it was #1. On it's Frappr, which is a Google map where you can post shout outs and such, Mugglecast has almost 3000 different people: <a href="http://www.frappr.com/mugglecast" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.frappr.com/mugglecast" rel="nofollow">[12]</a></p>
<p>Also, on the official fanlisting, that just came out 2 days ago, there are already about 100 people and 525 different posts. Mugglecast is also hosting a big Barnes and Nobles Live Podcast in NYC, where it is estimated 700 fans alone will be there.</p>
<p>If you want more proof, I can find it, but I assure you, Mugglecast is VERY VERY popular.&#160;:) Please allow the entry.&#160;:/ ~Mamatha</p>

<p>I don't know, it would take at least two or three more delete votes to qualify as consensus for delete (assuming there are no more keep votes). AfDs do have a tendency not to get much attention after the first few days, so this is not anything special in that respect. If you want to relist it, go ahead, but I'm probably not going to do that.

<p>I rarely vote oppose and felt sorry to do so, but think that the biggest problem with your RfA was timing...perhaps in a few months, it will be more advantageous for you. I am glad that you decided to stick it out here and continue to contribute even after the your failed RfA, and dealings with Mr. Sidaway (even though I take his side in that conflict)...I admire people that stick to their guns and think that even though we all get in petty disagreements, it is important that all get heard.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 02:46, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well that was a rather shocking, yet interesting, explanation. Feel free to add me, it'd be good to have a guardian angel. I just found it strange to have 6 users on someone's user page with slashes inbetween them, and the link was to their contribs rather than their user page. And I knew you aren't friends with specifically at least one of them, so I knew it wasn't some wikifriends thing; yet all the users are recognizable admins, so I was really just curious.

<p>I disregarded all votes from anonymous users. After that action, the result of the debate was eight for deletion and two for inclusion.

<p>Since you're begging for it. As per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nicodemus75&amp;oldid=27179381" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nicodemus75&amp;oldid=27179381" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, you're right - I <b>DO</b> think you are a "deletionist vandal" among other things. My earlier attempt to reconcile with you after your disgusting and inherently racist use of the term "nigger" in the context of saying "even they [them niggers] call each other that" was patently ignored <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aaron_Brenneman&amp;oldid=23388343#Gee.2C_that_was_fast" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aaron_Brenneman&amp;oldid=23388343#Gee.2C_that_was_fast" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> with no response on your page or on mine. My apologies on that occasion were not replied to, and my declaration that my use of the term "deletionist" is in no way intended as personal insult or attack went unanswered, and in fact you have since insisted on several occasions that my use of the term is a personal attack, including your removal of my comments including the term "deletionist" and even the phrase "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete" (which is just a statement of identification of behavior of certain editors and I am baffled at how that could be construed as a personal attack). Your ignoring of my attempt to mend the fence I see as typical of your behavior in general, which had included a block request against me for calling you a "deletionist". I see a continuation of this sort of nonsense in many of your actions including the most recent and shameful incident of your vandalism, motivated by your clear hatred for Tony and his positions.</p>
<p>Now the current debate where you pontificate from on high as some well-read and researched editor on the history of consensus on school articles, from a <b>clearly</b> partisan pro-deletion perspective. I respect the fact that you may have a different philosophical position than I do on schools. What I do not respect are many of your comments and tactics. I am frankly sick and tired of you constantly insisting that you aren't a partisan, that you don't favour the deletion of school stubs and "non-notable" school articles defacto, when you clearly are every bit as much a partisan as I am. The constant self-righteous, holier-than-thou approach to school debating is offensive in the extreme, particularly when it is peppered with false statements to buttress your position. If I went around, claiming there clear, majority consensus keep on ALL elementary schools, you (and others) would <b>rightly</b> call me on it and be outraged that I was fraudulently trying to convince people of falsehoods. If I came back and claimed, "Oh that's how it was months ago" you would in all likelihood be rightly suspicious of my claims considering my history of participation in the debate or at least suggest that I get my shit in order when making claims and make sure they are backed up by the evidence - using a couple of selective AfD results on the fly, obviously wouldn't cut it.</p>
<p>Based on the history of interaction, I am not sure how we can reconcile at this stage, because you don't respect anything I say, and I essentially consider you to be a <b>bad faith</b> contributor to many discussions on WP, admittedly backed by offense taken at your latently racist remark. (Just to be totally clear, it is not the word "NIGGER" that I am so offended by, it is the phrase "even <b>they</b> call each other that" stating by implication that "they" are the "niggers" in question). If you want to debate and even bandwagon for school deletion - fine. But I do not think false claims and the whole self-righteous act when it comes to AfD that "you are all partisans and I am not" is a bunch of condescending, insulting tripe that is intended to pander to certain elements of the WP community so your next go at adminship actually has something better than a snowball's chance in hell. To top it off, you make even more galling statements that "[Nicodemus] has done worse" than calling people jerks. When it is you who have insulted me (and others) with your disgusting use of a racial epithet while insisting "oh, but it was sarcasm" and "Oh I am not a racist". I'm sure you'll tell me next how you "even have some black friends" or some other nonsense.</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, the ball is in your court to do something more substantive than just offer a string of glib apologies everytime you do something offensive.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 09:48, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Forgive me for the delay, I hardly get anytime during the week and I thank you for your patience. I've gone through your RFA and the reasons for the oppose vote.</p>
<p>I do think that you need some more time (at least 45 days) before your next bid. I'd noticed that you had some problems being civil. If you dont repeat it over the next few weeks, you're less likely to get opposed. Public memory is notoriously short, and if there are no behavioural related issues, your past misdeeds will be forgiven. Also try and make up with those who strongly opposed your RFA. Collaborate with them, try and find a common ground. Also if you make an error, its nice if you could apologise right at the start to avoid it snowballing unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Adminship is a position of trust. The community will vote for you if you are trustworthy. You'd have to build up on your reputation from now on. Start by participating on the Village Pump and RFA talk pages. A daily visit to AFD, IFD and CFD will help. You could also help out in RC-patrol, though vandalism can also be fought via watchlists.</p>
<p>I've also read that you are a good editor. The article you provided didn't allow me to evaluate it. Why don't you try and get an article featured. Getting an article featured is not easy and is appreciated by the community. Those who do get an article featured usually have a smoother RFA nom. FAC is a great leveller, it is a stressful process, but if you can come out on top, there's nothing like it.</p>
<p>I know the above is short, but I hope you consider the above points.
