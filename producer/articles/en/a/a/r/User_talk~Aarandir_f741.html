<p>This Argument was between me and an admin. Both of us were stubborn but as you go down the argument you will see the admins logic and reasoning skills deteriorate somewhat, he starts interpreting things I say as something that they are not supposed to mean for example; he though me calling him "immature" meant I was being ageist (i wasnt, infact i didnt even know his age). Anyway see for yourselves. He is no doubt embarrased of this argument and doesn't want anyone to see it therefore he comes up to MY page and tries to change the structure to try and keep it <a href="../../../e/m/b/Embarrassment.html" title="Embarrassment">under wraps</a>.</p>

<p>would it kill you to just unblock the page? the thing is i can promiss to you she will be an amazing personality... its very obvious</p>

<p>yes... but she will; if she is likely to have one then she probably will have one, in addition to that NO HARM or offense whatsoever can come of you un-protecting her page, infact by refusing to unprotect her page you are slightly upsetting/annoying me therefore, u should un-protect her page.</p>

<dd>She is not notable. Therefore she should not have an article. Therefore the 'article' is protected. If the page gets unprotected, someone (you) will create an article on her.

<p>1) your argument is flawed/poorly structured;</p>
<p>2) but the fact that she does not have an article makes me annoyed slightly, only a demented person would dream of anoying an innocent human being and anyway she already has reached a level of fame entitling her to an article on wikipedia. can you give me an account of how famous one has to be to be entitled to an article on wiki? <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarandir_95f1.html" title="User:Aarandir">Aarandir</a> 14:12, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

you are now just being stubborn and irrational not engaging in the argument but going in circle. can you please reply something sensible to my argument? i put it to u that working my probabily in this certain incident wont harm anybody but infact do the opposite (make my upset cos you are being soo stubborn) will you say something coherent or are you going to be immature and reiterate your claim that i belive is not entirely justified. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarandir_95f1.html" title="User:Aarandir">Aarandir</a> 14:32, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>i am "cool" as you put it just getting progressively angry (but i can control my anger and not resort to being immature and stubborn). anyway AGAIN you somehow manage to avoid answering my question. if ANYTHING i think you are insulting me by not listening to my argument and continually denying my rational requests and getting me worked up.</p>

<p>can you tell me what this "personal attack" is? maybe if you show me it ill consider whether i meant it as such and consequently apolgise. please firefox do not get angry, you have said something completely irrelavant "edit war" i have not instigated an edit war... i have not edited anything so please dont make that claim. your claim that i am making personal attacks on you or instigating an edit war i find highly offensive.</p>

<dd>I think you've gone <a href="../../../a/g/e/Ageism.html" title="Ageism">too far</a> now by saying "you are being immature becuase it is generally accepted that children are stubborn and immature." If you think that because I am 16 years old (a "child"), you can call me stubborn and immature, you are very wrong. I've given you answers, and you want more. From what you've just said I'm not going to think any more up. — <i><b><a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFireFox_99a0.html" title="User:FireFox"><span style="color:#3971DE">Fire</span></a><a href="../../../f/i/r/User_talk%7EFireFox_263b.html" title="User talk:FireFox"><span style="color:#3971DE">Fox</span></a></b></i> 15:12, 17 July '06</dd>

<p>listen mate im 17... i am not being ageist, you are constantly interpreting things wrong, i never SAID you were a child not was i trying to imply you were (i didnt even know you age). and im glad you have given up becuase i can now talk to a more mature and responsible admin (not nesseceraly older). while were on the topic of interpretations let me just say (THIS IS NOT DIRECTED AT YOU AND DONT TAKE IT AS SUCH) silly/wrong interpreations of the <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible.html" title="Bible">Bible</a> and <a href="../../../q/u/r/Quraan.html" title="Quraan">Quraan</a> have led to religeous wars and DREADFULL acts of <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_4153.html" title="9/11">terror</a> therefore we should ALL (as the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_race.html" title="Human race">Human race</a>) be carefull how we interpret things and not jump to conclusions.</p>
<p>nice arguing with you, even though the argument was flawed and not carried on propely or coherently on your part. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarandir_95f1.html" title="User:Aarandir">Aarandir</a> 15:20, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

What exactly is the problem? I moved your comment to the end, because the comments need to be in Choronological order to make sense. You are adding at arbitrary places.

<p>i dont have a bloody problem, my posting is the latest and it should be on top like it is on every discussion board. anyway i decide where it goes not you, i can take this to higher autority, and i feel i more justified to put it where i want (on the top) rather than have it in "chrnological order" where no one will probably see it. PS. bloody is not a "profanity" it isnt offending you now is it? its there to show im rather unhappy, not there to make you feel bad about yourself or insult anyone. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarandir_95f1.html" title="User:Aarandir">Aarandir</a> 22:07, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Please take it to any "higher authority". Also, please take a look at <a href="../../../t/a/l/Wikipedia%7ETalk_page_guidelines_82c6.html#Layout" title="Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines">Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines#Layout</a> the layout guidelines, which state <i>Proceed descendingly: Within each topic, the further down the contribution to talk, the chronologically later it was made.</i>. I have to clean up your whimsically left top posting, which is becoming quite irritating. When going to a talk page, you might notice a "+" button at the top. When you click that, the message goes at the end of the current page, not the top. Top posting is not a wikipedia convention. The latest postings need to go at the bottom.

<p>well thats a policy that frankly needs reviewing. its silly. the newest being at the bottom and not at the top. you take that policy to a secret service office and see what they think about it. i cant imagine someone at the CIA saying "hmmm, news from iran: iran launches missle at israel, you know what ill leave this at the bottom incase ragib gets angry" (bad example i know) but you must admit newest should be at the top. ill make a poll to prove to you that more than 90&amp; of people think the newest think should be at the top. when i said higher autority i meant someone bigger than you on wikipedia. so for the moment leave me comment at the top please. dont be annoying, ive never been insuled more on any other discussion board where people have moved my comment down to the bottom for "chronological ordering"</p>

<p>Hi there. I'd be happy to help you with the series. The infobox is basically a simpler way of showing common information like the population and area figures. I have been awake for about 24 hours now so I am going to sleep for a bit but if you want I'll try to create a template for you in the morning. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_Giant_e03e.html" title="User:Green Giant">Green Giant</a> 22:22, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay! lol get your much needed sleep. i live in the Uk aswell by the way, i am asian(pakistani-punjabi-mirpuri) if you care! you?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not slept well (damned local cats are in heat&#160;:P ) but I made a start on the infobox, you can find it at <a href="../../../p/a/k/Template%7EPakistan_districts_c653.html" title="Template:Pakistan districts">Template:Pakistan districts</a>. I won't add it to any district until we're happy with the layout, so make any changes you feel are necessary and we'll take it from there. Plus added a bit to Attock district.</dd>
<dd>Cos you asked, I'm a Yorkshire-man (and protestingly labelled as English), living in Chapeltown, Leeds (love the mixture of people from different backgrounds). You're Mirpuri, as in Mirpur, Azad Kashmir? <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_Giant_e03e.html" title="User:Green Giant">Green Giant</a> 01:53, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Yeap, i dunno, but i consider myself punjabi becuase i speak it as opposed to kashmiri. anyway yes very nice infobox, great job! im not exactly sure capital would be appropriate. i dont think so... im more or less gettin all my information from this site <a href="http://www.punjab.gov.pk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.punjab.gov.pk/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> lol. and i cant find anything there about nazim or niam nazim or district council seats. or time zone or co-ordinates and capital. anyway capital and its coordinates are the only ones i think shouldnt be there. ill go ahead and delete them. and ill i hope you dont mind me applying it to <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attock_District_4229.html" title="Attock District">Attock District</a> right? i dont have a map with pictures of the punjab districts highlighed, can you make that? can i help? forget it if its too much trouble. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAarandir_95f1.html" title="User:Aarandir">Aarandir</a> 22:12, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, long time no see. I've been busy working on getting the <a href="../../../p/a/k/Pakistan.html" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> article up to Featured Article status but now I think I'll have time for our project on the districts of the Punjab. I think we should expand it to include all districts in Pakistan as well as districts of Azad Kashmir and the Northern Areas (although the latter might be difficult to obtain information on). I disagree with the several provincial templates you created because there is nothing specifically which distinguishes a district in Punjab from a district in Sindh or any other province. The only distinction we need to make is between the two types of districts - ordinary districts and city-districts. This is because in ordinary districts the subdivisions are called tehsils and in city-districts the subdivisions are towns. Accordingly I have requested these templates be speedily deleted to avoid any confusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>‎Template:Azad Kashmir districts</li>
<li>‎Template:Balochistan, Pakistan districts</li>
<li>‎Template:NWFP distrcts</li>
<li>‎Template:NWFP districts</li>
<li>‎Template:Punjab, Pakistan districts</li>
<li>‎Template:Sindh districts</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it makes sense to create an article series using only three templates for this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's move <a href="../../../p/a/k/Template%7EPakistan_districts_c653.html" title="Template:Pakistan districts">Template:Pakistan districts</a> to a new <a href="../../../p/a/k/Template%7EPakistan_District_Infobox_164f.html" title="Template:Pakistan District Infobox">Template:Pakistan District Infobox</a> for ordinary districts</li>
<li>Use the <a href="../../../p/a/k/Template%7EPakistani_Cities_16d5.html" title="Template:Pakistani Cities">Template:Pakistani Cities</a> for the city-districts</li>
<li>Create a new <a href="../../../d/i/s/Template%7EDistricts_of_Pakistan_14d4.html" title="Template:Districts of Pakistan">Template:Districts of Pakistan</a> to become a navigation tool at the bottom of each district page.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The existing <a href="../../../d/i/s/Districts_of_Pakistan_3bd2.html" title="Districts of Pakistan">Districts of Pakistan</a> page can become the main article for the series</li>
<li>I will try to extend the existing <a href="../../../c/i/t/City_District_Government_7886.html" title="City District Government">City District Government</a> page as an extra article</li>
<li>I will continue working on a decent map for the districts, which was sitting around doing nothing because someone uploaded images of four maps from a government or NGO website which showed the four provinces separately and gave a rough idea of how many districts and tehsils each had. However, these maps have copyright problems, so I will try to create four provincial maps to replace them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Look forward to hearing from you soon. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreen_Giant_e03e.html" title="User:Green Giant">Green Giant</a> 04:48, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

Did you get it from the web somewhere? -- <a href="../../../s/t/b/User%7EStbalbach_126e.html" title="User:Stbalbach">Stbalbach</a> 17:17, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for uploading <b><a href="../../../k/a/l/Image%7EKalashg.jpg_c10b.html" title="Image:Kalashg.jpg">Image:Kalashg.jpg</a></b>. I notice the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> status is unclear. If you have not created this file yourself, then there needs to be a justification explaining why we have the right to use it on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you did not create the file yourself, then you need to specify where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.</p>
<p>If the file also doesn't have a copyright tag, then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the {{<a href="../../../g/f/d/Template%7EGFDL-self_97c5.html" title="Template:GFDL-self">GFDL-self</a>}} tag can be used to release it under the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>.
