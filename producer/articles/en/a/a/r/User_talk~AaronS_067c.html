<p>I'm very sorry to see you go. Now you understand why I have kept away from the anarchism articles. There's a lot more that can be done here other than those, and the right folks, eventually, will probably perservere, so the best thing seems to be to make small edits to those at random intervals, rather than focusing completely on them. I suggest and ask that you take a Wikibreak, or try working on articles completely unrelated to anarchism. Like working on the collaboration of the week, or hitting Alt-X (random article) and finding something to spruce up. It'd be sad to lose you. Good luck. --<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGolbez_ce9f.html" title="User:Golbez">Golbez</a> 18:34, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Thanks a lot. I appreciate you taking the time to consider the matter.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The way I see it, if we are going to keep bringing up my 3RR violations, then we should consider them as separate, and we should also consider the circumstances surrounding them. The first was inadvertent on my part, and I kindly asked the blocking administrator to lift the block, because I was currently editing <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_England_30a7.html" title="New England">New England</a> extensively, working towards FA status. He did. The second was later admitted to be a hasty error on the part of the blocking administrator, who was also very reasonable. The third, by <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a>, is a bit up in the air. I contested it, and believe that Woohookitty admitted that he might have been in error, but I'm not quite sure at this point. Either way, in that case, I was reverting without edit warring, an exception to <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regardless, I do not have a history of tendentious editing. I rarely ever insert unsourced claims into controversial articles. Most of my edits have only been considered tendentious by a select group of highly ideological editors, some of whom are now banned indefinitely. As far as edit warring is concerned, I try as hard as possible to refrain from revert wars, and when I revert, it is usually without edit warring. My reasons are always promptly explained on the talk page of the article in question.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Much of my involvement in Wikipedia's controversial articles (and my involvement with Wikipedia was not exclusive to them, although I took a certain interest in them) has been in conjunction with the involvement of a few other truly bad faith editors, who are now banned indefinitely (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThewolfstar_d89c.html" title="User:Thewolfstar">Thewolfstar</a>, <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheIndividualist_25e6.html" title="User:TheIndividualist">TheIndividualist</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/g/User%7EHogeye_abad.html" title="User:Hogeye">Hogeye</a>, and their various proven or admitted sock puppets). Considering that I was editing controversial articles that were swamped with a few zealots, it follows that I often walked a thin line. I feel that I always walked that line in good faith and with the best interests of the encyclopaedia in mind.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I pointed out my 3RR violations to the AN some time ago, asking for input. Many editors were sympathetic to my position. We all noted that, sometimes, administrators do not fully understand the context of a situation, especially where controversial articles are concerned, because they are too busy to take the time to do so. I'm very happy that <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWoohookitty_27d9.html" title="User:Woohookitty">Woohookitty</a> has protected <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> and taken a greater interest in it. It was only after hitting a brick wall a number of times that I decided that Wikipedia wasn't worth my time, anymore. --AaronS 20:04, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, Hogeye just got unblocked a few days ago, and has since posted to the anarchism talk page once. They had their blocks extended so many months for sockpuppetry though, that it seemed like they were indef blocked. They really should be though. The minute he steps out of line we need to propose a community indef ban on him. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_Wikipedian_kitchen_68b8.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force/Wikipedian kitchen"><font color="green"><sup>The Wiki Kitchen!</sup></font></a> 23:46, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Re-reading my comments, I feel I was unduly harsh in my responses, particularly given the nature of the matter. For that, I apologize.

<dd>Reading Foucault, Sartre, Derrida, Camus, and others in different French and philosophy courses attracted me to the subject. I've also studied in France several times. So, I simply combined my three favorite subjects: French, philosophy, and literature. I'll be applying to seven different schools, listed in the order of how good their program is for me: Johns Hopkins (the best), Harvard, NYU, Yale, UC Berkeley, UC Irvine, and Princeton. After graduate school, I'll in all likelihood become a professor of some sort. --AaronS 13:03, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

It got taken out with the removal of all the crap that was going on that page that day though. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><b><font color="black">Ungovernable Force</font></b></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><sup>Got something to say?</sup></font></a> 04:38, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I called the editor in question, who has been banned and blocked a number of times for disruption, trolling, OR, and so forth, "dishonest," because he was acting dishonestly. I explained to him why I felt so. I called him an idealogue; but, he has already admitted to that. A synonym for "idealogue" is "zealot." Perhaps I was being a bit egregious by throwing in the word "charlatan," but a an idealogue and zealot who feigns neutrality (after admitting to his immutable bias) is indeed a charlatan. I really wish that you would look at a situation more closely before throwing around these warnings. Also, I'm not sure why this is a final warning. I can't even remember the last time I was warned for making a personal attack. --AaronS 04:17, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Did calling him all that help the discussion in any way? I don't think so, it only drives up tensions making the discussion less and less hospitable and hence more and more pointless. From the first paragraph of <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>: "Comment on content, not on the contributor."--<a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKonstable_8474.html" title="User:Konstable"><span style="color:red">Konst</span></a>.<a href="../../../k/o/n/User_talk%7EKonstable_e0b7.html" title="User talk:Konstable"><span style="color:green">Able</span></a> 08:53, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm familiar with the policy. When a user is a troll who disrupts in a particular way, it is indeed useful to expose that. I have been watching the discussion for quite some time, only adding my own thoughts very sparingly. I have had experience with Hogeye in the past, before he was originally banned. He was diverting discussion aimed towards improving the article towards the same kinds of things that got him banned -- originally-researched diagrams from his personal web site, leads that purposefully do not attempt to reach any compromise, etc. He has already stated, more or less, that his intention is to make editing the article so unbearable that people will be forced to give him what he wants.</dd>
<dd>Showing exactly how Hogeye disrupts discussion enables other contributors to be cautious and helps them better understand how to deal with him. Hogeye already has a chip on his shoulder the size of the Titanic. My comments bounced right off him. The purpose of them, however, was to show others that, until he changes his behavior, they should not be wasting pages and pages of talk page discussion rehashing the same old points that he was bringing up before he was banned. --AaronS 12:52, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I live in London these days, so I'm only back in Ireland four or five times a year, but it you haven't been there since the late 90s, it's changed massively (particularly Dublin). Good parts: It's very multicultural with a substantial Chinese and African population. Bad parts: Ireland got rich and hit the verge of cultural breakdown (though it looks like people went to the pub, had a few drinks and got over it). Dublin's been tarted up and has lost a lot of its soul. House prices are through the roof. Drinks cost a fortune. There are too many cars. LOL!

<li>2.

<p>Could you indicate via a revised templete the source?</p>
