	    <p>Milton Friedman was born in New York City on July 31, 1912 to a working class of Jewish immigrants from a Hungarian community. At a young age, the family moved to Rahway, New Jersey, where Friedman's parents kept a dry-goods store. Although the family faced somewhat of a financial need, it was decided early that Milton would attend college. He earned a degree in mathematics from Rutgers University, graduating in 1932 during the depths of the Depression. Although scholarships covered his tuition costs, he worked throughout his student years to meet his living expenses. After graduation, Friedman was interested in furthering his studies in mathematics, but the state of the economy inspired him to pursue economics instead. He accepted a scholarship from the University of Chicago, where he would earn his master’s degree and also meet his future wife, Rose Director. Friedman was awarded a year's fellowship to continue postgraduate studies at Columbia University. After another year in Chicago as a research assistant in the economics department, he was then hired by the National Resources Committee in Washington to work on a large consumer budget survey. During World War II, he worked in the Treasury Department, where he helped create the federal withholding tax system. Before that time, Americans had paid their taxes in a single lump sum each year. He also held such jobs as National Resource Committee, a professor at the University or Chicago, Bureau Staff, a consultant to U.S. Governmental Agency, and also as a visiting professor at Cambridge. In 1937, Friedman joined the research staff of the National Bureau of Economic Research in New York City. With a steady income finally assured, Milton Friedman and Rose Director were married in 1938. After the war, Friedman's dissertation was finally published, and he was awarded his Ph.D. from Columbia University. His book, Incomes from Independent Professional Practice introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income. This study of professional income mixed with his prior work on consumer budgets, served as the basis of his landmark Theory of the Consumption Function. After one year at the University of Minnesota, Friedman accepted an appointment at the University of Chicago, where he taught for the next 30 years, while simultaneously maintaining a staff position with the Bureau of Economic Research. In 1976, Friedman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his achievements in the fields of consumption analysis, monetary history and theory and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy. Later , in the same year, Milton retired from teaching at the University of Chicago. Although still living today, Milton Friedman’s hard work, dedication to his studies, and his important theories helped shape and make a extravagant impact on the economy.</p>

<p>Milton Freidman- Theory Report</p>
<p>To fully understand Milton Friedman and his theories on the economy you must first understand the meaning of the word methodology. Methodology as stated in Webster’s dictionary is the analysis of the principles or procedures of inquiry in a particular field. Another definition of the word is a body of methods, rules, and postulates employed by a discipline: a particular procedure or set of procedures. Milton used this way of looking at the economy to produce the theories that he did. In its entirety this word defines the study of our economy and what men like Milton Friedman based their life works upon. Milton stated that a theory is strictly an instrument for generating predictions. Milton formed two strong instruments for generating predictions, the Quantity Theory of Money and also The Expectations-augmented Phillips Curve. Friedman is said to be the foremost conservative economist in the United States today. He is a very strong defender of the old-fashioned “quantity” theory of money. According to that theory, the dominant factor in the shaping of economic events is the amount of money in existence, and particularly in circulation. This theory simply states that the more money circulating in the economy the higher the average prices of goods and services is going to be. Friedman also believed that Keynesian economics does not work. He said. “But nothing is harder for men than to face facts that threaten to undermine strongly held beliefs.” Freidman opposed farm price supports, securities, and exchange controls but favored the application of antitrust laws. He thought social security should be abandoned and welfare and anti poverty apparatus be replaced by a simple reverse income tax, a cash subsidy for those citizens in the lowest income group. Friedman is credited with the negative tax idea and helped it gain its popularity and acceptance that it would not have otherwise received. This negative income tax idea is defined as a guaranteed annual income, a citizen with less income than the total of exemption deductions permitted by the IRS would be paid the deficiency in cash. With this form of taxation it gives help in the form most useful to the individual, cash. Friedman also stated the Expectations-augmented Phillips Curve. In this theory Friedman molded the Philips Curve to allow the curve to still work when unemployment and inflation bout rose at the same time. The Philips curve did not before allow for the rise of both at the same time. If the government decided the unemployment rates were too high it would boost the demand. The increase in demand for goods and services will fairly soon begin to lead to inflation, and so any increase in employment will quickly be wiped out as people realize that there hasn't been a real increase in demand. So having moved along the Phillips Curve, the firms now begin to lay people off once again and unemployment moves back. Next time around the firms and consumers are ready for this, and anticipate the inflation. If the government insists on trying again the economy will do the same thing only at a higher rate of inflation.</p>
<p>Friedman blamed the government and its monetary policy for being the main cause of economic depressions and inflations in the United States. He stated that the government preoccupied itself with “inept” fiscal manipulation; it ignored the hopeless monetary policy. Friedman described the monetary policy as “leaning against the wind.” In saying this Friedman meant that the board tightens money when boom periods approach a critical climax, and loosens money when recessions threaten to become depressions. The reason this does not work is because there is always a time lag between a shift in Federal Reserve policy and the effect of that shift on the economy. Friedman believed that the Federal Reserve board should be stripped of discretionary control of the money supply and directed to increase the supply at a steady rate of approximately 4 percent “month in and month out, year in and year out.” Friedman believed in laissez-faire, the government having the least involvement on the economy as possible. Freidman felt their were more economical ways to control the market, the trend is to upgrade social responsibility and downgrade individual responsibility. This does not work because if a man feels like he has no responsibility for his own deficiencies, he is likely to take out his frustrations on society as a whole, even in lawless acts.</p>
