<dd>Yikes. There are <i>lots</i> of things that "Can" be done with admin powers but that shouldn't be. Admins "can" unblock themselves rather than asking someone else to do it, but reasonable people have suggested that <i>that</i> course of action should be instant dead-minn.</dd>
<dd>Look at it this way: Clearly you thought the article had a reason to exist in mainspace. Clearly Zoe did not. So she pushes her button. Then, since you disagree, you push yours. This hasn't progressed any discussion, or worked towards any solution. You're saying that it was ok because you thought you were right, I believe. But Zoe still thought <i>she</i> was right, so what would have been wrong with her just speedy deleting it again?</dd>
<dd>There are heaps of admins around. It wouldn't have been hard to find someone else to do it for you. Barring that, when you restored it <i>you</i> should have taken it to AfD per <a href="../../../u/n/d/Wikipedia%7EUndeletion_policy_6fe1.html#Exception" title="Wikipedia:Undeletion policy">Wikipedia:Undeletion_policy#Exception</a>.

<dd>I certainly agree that there are things admins can do that they shouldn't. I'm just not convinced that restoring this article was an example of that. In editing, we follow the <a href="../../../b/o/l/Wikipedia%7EBOLD%2C_revert%2C_discuss_cycle_e770.html" title="Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle">BOLD, revert, discuss cycle</a>. It seems to me that the process followed here was BOLD delete, revert delete, discuss. That seems reasonable and constructive to me. Now that I know that it is considered bad form, I won't do it again. But I still don't understand why.

<dd>I can see your position. I tend to not think that BRD applies to administrative actions, but I appear to be almost alone in that nowdays! I'd think that <i>wider</i> discussion was the key here, and thus something like taking it to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> or restoring it and putting it on <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> yourself would have been better. Both of those venues lend themselves to slower action/reaction. How about if I redact "bad form" to "could have been done somewhat differently?" - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 01:52, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have no objection to your "bad form" comment; you may leave it or redact it as you wish.

<p>Hi, the notice shouldn't have been blanked - that needs to remain of course. The rest of the story is a request via email to the Wikimedia Foundation. A writer asked that we remove the AfD page, as it is coming up high on search engine results. I explained that we couldn't do this, that we needed to keep a record of the debate, but that I could blank the page as a compromise solution. It's something that comes up as a request every now and then, and blanking has seemed to be a solution that everyone can live with (the full debate is easily accessible via history of course). I'd appreciate the AfD page being restored to the (semi)blank state. It is such a little thing to accommodate someone on this, it causes no harm and prevents conflict. I'm sure you'll agree that's a good solution all round.

<p>Sorry for the slow response. I'm not sure exactly what the best way to handle these is. In the past, I've always just blanked as I did, with an explanation that the full discussion is in the history, and that's been fine with everyone. But there is a wider discussion about this starting on the mailing list <a href="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-January/037246.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-January/037246.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Jimbo has obviously got a lot of these requests directly, as well as those we have had on the info address. So he's opened up the discussion on what should be done. It looks as though most people on the mailing list think that blanking, combined with technical means to prevent search engine indexing, are the way to go. On the second AfD, I'd say the same can be done for that once the discussion is over. -- <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESannse_0094.html" title="User:Sannse">sannse</a> <a href="../../../s/a/n/User_talk%7ESannse_2ae9.html" title="User talk:Sannse">(talk)</a> 21:29, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your explanation. My main motivation in sending <a href="../../../j/e/o/User%7EJeolmeun_40df.html" title="User:Jeolmeun">User:Jeolmeun</a> to DRV was to try to get him off RFP, which he seemed to be trying to turn into a forum for the content dispute. Since it was from a AfD I thought that was the right place -- and if you haven't cleared it up I suppose that's becuase it's an inherently murky situation.</p>
<p>You're spot on as far as the problem goes, and I would of course not automatically revert a substantially different article. I reserve doubts about how useful such a standalone article might be though. I'm not entirely sure a detailed historical and theological analysis of it would be worthwhile -- perhaps as part of an article like Papal titles or Titles of the Pope or something like that should someone (not me!) feel moved to write it, but not by itself. I don't know what else might fit there -- possibly a dab page pointing to both <a href="../../../g/o/d/God_the_Father_5aa3.html" title="God the Father">God the Father</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope.html" title="Pope">Pope</a>, but ISTM that anything other than the briefest of notes on the Protestant problem with the phrase as a papal title will devolve into one of those "interesting" POV essays that seem to plague religious articles.</p>
<p>I just looked at it for the first time today and the last revert from last night, by someone other than myself, seems to have stuck. So that's good. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 04:48, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm sorry, I didn't realise you were involved with this situation with the SuperOffice article. Had I known, I would have left my message on your talk page too. As for the unblocking of Tony Sidaway, your heartfelt concerns about allowing time for discussion are not warranted: Tony has agreed not to undelete the article, as it's now before Deletion Review. Since Tony is the person who noticed the irrationality of this deletion, it is only logical that he be one of the parties to participate in these discussions you desire. Thank you for pointing this out to me.

<p>I prefer to consider myself part of the "great unwashed masses", thank you very much. PS, have you considered standing for admin? I'd nominate you if you were interested, (it would be my first nom) or support you in a minute if you were nominated by someone else. I think you've been asked before but I think maybe now might be a better time. Despite you being deletionist scum... er I mean "well intentioned but misguided". (feel free to answer here, I watch talk pages after talking there, for a while) ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 17:30, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What I like about my version is that we get to eat the <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators_37b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Administrators">Eloi</a>. And, aside from me demuring, you really <i>really</i> don't want to be the person who nominates me. Once of the biggest problems with the current culture is a combination of "guilt by association" and "trial by aspersion".
<ul>
<li>The first is pretty clear: If you are publicly associated with one person, either by explicit criticism <i>or</i> by implied support of their actions, it often happens that "allies" or "opponents" appear. This is also known as the "pile-on".</li>
<li>This leads handily to the second: People tend to believe what they read. If I say "Lar has done this! It's an outrage!!!" the most people won't take the time to check, they'll just believe it. Then later if someone says, "Actually, that Lar isn't bad", they'll still hold on to the first (negative) impression.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So, although a fair amoung of time has passed, based upon being recently told on IRC that I can expect people who consider themselves "opposed" to me to be "in my face", I'd imagine that any RfA I have will involve no small amount of blood-letting. I could wax philisophical about how we should leave high school behind and concentrate on the encyclopedia, but I'll save that for another day. Thanks for the compliment, though!</dd>

<dd>That all makes sense but one thing I should point out is that I have no personal desire to be an admin myself (and I don't see that as likely to change... I've been too involved in meta-stuff here and I need to cut back and <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html#SuperSTUBS_I_am_working_on_that_might_be_articles_some_day" title="User:Lar">write</a> more articles (it's a bad habit of mine, Karmafist and I discussed it a bit on my <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html#Metapedians" title="User talk:Lar">talk page</a>, meta-stuff is addicting)... I've been an admin elsewhere (<a href="../../../l/u/g/LUGNET_b6d1.html" title="LUGNET">LUGNET</a>), and I think I am now thorougly cured of the desire. There were 5 of us there, there are 800 here, so it's not like there is a pressing need). So the enemies I'd make wouldn't matter as much to me as they would to someone that had admin aspirations themselves. They still might be out to get me for other stuff but I have yet to be in a POV war or anything (Bridges and engineers just aren't that controversial!) so it may not matter as much. Plus I'd like to think I'm starting to build a reputation however small as a thoughtful and fairly polite contributor. So... if at some point you change your mind and you are looking for a nominator that doesn't care as much about that poisonous fallout effect (which I agree is real), keep me in mind, that's all I'm saying. I have less to lose than many and I would be happy to do it. That's not pressure, mind you. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 07:07, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>When I first saw you I would never have believed that to be the case, but boy was I wrong, which just shows how dangerous forming first impressions too quickly can be. It's a philosophy that I aspire to as well. As an aside, for me the D/I labels are more funny than serious. Kind of like <a href="http://brickwiki.org/index.php/space" class="extiw" title="brickwiki:space">LEGO space</a> vs. <a href="http://brickwiki.org/index.php/trains" class="extiw" title="brickwiki:trains">LEGO trains</a> which are a source of lots of ribbing... but I know others take D/I quite seriously. Which is the problem with labels in general, when used as shortcuts they lead to bad assumptions and bad actions. That said I do tend to think of myself as more inclusionist (despite my voting record on AfD being probably 80% delete... a LOT of cruft comes up there... Speaking of which, it's been 30 days since a particularly non useful list came up, time to relist it unless someone else beat me to it already...

<p>Hi Aaron, no that's fine by me, so long as others do the same. The most important two sentences for me are: "Editors who <b>repeatedly</b> add images or text that have been plagiarized, or the use of which would clearly amount to a copyright violation, may be blocked. In cases where an editor is acting in good-faith and the copyright status is unclear, the editor should not be blocked," or words to that effect. My only concern here is to prevent heavy-handed editors or admins arriving on a person's talk page with a concern about an image, and practically the first thing they say is to threaten a block. As a result, the recipient digs his/her heels in, starts reverting, and ends up being blocked. I saw it happen recently and it resulted in the editor leaving. I want to make sure it doesn't happen again, and I think the overwhelming majority of Wikipedians would be behind that. Of course, as you said, stating this in the policy won't in itself stop people from being heavy-handed, but at least there will be no basis in policy for what they're doing. Beyond that issue, I have no quarrel with any of the copyright policies, and I'm happy to thrash it out on talk.

<dd>LOL!! Sorry.&#160;;-) I agree about the poisonous atmosphere. As I said, all I want to do with this section is stick in just a tiny bit of protection for ordinary editors who stumble into a copyright dispute unaware of what they should be doing, so that they don't end up being blocked on a whim. I'm happy with any version that retains just a bit of protection.

<p>Sigh, I know, but I wish there was a way I could just jump through the computer screen and smack anyone who uses "Because Jimbo said so" to justify something because Jimbo will be the first one to tell you that he's as human as any of us.</p>
<p>I've told Lulu that now isn't a particularly good time to run for rfa due to the admin-phobia after Kelly Martin's RFC and now with Radiant's Poll, but he's doing remarkably well after his nadir last year(if this vote was being held in August, he'd have 20% or so), and within a few months, he'll have enough to pass if he doesn't this time(right now he's on the cusp).</p>
<p>Personally, i'm trying to stay away from the Cabal as much as possible(haven't been on IRC in 10 days or so now), I've gotten some new meds, I still have panic attacks when I have serious conflicts in "reality", but they're less common than they were at the end of December.</p>
<p>For that matter, since the beginning of the year alot has changed that's been able to make it easier to see Wikipedia as just a website rather than the end all/be all of everything. I quit the crooked Real Estate Agency I was working at and joined a seemingly less Real Estate Agency, got two part time jobs, cut way down on the political activism (tonight was the big night against <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walmart.html" title="Walmart">Walmart</a> with <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizens_Action_For_Southern_New_Hampshire_dfa3.html" title="Citizens Action For Southern New Hampshire">these guys</a>, but it takes small steps to fix yourself sometimes, and not spreading myself too thin with things I couldn't affect like that was a place to start.) Give me a few months and maybe i'll be able to assist you and David Gerard and a few others finally mend some of the things that are broken around here, but now just isn't a good time.</p>
<p>Oh, btw, I know you might not know me very well, but from what you do know of me, what would be a good career for me IYO? Real Estate is seeming iffy, i'm a few credits short of a BA in Geography but i'm not sure about that, maybe going back into the media might work but I have no clue, the only thing I really want to be is in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Hampshire_General_Court_e1fd.html" title="New Hampshire General Court">New Hampshire General Court</a>, but that'll cause me more foot shooting than 10 Kelly Martin RFCs in my current state, and it only pays $100 a year even if I can make it there(got slightly under 5,000 votes last time). I suppose it isn't that big of a deal for a 24 year old not to know where he's going in life, but it still sucks.<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist"><font color="#4682B4"><i><b>Karm</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/WP%7EESP_03e8.html" title="WP:ESP"><font color="#00FF00"><i><b>a</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarmafist_6c43.html" title="User talk:Karmafist"><font color="#E32636"><i><b>fist</b></i></font></a> 04:14, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, the key in what you said is "I". Talking to him is fruitless, I haven't done so in awhile, nor did I plan to again.

Gah -- I just got out of a crummy situation off wiki in "reality" that could have been prevented if I just was more "on the ball" and didn't make emotional attachments, similiar to what I brought in with him in the first place.

<p>Aaron, please can you explain how it can be unfriendly. I support Greg's efforts to get people to remove fair use images from the user pages, which is why I put a free use image to match his own (presumably tongue in cheek) statement. Arniep 02:44, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the note. It's no big deal. I fully expected Aetherometry to go to DRV. Also as I stated in the discussion for Torc, P.A.C. Bloos, I don't mind if that and the other druid articles are deleted for lacking verification. I was just following the "when in doubt, don't delete" rule. I do seem to get a lot of AfD closures ending up in DRV, though. I think it's because I don't mind closing the tough ones so there's always bound to be people who disagree. <span style="font-family:Verdana;"><b><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color: #33C;">howch</span></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><span style="color:#0F0"><i>e</i></span></a><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowcheng_1863.html" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color:#33C">ng</span></a></b> <small>{<a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHowcheng_f4d4.html" title="User talk:Howcheng">chat</a>}</small></span> 17:05, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

Yes, I do have some worries in that regard, and I'm concerned about how self-defining the "being right" part seems to be.

<p>No, let me know. But in that particular discussion, people either need to realise they are wasting their time or actually say they are going to go with the discussion. I'll bet money it's the former. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 00:25, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yeah, but you've probably got the impression I get a perverse joy delving into issues like this. Oddly enough, I was doing newpages patrol when right before this bit started; it was bringing a new article to AFD that caused me to notice Tony's nomination. But newpages is a trainwreck. A depressing endeavor that's enough to drive a person to drink (and you don't have to drive me far). When people were getting on Mushroom's case for speedying a few utterly worthless articles (they're all back at AFD now, about to be deleted <i>again</i>, what a waste of time) I don't think any had any idea of the sheer amount of crap that's shoveled into wikipedia by the minute. By the time you've nominated something for AFD there are 2 more such articles, and by the time you've cleaned up one article there are 5.</p>
<p>But I digress. But hey, you're not an admin, are you? I recall you were nominated a while back but some rather foolish behavior got you voted down. Do you think enough time has elapsed that you'd want to try again? I've never nominated anyone, but I don't see any reason to rule out ever doing so. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 06:33, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
