<p>Despite claims otherwise, I'm not <i>locked</i> into process. The current RfC system is not that good, and in a highly polarised area like this doesn't lend itself to discussion at all.

<dd>On a personal note, I'm trying very hard to take a break, but keep getting sucked in because I think that real damage is being done to Wikipedia. However, I'm <i>hoping</i> that I won't be around to shepherd this. I've spammed a few people I respect asking them to contribute to this, but I'd also hope for some blow-ins, and would ask that everyone do five things:
<ol>
<li>Comment on the contributions, not the contributor.
<dl>
<dd>I've been guilty of personalising many times in the heat of the moment, and it never helps. Ever.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Focus on solutions
<dl>
<dd>Venting and rehashing old insults is a waste of time. This is supposed to be about <i>stopping</i> wasting time, and <i>decreasing</i> the level of tension.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Forget policy formation
<dl>
<dd>For the most part, this is about finding social solutions. Let's be pragmatic: There is not going to be any enforcement from above. Period. Deal with it. This doesn't exclude <i>informal</i> enforcement arrangements, of course...</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Police each other
<dl>
<dd>Don't be shy. If someone starts to go off track, tell them. If they won't stop, remove their comments. Be <i>brutal</i> about being nice and moving forward.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Take your time
<dl>
<dd>We're all eventualists, I think. We all plan on being here next week, next month, and next year. Far far better to take a fortnight <i>or more</i> to work on this than to go off half cocked.</dd>
</dl>

<p><b>Cutting the gordian knot</b> I think the problem here is not so much lack of communication--I seem to do about 25 to 30 user talk page edits per day--as a prolonged period of pushing the envelope with administrator actions. Whilst my actions frequently get results (<a href="../../../t/a/l/Tally_Solutions_Ltd_c0a5.html" title="Tally Solutions Ltd">Tally Solutions Ltd</a> 12k, 2d, <a href="../../../s/u/p/SuperOffice_7791.html" title="SuperOffice">SuperOffice</a> 15k, 4d), they often do so in a way that some people find alarming, even distressing. And even if I ignored that effect, others would not. While the arbitration committee may seem to be happy with what I do, they wouldn't remain happy for long if in trying to do the right thing, I alienated other editors, which is definitely not the right thing.</p>
<p>So here's what I'll do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lay off DRV for a bit. I'm satisfied that there's site-wide consensus for edtiors being able to see and edit stuff that's under review, but that will come further down the road. The prospect of people actually editing articles being discussed, while commonplace for AfD, is very alarming for DRV regulars and they need time to get used to it.</li>
<li>Stop deleting templates</li>
<li>Stop undeleting deleted articles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we'll review that in a month's time to see how everybody feels. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 07:46, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That's great, but I don't even care if you do contribute to DRV a lot. I'd rather you do if you're good at it. What I don't want to see is you repeatedly undoing other admin's actions and acting like policy only applies to everyone else and not you. Repeatedly undoing admin actions is abuse of priviledges and I feel it is also clearly disruption. It causes so much more angst and dissent that I think you should have long ago come to the same conclusion. Anyway, thanks for being reasonable. We're all here to build something important, so lets just eliminate behaviors that hold that back. - <a href="../../../t/a/x/User%7ETaxman_8430.html" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../t/a/x/User_talk%7ETaxman_82e8.html" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a></small></sup> 14:41, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I want to make it plain that I do not consider my actions to have been abusive in any way. But there's more to this than just doing the right thing. I'll pick out two that spring to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting a bad example: someone with less discrimination might try to imitate me.</li>
<li>Breeding bad faith: short-circuiting sterile discussion in search of a wider consensus is fine, but if I'm continually doing it then there are inevitably some who feel disenfranchised and blame me.</li>
</ul>

<li>On the other hand, we have, say <i>Rimini Street</i>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rimini_Street_8752.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rimini Street">(8d, 3k)</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Rimini_Street_%282nd_nomination%29_9a47.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rimini Street (2nd nomination)">(11d, 4k)</a> in its second incarnation.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>That is simply incorrect. My resurrections nearly always succeed. Rimini Street was a <i>recreation</i>, all new material. And I'd say that this was a very rare exception; just about the same day I resurrected Seth Ravin, which had been deleted and failed DRV, and recast it about his company, FutureNow. Essentially the same article but now undeletable. And there's s: <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homa_Sayar_4fc8.html" title="Homa Sayar">Homa Sayar</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_M._Wolters_cf41.html" title="Albert M. Wolters">Albert M.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And I think you're barking up the wrong tree if you're trying to say I have not discussed the problems with AfD and DRV. If you have not read my edits and posts,this is not my fault. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 20:17, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think it's the "do first, explain later (maybe)" bit that causes the problem. Having articles visible during DRV, for example, is fundamentally a sound idea, but not all of us have the benefit of being in the "charmed circle" so we <i>need</i> to have guidelines, policies, procedures, agreement, or at least some kind of idea what the fuck is supposed to be going on. It seems to me that you understand very clearly why your actions are alarming to some: not all admins have the tenure you do, and not all are half as inclusionist as you. And undoing other admins' actions is also downright confusing, if nothing else. You're welcome to revert anything I've ever done anywhere on WP just so long as you tell me why and give me a chance to either challenge or learn from it. I'm quite happy that the default status for articles is undeleted and unprotected, and the default status for accounts is unblocked. Anyone who <i>doesn't</i> like that is probably on the wrong project. We all know we can ignore all rules, but not <i>all</i> the time... - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 17:25, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Well I wasn't actually breaking any rules when I did this (though this seems to have come as a bit of a surprise to some people and perhaps I could have, with a bit of forethought, predicted a lack of knowledge of Wikipedia policy and practise on the part of some other administrators). I placed a notice about my decision on <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> but this was removed, so I then attached the notice to a comment I had made in a DRV discussion. Subsequent discussion there and on wikien-l seem to suggest that the decision to make articles visible to all is very popular indeed. A very small number of administrators disagreed. Although the impression seems to have been formed that I was engaging in some mad orgy of undeletion warring, this isn't the case; indeed many of the undeletions were straightforward history undeletes of the kind that any administrator can do and for which no administrator should need to request permission. Just because parties to a complaint <i>believe</i> that a person has acted abusively, doesn't mean that he has.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Another point that I'd like to make is that it was *I* who attempted to discuss deletions with those performing them. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zoe&amp;diff=37048420&amp;oldid=37048353" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zoe&amp;diff=37048420&amp;oldid=37048353" rel="nofollow">Here</a> for instance I contacted <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a> on her talk page politely asking her why she had deleted an article that I had temporarily undeleted. There was, alas, no response. Zoe also deleted <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colony5.html" title="Colony5">Colony5</a>. Gazeebow Unit was deleted by several administrators at various times, mostly by people who were well aware of the discussion on <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EDeletion_review_3b38.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Deletion review">Wikipedia talk:Deletion review</a> and presumably elsewhere. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 17:44, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You;ve got your facts wrong.

Even Aaron at first simply made the objection that it was "redundant with Category:User undeletion" so he was obviously aware that administrators can, and sometimes do, undertake temporary undeletions.</p>
<p>I take strong exception to Rossami's accusation of bad faith. I placed the notice in a prominent position at the top of the page, in a normal edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review&amp;diff=36947512&amp;oldid=36944492" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review&amp;diff=36947512&amp;oldid=36944492" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. His accusation was uncalled-for and wholly false.</p>
<p>You also falsely state that I was not engaging in discussion. By the time of the Rossami edit you discuss, Aaron and I had been engaged in discussion for a while and the discussion on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikien-l.html" title="Wikien-l">wikien-l</a> was well under way, with very positive comments on this move. (Morven was particularly impressed.) Truth to tell, I was engaging in rather <i>more</i> discussion of this move than anybody else at that time. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 22:06, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As has been pointed out before, not everyone subscribes to wikien-l. I was under the impression that stuff like this was intended to be discussed within Wikipedia, not in an external mailing list (or for that matter on IRC).

<dd>Since <i>when</i> are people on a mailing list less representative of wikipedians than those <i>on</i> the wiki? That is absurd. Also, you use the term <i>de facto</i>, correctly, above, to describe your assumption and subsequent action. We have all given <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">neto</a> a lot of flak lately about his lack of consensus. The term <i>de facto</i> implies lack of consensus. Which is, in fact, what we are discussing. Your unilateral actions. Perhaps if you could realize when you were making a de facto assumption that action based upon it should be floated before the community <i>first</i>, rather than <i>after the fact</i>.</dd>
<dd>That being said, I mostly agree that your proposed solution, above, is agreeable.

<p>I'm having difficulty parsing most of the sentences in the above, but I'll try to interpret and respond.</p>
<p>You say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since <i>when</i> are people on a mailing list less representative of wikipedians than those <i>on</i> the wiki?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not my argument.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have all given <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">neto</a> a lot of flak lately about his lack of consensus.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't understand this sentence. Also, why did you conceal a reference to the name of <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetoholic_fd0c.html" title="User:Netoholic">User:Netoholic</a> with the characters "neto"?</p>
<ul>
<li>The term <i>de facto</i> implies lack of consensus</li>
</ul>
<p>This is very baffling. Could you explain yourself more clearly?</p>
<ul>
<li>Your unilateral actions</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, all actions taken on a wiki are unilateral. For instance, your own edit above was unilateral. Could you explain what it is about some other person's unilateral actions that you wish to single out?</p>
<p>I hope I've not given the impression of being intentionally dismissive here--I really don't want to dismiss anything you say, <i>as long as I am capable of understanding it</i>.

<dd>Looking at the diffs, I understand why people feel there is a lack of comunication. A statement like "I'll replace it" does nothing to outline one's own viewpoint why and how WP:DRV ought to be reformed. It also isn't respectful to others who may have other ideas about the shape of deletion review. And looking at the diffs again, the statement that you were involved in discussion with Aaron before Rossami's statement is just untrue. A posturing match with veiled threats thrown in ("By the way, you've managed to misquote arbcom's admonition against you for editing a policy page. Do you still need a lesson in the difference?") isn't a discussion; in a discussion one would address the opponent's concerns. I'd also extend good faith to Rossami here, he may feel that arguments for either side are needed and none were provided yet. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 17:35, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks, Avriette. I do think that wikien-l is more representative of wikipedia users as a whole--there are more of us, for a start. But even if it were not, I don't see why there should be a problem with my discussing something on as many relevant forums as possible. At the very least, my announcements on wikien-l may draw people to the DRV discussion who would not normally have seen it. An announcement on Village Pump might also be a good idea. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 00:55, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>On the idea that <i>de facto</i> has any connotations related to consensus, I don't think that's productive.

<dd>Yes, I have now resumed temporary undeletion, but only (for now) in cases where the articles clearly have a huge amount of support for undeletion. This will give other editors who may be used to a more conservative approach time and opportunity to get used to the idea that non-administrators can see the content of articles being discussed on DRV. I think we've passed the point where such temporary undeletion is viewed as especially controversial. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 00:58, 6 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just so we're clear: having the content of an article available for review is nothing new, and is done almost as a matter of course: stubs have their contents copied into the discussion, longer articles are moved into subpages in user space. What's <i>new</i> is the idea that when anyone requests it, the article springs back to life fully fledged. Please direct further discussion of this matter to <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EDeletion_review_3b38.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Deletion review">Wikipedia talk:Deletion review</a> as repeated and split discussiona are considered harmful. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 01:20, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well I'm not talking about copying the contents of stubs, I'm talking about the full history of articles being undeleted in full, for the purpose of and duration of discussion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sympathetic to the idea of putting undeleted articles into some other place than article space--I wouldn't object to having a particular hierarchy for that (say Wikipedia:Deletion review/Pending/ARTICLENAME).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the idea of normal editors being able to see and work on the article during an undeletion discussion is pretty new. I'll try to take this slowly.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't agree that there is a problem with "repeated and split discussions." If there is disagreement between the conclusions in different Wikipedia-related forums, then this in itself gives us useful information about whether there is consensus on a matter (in particular, that there is no consensus). We should always seek to broaden debate on important subjects and this may sometimes require stimulating discussion by announcements in Village Pump, wikien-l, and the like. I do agree that discussion should eventually coalesce, but this will probably happen of its own accord. No reason to suppress discussion. . --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> 02:01, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Shortly after this RfC there was an arbitration case involving me, partly as a result of concerns about my template deletions.
