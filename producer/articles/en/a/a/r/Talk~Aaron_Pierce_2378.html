<p>I think we should split up the way Days 2, 3, and 4 are combined and squeeze in his role in 24 the game. This is defininely pertinent to the character. But alas, I have not played the game. Anyone who has, feel free to do so.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>I have a feeling that his role was minimal in the game, and that he was after all, put in there because he is such a fan favorite. However, it would be nice to see Days 2,3, &amp; 4 split.</i></li>

<p>The bio just ends with Mike's dropoff. I don't feel like writing anything, so can someone please finish off his role at the end of day 5? Helping Jack break into the locker room, etc? --<a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeege515_d2c9.html" title="User:Deege515">Deege515</a></p>
<p>Aaron Pierce: Hero. Secret Service Agent dedicated his his job. Protected presidential candidated David Palmer during his campaign for president. Protected him, and was a confidant of his during his term of office. Served as an agent under President Keeler, and acting President Charles Logan. Served under President Charles Logan. Found out that President Charles Logan betrayed the IDEALS of the country and was, in his opinion, guilty of high crimes under the US Constitution. Was offered a deal - his life in exchange for silence and a job outside Presidential protection. Refused. Targeted for assasination as a result. Saved by First Lady Martha Logan; later assisted her, Presidential aide Mike Novack, and rouge / disavowed agent Jack Bauer in bring Charles Logan to justice. The ultimate irony is that Jack Bauer paid for his role in taking down Logan and his role in day 5 events with his freedom.</p>

<p>I just reverted the edit:</p>
<p>Pierce is one of only four characters, along with <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Bauer_3872.html" title="Jack Bauer">Jack Bauer</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kim_Bauer_91c4.html" title="Kim Bauer">Kim Bauer</a>, and <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Novick_ea74.html" title="Mike Novick">Mike Novick</a>, who are still active since Day 1 and have not been killed off or written out.</p>
<p>Because it was getting a bit out of hand. Although I haven't watched the whole series, edit wars aren't the way to solve this problem. This seems to be between two people so you two should discuss it here. <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrIdiot_cdb1.html" title="User:DrIdiot">DrIdiot</a> 14:58, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I researched it a bit more (basically looked at <a href="../../../2/4/_/24_%28season_1%29.html#Main_cast" title="24 (season 1)">24_(season_1)#Main_cast</a> and I think I have to agree with leaving it out. If you're using "being present in all 5 seasons" as criteria, you'd have to leave out Mike Novick and Kim Bauer. On the other hand, if you don't use it as criteria, you'd have to include a lot more people, such as Mandy, Kieth Palmer (just checking random ones here). <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrIdiot_cdb1.html" title="User:DrIdiot">DrIdiot</a> 15:02, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I wasn't intending on reverting the second version because it was more accurate. You're right about Mandy, but not about Keith Palmer, who hasn't been seen since season 2... all in all this is a subjective sentence which I feel should be let out but only removed myself when it was factually incorrect. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimpire_7f25.html" title="User:Kimpire">Kimpire</a> 21:14, 25 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Well, Mandy's status is unkown as far as I'm aware, and even so, the fact could easily be "one of five." If the fact that he's among few to appear in all seasons deserves inclusion, why doesn't this, properly worded, also deserve it? <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETromboneguy0186_2295.html" title="User:Tromboneguy0186">Tromboneguy0186</a> 00:21, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The fact could equally easily be "one of thousands". How many people have had speaking parts and appeared in one, two, three, or four seasons? Choosing who appears in a list like that and who doesn't is an entirely subjective measure. Declaring that one needs to be in all five seasons deserves inclusion because it can be measured. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimpire_7f25.html" title="User:Kimpire">Kimpire</a> 22:02, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The article mentions for 24: The Game that Pierce appears protecting the then Acting President Prescott. But, in the game, Prescott is back as the Vice President, and Palmer is President. Did I miss something here, or should that be changed to VP? <a href="../../../a/n/a/User%7EAnakinjmt_7c04.html" title="User:Anakinjmt">Anakinjmt</a> 04:14, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>It says civilian. He's a Secret Service agent, I think that upgrades him to...not civilian. Unless he quit which I'm pretty sure he didn't. - <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackWidower_1b56.html" title="User:BlackWidower">BlackWidower</a> 03:52, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Fox refers to Aaron as Martha's "boyfriend." I didn't see wedding rings, either, so that information in his profile should be changed to something else. Any ideas? --Vikitty 01:13, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I did not see any indication that Aaron retired, but only that he was not on the job at the time, he could simply have had the day off or not working that shift. Either way I believe that comment on his employment status should be omitted until we obtain further information. - <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackWidower_1b56.html" title="User:BlackWidower">BlackWidower</a> 06:15, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For what it's worth, the official Fox <a href="http://fox.com/24/character/ml.htm" class="external text" title="http://fox.com/24/character/ml.htm" rel="nofollow">character guide</a> mentions him in the following bit from Martha's page:</dd>

<p>Martha, now residing in a luxury convalescent home, is greeted by her new boyfriend, former Secret Service Agent Aaron Pierce.</p>
