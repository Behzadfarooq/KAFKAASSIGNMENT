<p>I have found this person to put far too much stock in his own views and show blatant disregard to anyone who happens to disagree with him. He doesn't feel the need to explain his actions and doesn't even feel the need to discuss issues to reach conscensus. Sadly, I share your frustration here and will be avoiding this person in the future due to what I personally see as a show of bad faith and lack of common consideration <i>(That is not an attack, its an opinion)</i>. <a href="../../../e/n/i/User%7EEnigmatical_a9c5.html" title="User:Enigmatical">Enigmatical</a> 23:40, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>But is instead a commondation for what a well-worded notice to ANI, combined with a <i>slight</i> suggestion on how to do it better.</p>
<ol>
<li>Always good to see someone who understands that they might in fact be the one who is in the wrong. Kudos. I attempt to maintain this myself, but when the other party doesn't share that sensibility it's easy to respond with "No, <b>I'm</b> right!"</li>
<li>Diffs to the <i>exact</i> edit where whomever said whatever always go over well with the crowd. Especially if it's a prolific editor or a busy page, people often cannot be bothered to hunt htings down. So instead of <i>"At Page foo Bar said 'cheese', 'king', and 'blade'"</i> put <i>"At Page foo Bar said [diff1 'cheese'], [diff1' king'], and [diff1' blade']."</i></li>

<p>Hello AaronS, <b>: - )</b> Um, maybe you are going a bit overboard. You have said your piece. Why not take some time to reflect on the situation for a few days? Most experienced admin understand that we are here to write an encyclopedia not administer perfect justice for indiviuals. We make our decisions based on what is in the best interest of the encyclopedia not the user. This concept is an adjustment for most people.</p>
<p>As members of the community we all are expected to put the interests of the encyclopedia first. Sometimes this means keeping quiet to stop a dispute from escalating. Everyone can not have the last word. Give it some thought, okay? Take care, <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight"><font color="darkblue"><b>FloNight</b></font></a> <a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFloNight_133a.html" title="User talk:FloNight"><font color="green"><sup><i>talk</i></sup></font></a> 17:26, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You probably don't realize this, but that sounds somewhat fascistic--The <strike>State</strike> Encyclopedia before the Individual. Part of a community is keeping it together without causing huge upsets. The best way to help the encyclopedia is to keep a high level of morale among users, which is why policies/guidelines like NPA, ASG and CIVIL exist. The community and the individual are equally important and deserve fair treatment. I do agree though that the situation should just be dropped since I don't see any progress coming out of it for anyone. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force">The Ungovernable Force</a> 21:58, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Given the extensive damage that I believe user RJ has inflicted on wikipedia with his campaign of deception and abuse, I have taken the time to compile a very extensive and (imho) convincing account that RJ and Vision Thing are the same user. I have already placed two inquiries to Vision Thing on this subject, both of which have been ignored. I noticed that when he first arrived you believed vision thing was a sockpuppet. Could you please direct me as to the proper procedure in notifying admins of this new evidence? Thanks! <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlahblahblahblahblahblah_a472.html" title="User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah">Blahblahblahblahblahblah</a> 01:37, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your advice! I'm worried that a checkuser will fail for the same reasons it did when infinityO called for it, namely that the IP address for the two will not be the same. As such I don't want to have some admin quickly run through that and move on without checking out the evidence, so I've posted to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jeffrey_O._Gustafson" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jeffrey_O._Gustafson" rel="nofollow">Jeffrey_O._Gustafson's</a> talk page for more advice. In the meantime I have posted my evidence in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah/sandbox" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Blahblahblahblahblahblah/sandbox" rel="nofollow">sandbox</a>.

<dd>The last time it was removed was after discussion on the <a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_e72f.html" title="Talk:Anarchism">Talk:Anarchism</a> page. You'll see that it was replaced for entirely different reasons. I only removed it the fourth time after discussion showed that there was no reason for it to be there. Is it still a revert, then?

I would not want to subject anybody to the experience of reading <a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_e72f.html" title="Talk:Anarchism">Talk:Anarchism</a>.&#160;;o) Anyways, I repeatedly asked User:Intangible to bring discussion of the tag to the talk page, and he eventually did (although it's hard to dig out). He added the tag, because I removed a controversial claim that he backed up with an unreliable source. The discussion is mostly about the source. <a href="../../../v/o/l/User%7EVoluntarySlave_e88b.html" title="User:VoluntarySlave">User:VoluntarySlave</a> pointed out that the source actually did not say what Intangible thought it said. There was no more discussion, after that. Seeing that things had cooled down, and that there was no real reason for the tag, I removed it, and then made note of my reasoning on the talk page. <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVision_Thing_6e8a.html" title="User:Vision Thing">User:Vision Thing</a> then re-added, although for entirely different reasons. As you can see <a href="../../../a/n/a/Talk%7EAnarchism_e72f.html#POV_tag_2" title="Talk:Anarchism">Talk:Anarchism#POV_tag_2</a>, I respected his decision to do that and opted to engage in discussion with him. I don't have a history of mindless reverting. I think that there's a misunderstanding, here. Further, I have no intention to edit this page for some time.

<dd>I see, I understand a little better now. What you probably didn't realize is that User:Intangible was blocked for his <i>own</i> excessive reverting in continually adding the tag. You may be right that the discussion died down, but that only really happened because Intangible was blocked. From the talk page, I didn't see an agreement from Intangible or the others wanting the tag there that it could be removed, just no further discussion, so I think the block was appropriate. In the future, when dealing with those tags, I would say you need to leave more time before removing them. They look ugly, I know, but it's supposed to be something that can remain on the article page while editing continues. I believe you were acting in good faith, but your actions were still a violation of the 3-revert rule. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 17:36, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
