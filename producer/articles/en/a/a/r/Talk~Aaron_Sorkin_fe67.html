<p>To all the reporters who will have the opportunity to interview or write about Aaron Sorkin this year, I ask kindly that you review what is written about him on the page one tab over and help to fill in the missing facts or correct any misconceptions surrounding his life. Here is a list of some outstanding questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any details on his years at Castle Rock Entertainment.</li>
<li>How many screenplays of his are unproduced? I've come across two, which I list in the Credits section. It would be interesting to hear about those unproduced screenplays and others.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is of benefit to you to answer these questions, because I or others will then use your journalism to improve this article and in turn <a href="../../../a/t/t/Wikipedia%7EAttribution_916a.html" title="Wikipedia:Attribution">attribute the information to your reporting per policy</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>FROM THE DEJONGE NYT article:Rick Cleveland, was livid about not being able to make any remarks at last year's Emmy ceremony at which an episode he wrote with Sorkin (the one about the homeless war veteran) was honored. What made the exclusion all the more galling to Cleveland was that the story was based on his father, a Korean war veteran who spent the last years of his life on the street. Characteristically, Sorkin couldn't leave the matter alone. Immediately after the dispute was reported in The New York Times, he trashed Cleveland online in a <i>West Wing</i> chat room. (He habitually visits such Web sites after a show airs.) In a signed tirade, he insisted that Cleveland's contributions were so minor that he should have counted himself lucky to have won an Emmy at all. But as Cleveland points out, the co-writing credit was not offered by Sorkin but dictated by the Writer's Guild.</p>

<p>As JMD queried, is Sorkin "unique" in writing "nearly every episode"? Only pertinent example I can think of is <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._Michael_Straczynski_0092.html" title="J.

<p>This from a ComedyCentral.com interview</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can you talk about Thomas Schlamme and his contribution as an Executive Producer and Director? Tommy Schlamme's contribution is equal to mine. I don't want it to seem like he contributed 20% or something. It's absolutely equal to mine - on both "Sports Night" and "The West Wing".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a very well known, much awarded and justifiably awarded television director, probably the most well-known television director. ABC wanted him to direct the pilot and I met with him and clearly his instinct was also, "Well this is great, but it needs to be more like a sitcom. These two guys, these two anchors - one of them needs to be the neat guy, the other one needs to be the sloppy guy. One a gay guy, one a straight guy; one the fat guy, one the thin guy. It's got to be like that. And I said, "God, I don't know anything, I'm not in television. You're an incredible success and I'm sure you're right, but I'm not going to do that." And the network got very upset with me, that I had sent him packing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The next day a meeting had been set up with Tommy, who I'd never met but whose work I knew. He'd directed a couple of features, he'd directed plenty of half hour television, but he was also one of the hands responsible for "The Larry Sanders Show" and the look and feel of "Larry Sanders," which I love - which everybody loves. But I was scared the day before by the network, and I didn't want to send Tommy packing, and this other director had really put this bug in my ear, so my first question to Tommy was, "Listen, Tommy, if you were to direct this pilot, it's an unusual half-hour, what touchstones, what comfort zones would you put in this show to make people feel like, hey this is just a regular half-hour, like other half-hours?" He replied, "None - I want to do the one that you wrote."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So not only was he hired right away but I fell in love with him right away. And right after he directed the pilot and the show was picked up, I asked him to stay on as an Executive Producer of the show, not only direct as many of the episodes as he could but also take over many if not most of the non-writing chores on the show. So that partnership was born. Tommy, in addition to really creating the look of both shows, does the heavy lifting as a producer, is the one working with all of the directors who come in when he's not directing, is the person talking to me about the script as soon as I turn it in. He was the one making design decisions, casting decisions, and he's in all the money meetings that I would not be in or would not be capable of contributing in. We've been working together ever since.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Last year was the overlap year, when we were doing "Sports Night" and "The West Wing" at the same time, and that was difficult to say the least. There was no way it would have been attemptable without Tommy, without my knowing that wherever I wasn't, Tommy was going to be there.</p>

<p>I am using the Yahoo contributed biography very carefully. I check facts against other sources when I can. It seems to be "anonymous". When the Yahoo contributed biography tells that John McQuiggan commissioned Sorkin to improve <i>Hidden in this Picture</i> there is evidence that McQuiggan presented <i>Making Movies</i> later when it was produced from a NYT review. That lends a little more credibility to said biography, but it would be much better if there was more info on McQuiggan's commission.-BiancaOfHell 02:42, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>I'm also skeptical about what the Yahoo contributed biography tells about Sorkin's acting work at Syracuse. Some of it sounds like a joke, "a top pyramid acrobat for Carnival"?

<li>he met his wife there</li>
<li>he wrote 3 scripts there: a few good men, malice, the american president</li>
<li>he took 2 or 3 years to write <i>The American President</i> on a bit of a crack binge, and trouble finding his muse</li>
<li>he wrote the scripts for <i>A Few Good Men</i> and <i>Malice</i> together kinda, here and there, and quickly it would seem. Then had a bit of a break until <i>The American President</i> was done. After that he was done with Castle Rock and went on to work as a script doctor.</li>
<li>During these years, he also was asked by Spielberg to help out with <i>Schindler's List</i>... that's the extent of his script doctoring while at Castle Rock.. the bulk of it took place after.</li>
<li>His end with Castle Rock coincides with his trip to Hazelden for rehab.</li>
<li>his wife was an entertainment lawyer, or some such lawyer-type at Castle Rock.</li>
<li>According to William Richert he would read everything available to read at Castle Rock. So he spent time there. Where was the building?</li>
<li>This was his start in the film industry. He was making a transition from playwright to screenwriter.</li>
<li>William Goldman was his mentor there, sorta, on <i>Malice</i> for example. Was Goldman working there as a consultant, to what extent?</li>
<li>Rob Reiner... their relationship. Reiner appears in an episode of Studio 60. Reiner directed <i>A Few Good Men</i> and <i>The American President</i>.</li>

<dd>He's pretty famous for the drug addiction problems. SNL did a skit about it a few years back, and it's been a problem for him for many decades. He battled with it because he relapsed, and he's mentioned many times the relief he gets from specifically freebase cocaine. But in the peer review it was suggested not leaving it out.-BiancaOfHell 19:54, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I would suggest citing TWP as the source for pedeconference, and making that clear in the text rather than just in the footnote. Also, Aaron Sorkin's own interactions with TWP forums might be worth a mention - apparently there is some press coverage of this.

<p>Here's the money Sorkin quote from the New York Times Magazine article on Television Without Pity:</p>
<p>Magazine Desk; Section 6 The Remote Controllers By Marshall Sella 4834 words 20 October 2002 The New York Times Page 68, Column 1 English c. 2002 New York Times Company</p>
<p><i>EXCERPT begins</i> Any notion that the Hollywood telegentsia hovers above the fan-site fray was shattered two years ago when Aaron Sorkin, creator of <i>The West Wing,</i> bitterly responded to an online complaint; he posted under his own name on Television Without Pity (or, as it was then called, Mighty Big TV). A year later, Sorkin wrote a <i>West Wing</i> episode that savaged TWoP and its ilk, portraying hard-core Internet users as obese shut-ins who lounge around in muumuus and chain-smoke Parliaments. It was his best and loudest available form of revenge against a phenomenon that has not always treated him fondly. <i>EXCERPT ends</i></p>

<dd>I don't see how Sorkin's cameo appearance has the most legitimacy in this article. Does that mean any photo he appears in is legitimate? How about the screen shot of himself talking about his writing that is used at the very top then?-BiancaOfHell 14:16, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
<dd>The distinction is that the use of the Sorkin screenshot is completely "insubstantial" (17&#160;U.S.C.&#160;107(3)) in relation to the episode of <i>The West Wing</i> from which it was taken: if there was no caption, you would never guess that it was taken from <i>The West Wing</i>. This doesn't in itself guarantee that the use is fair, but it is one of the factors a court would have to consider in an infringement case. The other images are either complete posters or a screenshot from an interview devoted to Sorkin, where we would be on much shkier ground with respect to the substantiality criterion. <a href="../../../p/h/y/User%7EPhyschim62_966c.html" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> <a href="../../../p/h/y/User_talk%7EPhyschim62_05f3.html" title="User talk:Physchim62">(talk)</a> 14:52, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry to open a can of worms. I think that clamping down on copyrighted images, especially those claimed under fair-use will get alot more attention Wikipedia wide in the near future. There are estimated 200,000 photographs that fit that category, so pointing to another article where it happens will likely result in those being removed too, rather than them being allowed in violation of copyright here. My view is beyond the unsubstantial distinction made earlier, and is that a copyrighted image may only be used for critical commentary. Not criticial commentary of anything, only of the artist (photographer) or artwork itself. A screenshot is a copy made of the copyrighted TV work itself. The photographer took this without permission, and unless that image is used in a review or commentary (or parody) of the specific copyrighted work itself, it does not meet fair-use. Sorkin obviously had a role in some fashion with what all of the photo's represent, but that isn't sufficient unfortunately. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 16:42, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alright, but then let's take this issue seriously. Someone knowledgeable should start a WikiProject, Portal, or whatnot, that will help out Wikipedians in dealing with this issue. I'm going to see what I can do to get in contact with Aaron Sorkin to obtain a free use image. But what can Wikipedia do to help others in this situation? There are possibly over 10,000 photos that could be removed if a strict policy was enforced. It's time to start looking at ways to obtain these free use images, instead of just plumping down a new policy that will aggravate a tense situation.-BiancaOfHell 17:35, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually there is not much new on this. Decission was taken that present policies will be enforced more strictly. It will take time before all such images will be removed (there are probably many more invalid fair use images here than you estimated) and it will take even longer time before more people will start to license their content into public domain. There is no simple answer to that but the point is that many copyrighted works are on WP for the sole purpose to make articles look better.--<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPethr_1b0f.html" title="User:Pethr">Pethr</a> 18:00, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Based on the current wording of <a href="../../../f/u/_/WP%7EFU_03b9.html" title="WP:FU">WP:FU</a> Screenshots are specifically allowed as long as they meet FU criteria: "Film and television screen shots: For critical commentary and discussion of the cinema and television." I don't believe the new statement from the Board changes anything, it still allows fair use for critical commentary on "modern art" which a TV show arguably is. In no way are screenshots forbidden, they just must be used in the context of critical commentary. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 18:42, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Milo, could you justify any of the photos that are used in this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aaron_Sorkin&amp;oldid=106574169" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aaron_Sorkin&amp;oldid=106574169" rel="nofollow">this version</a> of the article, to help me out?-BiancaOfHell 18:45, 9 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Copyright law, and wikipedia policy are more narrow than you suggest. The screenshots can be used for critical commentary of the specific case, and not the general case. Used in general discussion of TV, or film is not within fair use. Used for discussion of the actors, or of the writers or directors in not fair use. Critical commentary of the specific epidsode, or the show itself could qualify. Fair use for critical commentary on "modern art" is *not* acceptable fair use. <a href="../../../a/t/o/User%7EAtomaton_fe94.html" title="User:Atomaton">Atom</a> 04:35, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I'd agree that's an overly narrow interpretation unsupported by wp policy (or even copyright law/cases, you aren't a laywer, are you?). What I "suggest" was a direct quote from wp policy (and I made no mention of "general cases", while "Fair use for critical commentary on modern art" comes directly from the latest board message as allowed). I find the suggestion that a still is OK on a film article but not on a director article a bit ridiculous. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 14:22, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seem that Wikipedia is working towards trying to eliminate all non-free images. Use of copyrighted images at all will be limited to very, very few cases. One of the issues is translation of U.S. concept of "fair-use" to other places, such as Italy and Netherlands, to name a few. Regarding your statement that use of, for instance, <a href="../../../s/o/r/Image%7ESorkinwwtomorrow1.jpg_4f9b.html" title="Image:Sorkinwwtomorrow1.jpg">Image:Sorkinwwtomorrow1.jpg</a> is fair use.
<ul>
<li>Consider the label on the image itself, which says: "for identification and critical commentary on the station ID or program and its contents". The image of Sorkin in the Sorkin article is not for critical commentary of the specific program and its contents, is it?</li>
<li><a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">Wikipedia:Fair use</a>Counterexamples (examples of what is <i>not</i> appropriate fair use)
<ul>
<li>"An image of a living person that merely shows what they look like."</li>
<li>"An image of a magazine cover, used only to illustrate the article on the person whose photograph is on the cover. However, if that magazine issue itself is notable enough to be a topic within the article, then fair use may apply."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Here is a link to the Stanford law library page about fair use, comment and criticism<a href="http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter9/9-a.html#1" class="external autonumber" title="http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter9/9-a.html#1" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> Reading this, do you think that the use of the copyrighted image from the West Wing, is being used in this context?</li>

<dd>My understanding is that the photo had an additional "Non-Commercial" use license, and it was removed for that reason. It had nothing to do with the photo, but the license. It was released to the Creative Commons though. Actually, I'm wondering if the Flickr photo had to be released with a "Non-Commercial" license since it was a photo of a commercial theatrical play.-<a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillDeanCarter_644b.html" title="User:BillDeanCarter">BillDeanCarter</a> 21:00, 21 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The difference between cocktail napkins, an 80s stationary Mac and a modern laptop is significant.
