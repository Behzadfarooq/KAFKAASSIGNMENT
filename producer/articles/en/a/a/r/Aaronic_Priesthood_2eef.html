<p>Mormons believe that ancient prophets and apostles conferred the Priesthood directly upon <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr._b262.html" title="Joseph Smith, Jr.">Joseph Smith, Jr.</a> and other early members of the Church. The conferral of the Aaronic Priesthood on Joseph Smith and <a href="../../../o/l/i/Oliver_Cowdery_98e9.html" title="Oliver Cowdery">Oliver Cowdery</a> is recorded in Joseph Smith - History as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"[W]e. . . went into the woods to pray and inquire of the Lord respecting baptism for the remission of sins, that we found mentioned in the translation of the plates [<i>The <a href="../../../b/o/o/Book_of_Mormon_f6c8.html" title="Book of Mormon">Book of Mormon</a></i>],. . . . While we were thus employed, praying and calling upon the Lord, a messenger from heaven descended in a cloud of light, and having laid his hands upon us, he ordained us, saying:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"He said this Aaronic Priesthood had not the power of laying on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, but that this should be conferred on us hereafter; and he commanded us to go and be baptized, and gave us directions that I should baptize Oliver Cowdery, and that afterwards he should baptize me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Accordingly we went and were baptized. . . .</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"The messenger who visited us on this occasion and conferred this Priesthood upon us, said that his name was John, the same that is called John the Baptist in the New Testament, and that he acted under the direction of Peter, James and John, who held the keys of the Priesthood of Melchizedek, which Priesthood, he said, would in due time be conferred on us, and that I should be called the first Elder of the Church, and he (Oliver Cowdery) the second. . . .</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>"Immediately on our coming up out of the water after we had been baptized, we experienced great and glorious blessings from our Heavenly Father. No sooner had I baptized Oliver Cowdery, than the Holy Ghost fell upon him, and he stood up and prophesied many things which should shortly come to pass. And again, so soon as I had been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of prophecy, when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and many other things connected with the Church, and this generation of the children of men. We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and rejoiced in the God of our salvation."</dd>

<p>In <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_1f3f.html" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, the Aaronic Priesthood has taken on a role as a source of training, leadership and service for adolescent boys and new converts. It is often called a "preparatory priesthood." Holders of the priesthood whom the Church considers worthy are advanced to an office in the <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melchizedek_Priesthood_04ef.html" title="Melchizedek Priesthood">Melchizedek Priesthood</a> as a matter of course after the age of about 18, or in the case of adult converts, after about a year of active Church membership.</p>
<p>The Aaronic Priesthood is open only to men and boys, twelve years old or older, who are considered worthy after a personal interview with a local <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_%28Mormonism%29_94a2.html" title="Bishop (Mormonism)">bishop</a>. Requirements for worthiness include abstaining from unmarried sex, following the <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word_of_Wisdom_6e64.html" title="Word of Wisdom">Word of Wisdom</a> (a Mormon health code), and attending church services.</p>
<p>With the exception of Bishop, the offices of the Aaronic Priesthood are organized primarily by age, and an adolescent boy will automatically advance to the next office if found worthy upon reaching the appropriate age. The conferral and ordination to an office in the Aaronic Priesthood is performed by the "laying on of hands" by those holding the Melchizedek priesthood.</p>
<p>Aaronic Priesthood holders of the same office are organized into a <a href="../../../q/u/o/Quorum_%28Mormonism%29_37f6.html" title="Quorum (Mormonism)">quorum</a> (small group), led by a president and counselors within each quorum.</p>

<p>In the book of Exodus, God ordained Aaron and his sons Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar to be priests for the Lord. According to the Law, only descendants of Aaron, or Aaronites, could be priests. It was their duty to make the daily sacrifices, fellowship offerings, grain offerings, et cetera at the Tabernacle or Tent of Meeting for the Hebrews. In effect, the priest's role was to intercede before God on behalf of the nation of Israel. Aaron was appointed the first High Priest, and it was his duty to enter the Most Holy Place of the Tabernacle once each year to make the sin offering for all of Israel. The priesthood was a hereditary office only the Aaronites could fill. The lineage of Aaron was eventually lost, and the Temple was destroyed for the last time in AD 70 by Roman troops under General Titus.</p>
<p>The Aaronic priesthood is considered defunct in Protestant Christianity. It is an office that is no longer required as the rite of animal sacrifice for remission of sins has been replaced by the ultimate sacrifice of Christ on our behalf. Having fulfilled the law, Christ was made our High Priest in the order of <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melchizedek.html" title="Melchizedek">Melchizedek</a>, the priest of God for Abraham, because he was a Judaite and not an Aaronite. Christ has fulfilled the role of the priesthood in that he is our only intercessor before God.</p>
