<p>Dear Administrator: I, like you, am an editor; I create articles and make edits. But, many, I am sure many other people out there, are tired, frustrated and angry with the behavior of many Administrators. I am certain that it is appallingly easy to revert an article, that someone has undoubtedly spent allot of time and effort writing. I have, in the past spent hours, researching, planning, writing, checking and revising an addition to an article only to have the whole lot deleted forever three minutes afterwards.</p>
<p>I know that deletion of material is essential in a free-to-edit encyclopedia, but if you see an article that someone has anonymously devoted their time to writing, why could you not revise it, change it or give a reason for you action? They deserve one.</p>
<p>I know all Administrators are not all Drunk-With- Power-Trigger-Happy-Nazis, many of you do an excellent job and you know who you are. The world owes you. I owe You.</p>
<p>In closing: Create, don’t Destroy. Make a distinction between “what is right, and what is easy”. Be enriched and enrich others with the knowledge of other people.</p>
<p>And keep that finger off the trigger.</p>

<p>Thanks! I do agree it needs more sources, but I am having difficulty finding some, I disagree that sources close to the subject arnt as reliable as one further from it, it's just that they can't be as trusted most of the time, and any other sources information would have to be obtained directly (or worse, indirectly) from the subject (ex: sigmund jorgensen) and then it becomes second hand or third hand information, it isnt as good as first hand information.</p>
<p>I do agree though that if more sources can be found on things to do with Montsalvat other than its history, they would perhaps be better than the source of sigmund jorgensen himself, but for the history, I think you can't beat the son of the guy who founded the colony, unless those who were a part of it back then were still alive and wanted to share their info.</p>
<p>I created the article about "A symphony of mud and stone" because it is a real book that exists and thought I'd supply all the info I could about that source, but if it isnt as many here say noteworthy then I wont complain if it gets deleted. The articles must be neutral but the editors can be brutal, is that the way it goes? if so, very sad.</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing these things to my attention and for taking interest in the article, but mostly for providing some positive feedback! Its all well and good to say object and then say whats wrong with it...yeah? well what needs to be done to make it better?? I get frustrated with some editors on wikipedia somtimes I do.</p>
<p>The photos are okay I have some better ones and if I ever have time I'll update them, and I apologise for the late reply cause our internet connection died a few days ago. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_carson_2b91.html" title="User:Nick carson">Nick carson</a> 06:35, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Ansell:I've reverted your change to Aaron's user pages. People do not HAVE to make easy convenient archives if they do not wish to. This page was blanked by Aaron for his own reasons, well within his aegis to do so if he wants to as long as he's not ignoring warnings or whatever. He's on break, he can blank the page completely if he so desires. I am sure he'll revert me if he does not agree with my reversion. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar"><font color="blue">+</font></a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 02:15, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You're the only admin i've come accross who does not conduct himself like a power stoned <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narcissism.html" title="Narcissism">narcissist</a>. I have a short fuse when it comes to being treated like shit by the community and it seems to me that everyone here has an admin friend who they spend a lot of time sucking up to and who is ready to help them out when necessary, which empowers them. I refuse to do that. I'm not a power hungry narcissist and i'm not a sheep. As such I don't see how I can fit in here. Wikipedia is an organisation with a Bullying culture that it actively turns a blind eye to. I can't justify putting any more time and effort.</p>
<p>If I could make any suggestion it would be that what is needed is a comprehensive anti-bullying policy. But I can't see that ever happening while it's the psychopaths who make the policies.</p>

<p>I notivc eyou ve been trying to remove excess links from lots of pages. Chill out with your shoot first approach to gaming links. Did you even click on any of them to see their relevance? When an article eventually matures to be referenced., those links will be imporetant. ANd most of the links you got rid of are perfectly valid. I would recommend staying out of the CVG space, as we're pretty good at self-regulating these kinds of things. And btw citing <a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_links_6e33.html" title="Wikipedia:External links">Wikipedia:External links</a> in your comment doesnt justify what youre doing, especialyl since youre rmeoving stuff that does not go against policy. --<b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarsinio_de8b.html" title="User:Larsinio"><font color="LimeGreen">larsinio</font></a></b> <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELarsinio_d8b0.html" title="User talk:Larsinio">(<font color="orange">poke</font>)</a><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_larsinio_1d82.html" title="Special:Contributions/larsinio">(<font color="DodgerBlue">prod</font>)</a></sup> 01:22, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree. The game articles are particularly susceptible to linkcruft. Any editor can edit any topic as long as he does so responsibly, and Aaron's edits in this space seem like plain good sense. Could you identify a specific herd-culling he did that was inappropriate? <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 01:27, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am really getting annoyed by brenneman's removal of external links. In the cases I've seen (specifically the LUEshi article), you've defended your actions by spouting nonsense and pointing to the external links policies. It's one thing to delete cruft- it's another thing to remove external links that are 100% relevant to the subject at hand. Use some common sense, kiddo. 172.147.192.250 06:12, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, after having re-reviewed these none of them provide a resource that should be linked according to the guideline. Moby games is almost always instantly deletable as providing no information not widely available elsewhere, and dot eaters would be possibly acceptable if used as a reference (please in the "Cite" style not in-line refs!) but as a bare external link it is not.<br />

<dd>KLOV is exclusively used to fill the infobox items. Most pages in the CVG space have items listed in the external links that were indeed used as references in the article, which is why it is important to NOT remove links. Mobygames is an issue constantly under debate, and I dont really care either way on that front.

<dd>Any external links that are in fact references are always available in the history. There is no need for them to be "stored" in that manner in the artical.

Like gamefaqs links are useful references for many games, as they contain loits of gampleay information, information about items and levels, and what not. Just by linking to it does not violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>.

<p>Hmmm... Well, let me put it this way... I've got the flu, and that article resembles what is streaming from my nose!&#160;:) Seriously, my guess is that it is neologistic "management speak" from disaster-prepared people, apparently some of them Israeli. I'd certainly AfD it, and I swear, on a day like today, I could support an A1 speedy, because it does verge on indescipherable.</p>
<p>I checked my email yesterday, and got yours; but now I see the pink box, and I don't know where to send a reply. Go ahead with your plan to give me the Brenneman overhaul, about which I am quite excited. While you're combing through my contribs., please wander over to James F.'s talk page and see if I did anything to deserve the WP:DICK treatment he gave me. That sort of thing from a person "on high" is what makes a volunteer want to crawl in bed and take his Tylenol.

<p>I am guessing Bitter contacted you recently about KAS. He sent me emails, which I believe were sent to you, for the greeting wasn't my name, but yours. I think both sides of this arguement should be kicked off wiki for a while. What ever arguement they have with each other has nothing to do with this article and both sides have taken this a little too personally. Not even I fought you with personal insults and I did try to keep it limited to the article contents. This fight between KAS and Bitter should be removed from Wiki, as Wiki has nothing to do with this fight and Bitter is trying to drag others into the fray. --<a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbitOne_44d2.html" title="User:OrbitOne"><big><big><font face="Brush Script MT" color="blue">Orbit</font></big></big></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font face="Brush Script MT" color="green">One</font></a> <sup>[<span style="color:red"><a href="../../../o/r/b/User_talk%7EOrbitOne_a840.html" title="User talk:OrbitOne">Talk</a></span>|<span style="color:gold"><a href="../../../o/r/b/User%7EOrbitOne_Translations_7e87.html" title="User:OrbitOne/Translations">Babel</a></span>]</sup> 12:52, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>May I ask why this article was deleted? There are so many less popular internet memes on Wikipedia. A page that was very popular and at the top of the google searches when searched for 'Average Homeboy' is deleted. He is going to appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live. I think that is grounds enough for him to atleast have an article. I worked long hours revising and editing and researching the article, that I created, only to have it deleted. I know you have a lot to deal with, but please reconsider, as it was a popular article. Thank You. tynews2001</p>

<dd>I do indeed hate them with a passion that borders on the monomaniacal. However, I bow to the pressure of the people. Three things: <b>A)</b> Getting any early stops them from going to per-unit subpages. I had to do some quick-stepping to un-do that not long ago. And <b>2)</b> If we don't like it we can change it back and then I'll have more ammo to resist it next time. <i>And</i> <b>Γ)</b> I get some small credit for being flexible and following consensus.</dd>

<p>Thanks for letting me know about Tony's opt-out list. (Actually, I saw it yesterday; sometimes I look at Tony Sidaway's talk page when I'm not finding enough stress around here.) I'll consider it, but I think his "do not refactor" list is kind of a kludge at best. I'm not a proponent of long signatures with 12 color changes and the flags of my city, state, and country, but I think Tony's "refactoring" is his attempt to enforce a policy when there isn't a clear, definitive policy to be enforced. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENathanrdotcom_e182.html" title="User:Nathanrdotcom">nathanrdotcom</a>, as an example, had several people hammering on him about his signature, and that sort of thing represents a community consensus that signatures that long are undesirable. On the other hand, when Tony "refactors" just about any signature that has a font color change, or CSS, or a link, then that smacks to me of enforcing policy. (Interestingly enough, he's never refactored <a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde</a>'s signature, even though the pink color and cursor change are unnecessary to get the point across.)</p>
<p>It doesn't bother me terribly much that my signature could be "refactored", but it <i>does</i> bother me that one user is trying to set policy, based on his personal preferences, without real community consensus. My belief is that policies and guidelines should come from the community, with certain exceptions, like if Jimbo needs to put the foot down on something that could damage Wikipedia. Even at that, he hasn't put the foot down on people as harshly as some admins have. Look at the userbox debate as an example -- Jimbo politely requested that people remove religious and political userboxes. Certain admins took that as an endorsement to move toward a wholesale deletion of userboxes. In the process, a request that could have strengthened the community has instead caused rifts in it.</p>
<p>I think I'm rambling here instead of simply acknowledging your message, but sometimes things like this need to be said. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> 22:29, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'd agree with almost everything in that statement. Especially the bit about you rambling. My feeling on the signature fights is very much like my feeling on the userbox imbroglio: Utter waste of time. But to be more specific:
<ul>
<li>Even the very longest signatures have never presented even the slightest trouble to me as far as "finding" comments or editing. I hear a few other people claim that they do have problems. Considering that thousands of wikipedia discussions occur every day and we rarely hear complaints, I'd guess most people also have no problem editing.</li>
<li>Signatures are for identification, and I use the colours, symbols, etc to identify people. I have found the occasional signature to be "too much" for viewing I admit. But you can tell a lot about a person by their signature, be it clever or eye-gouging.</li>
<li>I've only very rarely seen someone <i>refuse</i> to change when asked nicely. Really nicely, not "do it or you'll be blocked" faux-nicely.</li>
<li>I'd agree that it's poor form to attempt to forge policy based upon a very view (if quite vocal) opinions. I often wonder about <i>why</i> some people are happy to hold pitched battles over ephemera.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Finally, your comment about whom has been refactored and whom has not was an interesting one. I'd love to see a table made with the number of times each editor's signature has been refactored, with notes on number of characters etc. My totally-baseless impression is that it has been far from even-handed, but I'm too lazy to track that down right now. A massive list of diffs in chronological order with every sig refactoring would be a great task for some compulsive wiki-gnome to create.</dd>

<p>I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion that bots generally are more damaging than helpful to the project. They seem to be frequently fired off by a single person with a sense of purpose and they propogate throughout the project faster than consensus can emerge.</p>
<p>Using them while a dispute is actively being discussed is, of course, even worse since the launcher clearly does or should know that consensus for the action has not been reached. Unfortunately, bots have become so easy to use that they will be extremely difficult to stop. I don't know how to put this genie back in the bottle. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 05:19, 22 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I had a couple of quick thoughts.
<ul>
<li>Hope that social pressure will do the trick? Tell the person using AWD or BullBot or whatever, "Please don't do that again" a few times.</li>
<li>Shouldn't we have a "revert everything" button for this sort of thing?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I know that a mass-revert seems like the worst kind of buggery. However, the more I think about it, the more reasonable it seems. If it takes someone no effort to make a MFT of edits, then reverting them with no effort should be the same as one "real" reversion.</dd>

<dd>No disagreement. It can take a block to stop someone who's really going. And that's not really appropriate if they are well-intentioned but merely mistaken. I like the idea of a "mass revert". I could see it being very helpful in vandalism patrols as well. But it could also be easily abused.

<dd>It wouldn't be a normal day for me without dark thoughts. Besides, when the agreement changes from, "If you ask, I won't refactor your signature except on my talk page and <a href="../../../a/n/_/WP%7EAN_865a.html" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a>," to, "If you ask, I won't refactor your signature unless they're causing excessive clutter," to, "Even if you ask, I'll still consider your signature as clutter and refactor it, and don't ask in terms other than my own," I get a little cynical. Moreover, since there isn't a real decision as far as what "clutter" means, where does it end? Clearly, vanity articles about people or their bands meet <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>, and deserve to go -- they're clutter. 730-byte signatures with three images are excessive, as well. <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">Featured articles</a> probably aren't clutter, and can stay. But in the meantime, there's a lot of gray area. For example, someone could say that <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peavey-Haglin_Experimental_Concrete_Grain_Elevator_57f4.html" title="Peavey-Haglin Experimental Concrete Grain Elevator">Peavey-Haglin Experimental Concrete Grain Elevator</a> is just an insignificant tower in <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Louis_Park%2C_Minnesota_6497.html" title="St. Louis Park, Minnesota">St. Louis Park, Minnesota</a> and doesn't deserve an article. Or, <a href="../../../g/l/a/Talk%7EGlacier_National_Park_%28US%29_6653.html" title="Talk:Glacier National Park (US)">Talk:Glacier National Park (US)</a> has too much chit-chat on it about what needs to be done with the article, and not enough productive editing. Or, my large number of edits to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Registered_Historic_Places_in_Minnesota_3a59.html" title="List of Registered Historic Places in Minnesota">List of Registered Historic Places in Minnesota</a> could have been condensed into just a few edits, reducing database space on the server.

<dd>I must admit I am often weilding a scythe, so it would be hypocritical of me to simply *nod* in understanding. I <i>can</i> point out that deleting things doesn't save any space, but that's an aside. More importantly is to have a look at the wider picture (something I often fail to do) and see that Wikipedia is thriving overall. If there are some areas that need improvement than let us make them better. Dispute resolution needs an overhaul, especially at the request for comment end, for example. Or the calmer waters of article space. Lots to do there.

<p>Let's see... I closed a DRV the way some folks didn't like, so the malcontents questioned my competence, and Mackensen (metaphorically, I hope) threatened to kill me at ANI. Kelly added her dash of fun, Kelly-style, Cyde and I had a reasonable discussion, Rossami stood up for my choice, a disamb. got created as a compromise... all in a day's work! And my talk page got moved to "Nigger" around the same time for good effect! Ugh.

<p>Many reasonably seasoned editors have not been through the Deletion review process, and the page does not seem to direct whether we rehash the AfD arguments, try to formulate new ones, whine about procedure, or just bring the whole thing to a new audience without comment.

<li>Prolix (great word). Thanks for the note, your apology is unnecessary, however. You did not offend me; I think of myself as thick-skinned and thick-headed. Something I have learned here is that chaos is its own reward, and that "Wikilawyer" is the worst insult one can heap on someone else and not be cited for civility (or is that <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivil_1ef2.html" title="WP:Civil">WP:Civil</a> disobedience?) Any way, being new to the politics (no offense intended), I decided to be boldly boring and prolix (still a great word), figuring that debate could be closed at any moment and I wanted my say, gosh darn it. And, I am often quoted as saying "bits are cheap", but see <a href="../../../b/i/t/Bit_%28money%29.html" title="Bit (money)">bit (money)</a>; again, I digress into prolixity (what a great word, it takes inflections too). <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 02:58, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't question your review, and just wanted to let you know of the outcome. FYI- I have been an admin for about a year now. Though I don't habituate the RCs or other areas of random users, I figure that I have seen a wide range of behaviors ranging from POV pushers to trollish, vandalistic, sock puppetry, puerile humor, hoaxes, etc. Even so, I've found Primetime's case to profoundly disturbing. Perhaps that's partly because I'd edited with him at length and extended good faith. He has been found to be such a bald-faced liar, such an unapologetic plagiarist, such an effective weedler, such an active vandal, that the collective good faith I feel towards other editors has gone down a notch. We're still correcting the copyvios he planted, and he's still trying to sneak them back into articles. I expect another couple of months activity.

<p>Let's face facts here...at least as far as I am concerned, what brings me the most enjoyment out of this project is creating my little stub articles, some of which I do expand to something more, but with a half hour or a little more, I can write up a stub and turn a red line into a blue one...it's not much, but it's a start. In many cases, like in the National Wildlife Refuges and or Wilderness areas, there simply sin't much material to source from, so the articles are naturally never going to be anything more than a stub until somebody else comes along and makes it better. But, the truth is, my computer skills are modest, so for fellows like yourself, you are able to do more benefit than I can with the Afd's and etc...sometimes, I am simply dense, and in one case it took two users about three tries to make me understand that for one template, they wanted me to do a move of the entire history and not just a cut and paste plus a redirect...duh. That must be frustrating when someone comes to me for "help" on an admin level. Keep up the good work, we all have our niche.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 04:35, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>there is an admin that is using vile curse words in their edit summary and a photo of their privates on their page&#160;: <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreakofnurture_92d3.html" title="User:Freakofnurture">Freakofnurture</a></p>
<p>In reference to: according to what <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a></p>
<p>1. User pages. Wikipedians have their own user pages, but they may be used only to present information relevant to working on the encyclopedia. If you are looking to make a personal webpage or blog, please make use of one of the many free providers on the Internet. The focus of user pages should not be social networking, but rather providing a foundation for effective collaboration.</p>
<p>the freakofnurture is in direct violation of the above.</p>
<p>the response I received from first request:</p>
<p>I know it may appear raw and inappropriate at first sight, but almost everything on that page is a reflection of some component of Wikipedia culture. For example, the phrase "This administrator knows how to spell his fucking words" refers to wikipedia's rogue admins. Someone accidently spelt "rogue" as "rouge" and the joke has stuck ever since.</p>
<p>The "meta-template for hate reflects the controversy surrounding meta-templates. The "This user is often a dick not censored" reflects a controversy surrounding a picture of breasts in a userbox. Most of the categories at the bottom reflect controversial articles or arbcom cases. So you see, there is much more depth to the page than a quick glance may suggest.</p>
<p>I hope this helps explain some things. Have a nice day. The ikiro</p>
<p>can you do something?</p>

<dd>I try and take every request seriously, although the word "vile" is a bit tedious. "Debauched" is much more fun. Anyway, I will have a look at some stage, albeit a quick one. As to the use of explicatives, I might have done so before and not recall. I always suggest that adminstrators, like every editor, should try to be as civil as possible.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I applied at RfA on the rationale that I'd keep DRV running, and it's what I do. It's a simple, repetitive task of the sort I'm perfect for. Since you chimed in, though, it just so happens that the bottom three now are things I've commented in, so I'm ineligible to close.&#160;;) Have fun! By the way, I don't know whether I'm more drunk than I am fat, or more fat than I am drunk; but, I am both drunk and fat. I gotta drink on July 4 to reconcile America's great potential with its recent retarded record of mismanaged global mayhem. How hard is it to emigrate to Australia?

<p>You seem to be overly convinced of your assumed righteousness. Just because a paragraph is unsourced doesn't mean you can immediately delete it. <b>This is not your encyclopedia.</b> There often exists a high probability that the content is verifiable upon doing a little research. If you want to help, why don't you find the citations or make it more encyclopedic? And you need to be consistent in your spelling - unsourced is not spelled <i>unsrouced</i>. I'll be watching you Brenneman. --<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbelani_8b2e.html" title="User:Abelani">Amit</a> 20:06, 9 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can't speak for Aaron Brenneman, but please reread the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy. I'm not sure exactly what your particular issue is. If Aaron Brenneman gave reasonable notice, for example by marking items with the {{citation required}}, then there shouldn't be any issue.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The verifiability policy is quite specific: The obligation to provide a reputable source lies with the editors wishing to include the material, not on those seeking to remove it. Nothing in the policy says that it is good enough for there to be "a high probability that the content is verifiable upon doing a little research." If "a little research" is all that is required, it's reasonable to ask that editors inserting the material do that little research <i>before</i> adding content, and certainly should be willing to do so once they've been asked to supply a reference. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 00:23, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm assuming you're talking about the <a href="../../../s/p/e/Speed_dating.html" title="Speed dating">Speed dating</a> article, and it does not appear that Aaron Brenneman gave any notice, but it shouldn't be a big deal. Add the sources and reinsert the items.

<dl>
<dd>For the edit changes that I reviewed, Aaron Brenneman did not give any notice. It would be useful if he were to use the {{citation required}} tag rather than directly removing the unsourced sections. I believe it is also responsible behavior to initiate a discussion topic and place the relevant text there, before removing it from the article. This way there would still be some hope that someone in the future would cite sources. --<a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbelani_8b2e.html" title="User:Abelani">Amit</a> 00:41, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my personal opinion, yes, I agree with you, <a href="../../../a/b/e/User%7EAbelani_8b2e.html" title="User:Abelani">Amit</a>: it would have been more courteous of him to have tagged them, waited a while, and then moved the unsourced items to the Talk page. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:24, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you both for the input.
<ul>
<li>I do, in fact, often use that approach. I also often move material to the talk page for discussion. I'm also known to actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frog_cake&amp;diff=61949002&amp;oldid=61871155" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frog_cake&amp;diff=61949002&amp;oldid=61871155" rel="nofollow">add sources.</a></li>
<li>But experiance shows that the {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tag has very little effect, and if you'd like I'll provide a long list of talk page discussions I have with myself. The majority of the time my "I'm going to remove section foo" is answered only by crickets.</li>
<li>If someone is upset enough about a removal to mock my spelling, I can only know about that after the fact. I don't fully understand it, as no damage has been done to anyone or anything, and the wiki-linked phrase <i>"Use <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">sources</a> for encyclopedia content"</i> appears every time an edit window is opened. That doesn't diminish their affront, of course, however I only rarely intend to offend.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Amit, if you'll review my talk page you'll see that I attempt to answer every question or complaint with <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">courtesy</a>. I'd suggest that it is much easier for me to do so when I'm <i>approached</i> with courtesy.</dd>

<p><b>&lt;snip&gt;</b><br />
Regarding your comments on DRV: You're correct to some degree. I watch Tony Sidaway's edits <i>very</i> closely. While Tony calls this "obsession" I call it "monitoring a problem user with more than a handful of RfCs and RfArbs, who's proven remarkably resistant to community input." ^_^</p>
<p>With regards to "wiki-stalking" in a more general sense, the <i>inventor</i> of wiki (way before wikipedia) has said that the use of "recent changes" to track the edits of other users is one of the strongest points of the system. It means that oversight and transparency are trivially easy to maintain. I'll dig up the reference for that if you'd like.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that it can't be destructive and/or disruptive of course. But I encourage you to stalk <i>me</i> and if you think that I'm doing something wrong to let me know.</p>

<b>&lt;/snip&gt;</b><br />
I would consider just looking over user's edits as passive stalking, which would be pretty well harmless, depending of course on your motives. (In fact, if you are just looking at their previous edits to try getting a feel for their actions in general, that's not even stalking, that's acquainting yourself with their behaviour.)</p>
<p>My biggest complaint would be that filling the entire day's DRV with closures betrayed a rather unbalanced interest in the behaviour of the editor in question, and had a significant chance of starting an argument. It's not like Sidaway will be swayed from his rather, shall we say, "singular" administrative practices by people following him around and DRV'ing everything he does anyway. If early closure of AfD votes is disruptive, then mass DRV'ing isn't much better. Basically, as I commented there, I would think that leaving it to the editors of those articles to decide whether they think a DRV is appropriate would be the best course. --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 07:41, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I can well see the logic of what you're saying. While I was looking for (and recieved) a general consensus of "err, bad form on some of those closes," I accept that <i>A)</i> It raised some stink and <i>B)</i> It may have little impact. I am frustrated by Tony's almost pathological indifferance to the input of others, and am rapidly running out of ways (short of ArbCom) to deal with the behavior of this problem user. Thanks for taking the time to reply, I'll consider your comments next time a situation like this occurs. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#000000">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="#000000" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 12:17, 13 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Speaking of stalking, could you take a look at this <a href="../../../t/o/b/User_talk%7ETobias_Conradi_1f4c.html" title="User talk:Tobias Conradi">User_talk:Tobias_Conradi</a>? There are several threads there but among Tobias's allegations are that pschemp and myself are stalking him. I prefer "monitoring a problem user with more than a handful of blocks, already banned from .de, who's proven remarkably resistant to community input and advice from admins." (to paraphrase someone)... if your review suggests pschemp or I have erred, there's a thread on AN/I already where you could point that out. If you think she, or I (and TexasAndroid and others) are spot on, a post to that effect might be good on his talk page. That statement from Ward about use of contributions to ensure transparency seems particularly apt.

<p>Hello, Aaron. I just wanted to express my regret at your castigating the people that sorted the AFD votes into sections. I will admit that it appears to be a violation of standard policies, but personally I feel it was justified, given the effort by the Inquirer to try to rig the vote. Perhaps, even an effort to make it easier for the closing admininstrator to sift out the dross and figure out consensus. By any means, I think that in light of the subjects linking to the AFD vote, I would consider doing something like that an exceptional case in which unusual measures were appropriate to take. Now, while I'm here, I felt the need to express the sentiment that I'm sure a lot of the supporters felt on the article's deletion, but in rhyming couplets, if I may.</p>

<li>Oy, nice one. ^_^ I must admit I had been watching this one to see which way it fell. I was trying to stress that it can be hurtful to the people "sorted" thus as opposed to shaking my finger at whomever did it.

<dd>I don't think you came off as too schoolmarmish at all. If it makes it harder for the closing admin, it's not a good thing, and it <i>is</i> technically against policy. I just thought it might sit better if I brought up the fact that sometimes extenuating circumstances call for unusual measures.

<p>Hello Brenneman, having seen your comments on <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">User:Tony Sidaway</a>'s page I took a look at your signature and saw that it's code could be shortened. Here is a shortened code version of your sig that you might wish to adopt:</p>
<div style="style">
<ul>
<li>Newer version: [[User talk:Aaron Brenneman|&lt;font color="black"&gt;brenneman&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt; [{{fullurl:Special:Log|user=Aaron+Brenneman}}&lt;font color="black" title="Admin actions"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;'''{L}'''&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/font&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Older version: [[User talk:Aaron Brenneman|&lt;font color="000000"&gt;brenneman&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt; [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman&lt;font color="000000" title="Admin actions"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;'''{L}'''&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/font&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;</li>

<dd>Thanks for that, mate, deployed already. I'm often irritated by how much code it takes to make my simple <i>looking</i> sig. But I like my "L" too much to give it up. If "Special:Log/Aaron_Brenneman" was supported like "Special:Contributions/Aaron_Brenneman", but oh well. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 04:36, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>However, since I'm stupid and had forgetten that I'd <b>already</b> been told that $cleansig expands the fullurl anyway.

<dd>I believe there is a way around $cleansig. If you make a page in your user space say like User_talk:Aaron Brenneman/cleansig and put the code for the newer version in it and then add {{subst:User_talk:Aaron Brenneman/cleansig}} into your signature pref I think it won't expand. the fullurl: bit isn't like a regular template and its impact on the servers is negligible. Hope that helps. <i>(<a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetscott_c779.html" title="User talk:Netscott">→</a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetscott_af86.html" title="User:Netscott"><span class="pBody" style="border: 0; color: gray; padding: 0; font-size: 100%;">Netscott</span></a>)</i> 12:49, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wasn't aware there was a legitimate spelling "organise", but now I see that that is the British variety, so I've learned something new. Thanks! By coincidence, "organize" being the American spelling is more appropriate for use with the American topic of Ms. Hilton, so I was right, but only by accident.</p>

<p>I agree with your assertion that "Ideally each entry on the list should have a Wikipedia article". Well, that is waht they want to do - give anyone there an article. It still does not answer my problem with <a href="../../../o/l/e/Oleg.html" title="Oleg">Oleg</a>. As I said, this one is in fact at the same time a redirect to Russian an Rus' monarchs called "Oleg" (but there is a problem there) and a list of famous people called Oleg. There was a consensus there to delete these famous people (note: in Russia and Ukraine, "Oleg" and "Oleh" are official names, you never call someone "Oleg" when you already know him - this sort of list is of no use in Russia or Ukraine). However, if you look at the rest, you will see the problem: most of the other links for disambiguation are red (in fact, I think the list of famous people called Oleg is just there to hide that fact).</p>
<p>And that is not all: at least two Olegs here (Oleg IV and Oleg V of Chernigov) may never have existed - they are only mentioned in obsure and incomplete annals - so if they did exist, chances are that they are not really Oleg IV and Oleg V, but Oleg VI and Oleg VIII. But we will never know, obviously, for finding other material on these guys will be tantamount to the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls. As for the other, also obscure Olegs, who definitely existed, after the tiff about Oleg IV and Oleg V between Ghirlandajo and Briangotts, no Russian editor is going to touch those even with dirty and radioactive hands, although there must be something on these guys in their libraries. Note that this page is actually hindering people in their search for Oleg, which will probably be Oleg of Novgorod.

<p>Well, perhaps this grandma could use a few egg-sucking lessons.&#160;:) The difference between "keep and redirect" and "delete and redirect" still seems fairly trivial in this particular case — the end result is a redirect that any user <i>could</i>, if they wished, turn back into an article (although such a transformation would be against apparent consensus, and wouldn't last long).

<p>Greetings; I think protecting the page is an excellent idea. <s>I would suggest, though, that you protect it to a version prior to the fighting by Fullstop and Spahbod. Currently, the protected version is precisely the one that has sparked all of the controversy. I would like to request that you roll it back to a version prior to Fullstop's extensive edit.</s> Thanks! <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Krupp_1e6c.html" title="User:Anthony Krupp">Anthony Krupp</a> 12:09, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You know that bit where it says protection is not endorsement? There's a reason for that, he purposefully picked a random version so that it wouldn't endorse one of your views. Just wait a day or so, and it should be unprotected.

<p><s>::<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a>, I do understand the reason for non-endorsement, which is why I suggested that the protected version should not be precisely the version by one of the users involved in an edit war.

<dd>Anthony, you'd have to go back to the version of 6 December 2004 or 11 March 2002 to have a version prior to one of mine ("one of the users involved"). -- <a href="../../../f/u/l/User%7EFullstop_7a4f.html" title="User:Fullstop">Fullstop</a> 14:22, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s>::::Sigh. Thanks for the clarification. What I was noting is that the version of 16:06, 17 July 2006 by Fullstop marks a significant change from the previous version of 03:34, 17 July 2006 by 172.129.227.19. It was this change that sparked the edit war. Anyone reasonable will agree with that. I am not immediately invested in either of these two versions, which is why I addressed this question to another neutral party (Aaron Brenneman). I think it will be clear to anyone reasonable that I was suggesting we just back up a few versions before the fight. I do not mean to suggest that we must purge the article of all traces of work by Fullstop or Spahbod. Hope this helps.<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAnthony_Krupp_1e6c.html" title="User:Anthony Krupp">Anthony Krupp</a> 14:44, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</s></p>

<dd>There's actually a meta page just about this issue, humorously enough. Unless he accidently selected a version that was blatant vandalism, I believe this falls under the scope of <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" class="extiw" title="m:The_Wrong_Version">m:The Wrong Version</a>. (Even though you are a 3rd party.) Basically, as protection on the "wrong version" doesn't endorse that version, protecting a page on the "wrong version" can actually be superior as a way of forcing discussion and resolution to having it on a pre-edit war version, and does not harm the page any more than the ongoing edit war did.

<dd>That is extremely funny! Thanks for the link to <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/The_Wrong_Version" class="extiw" title="m:The_Wrong_Version">m:The Wrong Version</a>, which lightens my day, and also for the explanation. I'm still new here, so wasn't aware that protecting a contested version can actually be A Good Thing. I appreciate your input here, and I hope that the other editors do as well.

<dd>Also, is this edit war seriously about whether the Parsi can be considered Indian? Because that's just lame. Can't you just say it's at least slightly contentious, cite someone who says they <i>are</i> Indian, cite someone who says they <i>aren't</i> Indian, and move on with the article? Of course, it never goes that simply in actual practice... --<a href="../../../t/j/s/User%7ETjstrf_ba84.html" title="User:Tjstrf">tjstrf</a> 17:24, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

While I do realize that those articles are only stubs, the removal of the scars section made me modertly uncomfortable.

<p>Hi, I saw your name recently on another editor's page where you were discussing their signature and policy. I have had the recent misfortune of working on an article that is "guarded" by several who wish a particular POV. I doubt there is much that you or anyone can do about that, however, I would like your help in the near future about a particular editor among that group whom has a particularly bright fancy signature. I don't mind that people in general have signatures as such, but this particular editor has a habit of following me around and addressing nearly any comment I have on any article I happen to edit. If you think that you could help me explain to him about this matter, I would appreciate it a great deal. I am basically afraid to even speak to him anymore. Anything that I have ever said is purposely miscontrued, backwards, twisted, upside-down, however. Please let me know, and I'll keep an eye on your page here for an answer. Thanks.

<dd>That was too vague for me to be able to respond intelligently, I'm afraid.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>In a very general sense, I'm the wrong person to be talking to about "wikistalking." First note that I've got my own personal list of "stalk-ees" at the top of this page. Then have a look at <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Interview/Ward_Cunningham" class="external text" title="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Interview/Ward_Cunningham" rel="nofollow">this</a> interview with the father of wiki where he states that <i>"the ability to see what other editors are doing"</i> is vital. I'm sure I'm stretching his ideas a fair bit, but still, there it is.</dd>

<dd>I think there is a big difference between watching something compared to using information to purposely try and cause problems. In anycase, though, I didn't want to be specific so I'd be sure to get a neutral answer. The main problem was in regard to the signature and your opinions. Thanks though.

<p>Aaron, since you have been valiantly culling external links, could I solicit your opinion on the train wreck <a href="../../../g/i/l/Talk%7EGill_Langley_0d30.html#British_Anti-Vivisection_Association" title="Talk:Gill Langley">here</a>? In short, the subject of the article is an snimal rights activist who has been consulting for a bunch of charities, and the edit war is over the <i>British_Anti-Vivisection_Association</i>, a charity the lady has not been involved with.

<p>I have an ongoing content dispute regarding <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomson_%28unit%29.html" title="Thomson (unit)">Thomson (unit)</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass-to-charge_ratio.html" title="Mass-to-charge ratio">Mass-to-charge ratio</a> and now <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_spectrum.html" title="Mass spectrum">Mass spectrum</a>. I was wondering if you might drop in for a little bit, with no obligation to solve anything and finish anything and give a few words of advice and clarify parts of wikipolicy. Some of the dialog is excessive perhaps only the last few entries might be the best reading. I ask in good faith that you clarify to <a href="../../../k/e/h/User%7EKehrli_23c6.html" title="User:Kehrli">User:Kehrli</a> that the removal of disputed tags without discussion is inappropriate and that verifiability applies to usage and not just to the possible usage that is consistent with guidance documents. By this I do not mean to say that the possible usage is not verified but that without a single intance of use anywhere perhaps it doesn't meet proportionality guidelines. You are of course free to disagree with me. My hope is that these clarifications will foster better discussions and we will work things out ourselves or at least act civilly in a stalemate.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 17:33, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've just re-checked my work from before and I still get the same answer. I take your point about the two hours ten minutes left to run, but once the accounts with very low participation are set aside, there does not exist consensus to overturn. I'm not willing to un-do the close myself. Depending on how <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">brave</a> you are feeling, it doesn't take any adminstrative powers to close a DRv discussion, so it is also a normal editorial action to <b>un</b>close one.

<p>Thanks for your comments on my Talkpage regarding <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Edwin_Thanhouser_ca2a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Edwin Thanhouser">my first AfD</a>, my original reply is there. I understand now that AfD probably wasn't the best answer for this article, and a result of "Keep and Merge" seems likely. Since I'm the one who opened this can of worms it only seems reasonable that I should sort it out and do the work myself, but I have more questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Would it be absurd to change my position and vote against my own AfD?</li>
<li>Should I wait until after AfD to begin working on the article, or can I start immediately?</li>
<li>When the time comes to merge, will you help out? It will be another wiki-first for me...</li>
<li>If I change my position will I be in danger of losing my Dark Side credentials?</li>

<p>I guess I just don't really see the harm in keeping it as a redirect; if anything, it discourages future recreation. I do think that, even if trivial information is merged, a redirect is the proper conclusion. Consensus was that the information in the article didn't belong in Wikipedia and I think this result still reflects that.

<li>Bah. I was pretty unhappy with this decision, actually.

<li>Platz. No, there isn't much wiggle room for me there, it's a "no consensus to delete" and there isn't a policy reason to over-riding the consensus (or lack thereof.) I'd note that we don't (usually) delete an article that has had information from it merged due to the <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> requirements to keep a change history. I'd say start with a page move to a better title (for serch hits) and a redirect to the target you've mentioned. Start a thread on the talk page of Wizarding world with a perma-link to a pre-redirect version of the page with a note "What needs to be merged from this?."<br />

<p>Dear Aaron,</p>
<p>You are the only admin I know that commented on <a href="../../../t/e/m/Wikipedia%7ETemplates_for_deletion_Log_2006_July_18_a9d5.html#Monty_Python_user_templates" title="Wikipedia:Templates for deletion/Log/2006 July 18">this issue</a>, so I would like to bring it to your attention that <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFredil_Yupigo_5cbb.html" title="User:Fredil Yupigo">Fredil Yupigo</a> closed the discussion only one day after a compromise was proposed. I have asked Fredil Yupigo to revert his closure, however, if the user doesn't respond or responds poorly, would you be willing to look into this matter or suggest someone look into it?</p>
<p>I know that user templates are very low on the importance scale of things on Wikipedia, but they are still a part of it whether people like it or not. I am just trying to do my part in gaining some sort of control of them. I am a fan of most of the subjects of which I have made master user templates, which should tell people that even a fan can see when the peer group is getting a bit ridiculous. This is the case with the Monty Python templates. And now Fredil Yupigo has come along and closed off discussion.</p>

<dd>I often double-check closes, and would expect that people do the same to me. I'm examining contribution histories as we speak.

<dd>Yeah, this was an odd discussion, not much meaty discussion, nor any mention of the influx of very very new users. The problem with a debate like this is that people are encouraged by the afd instructions <i>not</i> to participate in a debate whose outcome looks clear. Once we discount the <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> from people with under ten edits, the outcome is actually not that clear. I'd suggest that a good thing would be to re-open the debate clearly tagging all users with their edit counts. The other option would be to re-nom, but then the few experianced editors who opined already either have to weigh in again or get their wishes ignored. But I'm not that excited either way, just doing sue-diligance - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 02:11, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ah I see. Well I just close the AfD's, I dont pass judgement on them. If all votes point to keep, its kept. As a general rule of thumb, I never close an AfD if fewer than 5 people have said keep. I also will not close an AfD if one person says delete, even though I was told that if one or two deletes were there, I could close as keep. If you want, we can tag them all and relist, or...we can bring this up to the nom and ask him/her to renom it. Either wat though, my method of closing is based solely on not making a decision myself on the AfD, so I can be totally objective. I can see now that its flawed.</dd>

<p>Hi, Aaron. This is a response to your post on <a href="../../../j/i/m/Talk%7EJim_Hawkins_e958.html" title="Talk:Jim Hawkins">Talk:Jim Hawkins</a>. I recommended that the <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Hawkins_8932.html" title="Jim Hawkins">Jim Hawkins</a> article be deleted because he requested it and because he is non-notable, in my opinion. The AfD might have succeeded if the nominator had not chosen Hawkin's request as the only reason to delete the article. Saying that you want an article about yourself deleted virtually assures that it will be kept on AfD. He has been belligerent, which is not helping his cause, either. He has also threatened that he is getting "legal advice" to have the page removed.</p>
<p>He has not made any attempt to understand what Wikipedia is about and what its rules and etiquette are. Here is a quote from him, "I really couldn't care less what Wikipedia frowns upon, to be honest, but thanks for initiating the deletion process." Here is another, "He doesn't want an entry on Wikipedia, but for some ridiculous reason he's unable to delete his own entry on the site without being accused of `vandalism'." That was a comment that he put into the article itself. He keeps saying (on the articles talk page and on the AfD nomination) that he should be able to delete an article that is about him. It is like he thinks he owns the article. I doubt that the BBC (his employer) would remove an article from its website because the subject requested them to do so. If we had access, they would also probably be upset if the subject blanked the article him or herself. Since it is a wiki, I guess he thinks that he can do whatever he wants. Also, I think that he may be one of those people that object to the idea of an encyclopedia that anyone can edit.</p>
<p>As for specific objections, there was an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jim_Hawkins&amp;oldid=34717415" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jim_Hawkins&amp;oldid=34717415" rel="nofollow">early version</a> that he claims was full of errors. He removed some information in two edits and then removed the entire article except for the first sentence. In subsequent edits he mostly blanked the article (most of the IPs in the history are him). Sometimes he just removed some of its content. I think his objection is that the article exists. Also, while some of the information might have been inaccurate, I think that he does not want people to know things about his life (like hobbies and what schools he attended), even though they are not negative or sensitive, with the exception of his date of birth, which could be used for identity theft.</p>
<p>I do not know what is to be done about this. He is so hostile that I do not think that it is possible to reason with him. People have tried to explain about Wikipedia, its etiquette and processes, but he responds with snide remarks. I suspect that he will threaten the Foundation and they will delete the article because it is not worth fighting about.

<dd>Yeah, to be sure, I rather think his main objection is as to the existence of the article, not to any particular information contained therein (ostensibly akin to <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngela_56ea.html" title="User:Angela">Angela</a>'s objections relative to the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angela_Beesley_5b39.html" title="Angela Beesley">article apropos of her</a>); I gather that even were it exclusively hagiographic he'd want it deleted (notwithstanding that all of the information, per <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, of course, is readily avaiable elsewhere). Pace Kjkolb, I think it unlikely that, were he to contact the Foundation (either individually via OTRS or formally through a lawyer), the article would be summarily deleted; he is volitionally public and notable, and the article does not tend toward the defamatory, and so, even as the Foundation always likes to avoid litigation, this is one situation in which Jimbo's pronouncement that, even as we ought to treat decorously subjects who are not happy with the encyclopedic treatment accorded them, we ought not to accede to their wishes where our articles are otherwise consistent with our policies and guidelines (even the altogether pernicious <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> recognizes this). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 19:03, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Aaron, any idea what to do with this page? The "nom cabal" concept didn't really go anywhere, as far as I can tell, but enterprising young editors are still finding this page, and then adding themselves and being largely ignored. I've imposed some order on the page chronologically, but I'm not sure it's current <a href="../../../b/a/c/Backwater.html" title="Backwater">backwater</a> state/location are helpful to either the nominees or the concept of crafting better RFA noms...thoughts? -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 15:01, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Obviously, what the schoolies mean when they say that "it is policy to keep schools" or that there is "consensus to keep schools" is that there is consensus among schoolies that this be policy. The rotating cast of dissenting voices quickly tire and move on to more productive tasks, I really hope you will do the same. There is a lot of useful work that needs doing outside of the schools ghetto. As someone who gets invited to contribute to "real" encyclopedias, let me assure you that there are areas of Wikipedia that are really very very good, valuable, and a real benefit to the world (eg hard sciences). These are areas where any sane and reasonable person can make valuable contributions. There are also areas that need constant tending (eg popular culture). These articles get read, and used. They matter. I suggest rather than valuing WP by the quality of it's most frivolous content, that you try viewing WP's quality by it's most frequently accessed content. Since most school articles are unlikely to be read by anyone other than the author, their existence is really no cost to WP. Possibly more importantly, if one assumes that some proportion of the schoolies are motivated more by the social networking aspects of their contributions to WP than the relevance of the data contributed, there is the risk that if NN schools disappear from WP, that these editors will focus their attentions on other parts of WP, where more effort may be required to keep standards high. At present count, there are 1,293,988 articles in the English wikipedia, even if the schoolies manage to make an article for each of the paltry 112,494 US schools already documented at www.publicschoolreview.com it'll keep them busy and out of everyone else's hair for years to come.

<p>With respect, I disagree with the way this one was closed. Although I acknowledge AfDs aren't votes I'm beginning to fear that that is being used to reinforce the closer's opinion. But I don't want to antagonize you; that's not my accusation against you. Regardless of whether there was a consensus to delete, to say that some opinions should be discounted because they were sockpuppeting or failed to address the article strikes me as wrong; only one looked like a sock on my quick inspection, and while some people questioned the AfD they added opinions on why they think the article is notable. I was one of these, and I sincerely hope you didn't disregard my opinion. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">Et tu, Brute?</a></small> 19:11, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Before I even go and review this close, two things:
<ol>
<li>Every adminstrator should welcome feedback on their performance, so there's no fear of antagonising me. I think that if someone doesn't like having their admin work triple-checked or doesn't want to defend thier decisions, they should stick to regular editing.</li>
<li>If I have a strong opinion, a <i>personal</i> opinion, on the outcome I won't use sysop privledges as a "super-vote." I try very hard to be as even handed as possible.</li>

<dd>(I'm going to respond here from now on to keep the conversation together.) It's a quadruple standard with a backflip. We keep articles on radio masts, have you noticed? The only way to stay sane is to take a long term perspective, and to understand that articles come and go, but wikipedia stays. Getting too wound up over any one article's fate <i>right now</i> is almost never helpful. Baby steps.

<p>Dear Aaron, thank you so much for your beautiful words, your kidness and your trust in me! My <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_Phaedriel_2_3e0a.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Phaedriel 2">Request for Adminship</a> is finally over, and the support and appreciation that the community has gifted me will stick in my mind as long as I live. I have no way to properly express how grateful I am to you for all you've done for me, and all I can tell you is, I'll try not to disappoint you nor anyone else with my use of the buttons... and if I mess up, make sure to <a href="../../../p/h/a/User_talk%7EPhaedriel_a4cd.html" title="User talk:Phaedriel">come here</a> and give me a good yell!&#160;:) Seriously, tho, if you ever need my help, either for admin-related stuff or in any other way, you'll always be welcome to message me, and I promise I'll try my very best.<br />
Dear Aaron, first of all, allow me to tell you I'm incredibly, utterly and terribly sorry for letting all this time pass without messaging you. So many, many times I was "this" close, and I even once wrote a poem to "vandalize" your page... but after I read it, I thought it was just <i>too</i> silly and unworthy. I hope you can forgive me, please...&#160;:( However, one thing I can swear to you, and I have witnesses!&#160;;) is that you've always been a very special and dear person to me. The most important thing to me, is how you've stood by me every time my way of being is questioned, and that is something I'll never, ever forget. You are a person I constantly look up to, and the fact that you considered my modest contributions worthy of your support is a great flattery, beyond our friendship. And, regarding your thoughts at my RfA, I beg you that if you ever see that the mop is changing me, don't bother to file a RfC - just hit me with the flamethrower, please!&#160;:) You are simply great, A&#160;;) With a big hug, your friend,</p>

<p>As far as the proposal: it's a decidedly bad idea for a variety of reasons, and I don't really see why we need it. If we require some sort of emergency policy deciders, we should just use the ArbCom, which has, at least, community support for its membership. Otherwise, our existing methods seem to be coping with policy formation.</p>

<p>Why did you delete this article? The voting was 5:3 in favour of keeping it so far and a few other people and I were in the process of rewriting the article to make it adhere better to Wikipedia's standards. We had added quite a few references to awards and the like given to this website already, but another admin deleted them from the article. Cantr is only technically an MMORPG, its gameplay is nothing like that of any of the games in that category. That's because in reality it is an experiment in sociology and as such it is endorsed by universities and schools in several countries. But even if it was an ordinary, non-notable MMORPG as there are thousands on the net, I don't see how you can delete the article when Wikipedia has an own MMORPG category (<a href="../../../m/a/s/Category%7EMassively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_games_7315.html" title="Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games">Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games</a>) with already close to 200 entries, clearly showing that game info is as much a part of this encyclopedia as, say, linguistics (<a href="../../../l/i/n/Category%7ELinguistics_523e.html" title="Category:Linguistics">Category:Linguistics</a>). <a href="../../../j/u/n/User%7EJunesun_def6.html" title="User:Junesun">Junesun</a> 08:58, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you'd like I'll restore the article into user space to give you material to use for a re-write. I must stress that the "ratio" of delete to keep "votes" grotesquely misunderstands the way that deletion discussions work. While anyone (even IP addresses) is welcome to contribute facts based upon <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to a discussion, statements like "as valid as any other RPG article" would be very light-on coming even from a vested contributor. If you decide to attempt the re-write, please study very carefully the guidelines on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">web content</a> as well as the afore-mentioned reliable sources. With regards to the 200 MMOPRG articles, we don't play to the least common denonimator here. If any of these fail the inclusion guidelines, please do bring them to my attention and I'll probably nominate it for deletion. Often things that eventually <i>will</i> be deleted are around only because they haven't been noticed yet. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 12:11, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not really your place to summarize everyone's comments, <b>especially</b> then there is active discussion going on. THis is a policy proposal. I'm sure you realize that disrupting this, particularly since it provides a way to desysop people, looks suspicious. I'm not saying you're doing it on purpose, I'm just telling you: it looks fishy. WHy don't you just let the discussion run its course instead of making controversial, unilateral moves to a page where dozens of people are discussing an idea? Surely you understand that doing this sort of thing to a discussion that's been going on for several days, as well as simply summarizing everyone's viewpoints they've spent so much time formulating, is going to be inflammatory and even insulting to those who participated?</dd>
<dd>In any case, I've nominated the talk page for speedy deletion so it can be moved back and the history restored. Ongoing discussion on the main talk page can be found/archived <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarwynn_Recall_talk_f57e.html" title="User:Karwynn/Recall talk">here</a>.

<li>Well, actually it's <i>everyone's</i> place to refactor if they see fit. It can be annoying when someone does so, and if someone is doing it to push an agenda (or just to be annoying) it's a problem. The talk page was 174 kilobytes long already. And, as nicely as possible, a great deal of it was repetative and sniping. By compressing the <i>ideas</i> then we can isolate them from the contributor. I urge you to expand any summary points that you object to and to put in any points that I've missed, but please do it as a simple statement of fact as opposed to a signed comment. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Aaron+Brenneman" rel="nofollow"><font color="black" title="Admin actions"><sup><b>{L}</b></sup></font></a></span> 13:14, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Additionally, you completely changed the policy proposal. It is no longer the same process. If you want to propose a new process, start a new proposal.

<dl>
<dd>Err, no. I don't think I changed a single thing in the proposal. I removed a massive amount of repeated statements and overlinking, as well as obvious errors like use of shortcuts as words and link in section titles. But I'm pretty sure I didn't change anything. You do realise that this is a wiki, right, and that we're <b>supposed</b> to make changes in things?

THis is a policy proposal being actively formed. If you can't cooperate with other editors in forming it, you need to go make a proposal of your own and leave this one to those of us interested in pursuing the interests of the community rather than our own preferences.

<dd>YOu are right that you didn't totally change it however, I got the wrong impression from some of the wording that it was completely different. Karwynn <a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKarwynn_869e.html" title="User talk:Karwynn">(talk)</a> 14:51, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Thanks for that at least. Karwynn, I'm trying to be gentle with you here, ok? You are wrong about so many things at once that I'm having a hard time doing so, but I am trying.
<ul>
<li>First you need to read the <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_archive_a_talk_page_629d.html" title="Wikipedia:How to archive a talk page">Wikipedia:How to archive a talk page</a> where it describes the consequences of moving as a method of archiving. This is actually the <i>preferred</i> method of archiving, and the one used on almost all wikipedia namepace pages like the adminstrator's noticeboard. It actually <i>preserves</i> the existing links, contrary to your statements.</li>
<li>Then have good long look at the clean-up I did to the proposal. If you don't understand why having links in section titles is bad, the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28headings%29_90d7.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings)">Wikipedia:Manual of Style (headings)</a> explains it. There is also the deliberately obtusly titled <a href="../../../w/t/f/Wikipedia%7EWTF__OMG%21_TMD_TLA._ARG%21_b21f.html" title="Wikipedia:WTF? OMG! TMD TLA. ARG!">Wikipedia:WTF? OMG! TMD TLA. ARG!</a> which explains why use of arconyms is sub-optimal.</li>
<li>Next, look over the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7ERefactoring_talk_pages_ad80.html" title="Wikipedia:Refactoring talk pages">Wikipedia:Refactoring talk pages</a> page, and try to <i>depersonalise</i> the arguments that exist on the recall talk page. Do we really want another ten people to come and say the same things another seven ways?</li>
<li>Finally, your suggestion that <i>anything</i> is "agreed" upon and that I was changing things goes against both the reality of the talk page and the praaxis of <a href="../../../h/o/w/Wikipedia%7EHow_to_create_policy_4959.html" title="Wikipedia:How to create policy">Wikipedia:How to create policy</a>. If I removed an edge or two, changed a "6" to a "7", please understand that <i>almost no one cares</i>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Yes, I took a bloody big broom to both pages, yes <b>of course</b> it was unilateral... but I put some thought into those actions. You reverted back to a version that did not have "consensus" spelled correctly. I'm not going to claim that I have some mandate because I've been here longer, or that I was "right" but you're even forgetting to sign your comments. Just calm down a little.</dd>

<p>Yes, here I am back wasting my time on useless discussions. If anyone comes up with a workable improvement on admin discipline let me know. But this isn't it. Even Kelly Martin at her most unpopular could have mustered 20% to prevent a recall supermajority. Anyway, see you around at the next pointless proposal.
