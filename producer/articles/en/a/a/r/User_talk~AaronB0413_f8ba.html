<p>In the <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_and_Bones_93ca.html" title="Skull and Bones">Skull and Bones</a> article, were you aware you changed the S&amp;B 1931 of John Henry Heinz, II to "John Heinz" (his son), though its not really accurate that way and misleading? I see the "point" of the link it being the only available link right now, though its just not "kosher" I guess because John Heinz III is not SB as I indicated in a previous edit's notes.&#160;:-) A suggestion: a secondary link to his son after the original version, to clear that up? Just looking into your motivations for the change. Cheers, I'll have to come back and read your page. --<a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EReSearcher_8795.html" title="User:ReSearcher">ReSearcher</a> 04:57, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>My apology, and I assure you that the mistake was accidently. I had previously heard the John Kerry (S&amp;B 1968) had married his Teresa Heinz after her husband (who was said to be bones as well) died. So the mistake was mine, but unintentional. However, I did eliminate Heinz altogether from S&amp;B page, as his father was not a member of the US Congress, which is what that section was intended for. Sorry for the confusion</p>
<p>You can check my web blog for additional Bones information. <a href="http://inaaronsopinion.blogspot.com/" class="external free" title="http://inaaronsopinion.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://inaaronsopinion.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>No apologies asked for or required.&#160;:-) Actually I think it is an important link to keep as John Heinz II (S&amp;B, 1931) even if it is presently without a page. That is how we can tell people to write something at the link... Cheers, --<a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EReSearcher_8795.html" title="User:ReSearcher">ReSearcher</a> 02:10, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi. You deleted something I'd just added on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_political_families_608e.html" title="List of United States political families">List of United States political families</a> without an edit summary. I had to assume your intent was that the personage Mary Gore Dean was not notable. I checked some sources and she isn't as notable as I remembered, so I decided to leave her out, but it would be very helpful and courteous to other editors if you would add <a href="../../../e/d/i/Help%7EEdit_summary_ca7e.html" title="Help:Edit summary">edit summaries</a>. I see you've been here a while, and I'm surprised you haven't experienced how helpful they are from the other side. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 03:37, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry, but I just thought that it was obvious that she was not a political figure, and held no political office. As the page is for only political members of prominent US political families.</p>
<p>She should be mentioned on Wikipedia, and "Deborah Gore Dean, former HUD official convicted in a kickback scandal" would apply, but you should really include her HUD title and dates that she served in that position; otherwise it looks like your just trying to smear the Gore family. If that is your intent, you should include the information about about Mary Gore Dean (she is notable) Gore somewhere on Al Gore's page (perhaps), but she is not a political figure...anymore than <a href="../../../m/o/n/Monica_Lewinsky_f914.html" title="Monica Lewinsky">Monica Lewinsky</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Meyer_4350.html" title="Mary Meyer">Mary Meyer</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marilyn_Monroe_4162.html" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a>, Jennifer Flowers, <a href="../../../f/a/w/Fawn_Hall_5aad.html" title="Fawn Hall">Fawn Hall</a>, Jennifer Fitzpatrick, etc, etc, etc.</p>

<p>I have limited energies to devote to <a href="../../../b/a/l/Baldwin%2C_Hoar_%26_Sherman_family_fcdc.html" title="Baldwin, Hoar &amp; Sherman family">Baldwin, Hoar &amp; Sherman family</a>, but it would be nice to figure out how to make it more accessible.<br />
For example, I cannot figure out if all of Roger Shermans children are even shown on that page. This, over at <a href="../../../r/o/o/Roosevelt_family.html" title="Roosevelt family">Roosevelt_family</a> has some appeal.<br />
or <a href="../../../b/l/a/Template_talk%7EBlackfamilytree_db37.html#Dimensions" title="Template talk:Blackfamilytree">Template_talk:Blackfamilytree#Dimensions</a><br />
Even simply numbering the generations, perhaps in addition to</p>

<p>I would be willing to do what ever is necessary, but I am not real familiar with how the Wiki formatting works.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I invite you to check this tiny working <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYellowdesk_scratch2_0f70.html" title="User:Yellowdesk/scratch2">example</a>. We'll see what comes of it, as I learn how to do this formatting. (I'd prefer not to make that page public, and will take out the link after a while.) PS. I think William T.

<dd>Thanks for supplying dates on my draft of the family tree. Can you provide full list of citations to sources for these, so others, later on, cannot criticize these for being un-verifiable? Given how painful it is to edit these tables, I'm thinking that footnotes that are simple text, outside of the tree/table are the best way to go, or to have a text article for each family tree created, that provides the citations. -- <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYellowdesk_4361.html" title="User:Yellowdesk">Yellowdesk</a> 06:36, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
