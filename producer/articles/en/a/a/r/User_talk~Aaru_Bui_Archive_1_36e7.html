<p>You mentioned on the talk page there that starting another vote would be an option. I agree, but I don't want to do it myself, as I don't want to create the perception that I would keep putting the vote up until it went my way. I do find the result odd, as I mentioned, considering the votes and rationales. If you'd like to make a second Requested Move and this time mention it in WP:PW, I'd certainly vote again. If you do this, perhaps you could leave me a note on my talk page so that I don't miss out on it. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 08:28, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>I put them in the order they were shown. I recorded RAW, so I stopped the show and wrote them down (going left to right and starting with the top row). The top row (for example) was Viscera, Benoit, Benjamin, MVP, Nitro, Holly, Sandman, Sabu, RVD. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 01:16, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I see. Did sort of recognised the order. WWE.com now shows them in alphabetical order by last name though. Sure you still want to keep your order? --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaru_Bui_57ac.html" title="User:Aaru Bui"><b><font color="green">Aaru Bui</font></b></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaru_Bui_49f0.html" title="User talk:Aaru Bui"><font color="black">DII</font></a></sup> 01:33, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It was agreed at WP:PW that we won't necessarily follow the order that WWE/TNA lists them (which is why the RR match is in the middle since it was announced second. It doesn't matter that much since the RR is about 2 weeks away anyways. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 01:54, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Why, after working to improve the article, would you want to basically ruin it by moving it to the wrong name? It's iMPACT, not Impact. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 07:43, 15 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, why did you remove your entry in the current discussion? It's not any less deserving to be read and considered by your fellow editors. I admit, the discussion got a little off-topic, due to another person with that "no no, keep everything the oFFiCiAL way!" attitude, but I'm trying to fix that right now. - <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrus_XIII_14b0.html" title="User:Cyrus XIII">Cyrus XIII</a> 15:16, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_a984.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use">fair use</a> but there is no <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_rationale_guideline_7257.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline">explanation or rationale</a> as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the <a href="../../../i/m/a/Wikipedia%7EImage_copyright_tags_Fair_use_fdd2.html" title="Wikipedia:Image copyright tags/Fair use">boilerplate fair use template</a>, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.</p>
<p>Please go to <a href="../../../t/n/a/Image%7ETnasacrifice2007.jpg_0c77.html" title="Image:Tnasacrifice2007.jpg">the image description page</a> and edit it to include a <a href="../../../f/a/i/Wikipedia%7EFair_use_rationale_guideline_7257.html" title="Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline">fair use rationale</a>.</p>
<p>If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">1968 Australian "Open"</span></h2>
<p>Perhaps I should better explain why I removed the 1968 link from <a href="../../../a/u/s/Template%7EAustralian_Open_tournaments_479e.html" title="Template:Australian Open tournaments">Template:Australian Open tournaments</a>. The phrase "1968 Australian Open" is meaningless. No such tournament was ever held. The <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968_Australian_Open_b64d.html" title="1968 Australian Open">1968 Australian Open</a> article should be deleted, or at least renamed to <a href="../../../1/9/6/1968_Australian_Championships_7e80.html" title="1968 Australian Championships">1968 Australian Championships</a>. Eventually there will be a Template:Australian Championships link box and the 1968 tournament will go there. But it certainly doesn't belong amongst the Australian Opens. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDantheox_3b5b.html" title="User:Dantheox">dantheox</a> 18:01, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
