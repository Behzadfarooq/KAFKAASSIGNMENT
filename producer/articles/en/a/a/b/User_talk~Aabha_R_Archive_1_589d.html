<p>it's okay, provided you follow the instructions on the Category:Soccer-europe images page: use {{<a href="../../../s/o/c/Template%7ESocEur_8329.html" title="Template:SocEur">SocEur</a>}} and add "Image © <a href="http://soccer-europe.com/" class="external free" title="http://soccer-europe.com/" rel="nofollow">http://soccer-europe.com/</a>" to the caption on any pages you use an image.

<p>Hi Aabha,</p>
<p>I really like your article on Frank Lampard. We don't normally do <i>complete</i> rewrites of articles on Wikipedia though - imagine how annoyed you'd be if we put your article up and someone came along a month later and replaced the whole thing. However, with the article having a copyvio on it I can see why you did it that way rather than editing it directly.</p>
<p>The first thing we need to do is put the existing article through Wikipedia's copyright violations procedure. I've done that before with <a href="../../../g/i/g/Gigg_Lane_606d.html" title="Gigg Lane">Gigg Lane</a>, so if you give me the URL of the copyrighted article I can do that for you. If the Wikipedia article has always been a copyvio, it'll have to be deleted by an admin, in which case we can just copy your article to <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Lampard_a85e.html" title="Frank Lampard">Frank Lampard</a> afterwards. It's more likely that the article started off okay and then had the copyrighted text added to it, in which case it'll need to be reverted back to the last version without a copyvio. Once that's done, we can merge your changes into the article.</p>
<p>One other point about your article: the tables look great, but they need something saying what date they are valid to as they'll quickly go out of date otherwise.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantthinkofagoodname_4422.html" title="User:Cantthinkofagoodname">CTOAGN</a> 21:05, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Cheers for your note on my talk page. I've just had a quick look at your new article on Frank Lampard and it's looking good. I just think that you maybe trying for too much detail in his early career. Why don't you just mention he made 9 league apps, scoring 1 goal for Swansea. I don't think you need to be all that completist. Besides, not all sources seem to agree on how many appearances Frank made for the Swans anyway This <a href="http://www.franklampard.net/hammers.html" class="external text" title="http://www.franklampard.net/hammers.html" rel="nofollow">source</a> says 10(8league, 2cup) . But I would use this source from the FA as the best&#160;: <a href="http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/06/52274.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2003/06/52274.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajts_74ac.html" title="User:Majts">Majts</a> 07:58, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I like the table, but I would change a couple of things. Remove red &amp; yellow cards - they make it too complicated. E.g. <a href="../../../t/h/i/Thierry_Henry_ecb5.html" title="Thierry Henry">Thierry Henry</a> has some good tables that I think are both clear and informative. Don't worry about getting the stats absolutely perfect on his Swansea games though - someone will always correct it eventually if its wrong - that's the Wiki way. <a href="../../../m/a/j/User%7EMajts_74ac.html" title="User:Majts">Majts</a> 09:18, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I'd keep the stuff on his early career in unless the article starts to look too long. When I put <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denis_Law_eddd.html" title="Denis Law">Denis Law</a> through <a href="../../../p/r/_/WP%7EPR_690c.html" title="WP:PR">peer review</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">featured article candidates</a>, people complained that there wasn't enough stuff on his early life. With regard to his Swansea appearances, it's probably best to cite whichever source you're using and mention that other sources disagree in a footnote. Normally I'd sooner have stats left out than risk having wrong ones put in, but if you get an authoritative source and cite it I think that's alright.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I've sorted out the copyvio, so it's ready to have your stuff merged in. There are guidelines on how to do this at <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerging_and_moving_pages_8b77.html" title="Wikipedia:Merging and moving pages">Wikipedia:Merging and moving pages</a> but they don't really apply here as you wrote your article in your user space instead of the main namespace. I'd just go through your version a paragraph at a time and work out where it should go in the main article. If it's on something that the main article doesn't have, just copy it in. Otherwise, you'll have to decide whether to keep the original version, use your version or mix the two - just choose what seems best to you. I'm happy to help with this - just leave me a message if you want a hand. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantthinkofagoodname_4422.html" title="User:Cantthinkofagoodname">CTOAGN</a> 17:19, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good question. Why is the article such a vandalism target? Well, plain and simply, it's because ManU sucks! BOO YA! Enjoying your debt this season? Etc. etc.</p>
<p>Okay, not really. It's just a general thing – sports teams attract that sort of immaturity.

Meanwhile, ManU are so popular and well-known that it attracts even those vandals who've never even seen a football match. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 00:23, 15 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aabha,</p>
<p>I've been quite busy the last couple of days, so haven't got round to having a look at your changes. I should get the chance to do it in the next couple of days.</p>

<dd>I've had another look and it's good, you should definitely merge it in. I can make a start on it if you're not sure what to do, but the edit would be credited to my account instead of yours. I can always put something in the edit summary saying it was your text though. Let me know if you'd like me to do this</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There's no need to worry <i>too</i> much about making mistakes - it's easy for someone to revert an edit if you get anything wrong. Have a read of <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">Wikipedia:Be bold</a> and feel free to change anything if you think you can improve it. As long as you aren't maliciously damaging articles (and I'm sure you won't be) nobody should give you a hard time.</dd>

<p>It's probably alright, but I'm no expert on fair use. If no free images of Lampard can be found (very probably true), the image is fairly low-resolution (definitely no more than 400px wide, although it shouldn't be stored at a higher resolution than the article uses) and including it won't cost the copyright holder anything, it should be alright. I thought there was a Wikiproject relating to fair use but I can't find it. If you can find it, it would be worth asking them. <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Yemen flag large.png">Image:Yemen flag large.png</a> <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantthinkofagoodname_4422.html" title="User:Cantthinkofagoodname">CTOAGN</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECantthinkofagoodname_1ff5.html" title="User talk:Cantthinkofagoodname">talk</a>) 14:16, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>If you put a good fair use rationale on it, it would be fine. Something along the lines of: 1. Used for encyclopedic purposes, 2. screen-resolution file used (does not diminish value of actual printed version), 3. distributed by company, does not reduce re-sell value of photo, thus probably doesn't cut into future profits at all. --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 15:12, 6 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Oh, it's great you're volunteering - many hands make light work. There's growing consensus that free/public domain/copyleft images should be moved to the Commons. I have updated <a href="../../../m/o/v/Wikipedia%7EMoving_images_to_the_Commons_a980.html" title="Wikipedia:Moving images to the Commons">Wikipedia:Moving images to the Commons</a>. I've never done it myself, so probably best to find an image person if you have any questions beyond the instructions there. There will be some "fair use" images left over. These I suppose can be left in the category. There are some other categories under <a href="../../../w/i/k/Category%7EWikipedia_images_by_type_7407.html" title="Category:Wikipedia images by type">Category:Wikipedia images by type</a> which should probably be under <a href="../../../i/m/a/Category%7EImages_of_people_74b8.html" title="Category:Images of people">Category:Images of people</a>, instead of above it or along side of it in the category tree. To put an image or category into <a href="../../../i/m/a/Category%7EImages_of_people_74b8.html" title="Category:Images of people">Category:Images of people</a>, edit that page and add [[Category:Images of people]] near the bottom (above any interlanguage links). When you do this, you will see the image appear under <b>Articles in category "Images of people"</b> (possibly not on the first page, depending on the letter of the alphabet it starts with). Notice in <a href="../../../i/m/a/Category%7EImages_of_people_74b8.html" title="Category:Images of people">Category:Images of people</a> there are some people who appear <i>above</i> this header. This is because someone put a link to the image in the category page, instead of putting a link to the category on the image page. Go to the category page and hit "edit", and you will see what needs to be removed. You can add those images to the category using the correct method, or you can do the move-to-Commons thing if appropriate. If you have more than say, 50 "fair use" images of people left over in <a href="../../../i/m/a/Category%7EImages_of_people_74b8.html" title="Category:Images of people">Category:Images of people</a>, it's best to sort them into subcategories. You can make a new category by simply pretending it exists and adding an image to it. After you save that, follow the "red" link you just made. Edit the new category and put in a link to the "parent" category you want it to have. This will turn the links to it blue, because now it has a description page. (You may have to hit reload/refresh in your browser to see the color change.) I hope that all makes sense...probably it will be clearer after you read the tips page and figure out what the different copyright licenses mean.

<p>I think it died out because most people want to edit articles on their own clubs - there just weren't enough articles that a lot of people wanted to work on to make it worthwhile. If you think there are enough people who'd join in, by all means start it up again. I think it might work better at this stage if it was made completely informal and was kept to a discussion page where someone said "I'm working on (article): anyone want to join in?", but it's up to you. <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Yemen flag large.png">Image:Yemen flag large.png</a> <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECantthinkofagoodname_4422.html" title="User:Cantthinkofagoodname">CTOAGN</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECantthinkofagoodname_1ff5.html" title="User talk:Cantthinkofagoodname">talk</a>) 17:49, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aabha, I think it might be a good idea to make the AID fortnightly rather than weekly until it gets going properly. It was fortnightly first time round IIRC. <a href="../../../o/l/d/User%7EOldelpaso_61eb.html" title="User:Oldelpaso">Oldelpaso</a> 11:48, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'll have a stab at writing about fenerbahce. their history is going to have to be written by someone else cos i dont know too much about it, but i'll improve the whole thing as much as possible, making it npov, inproving factual accuracy and making it a better article as a while. i hope that helps! <a href="../../../z/b/z/User%7EZbzdhbafr_9e3f.html" title="User:Zbzdhbafr">Zbzdhbafr</a> 14:35, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hey mate, i added a bit to the Fenerbahce page. I added some stuff to the talk list so I suggest you have a look at it. I am also about to make some changes to it in the next hour thhat will make the page a bit similar to the page i did on trabzonspor. Im doing this cos i think it makes the page look more interesting and nicer.

<p>well done with the squad table. it doesn't really look like a list and provides more than simple information so i am more than happy with it. i'm thinking about doing it for the rest of the turkish football teams now i've seen how it works. if i can help any more or with anything else i'll be glad to give you a hand. <a href="../../../z/b/z/User%7EZbzdhbafr_9e3f.html" title="User:Zbzdhbafr">Zbzdhbafr</a> 17:47, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I checked the differences in tr and en versions of Fenerbahçe. You've cleaned much of Fenerbahçe, as you see it was written very fanatically. In the Turkish version only extra information is, about history of the club. Much of it is about pre-club history and about first years. May be its best to translate the headings in tr.wiki <a href="../../../../tr/f/e/n/Fenerbah%C3%A7e_Spor_Kul%C3%BCb%C3%BC_e4b3.html" class="extiw" title="tr:Fenerbahçe_Spor_Kulübü">tr:Fenerbahçe Spor Kulübü</a>

<p>Hi there Aabha. I haven't ever really looked at the AID for football before. I'm going to add it to my page so that I can monitor it, though. Let's see what we can do with this project.

<p>Thanks for the heads up about the football project. I'll see if i have time to join in soon. Wont be possible for at least three weeks though but then i'll probably join in. As for the fenerbahce article i cant think of any immediate improvements to make apart from a better layered article on the history from 1960-2005, which i'll do as soon as i have time to do so.

Ok. I see what you're saying about the talk page. But the thing is that no one has to go to the talk page to do a minor edit. If both talk page and main page has it then firstly, it attracts faid as a whole and the fact the article is up for being improved which means the potential for more work to be done. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingjeff_8e3f.html" title="User:Kingjeff">Kingjeff</a> 00:19, 10 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Aabha</p>
<p>For the patterns, have a look at <a href="../../../f/o/o/Template_talk%7EFootball_kit_ba82.html" title="Template talk:Football kit">Template_talk:Football_kit</a>. la1 is the left arm, b1 is the body and ra1 is the right arm for the first choice kit. la2, b2 and ra2 are those for the away kit. The different patterns that you can use are listed at Template_talk:Football_kit, or you can leave them all blank if the kit is unpatterned (no stripes etc.). The other fields use <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_colours.html#Hex_triplet" title="Web colours">hex triplets</a> to give a colour for different parts of the kit. If you don't understand hexadecimal notation, you probably don't want to (it's counting to base 16 using A-F to represent 10-15 and "10" for 16, not that that will explain it), so the easiest thing is to copy one of the colour values from further down that page or find a club with a similarly coloured kit and copy the value that's used there. And thanks again for your message on my RFA. I was flattered.

<p>Hi, I had a look on the other images and changed the tagging from "copyrighted free use" (wich basicaly means that people can do whatever they like with them) to the more apropriate "fair use in XXX" tag + a withpermission tag. Just because we have permission to show the image doesn't mean anyone can do whatever they want with it after all. I deleted the image you asked me to, but things tagged with "orphanded fair use" automaticaly show up on <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~gmaxwell/cgi-bin/report_orphan_fair_use.py" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~gmaxwell/cgi-bin/report_orphan_fair_use.py" rel="nofollow">this list</a> after a week, so there is generaly no rush, they will be dealth with a in a timely fashon. --<a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7ESherool_fe99.html" title="User:Sherool">Sherool</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../s/h/e/User_talk%7ESherool_9233.html" title="User talk:Sherool">(talk)</a></span> 14:36, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
