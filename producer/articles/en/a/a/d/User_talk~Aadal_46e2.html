<dd>Hi, Thank you for your encouragement. I did take a look at the Ancient Tamil music earlier and I think I also made some minor edits there. It is, in my view, already a well written article with a wealth of info. Key points from your <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Tamil_music_99f6.html" title="Ancient Tamil music">Ancient Tamil music</a> must find a place in the Carnatic music article as well. I'll certainly take a look at the Ancient Tamil music article again offer my suggestions. Thank you for writing such a nice piece on Tamil music. Dr. V.P.K. Sundaram had written a lot on the Tamil music. --<a href="../../../a/a/d/User%7EAadal_77f5.html" title="User:Aadal">Aadal</a> 04:55, 27 July 2006 (UTC)Aadal</dd>

<p>Hello aadal. I saw the dispute in the carnatic music article and thought we could join hands and do some work on it to remove the POVs and get more facts in. I saw that <a href="../../../i/m/p/User%7EImpuMozhi_e030.html" title="User:ImpuMozhi">ImpuMozhi</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenu62_2094.html" title="User:Venu62">Parthi</a> are also interested.

<p>Hello Aadal. I see you mention literature as one of your interests.

Unfortunately, it hasn't gotten anywhere much, although the article on the <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sangam_landscape.html" title="Sangam landscape">akathinais</a> has improved somewhat as part of the effort. Is this something you think you could be actively involved in?

<p>Hi, Instead wasting our time arguing with ignoramus on the Carnatic music talk page, it will be constructive to start on the History of Carnatic music article. If we can write the facts with appropriate citation, there won't he any dipute regarding this. - <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenu62_2094.html" title="User:Venu62">Parthi</a> 22:18, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/d/User_talk%7EAadal_46e2.html" title="Edit section: Temples of Belur and Halebidu">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Temples of Belur and Halebidu</span></h2>
<p>Dear Aadal, The temples of Belur and Halebidu are not exactly in runis. Let me explain.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Belur Chennakeshava temple was built by King Vishnuvardhana in 1117 CE to commomorate his victory against the Cholas. It apparently took over 80 years to complete it and it was completed. There are several smaller shrines in Belur complex. This temple again looks in fine shape to a common man's eyes, except experts know that the vimanas over the garbhagriha collapsed as this is a common mode of failure due to age.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly due to gravity. There was some damage in the Khilji invasion but later was restored by the Vijayanagar rulers. The main Rayagopura which is actually a dravida style was added by Vijayanagar Kings as they patronised the diety at Belur. There has been lots of vandalism of statues over the years though, but thats India.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Hoysaleshwara temple was built by his commander Katamalla in 1121. When we say built by, it means commissioned by. It took over 120 years for this one which was not completed for some reason. This issue of completion is actually something only experts can identify, not the eyes of common tourists. Meaning its not obvious. There are other fine temples in the vicinity like Kedareshwara temple and two Jain Basadi.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Hoysaleashwara temple suffered to some extent also in the Khilji invasion and also lost the vimanas either due to age or invasion and has been subject to vandalism. However, a tourist will normally be obvlivious to all this simply because of the remaining grandeur. The Kedareshwara temple built by King Veera Balla II (VishnuVardhana's grandson) partially collapsed possibly due to shifts in earth below. It looks great now though aftersome rework. It is common for later kings to add to work done by earlier ones. If you visit these places you will forget all about the invasion and just enjoy. If some rework looks shabby its because we dont have the artists now and have been slowly loosing the artistry that the artists used to have in those days. Thats why in places you see where ASI has done some rework, it looks shabby.</p>

<li>Hi, just to add to your interesting conversation. About the 'incomplete' nature of the temples, am not totally sure how 'incomplete' it is. Let me tell you what i remember from what a professional guide told me when i was there years ago. In both the temples, you will find many places where, for example, on a panel you may find some empty(unsculpted) space. the guide told me that these spaces were deliberately left unsculpted because it was meant to throw a challenge to anybody. if a sculptor felt that his work was a marvel, he would leave the adjoining space 'open' or 'uncarved'. it meant that anybody could accept the challenge and if possible sculpt a better figure. but obviously, as the empty spaces indicate, nobody took up the challenge and hence we find the empty spaces.</li>
<li>That is one explanation. that explains the empty spaces in seemingly complete panels. but i also remember the guide pointing to some unsculpted portions and said that it was like that because they didnt find time to finish the sculpting because of invasions.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<p>that was my 2 cents. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarvagnya_680d.html" title="User:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 05:23, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hi. It is very hard to deal with those two unreasonable users. I have been trying my best. However I think the only solution now is to seek some kind of arbitration. Sundar is an admin and has always been very helpful. You can also seek input from Arvind and a few other experienced users with knowledge of Carnatic music. My drawback is that I don't have an in-depth knowledge in this. I can help in maintaining neutrality. - <a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenu62_2094.html" title="User:Venu62">Parthi</a> <sup><em><a href="../../../v/e/n/User_talk%7EVenu62_1eef.html" title="User talk:Venu62">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Venu62_e0c1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Venu62">contribs</a></em></sup> 21:50, 13 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hi Aadal. There are two ways out now. One is both parties agreeing to <a href="../../../m/e/d/WP%7EMEDCAB_20f1.html" title="WP:MEDCAB">mediation</a> and draft a consensus version in the talk page before effecting the change in the article space.

<dd>One of the forum threads is on the current dispute on the Carnatic music article. He says:</dd>

<dd>One user "Aadal" is trying to prove that Carnatic Music came out of Ancient Tamil Music, based on musical descriptions in works like Silappathikaram etc. He is supported by another user called Venu62. Together they want to depict that Carnatic Music is 80% Ancient Tamil Music by engaging in an edit-war.</dd>

</dd>

<dl>
<dd>

<dd>I (and some 4-5 others) have been trying to say that while CM (or Indian Classical Music as it is known before the Carnatic-Hindustani split) has some similarities with ATM, they are not the same and one is not descended from the other. Rather they have both influenced each other to an extent. I have cited the Natya Shastra, Sangeeta Ratnakara etc as being the treatises that Carnatic Music (and Hindustani) consider authoritative, not Silappathikaram or other Tamil Sangam Literature. I have been stating that this doesnt mean Tamil composers dont belong to Carnatic Music, but that some ancient ones "did not originally compose in Carnatic Music" but their compositions were later set to classical music. It has taken the usual Tamil vs Sanskrit turn although I have mentioned that Gopalakrishna Bharathi, Oothukadu Venkatasubbier are among well known Carnatic composers who have composed in Tamil.</dd>

<p>Hi Aadal, I can help you in any way I can, however when the arbitration starts and when questions are raised you should be available to counter them. So if you are going to be busy for a while, then my suggestion is to get into the arbitration process when the timeis right. cheers -<a href="../../../v/e/n/User%7EVenu62_2094.html" title="User:Venu62">Parthi</a> <sup><em><a href="../../../v/e/n/User_talk%7EVenu62_1eef.html" title="User talk:Venu62">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Venu62_e0c1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Venu62">contribs</a></em></sup> 03:30, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, one way to resolve this problem is to write about the contribution of ancient Tamil literature (such as Sangam) in the formation of modern pan Indian literray forms as a seperate, referenced article. If it is properly done and there is consensus about it then link it to the main article such as Carnatic music. Once it is there for a while you can add a sub section on it and ad a summary of your creation in the main page. Always patience on these matters work but start with your own article first with proper references. This is my suugestion. If you need any help let me know. Thanks <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaveenS_7d61.html" title="User:RaveenS">RaveenS</a></p>

<dd>I will look at that page to see if there is systematic vandalism. But a separate article is probably needed if current editors of that article in question are unable to see a fit through regualr edits. At least that's what I have done, created content where there was non before.

<dd>It is systematic vandalism by a few editors who are dead-against Tamil, but the claim is content dispute. While I and a few other editors are for inclusive approach based on hard facts, a few editors are systematically against tamil and they want t0 and do exclude tamil and tamil-related info. WP should not be a place for displaying hatred for Tamil or for that matter any particular group. --<a href="../../../a/a/d/User%7EAadal_77f5.html" title="User:Aadal">Aadal</a> 17:37, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You have some work to do, you need to find the references for what you are adding. Find those references and anyone removing them is a straight forward vandal or bigot or both. You should have at least a week to do it. <a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERaveenS_7d61.html" title="User:RaveenS">RaveenS</a></dd>

<dd>I think my work is done on the page, the origin theories is properly referenced and baed on it the body of the article can develop in an inclusive way. Like someone else suggested you may have to write a comprehensive article on the History of Carnatic music as a seperate article and then link it eventually. Given this I am going back to my macabre task of giving a face to all those dead, dying or going to surely die <a href="../../../s/r/i/Sri_Lankan_Tamils_46e3.html" title="Sri Lankan Tamils">Sri Lankan Tamils</a> for the time being.

<p>I am going to remove most of the Template:Fact tags you put into Kannada page. Please read the citations that follow carefully before putting tags. In wikipedia, sometimes multiple sentences are clubbed into one citation for presentaton, so you have to read the cited web link or take the trouble to buy the book the citation comes from. One cant provide a citation for every word. Hope you understand this considering you are not new to wikipedia.<a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">Dineshkannambadi</a> 03:17, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>sure, i will keep a watch on all tamil, tamils related articles. natkeeran brought this issue to the attention of users in tamil wikipedia and also alerted arvind, sundar - the original main contributors of the article.

<p>Hi. I saw the edit you made and wanted to remark on that. While the map does not show the extent of Hoysala Empire at its peak, the LEAD tried to convey the message. If you read through the article you will see in citation15/16 and 17 what the lead was trying to convey. Srirangam which is pretty much in central Tamil Nadu was the Hoysala provincial headquarters around 1245. During this time, Even the Pandyas paid tribute to the Hoysalas and this is why the lead said "most parts of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhrapradesh" (which you altered referring to the map perhaps). I hope this resolves the confusion on the issue. If I can get hold of a map that shows Hoysala territory in 1250-1300 time frame I will upload it.Thanks<a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDineshkannambadi_c09f.html" title="User:Dineshkannambadi">Dineshkannambadi</a> 02:57, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
