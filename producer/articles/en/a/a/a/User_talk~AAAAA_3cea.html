<p>I placed the potential vanity tag there because it addresses a more specific problem than simply "cleanup." However, I respect your opinion that it is not, in fact, potential vanity; I would be interested to see what other users have to say as to whether or not I applied the tag properly. As for the page itself, I'm not certain if Ms. Easley meets the standards for notability, but again, I refer the question to the larger WP community. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHanson_59b8.html" title="User:PaulHanson">Paul</a> 04:30, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The story of this article is as follows. I had NEVER heard of this Annie Easley in my life, until one day my daughter came home with an assignment from school. It was during the African American day or African American week or something like that. She had to make an article about an important African American personality. One of the names in the list was Annie Easley. I am not sure if she chose to do that one or if it was assigned to her. My daughter asked for my help because she tried to locate references on the Internet and she couldn't find many. I told her to check in Wikipedia and there was no article, or if there was there was not much info on it. So, I helped her find some references on the Internet, and then also decided to start (or improve) the article about Annie Easley in Wikipedia and did some work on it gathering information from different sources I could find (very few at the time). I guess that if she was on a list of "important African American people" given to my daughter at school, then the people there are notable enough for a good portion of the population (African American people), which in turn means that those people are notable enough to be in Wikipedia. I would also recommend to <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHanson_59b8.html" title="User:PaulHanson">User:PaulHanson</a> and others like him not to be so "trigger happy" and avoid converting "clean-ups" into "destroy-ups" if they don't know enough about the subject. It is not nice to see our work of hours destroyed because somebody "thought" it was vanity or whatever. Regarding the question about the "potential vanity" tag, it is my opinion that it should be use when there are strong signs that the author of the article is writing about himself, when there are no other references to that person on the internet(not the case of Annie Easley...you can find several school essays posted on the Internet about her) and when the editor has no ID or has not written about any other article that that one--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 06:01, 22 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>AAAAA, I've tried to add some information to make the significance of Annie Easley more clear to younger readers or those from countries outside the USA. I don't know how well I have succeeded. I'm a middle aged white male and I've lived in the NW United States most of my life, so I'm not the most well-informed person about life as a black female in the 1940's and 1950's in Alabama and Ohio. It was interesting to read her oral history. Thank you for bringing it to my attention. -<a href="../../../w/s/i/User%7EWsiegmund_987c.html" title="User:Wsiegmund">Walter Siegmund</a> 06:46, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hey there, please don't just plop a protected tag into an article. You probably don't realize this, but just placing the tag in the article doesn't actually protect it -- only an administrator can do that; it requires a special button to be pushed. However, it gives that appearance, when in fact it's not true. The template is only intended to tell people, once the actual protection is done, that it's been protected. If there's a problem on a page and you think it needs to be protected, you should request an administrator review the page at <a href="../../../r/f/p/WP%7ERFP_c43d.html" title="WP:RFP">requests for protection</a>.

<p>Hello there! a ew user in Wikipedia started a whole war against my person in this topic. I have reverted most of his editions (most of them were clearly Ecuadorian POV), and now that he does not have many resources to use in his favor has starting to attack my person. He now claims that I'm the problem. Cheers! and see if you can help me. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 03:00, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>You say all links are helpful, but somehow I believe if I posted a link to our website it would be promptly removed. We have rates that are as competitive as bankrate.com and bankcd.com, but we don't make our income from ads, we make ours from transaction fees. I would even suggest that for that very reason we are even more accountable to the investors. If they don't get what we promised them, then they won't pay us. So please tell me why these ad based sites get a link, and ours doesn't?--Cdduncan 21:43, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

Your contributions to Lilian Cristina Aya Ramirez have been deleted (not by me&#160;:-) per <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> (all criticism of living persons must be well-sourced), and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, which says blogs aren't usually reliable sources. I've searched the intenet and <i>El Universal</i>, looking for reliable sources for the important information from Reconocelos, but have found nothing. I'm not very good at searches in Spanish, and don't know the press in Peru; perhaps that is the best place to look. I hope you're able to help locate information from a reliable source, so the information can be returned to the article. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandyGeorgia_1007.html" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy</a> 18:28, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Hola, AAAAA. I have to agree with others that Reconocelos.com can not be used to support information in a <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">biography of a living person</a>, as it does not meet the criteria for a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. I have no doubt the information is true, and I'm sure a journalist will report on it eventually. The truth has a way of coming out: patience is in order here. In the meantime, if you want to help out on the Venezuelan front, your input is much needed on the talk pages of other articles like <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez_ab88.html" title="Hugo Chávez">Hugo Chávez</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Hugo_Ch%C3%A1vez_233d.html" title="Criticism of Hugo Chávez">Criticism of Hugo Chávez</a>, <a href="../../../s/%C3%BA/m/S%C3%BAmate.html" title="Súmate">Súmate</a>, and <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel-Venezuela_relations_d707.html" title="Israel-Venezuela relations">Israel-Venezuela relations</a>.

<dd>Well, If that is the case then I think this dispute is a little absurd: It has been widely accepted that they should be called "Shinning Path"/"Sendero Luminoso".

<li>Mr. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDescendall_348e.html" title="User:Descendall">Descendall</a>: I am inclined to think that Almasakin is your SOCKPUPPET. How else would you have noted the comment I placed to Almasakin? Furthermore, your reaction was really low and you "accused" me of something that has absolutely no basis, while my question to your apparent sockpuppet was totally valid, since only Shining Path terrorists refer to this terrorist Abimael Guzman as "Presidente Gonzalo". Even if you are part or have been a member of Shining Path, or just simpatize with them, I still cannot understand why can't you see that both Abimael Guzman and Shining Path are evil terrorists, and why do you like to whitewash and/or protect them so much. Don't you already know how much suffering they caused in tens of thousands of Peruvians by bombing or killing them? Or do you sincerely think that Abimael Guzman and Shining Path is totally innocent?--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 04:26, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

You should actually read <a href="../../../h/a/v/Have_you_stopped_beating_your_wife__d50f.html" title="Have you stopped beating your wife?">have you stopped beating your wife?</a>. If you do, you'll see that you are using what is known as the fallacy of many questions. This is a question which contains an unproven premise, and thus leads to an unsound conclusion. Questions such as "why do you enjoy killing innocent people" or "have you stopped beating your wife" are prime examples of this fallacy. I probably can't explain it any better than the article can, so I suggest that you read it.

<p>Hello, I'm sorry it's been awhile, but I recently agreed to mediate that case. Please either accept or reject me as a mediator there, and if you accept, please let me know if you would prefer public or <a href="../../../m/e/d/Wikipedia%7EMediation_eaa9.html#Why_should_mediation_be_confidential.3F" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">private</a> mediation. Also, assuming you are still interested in mediation, please watchlist the page if you haven't already.
