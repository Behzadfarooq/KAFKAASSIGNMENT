<p>The Northern Region was originally made of four districts which were based primarily on geographic location. They were the <b>AAA Great Falls District</b>, the <b>AAA Gunston District</b>, the <b>AAA Northern District</b>, and the <b>AAA Potomac District</b>. The Northern Region had these districts from at least the 1967-1968 school year, and these districts served the region until the 1993-1994 school year.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/a/AAA_Northern_Region_4542.html" title="Edit section: Current District Names">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Current District Names</span></h4>
<p>The four current district names (Concorde, Liberty, National, Patriot) were adopted in the 1993-1994 school based on which division (5 or 6) of football they played in. The Concorde and Patriot Districts held Division 6 schools which are larger AAA schools; the Liberty and National Districts held only Division 5 schools which are smaller AAA schools.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/a/AAA_Northern_Region_4542.html" title="Edit section: Attempted Realignment of 2005">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Attempted Realignment of 2005</span></h4>
<p>The Northern Region realigned its districts once again in 2005 to equalize opportunities, in particular for football, for both the Division 6 and the Division 5 members due to membership changes and enrollment shifts since 1993. Again, the Liberty and National were to hold Division 5 schools and the Concorde and Patriot to hold Division 6. The alignment failed however due to South County Secondary School's opening which turned Hayfield into a Division 5 school in the Patriot District.</p>
<p>The reconfigured Northern Region overall has not changed the membership of most districts considerably, but some school rivalries have been thrown off by it because of district changes, including Fairfax/Woodson, Lake Braddock/Robinson, Stone Bridge/Broad Run, and Loudoun Valley/<a href="../../../l/o/u/Loudoun_County_High_School_0e6e.html" title="Loudoun County High School">Loudoun County</a>.</p>

<p>In 2005, Loudoun Valley and Stone Bridge, members of the <a href="../../../a/a/_/AA_Dulles_District_c86a.html" title="AA Dulles District">AA Dulles District</a> were moved to the AAA Northern Region due to enrollment increases in the schools. The Northern Region originally tried to keep both schools away from the region, but the VHSL forced them to accept the two Loudoun County schools anyway. Loudoun schools Broad Run, Park View, and Potomac Falls were Northern Region members before, but they joined before a 2001 VHSL provision was passed which would allow schools to play down a class due to transportation hardships, which both the Loudoun schools and the Northern Region used as a reason to keep its geography within Fairfax County. Both Loudoun schools attempted to remain in AA using transportation difficulties as a reason, but the plan failed because the VHSL did not believe either school's location warranted such a request. Thus, Loudoun Valley and Stone Bridge were forced to join the Northern Region, with Valley receiving an exemption to become a playoff only member of the National District and Stone Bridge joining the Liberty in all sports.</p>

<p>The only change made in the Northern Region was for Loudoun Valley to move to the <a href="../../../a/a/a/AAA_Cedar_Run_District_03a1.html" title="AAA Cedar Run District">AAA Cedar Run District</a> and the <a href="../../../a/a/a/AAA_Northwest_Region_b6c9.html" title="AAA Northwest Region">AAA Northwest Region</a> in the 2007-2009 playing cycle. This move was welcomed by member schools due to its location in western Loudoun County. This did split Loudoun County's AAA schools to two different regions however, with Stone Bridge remaining in the Liberty District which is not as distant from most members.</p>

In the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a> Hammond and GW were reassigned as middle schools.</p>

<p>From 1996-1999, <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broad_Run_High_School_1e8c.html" title="Broad Run High School"><b>Broad Run High School</b></a> of Ashburn and <a href="../../../p/a/r/Park_View_High_School_%28Sterling%2C_Virginia%29_756f.html" title="Park View High School (Sterling, Virginia)"><b>Park View High School</b></a> of Sterling were admitted to the Northern Region in the Liberty District. <a href="../../../p/o/t/Potomac_Falls_High_School_e5ec.html" title="Potomac Falls High School"><b>Potomac Falls High School</b></a> of Sterling opened in 1997 and was also a member of the Northern Region as a member of the Concorde District from 1997 until 1999.</p>
<p>Broad Run and Park View considered petitioning the Virginia High School League at the time to stay in the <a href="../../../a/a/_/AA_Northwestern_District_ddde.html" title="AA Northwestern District">AA Northwestern District</a> where they originally played, but went ahead with the move anyway after hearing suggestions from parents from student-athletes and <a href="../../../l/o/u/Loudoun_County_Public_Schools_39fa.html" title="Loudoun County Public Schools">Loudoun County Public Schools</a> superintendent Edgar Hatrick. In fact, Broad Run's and Park View's move to AAA received much support from parents in particular because they actually had to travel less to schools in Fairfax County rather than drive out to AA schools in Fauquier, Warren and Frederick Counties, all of which are at least an hour drive away from eastern Loudoun County. In 1999, all three schools dropped back to Group AA and returned to the Northwestern District because their enrollment numbers dropped significantly due to Potomac Falls' opening.</p>
<p>Though these schools have not been in AAA ever since, their stint in AAA has encouraged Loudoun County schools to sponsor more teams at the varsity level, including swimming, lacrosse, and gymnastics, which were not offered at the AA level in the 1990s. Loudoun County high schools at the time complained of not having athletic facilities up to par compared with Fairfax County schools. However, since Loudoun County has grown extensively and built five new high schools after Potomac Falls, the vast majority of Loudoun County high schools have state of the art athletic facilities.</p>

<p>Though most schools are placed in the same district as their primarily rival school's, the Northern Region's small size has allowed many of its members to have heated rivalries, many which involve two schools in different districts. Below is a list of notable Northern Region rivalries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Centreville/Chantilly/Westfield
<ul>
<li><i>These three schools in western Fairfax County share a heated rivalry with one another</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fairfax/Woodson</li>
<li>Falls Church/Stuart</li>
<li>Hayfield/T.C. Williams
<ul>
<li><i>Fueled by the recent success of both school's basketball programs and their proximity</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Herndon/South Lakes
<ul>
<li><i>A very heated rivalry since South Lakes opened in 1978, which split Reston into two schools.</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lake Braddock/Robinson
<ul>
<li><i>One of the most heated rivalries in Fairfax County and Northern Virginia with the state's two largest schools.</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lake Braddock/West Springfield</li>
<li>Langley/McLean
<ul>
<li><i>One of, if not the most heated rivalry in all of Virginia. Students from these two schools hate each other with a passion. Their extremely close proximity, and their students' affluent competitive background, fuels this cross-town rivalry.</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lee/West Springfield</li>
<li>Loudoun Valley/Stone Bridge
<ul>
<li><i>Loudoun County's two AAA schools play each other in every sport despite being split apart into different districts and also split from their traditional rivals who are in AA.</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Madison/Marshall</li>
<li>Madison/Oakton
<ul>
<li><i>Cross-town rivals, although not in the same district.</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wakefield/Washington-Lee/Yorktown
<ul>
<li><i>Arlington County's rivalry</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
