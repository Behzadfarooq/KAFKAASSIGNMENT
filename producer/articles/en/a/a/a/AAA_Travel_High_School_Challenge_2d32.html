	    <p>The <b>AAA Travel High School Challenge</b> (sometimes shortened to <b>AAA Travel Challenge</b>) is an annual travel-themed scholarship competition run by the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Automobile_Association_4c7a.html" title="American Automobile Association">American Automobile Association</a>, open to students in grades 9-12 in the fifty <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and the <a href="../../../d/i/s/District_of_Columbia_9454.html" title="District of Columbia">District of Columbia</a>. First run in 2003 as part of AAA's centennial celebrations, the competition has now become an annual event and a premier high school scholarship program.</p>
<p>The National Finals are held in Orlando, Florida. Each year the contest has awarded over $150,000 in scholarships. The 2007 competition will feature a $20,000 top prize (down from $25,000 in past years). In addition, the 2007 competition will, for the first time, also include a separate essay contest for those interested in seeking majors in travel-, tourism-, or hospitality-related careers.</p>
<p>Often compared to the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_Bee_0854.html" title="National Geographic Bee">National Geographic Bee</a>, a middle-school competition, the AAA Travel Challenge features a similar format, with a local, state, and national level, each with progressively tougher questions and material.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/a/AAA_Travel_High_School_Challenge_2d32.html" title="Edit section: Procedure">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Procedure</span></h2>
<p>(Changes in format to the 2007 Competition from previous years are in <b>bold</b>)</p>
<p><a name="Registration" id="Registration"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/a/AAA_Travel_High_School_Challenge_2d32.html" title="Edit section: Registration">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Registration</span></h3>
<p>The competition begins in December, when registration on the <a href="http://www.aaa.com/TravelChallenge/enroll.html" class="external text" title="http://www.aaa.com/TravelChallenge/enroll.html" rel="nofollow">AAA Travel Challenge Official Site</a> opens. Eligible students can apply and create a unique username and password which they will later use for the Stage One Internet test. <b>Students may also indicate if they desire to participate in the travel career-related Essay Competition.</b></p>
<p>A student may, at any time, take a Practice Test offered on the Official Site, which gives a general sampling of questions that may appear.</p>
<p><a name="Stage_One:_Internet_Test" id="Stage_One:_Internet_Test"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/a/AAA_Travel_High_School_Challenge_2d32.html" title="Edit section: Stage One: Internet Test">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Stage One: Internet Test</span></h3>
<p>For a specified period of time in January (usually 8-10 days), the Official Site will run the Stage One qualifying test. After students enter their unique user name and password, they will then proceed to the test.</p>
<p>The test consists of 40 multiple-choice travel-themed questions to be completed in <b>15</b> minutes time (a countdown clock is visible throughout the test). No two tests are alike, as the questions are picked from a pool of several thousand questions, with each test being "weighted" with an equal number of easy, medium, and hard questions. Neither reference materials (printed or electronic) nor help from another person is allowed, and this is agreed to when a student checks the "Integrity Oath" box during registration.</p>
<p>Questions have to do with destinations popular with American tourists, with most questions centering around the United States and foreign destinations such as Europe and East Asia.</p>
<p>The top five scorers in each state will advance to Stage Two. In the event of a tie, <b>the student(s) who used the least amount of time to answer questions will advance</b>. If a tie still exists, then, like in previous years, a random drawing will determine who advances. These Top Five are usually notified 1-2 weeks after the testing period ends via e-mail. If one of the five is unable to continue, or if nothing is heard from after 72 hours of the notification e-mail being sent, then the next highest scorer will be notified.</p>
<p><a name="Stage_Two:_The_State_Test" id="Stage_Two:_The_State_Test"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/a/AAA_Travel_High_School_Challenge_2d32.html" title="Edit section: Stage Two: The State Test">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Stage Two: The State Test</span></h3>
<p>Once all five in each state and D.C. have been confirmed (255 across the nation), each student will be sent an information packet with instructions for Stage Two.</p>
<p>Stage Two is another 40 multiple-choice question, <b>15</b> minute test, this time, however, written and taken at the nearest AAA Office nearest to the contestant's home. The test is monitored by a AAA Official. The time period for taking the test is usually three days in March, and arrangements (through AAA) must be made with the office at which the test will be taken.</p>
<p>Questions again focus on tourist destinations, but this time become more global in nature and slightly more obscure. It is unknown whether tests are the same throughout the nation or if each state or even each individual receives different tests, like Stage One.</p>
<p>The winner, the top scorer of the five in each state, is notified approximately one week after the testing period finishes. If the winner is unable to proceed, then the next highest scorer is notified. In the event of a tie for the top score, a random drawing determines the winner.</p>

<p>The National Finals are a four-day event usually held in early to mid May. Each of the 51 Stage Two Winners and one chaperone per finalist are awarded an all-expenses paid trip to <a href="../../../o/r/l/Orlando%2C_Florida_6d05.html" title="Orlando, Florida">Orlando</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>, for the competition.

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/a/a/AAA_Travel_High_School_Challenge_2d32.html" title="Edit section: Phase One: The Preliminary Test">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Phase One: The Preliminary Test</span></h4>
<p>The first phase is a preliminary test taken by all 51 finalists, usually in a conference room held at a sponsor hotel. The test is once again a monitored 40-question multiple choice written test to be completed in <b>15</b> minutes. Questions at this level are at their hardest yet, focusing mostly on global destinations, some familiar, but most obscure.</p>
<p><a name="Phase_Two:_The_Team_Rounds_.282003-2006.29" id="Phase_Two:_The_Team_Rounds_.282003-2006.29"></a></p>

<p>The Top 12 scorers, with random drawings acting as tiebreakers, advanced to the second phase of the competition. These finalists were usually announced about 30 minutes after testing had completed. Afterwards the twelve finalists stayed for a briefing and practice round, as all were later released to enjoy Orlando.</p>
<p>The next day the 12 remaining contestants as well as the 39 other finalists and families gathered for the Final Round, usually at <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Orlando_ddb2.html" title="Universal Orlando">Universal Orlando</a> (this competition was sometimes open to the public). The 12 Finalists had been divided into four teams of three contestants each. Three game-show style rounds were conducted. The first featured two teams versus each other. The second put the other two teams against each other. The winners of each of these rounds advanced to a final head-to-head round.</p>
<p>A round lasted 20 minutes, and featured these types of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Gateway Questions</b> - worth 20 points, these were toss-up questions that could be answered by any team member buzzing in. If a contestant answered incorrectly, 20 points were deducted from the team's score, and the other team was then given a chance to answer. Team members were not allowed to consult with each other.</li>
<li><b>Add-On Questions</b> - posed to a team once one of their team members had answered a Gateway Question correctly. The question was divided into three parts, with each part worth ten points (e.g. "Name the three North American national capital cities with the word 'City' in their name"). Team members were allowed to consult with each other, and no points were deducted for an incorrect response.</li>
<li><b>Upgrade Questions</b> - a special kind of add-on, where teams could significantly increase their point total. Before the question was posed, the team was given a category to which the question pertained. The team then could wager up to 100 or their total number of points, whichever was lower. If the question was answered correctly, the team was awarded that number of points. An incorrect answer deducted that number of points from the team's score.</li>
</ul>
<p>The winner of the round was the team with the highest score. The team competition was discontinued in 2007.</p>

<p>The third phase was an individual competition introduced for the 2006 Challenge. The twelve finalists were brought back out and are assigned a random order to sit in on the stage. Each contestant was then asked a question, one by one, by moderator Dr. Marc Mancini. In a manner similar to the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Spelling_Bee_dbb0.html" title="National Spelling Bee">National Spelling Bee</a>, if the student answered correctly, he advanced to the next round. If not, then the student was eliminated. If all the contestants in a round answered incorrectly, then all were brought back to participate in the next round.</p>
<p>The winner was the contestant who manages to answer his/her question correctly while everyone else in the round answered incorrectly. Such procedures allowed for ties for second and third place, as shown in the <a href="../../../a/a/a/AAA_Travel_High_School_Challenge_2d32.html#Champions" title="AAA Travel High School Challenge">results of the 2006 competition</a>.</p>
<p>After another day to enjoy Orlando, a banquet is held at the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hard_Rock_Cafe_d94d.html" title="Hard Rock Cafe">Hard Rock Live</a> that evening. Prizes are officially awarded as well as other miscellaneous closing remarks.</p>
