	    <p>Hi, Aaarrrggh. There isn't anything obviously wrong with your attempted edits on the Atheism page. However, if you study the history of the article, you will see that this page has undergone about 500 edits over the past few months, mostly taking the form of edit/revert/edit/revert, precisely in the area which you are trying to edit; namely, the definition. The article was in "protected" status for 25 days as a cooling off period in the edit war, and just came off that status. Administrators are hanging back waiting to see if the editors can compromise or the article has to be protected again. Right now, progress is being made on the Talk page regarding the definition, and while that is happening, people are letting the current definition stand, despite an emerging consensus that it is not adequate. Please refrain from editing the main article and triggering a renewed edit-war. But, by all means, participate in the Talk page discussion where people are working hard to achieve a consensus. Incidentally, welcome to Wikipedia, and good luck with your future contributions!</p>
<p>P.S. I'm assuming this new user account isn't a <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppet.html" title="Sockpuppet">sockpuppet</a> for one of the parties to the current dispute, but if it is: surely you can't think that is going to work. Your efforts would be better directed toward the emerging compromise, which is close to succeeding.</p>

<dd>I disagree with the above comment, of course. Please read the debate before reverting, and add comments. I explained in detail why I thought the coincidence was relevant and <i>good</i> writing. I mention similar citations (SJ Gould essay and Scientific American columns) not as an appeal to authority, but simply as examples of writers generally considered good using examples of coicidences to illustrate a topic.</dd>

The shouting I think was fully justified by the fact that you have added this irrelevant information to the article on AT LEAST 16 separate occasions. It is consistently removed, and this is entirely due to the fact that it is out of place in an introduction to the life of Charles Darwin, and has no relevance whatsoever in the article. And what you have demonstrated above is exactly an appeal to authority. I am once again removing this information, and I will do so every single time you add it.</p>
<p>To better illustrate this point - imagine you know nothing about Darwin, and come to wikipedia to learn a little about him. You start reading the article and come across this point. To me, it would just seem like a baffling point that serves no purpose and teaches me nothing whatsoever about Darwin. It is such a tiny little piece of trivia, and I cannot understand why anybody could be so obssessed with it as to add it at least 17 times (as I see you have now re-inserted it once again). I will not stop removing it, simply because it is completely irrelevant, and teaches us nothing about Charles Darwin.</p>
<p>Oh, and thank you for your comments William. It's comforting in some way to know that I'm not the only one who is getting frustrated by the repeated insertion of such an irrelevant point. <a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAaarrrggh_8b86.html" title="User:Aaarrrggh">Aaarrrggh</a> 11:45, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If you knew nothing of Darwin, then associating him with Lincoln immediately and vividly will localize him in time for you. I'm not particularly obsessed with the fact (which I honestly do find interesting and appropriate) I'm offended by the deletions and the name calling that has accompanied them. It's not like I was repeating the false story of his death bed conversion, or for that matter the equally false story that he lost his faith because of his scientific discoveries. Oh, and shouting is never justified, you're just losing your temper. 16 times in a week is less than three times a day, so <i>I am</i> following the 3-revert rule.

<dd>I was certainly not involved in any name calling towards you. I appreciate the fact that the information you are adding is factually correct (and I have also noticed that you have added some perfectly relevant information to the article in the past), but the problem I have with it is not related to accuracy, it is related to relevance. And yes, I was shouting because I was losing my temper. This was justifiably so - the fact you are adding is simply not relevant, has been deleted numerous times by people other than myself, and is something you do not seem prepared to discard. Can you not see that it has no place in this encyclopedia article, and especially not in an introductory section regarding Darwin's early life. What does Abraham Lincoln have to do with Darwin's early life? Nothing. Do you see my point?&#160;::<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAaarrrggh_8b86.html" title="User:Aaarrrggh">Aaarrrggh</a> 13:16, 17 Dec 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>&lt;sigh&gt; That's why it's a coincidence, but it is still an interesting one. Unless you're british, and then you're insulted at having Darwin the Holy smeared by association with the evil Lincoln. (I'm Canadian BTW, not American.) Anyway we're in a tit-for-tat war, with you and others losing your tempers, resorting to shouting and expletives. I have developed my argument, I have given distinct reasons for keeping the mention, while you guys just keep repeating your "it's irrelevant" justification. Hey, I am not the only one to point this out.

<p>Hi! I just thought that I'd have a word about strategy/tactics on the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a> article. If the range of positions is from 10 (Ungtts) to -10 (you), then I suppose I'm somewhere about 8 or 9, but I'm trying my hardest to look for compromise over material without compromise of integrity. It's important to make edits that the pro-creationist can live with, just as it's important for them to make edits that you can live with; unless one side or the other digs its heels in and refuses to allow <i>any</i> compromise, that should lead to an article worthy of Wikipedia. The trouble is that if you're too gung ho about your position (whatever its merits), you risk pushing Ungtss into that kind of stubborn posture, and we're in for an edit war, with no winners. I'm not saying that that's happened yet — just giving a friendly warning not to get too hot under the collar. Not that I don't get that way myself sometimes, but I try to stave it off until there's no other useful response (it still doesn't do any good, but it doesn't do any harm either). <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis (<font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 18:13, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No problem Mel Etitis, although if you look at the recent post I made on the creationism talk page, I have just agreed (at least partly) with what Ungtss just said about not defining creationism as the 'rejection of science'. I made this edit only a few minutes ago, so you probably haven't seen it yet. By the way, when you say I'm -10 and you rate yourself as 8 or 9, do you mean to say you tend to favour the creationist arguments? I know this is largely irrelevant, as the majority of the changes you have made have been quite fair in my opinion (and I do admit I can become a little agressive sometimes, although I am trying hard to be as open as I can be. I believe my recent post on the creationism talk page reflects this), but I didn't have you down as a creationist advocate. Perhaps I just misunderstood your point above (placing me on the negative scale made me think you stood at 8 or 9 on the opposite end). I'm asking you this out of pure curiosity by the way, of course you don't actually have to reply if you don't want to. <a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAaarrrggh_8b86.html" title="User:Aaarrrggh">Aaarrrggh</a> 18:58, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(Reply to your message on my page:) it's a pleasure. In fact, on the whole Ungtss is one of the more civilised creationist types on Wikipedia, so that (even though discussions can get a bit heated at times), things are generally easier than with other articles. I'm planning to leave the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Talk%7ECreationism_6105.html" title="Talk:Creationism">Talk:Creationism</a> alone for a little while, until it's quietened down a bit; then I'll archive the firct part of the page. It's getting huge, which is part of the reason for all the edit conflicts — it takes so long to save an edit. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis (<font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 19:55, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do agree with you about Ungtss. We clearly disagree quite strongly in terms of our perspective, but I have to credit him for his overall attitude. One of my first experiences after having signed up to wikipedia was in taking a role in a very heated edit war on the atheism page. User samspade was trolling and determined to write about atheism from a christian perspective. In contrast to samspade, ungsst has been very civil and has at least taken part in dialogue and reasoning. I think it is partly because of the experience with mr. Spade that I came into the creationism article a little hot-headedely - I think I was expecting a similar experience. Anyway, hopefully with the likes of us and others (feloniousmonk for one), we will be able to make sure the article doesn't relapse back into anything like its former state. <a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAaarrrggh_8b86.html" title="User:Aaarrrggh">Aaarrrggh</a> 20:08, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I encourage the more rational (pro-science) people not to give up here or anywhere on this issue. It has been my policy throughout 45 or more years of scientific work to ignore astrology, flying-saucer advocacy, Uri Geller, The Bermuda Triangle, Chariots of the Gods, and such tripe, because the more attention you give them, the more prominent they become. A prime example was Velikovsky's <i>Worlds in Collision,</i> which Harlow Shapley tried to have suppressed, only looking like a martinet and aggrandizing Velikovsky as a martyr. There are BIG differences in the case of Creationism/Intelligent-Design. One is that we face not a small, scattered passle of nincompoops, but a number of well-organized fanatics. Next, they do not just publish newsstand and cheap bookstore potboilers, but they invade school boards and legislatures. Finally, and worst for the future of science, many of these people seem to be pretty intelligent and they read a lot of scientific matter, understanding it in part, but then warping it. The warps are subtle. For example, in seeing the original Wikipedia "liquefaction" entry I only noticed that it omitted the liquifaction of gases (Ammonia, Nitrogen, and so on, culminating with Heike Kamerlingh Onnes' Nobel Prize for Helium). I added a line about gases, but then saw comments and changes from Zeizmic and Vsmith (as I recall) who know more geology than I to the effect that a lot of the science was wrong. Thus the original author appears to have partly digested some geology materials in order to insert ideas based on biblical cataclysms and a link to Creationism. I am glad that Zeizmic and Vsmith took an interest and fixed up a lot. At any rate, the neo-Luddites from the Intelligent Design school are crafty enough to understand and quote some science, thus grafting their idea system into it where they can produce a superficially plausible result. This approach is hard to attack, but it must crumble under careful scrutiny and we have to engage therein or the next generation will be raised with a view of science that is warped.<a href="../../../p/d/n/User%7EPdn_a12d.html" title="User:Pdn">Pdn</a> 17:32, 14 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for your kind words and encouragement. I agree with everything you have said. I will not allow wikipedia to become a haven for anti-science agenda setters such as Salva, and I will continue to make sure pseudoscientific nonsense such as creationism and intelligent design are treated cautiously and critically here. I'm not trying to supress information, but I am trying to protect the truth and to supress dishonest agenda's where and when I can see them.

<p>I understand your point, and indeed I agree, that creationism probably has no basis in science. I have heard many creationists claim that evidence exists to back creationism, but that evolutionists are ignoring it. I find that hard to believe, and I have never seen anything even suggesting that could be true.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalva31_5bf5.html" title="User:Salva31">Salva</a> will present valid points, I will, and you should, listen to them.

<dl>
<dd>I agree in principle with what you are saying, but the problem is that in my experience, creationists tend to use all kinds of deceptive techniques to try to bend facts and to bend evidence to their own pre-decided conclusions. If Salva can do the impossible and provide <i>valid</i> reasons and evidence for creationism, I won't have a problem with him putting such information into the article. If he tries to bend facts or uses outright distortion and lies to promote his agenda, I will step in to stop him. I am not worried about real information EC, I am just concerned about the inevitability of the kind of edits that I think Salva wishes to make. If he proves me wrong and adds valuable information to the article, I will not stop him. <a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAaarrrggh_8b86.html" title="User:Aaarrrggh">Aaarrrggh</a> 17:21, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's Aaarrggh here once again Adraeus, for some reason I seem to be having a lot of problems logging into wikipedia recently. If you arrange an offsite project for the same purpose I would be delighted to help you. I had a quick look on your userpage and noticed you're a member of CSICOP. I think I would be interested in joining them at some point myself. I have recently joined a humanist group in Manchester where I live, and have been thinking more recently about taking an active role in promoting not only atheism and humanism, but critical thought itself to a wider audience. It is something I've been thinking about quite a lot recently, having been greatly impressed by the methods taken by the likes of <a href="http://www.darat.org/~dimossi/James.Randi.debunking.on.Tonight.Show.wmv" class="external text" title="http://www.darat.org/~dimossi/James.Randi.debunking.on.Tonight.Show.wmv" rel="nofollow">James Randi</a> and Penn and Teller. A friend of mine who had disagreed with me for a long time about the claims of physics and other such nonsense was recently 'converted' to the skeptical approach after watching that James Randi video I just linked to. He actually said it was a combination of me discussing these issues with him, and the presentation given by Randi that finally won him over, but it gave me a lot more confidence as it was the first time I had ever been directly responsible for changing somebody else's outlook. Anyway, I guess I'm saying I'm definately interested in your project, and I'd also be interested in helping you out with your 'centre for atheism' project too, if you would like me to. 81.178.91.128 14:31, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I appreciate the effort you've been putting into <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a>, but I'm curious what you'd think about just removing the entire "Miscellaneous critique..." section. It reads to me like it's simply restating the information in the "Scientific critique..." section. Also, it has, to my mind, a large number of POV-laden statements, including the one you're currently going back and forth with Dabbler on, about whether to characterize young-earth creationists as making a "strong challenge" toward evolution or manifesting "aggressive hostility" toward evolution. While I agree with your comment about the "strong challenge" language being problematic in terms of making the YEC case sound like it constitutes a strong logical challenge, when it really doesn't, the characterization of what they are engaged in as "aggressive hostility" is equally problematic in a different way, because it exhibits a clear anti-creationist POV. And generally, that whole sentence is problematic from a POV standpoint, in that it basically is undertaking to paint young-earth creationists' motivations in a negative light. I don't think a neutral presentation should attribute motives to one side of a controversy from the perspective of the other side. That's what people do when they're actually debating an issue: they attempt to undercut the other side's arguments by calling its motives into question. As I understand the NPOV policy, a good Wikipedia article scrupulously avoids that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, as I said on the article's talk page recently, I notice a lot of POV problems throughout that "Miscellaneous critique..." section, and given how it doesn't really provide new information not already covered in the "Scientific critique..." section, I think it makes a lot of sense, rather than wrestling over each POV problem individually, to just delete the whole section. I think the article would be stronger as a result. Also, the energy currently going into reverting back and forth within that section could then be applied to improvements elsewhere in the article.</p>

<p>Look, we had reached a consensus on the Evolution page - I'm sure Nowa and I, among others would have appreciated it if you had brought the proposition to the table beforehand. Anyway, I don't fully understand why you think that the new revision was pushing a "creationist" agenda. If you refer to the discussion carried out before you arrived to the scene, you will see that a comprehensive and fully justified conclusion was reached.</p>
<p>It has been awhile since we last spoke on Wikipedia, and I admit that a degree of arrogance had previously fueled my cause, but I have taken in a lot of knowledge since then, and have discovered that it is a frivalous endeavor to try and gain any credentials whatsoever as a Young-Earth creationist. There is no scientific objectivity in the minds of fundamentalists, atheist and theist alike, so let's just both try and bring our bigotries away from Wikipedia so that we can write a good article, OK?</p>
<p>While I do not believe in the YE business, I think that the ID philosophies are justifiable, and valid in today's scientific arena. You cannot dismiss this fact. Creationism today is not the same as it was 100 years ago, and the entire reason that this controversy has resurfaced anew is that science has <i>progressed.</i> So read Nowa's statements again and rethink your impulsivity. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalva31_5bf5.html" title="User:Salva31">Salva</a> 02:25, 13 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>It is not a fact, and yes, I deny it. Intelligent Design is not a scientific theory, and has no scientific basis whatsoever. It is a politically designed euphemism for creationism, created by christian fundamentalists to get around the 1987 supreme court ruling that banned the teaching of creationism in American public schools for violating the constitutional separation of church and state. The 'controversy' lies entirely in the public arena, and in the public arena alone. It is nothing more than a clever little technique of christian fundametnalist propaganda, and is totally invalid. Interestingly, I had something of a religious conversion of my own recently, and will of course be insisting that <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster_3e86.html" title="Flying Spaghetti Monster">Flying Spaghetti Monsterism</a> is taught in Kansas schools after the recent atrocities against science that took place there.</dd>

<dd>Creationism today is pretty much identical to how it was 100 years ago, except the christian fundamentalists who advocate it today have become more media savvy. There is no assertive evidence to back up any claims put forward by these religious types, and their theories are nothing more than cleverly worded biblical literalism. I will continue to prevent you from pushing forward your christian, creationist agenda wherever I catch you doing it.

<p>Hi Aaarrggh. I do not think parapsychology is a psuedo-science. It is the seekers themselves who have corrupted it. I don't think it has looked in the right places, won't look in the right places and it is a haven for screwball ideas. I suspect all it will ever find is short range telepathy ( 20 feet or so) of uncontrolled shared visual hallucinations. I don't think that is what parapsychologists want, nor does anyone else. It is not what has been expected. It will have little affect on science, like the emotional contagion which probably makes it possible.<a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazuba_686a.html" title="User:Kazuba">User: Kazuba</a> 15 Feb 2006</p>

<p>Just to clear up a few points, to keep the article factually correct:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calls cost 60p. I am glad you have changed this to correct this fact.</li>
<li>The answers are not made up on the spot by the producers. This is quite obvious on the bonus round, which you have singled out. There is a 1 in 99 chance of guessing the correct answer (less if you note down previous incorrect answers, or if you're lucky enough to catch the presenter going through the incorrect answers). Once the two number digit has been guessed correctly, then the envelope which the presenter holds is opened, which contains a card with the two digit number hand-written on it. Also note that the presenters very often say "The answers have been locked into the computer, and can not and will not be changed". To even suggest the producers change the answers in order to get more calls is nowhere near NPOV. You have no proof to suggest this is happening.</li>
<li>The show is a TV show. It is not a business, by any definition of the word. A business is something that supplies goods or services. This is a phone in quiz tv show. You do not have to phone in. Nobody has to. The fact that ITV may be making money from the show does not mean the show is a business. It is not, and never will be. It is a TV show.</li>

<dl>
<dd>To clarify: Firstly, the addition I made never actually claimed that the calls to quizmania cost £1.50 a minute - that particular sentence began with the phrase "Shows <i>like</i> quizmania..." which to me implied that it was a comment on shows of this genre, not necessarily quizmania itself. I did agree that it was a little misleading however, so added the 60p comment in brackets purely for clarity.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I do not see your point about the bonus round not being 'made up on the spot'. There is nothing to prevent them from using any number they wish. I could guess '25', and there would be no way anybody could independantly verify whether this was the correct number or not. I'm sure they do pay out sometimes, but they would have to do this even if the show was a scam anyway, because they need to have at least a few examples of genuine payouts should anyone come asking for evidence.
<dl>
<dd>Because they <i>show the number after it has been guessed</i>. Do you honestly think they do camera tricks, and change the envelope part way through the show?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Your comment about the presenters saying: "The answers have been locked into the computer, and can not and will not be changed" regarding the bonus round is irrelevant as far as I can tell. We have to take their word for it.
<dl>
<dd>That is regarding all rounds. We also have to take <i>your</i> word for that they <i>don't</i> lock the answers into the computer.</dd>

<dd>"To even suggest the producers change the answers in order to get more calls is nowhere near NPOV. You have no proof to suggest this is happening."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>- It is neutral point of view to present totally legitimate criticisms. While I do not have conclusive 'proof', I have provided analytical evidence (consider the fact that the questions they ask have no definitive 'right or wrong' answer, for example - highly suggestive and <i>totally</i> legitimate criticism). I have also provided citations for my points - the BBC article which provides illumination on general criticisms of shows of that genre, and the times article which notes that Quizmania earned ITV a whopping £1.2 million in just a 2 week period, which neatly brings me onto your final point.
<dl>
<dd>There is no citing of sources. We cannot post non-NPOV statements on wikipedia.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Actually, it is a business, or call it a 'money spinning enterprise'. Call it whatever you want, but it is certainly not just a tv show. It is desgined to specifically make money (I refer you once again to the above times article), yet this type of program <i>simply could not work</i> if it presented realistic and genuine opportunities for people to win the amounts of money it appears to be promising. I have no doubt that they will genuinly pay out sometimes, but I would do this anyway if I were designing a system identical to this that <i>was</i> a scam. Equally, the point about people 'not having to phone in' is equally irrelevant. I do not <i>have</i> to purchase a BMW car - does this mean BMW is not a business?

<dd>This is an absurd statement. Firstly, the number of adverts they show during the day wouldn't make any difference whatsoever how many adverts they show at night-time. That's just absurd. It doesn't work like that. Equally, the statemnet that "You may remember that ITV have never shown adverts at night" is totally and utterly false. ITV have shown adverts at night-time for years.
