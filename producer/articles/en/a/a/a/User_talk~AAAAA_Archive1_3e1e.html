Krop High School</a></span></h2>
<p>You're probably following the discussion <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Dr._Michael_M._Krop_High_School_f6f5.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Dr. Michael M. Krop High School">here in VfD</a>, but I thought I'd say the same things here, and at somewhat greater length.</p>
<p>I'm sorry your article was listed for VfD, but articles about high schools are always very risky.</p>
<p>The chance of acceptance depends a lot on how good the article is. <a href="../../../y/o/u/Wikipedia%7EYour_first_article_be65.html" title="Wikipedia:Your first article">Wikipedia:Your first article</a> notes that: "Local-interest articles are articles about places like schools, or streets that are of interest to a relatively small number of people such as alumni or people who live nearby. <i>There is no consensus</i> about such articles, but some will challenge them if they include nothing that shows how the place is special and different from tens of thousands of similar places. Photographs add interest. Try to give local-interest articles local color."</p>
<p>For examples of very good articles about high schools, articles that survived VfD, see <a href="../../../m/o/a/Moanalua_High_School_24b1.html" title="Moanalua High School">Moanalua High School</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montgomery_Bell_Academy_5ae4.html" title="Montgomery Bell Academy">Montgomery Bell Academy</a>.</p>
<p>The VfD discussion runs for several days before any decision is made, and the article can be improved during that period. If you think you can beef up your article by mentioning a notable alum or two, and <i>something special,</i> almost anything, about the school, go for it. Pretend that your audience is <i>a fellow alumnus.</i> When they look up the high school in Wikipedia, you want them to get a warm fuzzy and have the feeling that the article is really about <i>their school.</i></p>
<p>Show that you really <b>know</b> this school.</p>
<p>If you <b>don't</b> really know this school then I'd suggest that it is <i>much, much safer</i> to expand one of the articles about a town you have lived in, any town you have lived in.</p>
<p>Most towns in the U.S. have Rambot-written articles, and few of them have any interesting details about the town. And don't worry if it has less than 1111 people; despite the note in <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat%27s_in%2C_what%27s_out_7f38.html" title="Wikipedia:What's in, what's out">Wikipedia:What's in, what's out</a> the Rambot articles are a <i>fait accompli</i> and I don't see anyone deleting them any time soon. <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat%27s_in%2C_what%27s_out_7f38.html" title="Wikipedia:What's in, what's out">Wikipedia:What's in, what's out</a> isn't really a reliable guide; it is at best policy-in-the-making. On the other hand, <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a> is a very reliable guide to point of policy that most Wikipedians really do agree on.

<li>As it happens, I am in the process of revising my vote right now and I had the VfD page open for edit. I think it's a borderline keep now, and I think you did a good job of revising the article to meet the objections of several editors. I don't think you should be viewing it as some kind of contest or battle. Try to relax, you've probably done as much with this article as you can, unless you can come up with any brainstorms. I suggest you try to avoid too much ego-involvement with this article (that's very easy to say and very hard to <i>do!</i>) and look for something <i>else</i> you can write or edit that will be non-controversial. One other suggestion to avoid VfD: when contributing a new article, wait until it is reasonably finished (say, three paragraphs) before actually creating the article.

<li>I've had a look at the page, and can see you've done a lot of thorough work on it, but I'm sorry to say it still doesn't make it notable for me. I'm not looking for quantity or depth of detail, more the shining light that says why this is a particularly notable school. I'll congratulate you on the thoroughness, but my opinion of the level of note needed for a school clearly differs on the fundamental level from yours. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 12:20, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<li>You are right. There's nothing really notable about this school, yet. It's too young (only 6 years). But I think it would not hurt anybody if this and all high schools that had somebody write a thorough article on them could "stay". As mentioned in different parts of the discussion, this article is of interest to about 3,000 people every year (1,000 students and their parents). Over 20 years, it will be of interest to more than 50,000. Maybe a few of those will contribute continously to the article. I estimate that eventually Wikipedia will let High Schools "in", as it is customary for Colleges and universities. Why not start now?--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 12:29, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for your message. I'm afraid that I'm keeping my vote as delete. This is not a comment on your article, you've obviously put in a lot of work, but I'm afraid that I'm not convinced that schools become notable until they're in the national media (and preferably international media). As I've said on the VfD page, I think that your info on the STAR programme would be useful merged with the <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnet_school.html" title="Magnet school">Magnet school</a> article. Perhaps you'd add info on the STAR programme to this page whether or not Dr Krop school is deleted (which it now probably won't be). --<a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutter_c4c0.html" title="User:Grutter">G Rutter</a> 07:58, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)</p>

<li>Your answers did not cover my questions. Please also check my comments on another article at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Alonso_High_School_b1b3.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Alonso High School">Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Alonso_High_School</a> and the response by another user. The difficulty is granularity. To cover a 70-year old high school in the depth you are attempting here would probably amount to writing a short book on the school. And yet you have not yet named in full the current teaching staff by department.<a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">Jallan</a> 19:55, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think so. A 70-year old high school would probably have NATIONAL awards, that will REPLACE the State awards currently on the article. It would probaly have Nationally or Internationally famous Ex-Alumni, that will REPLACE the local recipients of $500 grants currently on the article. It might have few instances of events that have some national interest.--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 21:16, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>I would quite like to see such material existing on the web, but possibly another project than Wikipedia would be the proper forum, just as the rambot articles, really, are not appropriate to Wikipedia though they are tolerated here. The conflict I am having is that I really think that what you are doing is probably about the best that can be done for a normal, non-notable, high school. And it's not encyclopedic because it covers only the present. (This is a problem with many articles in Wikipedia, contributed by editors fixated only on what is current.)<a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">Jallan</a> 19:55, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think Wikipedia is the perfect place. You are right that the school is still non-notable, but I have no doubt that with years it will have some kind of national interest (as most high schools will, I think).--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 21:16, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Regarding covering the present, the problem is that this school started operations in 1998 (I believe). My main source of information is the web, and it's hard to find articles about events that happened before 2003. I guess that with time that will change. Also, I guess that some students of the school will eventually read the article and contribute to it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What your article feels like is the beginning of a kind of web log for Dr. Michael M. Krop High School.<a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">Jallan</a> 19:55, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The difference between a Wikipedia article and a Web Log for a school is that a Web Log would the "journal", and an article evolves (with time) to a more enciclopedic state.--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 21:16, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>It would probably be a good thing if every high school and public school and local charity and university club and so forth had one of these.<a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">Jallan</a> 19:55, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)

Krop High School in great editorial fights to insure that the entire world sees the correct viewpoint about some event happening in Dr. Michael M. Krop High School that year because on that single article depends how the world views their school.

<li>Fortunately, there will certainly be forks in Wikipedia's future and competing projects or partially competing projects, partly because no volunteer project could sustain the kind of pressure of being anything close to the single source of information on all topics. The pressure alone would be hideously counter-productive. <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">Jallan</a> 19:55, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>And mirror sites will want to mirror something different to stand out, not just Wikipedia. What value to be just another of hundreds of mirror sites showing exactly the same Wikipedia content? But part of what Wikipedia must not do now is to try to be everything. There has been for a while a split on VfD between the "every high school is notable and deserves an article" group and "most high schools are not notable". The not-notable votes have tended to be outvoted resulting in keeping of what were often only stubs which never did get fixed up and only get in the way of people searching on the web for information on a school when the same bad stub comes up again and again on Wikipedia mirrors. Currently, the tendency seems to be the other way, for the first time, I think, perhaps because it has become more and more obvious that these articles don't get cleared up and that no-one knows what good articles would be for ordinary schools. The path you are following, that of recording the news of a single school year, seems to me far too granular for the Wikipedia project, to be unsustainable, unless you intend a master article on each school with dependant articles for every school year. If so, you should indicate this.<a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">Jallan</a> 19:55, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)

<li>I have no intention of writing an article on EACH school. For now, I am only interested in ONE school.

<ul>
<li>The problem is that the issue is bigger than your article alone. What kind of encyclopedia article can one write about a normal high school that is not simply what is happening at the moment? Do we want mere lists of minutiae for every year for each high school? Yes, we do, if we want to find that minutiae. It would be helpful if this were on the web. But should it be in Wikipedia?<a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">Jallan</a> 19:55, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My opinion here is again that although at the beginning you get minutiae, since Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, with time contributors will replace MINOR information with more important and relevant information. Some information currently in the article will survive, some will be replaced. And not every high school will include an article. I think that even now, Wikipedia contains articles that all Wikipedians until today have written because they wanted. There are many things or events in the world that probably deserve a space in Wikipedia, but no one has written about it yet. What I am saying is: If there is interest in a High School, let the interested Wikipedian write about it and don't destroy his/her work. Maybe only a few High Schools will get a Wikipedia article. Maybe many. But why should we bother about the ones that nobody has written about yet? Let the interested parties write about them.--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 21:16, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Unfortunately, on the topic you have chosen, the excellence of what you are doing is far from the only issue.

<ul>
<li>Maybe, but I don't see another medium for it yet. I have contributed on different articles in Wikipedia, and just recently decided on creating an article about this school, and make it better than the school's own web site, make it informative, interesting, and of Wikipedia value. But it obviously takes time.--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 21:16, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Most high schools are normal high schools much like any other normal high school. People mostly neither know nor care about any of them individually. Those who care about a particular school are mostly those employed at that school or by the local Board of Education or who are attending that particular school during a few years of their lives at most. Immediate family also care while a child or sibling is attending such a school. But most don't think that their school is special or notable or stands out. That most high school articles are uniformative stubs reflects the fact that the editor writing such an article either doesn't care much or just can't make a good article from information easily available oor both. What people do care about is their own years in "high school" in general rather than about the history of the particular high school or high schools that they attended.<a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">Jallan</a> 19:55, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In this case, this high school produces about 1000 graduates every year. This means that about 1000 prospective students (maybe more, because some have interested but never enroll) and their parents have some interest every year. Then, they have interest during the course of the years the student is attending. Then, they have interest after graduating, because the school is always part of their personal histories. So, in this case, 3000 people become interested every year. Over the course of 20 years it is 60,000 people that have or might have interest in the school at one point in their lives. And this doesn't count the people that might have interest in the school of an ex-alumni that suddenly becomes famous and starts appearing in the media.--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 21:17, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Notable high schools, like notable people, or notable organizations of any kind, would be those mentioned in media as being recognized for some reason other than merely existing and performing their normal, mundane functions. The repetative litany that "high schools are notable" is belayed by the substance of most Wikipedia high school articles which don't provide any reason why a particular high school is notable and often don't say much at all. An encyclopedia article should not provide only the minutiae of present day information such as the name of the current prinipal and whether a football team is doing well, all likely to be out of date even a year from now. Yet a history of a high school would be mostly nothing but such disjointed minutiae: names of principals, lists of teaching staff, awards won each year by teams or bands or clubs, average grades obtained compared to other schools, additions and renovations of the building, and so forth. Such an article would be encyclopedic. But people don't write them. <a href="../../../j/a/l/User%7EJallan_8e41.html" title="User:Jallan">Jallan</a> 19:55, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As mentioned before, after 20 years of starting operations, a high school would be of interest or potential interest to at least 50,000 people. And with the growth in Wikipedia an in Wikipedian numbers, I am sure that articles of high schools will eventually evolve to become more "encyclopedic"--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 21:16, 25 Sep 2004 (UTC)</li>

<p>At this point, you've put a lot of work into improving the article. Things are more or less out of your hands. Improving the article was a useful thing to do. Trying to answer every <i>delete</i> vote in the VfD discussion isn't. It won't do your cause any good; it won't do it much harm, either, but it is stressful to you and to those reading the article.</p>
<p>Wikipedians vary as to what they think about high schools. You are not the only one who thinks all high school articles should be kept. But not all of us do, virtually all the things that can be said about high schools have been said, and it doesn't seem to change opinions.</p>
<p>One thing you can do, by the way, is put the article on your own user page, or a subpage of your user page. If you're not sure how to do this, ask. Within very broad limits people can put anything they like on their user page, as long as they don't try to store dozens of megabytes or try to use it as a personal website.</p>

<li>Sam uses edit wars and other tactics, such as placing warnings at the tops of articles, to bully his opponents into accepting his POV.

<p>Hi AAAAA, I was wondering what to do with <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flecainide.html" title="Flecainide">flecainide</a>. At the moment, it requires some attention.

<li>I just restored a lot of information that Matt Kingston made me take out. Please, DO REWRITE NOW! I always wanted to have somebody edit the work that took me a long time to compile. It does have a few complete paragraphs that I copied and pasted from other web sites, so make sure the rewrite touches every sentence, so we remain with "original" work. If you can add even more information. Great. Whenever I do an article, I always like it to be AS COMPLETE AS POSSIBLE.--AAAAA 15:01, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)</li>

<dd>AAAAA, could you please stop adding copyright violations? It's not a few "complete paragraphs," you pasted in pages upon pages of info from RXlist and other commercial sources with no attribution. Making a trivial change to each sentence is still plagiarism and a copyright violation.

<p>AAAAA, completeness is no excuse for copying other people's work. Furthermore, the page in its present form is much too long, repetitive and confusing. When I've got time, I will complete my reworking, but please accept that your approach was not the correct one by copying stuff from all over the web. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 07:40, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<dd>AAAAA, you said "My reasoning is that information copied from a manufacturer that can promote the use of a product is FAIR USE." Unfortunately you are wrong. Fair use isn't about whether you think copying is beneficial, it's about the scope of the copying and the impact it has. Sites like RXList sell subscriptions and services. Copying whole articles from their site could negatively impact their sales - therefore it's not fair use, no matter how hard you wish it were. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 17:31, Oct 21, 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>AAAAA, I'm not sure if it's fair to call Rhobite and MattKingston "Destroyers". In the form you wrote <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flecainide.html" title="Flecainide">flecainide</a>, the article was a copyright problem. Wikipedia can run into legal trouble for plagiarism of websites, especially (but not exclusively) if these sites have invested money in gathering the relevant information. A glance at the WikiEN mailing list will confirm that various companies (and art galleries) have sent email to <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJimbo_Wales_60fb.html" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo</a> for copyvios, and theoretically, 3M could do the same. We therefore need very close checks on copied information. Please keep on working on articles, but do respect the copyrights policy. It will save you the aggravation and the administrators the disagreeable job of having to police on others. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 13:39, 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi there. I came across these two articles while browsing, as I was interested when I found links to terms that I had never seen before. From further searching, it seems that the only place they appear on the Internet is here on Wikipedia (and its mirrors). Can you confirm that these concepts actually "exist", and are suitable encyclopedia topics? Thanks for your help. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexG_f944.html" title="User:AlexG">AlexG</a> 00:33, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe I read about them somewhere (printed, non-internet), but at the moment I don't remember. At one point I searched in Wikipedia and didn't find anything about them, so I decided to create an article. They seem like valid concepts to me. What do you think?--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 03:59, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
<li>Furthermore, another 3 contributing wikipedians added info to the articles. So I guess these concepts probably seem valid to them too.--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 04:21, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I'm going to look at some books to see if I can find these terms there. I think the concepts are interesting but it would be nice to be able to give references to people who've researched such systems, or even used them in practice. Am I right in thinking that the difference between seniocracy and gerontocracy is that the former is about weighting votes by age, whereas the latter involves restricting power to older people only? <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexG_f944.html" title="User:AlexG">AlexG</a> 20:34, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I will try to find the reference where I read about them. At the moment I don't really remember. I just remembered the concepts because I found them very interesting.</dd>
<dd>Regarding Seniocracy vs Gerontocracy, what you state is exactly what I understand. Example of Gerontocracies can be found in many old cultures, at the tribes level, where the "governing council" was comprised of one ore more of the oldest people in the tribe. As far as I know, Seniocracy is hypothetical. I have not read about an actual culture or nation using that system. However, in a way, any system that gives advantages because of Seniority could be in a sense considered as a Seniocracy.--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 03:32, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I protected <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abimael_Guzman_df64.html" title="Abimael Guzman">Abimael Guzman</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shining_Path_bc8e.html" title="Shining Path">Shining Path</a>... What you've pointed out on my talk page is factually correct, but since I've acted as an administrator in protecting the pages, I'm required to stay impartial to both sides in the dispute. I can try to mediate, though. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 05:44, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>I notice that Shorne didn't edit <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shining_Path_bc8e.html" title="Shining Path">Shining Path</a> but did edit <a href="../../../a/b/i/Abimael_Guzm%C3%A1n_d00a.html" title="Abimael GuzmÃ¡n">Abimael GuzmÃ¡n</a> some but played a relatively minor role. I don't know a lot about either subject but I do note that you are focusing on the word terrorist quite a bit. I think this emphasis on one word is unjustified. For example in 1984 the Peruvian army carried out a series of mass killing of peasants in Ayacucho, announcing that if at least 3 out of every 60 killed were guerillas then the killings were justified, page 679, <i>The Black Book of Communism</i> <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0674076087</a>. I really don't think those who resist such savagery can be characterized as terrorists or at least not any more than the Peruvian army could be. They are Maoist guerillas who were attempting a Marxist-Leninist revolution. It is predictable given their political orientation that once in power there would be a great deal more killing (and also quick collapse of their new regime) but that is not encyclopedic knowledge. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred_Bauder_e542.html" title="User:Fred Bauder">Fred Bauder</a> 13:03, Nov 8, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>I no longer edit on historical-political subjects, mainly because I am sick of dealing with idiots like Shorne. I believe there is a proceedings going on to have him banned.

<p>Ported from the Talk page:</p>
<p>You wrote it from memory, in such detail? Inspired by some source long ago that you can't remember? Interesting set of memory skills you got there.</p>
<p>Permit me a little skepticism here about the inherent contradiction. If it made such a strong impression, you ought to be able to narrow down the possible sources, hmm? Was it from college reading? If so, what class? If not, what sorts of publications could you be reading where it would come up?</p>
<p>And might I reiterate that if this concept was not notable enough to get "traction", as you put it, then by definition it's not really notable enough for Wikipedia, so you need some citations to back it up.

<p>Hello and greetings =)<br />
I am peruvian student of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_University_of_San_Marcos_9083.html" title="National University of San Marcos">National University of Saint Mark</a> in <a href="../../../l/i/m/Lima.html" title="Lima">Lima</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peru.html" title="Peru">Peru</a>. I wish to have your personal opinion about the naming policy of calling the university Saint Mark instead San Marcos, i am supporting Saint Mark based in the opinion of the Catholic Church(which has been the institution that aproved the name in the first place). A precedent of anglicise the name.[<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13365b.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13365b.htm" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>] is an article from Catholic Encyclopedia, <b>i would ask your opinion from a peruvian to peruvian.</b></p>
<p><a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">User:Viajero</a> without reach a compromise or even a civilized talk is attempting to destroy all the places in which the anglicise name of Saint Mark to San Marcos exists using the arguments i am dissobey rules of naming policies, However i must remind that in the top of this rules (that he quotes) it said this</p>
<p><b>Naming convention are not rules written in stone ... and there may be cases where a particular convention is "obviously" inappropriate.</b></p>
<p>I dont think so i deserve to be treated this way.</p>
<p>It is not fair if i disagree with somebody i deserve to be a candidate to be under pressure to be banned.</p>
<p>Please it is urgently to have your opinion to support Saint Mark about this in the following link <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28policy%29_070f.html#Interpretation_of_WP_Naming_policies" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)">Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)#Interpretation of WP Naming_policies</a>.<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyApple_dadc.html" title="User:HappyApple">HappyApple</a> 05:38, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Altough I have disagreed with User:Viajero in other points, this time I agree with him. I believe "San Marcos" is more appropriate. Sorry HappyApple&#160;:( --<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 06:16, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I have a similar opinion, AAAAA, but the real problem is not the name: is the fact that Viajero wants to bann HappyApple just becouse of this, next with his friend Jmabel (that has nothing to do with the article on question). I belive that this is a sort of Abuse against me and HappyApple due to the fact that we are new users. A piped link those no harm to anyone, and that is what HappyApple has being doing: just using the Name "Saint Mark" to link it to the "San Marcos" Article. I believe that the entire name of the university should not be change, that is correct (and HappyApple has never said that it should be change on the Article of the University), but a pipe link is not enough motive to bann someone. Viajero is intolerant and only want to see its own POV on the articles that he like to see them. Please, we need your help with this. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 15:28, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>A Pipe Link is something like you put a name (lets say "university of Saint Mark") and it would led you to the "Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos". I see no harm on those links, becouse of one way to another, it would led you to the right page. I can't understand how you wanna ban somebosy becouse he tried to do this. Please, just help me to avoid his discriminatory acts against HappyApple, just becouse he doesn't think like him. <a href="../../../m/e/s/User%7EMesshermit_7871.html" title="User:Messhermit">Messhermit</a> 17:24, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This issue has been discussed at length at various times w.r.t. various articles by many editors. Please see <a href="../../../w/o/r/Wikipedia%7EWords_to_avoid_41db.html#Terrorist" title="Wikipedia:Words to avoid">Wikipedia:Words_to_avoid#Terrorist</a> for a summary. In casual speech, I use the word "terrorist" like anyone else. Here, I think we have to be more circumspect. Personally, I believe US government has at various times committed terrorist acts, such as mining the harbor of Managua in 1980s, and supported terrorists, like the Contras. If we are to be consistent, we should therefore also label the US government a "terrorist organization". Am I in favor of that? No, because it would alienate part of our audience, namely Americans who don't understand it. I would prefer in this case, as in most others, to present the facts and let the reader draw his/her own conclusions. As has been noted over and over again here, "terrorist" is a highly subjective term; it depends a lot on your point of view. If you ask me conversationally if I think Shining Path are terrorists, I would say of course they are -- but that is just my POV. -- <a href="../../../v/i/a/User%7EViajero_f80c.html" title="User:Viajero">Viajero</a> 16:07, 12 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>To further comment on what Viajero said: "guerrilla" describes the military strategy of a movement; "subversive" describes its attitude towards the existing political system, or existing power relations; "terrorist" describes a movement's use of violent means, or, more precisely, its use of violent means to terrorize the population. Note that "guerrilla" has less of a positive connotation in English-speaking countries than in parts of Latin America; thus, somebody who calls the Shining Path a "guerrilla" movement is not (generally speaking) praising it.</p>
<p>My assessment would be that (a) the Shining Path was both subversive and terrorist in the strict sense of the word; it could be called a guerrilla in the broad sense of the word, but did not follow classical guerrilla tactics; (b) the MRTA was a subversive guerilla that used violent means; once the movement was in disarray, some of its columns used murder to terrorize populations (vd. Ashaninkas), but the strategy of the MRTA was not terrorist, either in its origins or in the overall picture; (c) the Peruvian military was neither subversive nor, of course, a guerrilla movement, but used terrorist tactics from very nearly the beginning of the war with the Shining Path, and did so with such consistency (and, mind you, often according to a state-terrorist strategy) that it could fairly be called terrorist.</p>
<p>This does not mean, of course, that I favour the MRTA. Perhaps it would be best to call the Shining Path "subversive" throughout, and leave it at that. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHasdrubal_f7aa.html" title="User:Hasdrubal">Hasdrubal</a> 23:49, 18 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

I was looking around the web and some call it "Cathedral San Francisco de Arequipa." While others simply call it cathedral. Do you think we should change the name in the article? I think it would be tter to call the catedral by its name instead of just "cathedral." Sonesta Posada del Inca, a hotel just next to the Main Square, calls it "Cathedral San Francisco de Arequipa," and I'm assuming that's the correct name, too.

<p>Category:People imprisoned for terrorism. I had to put some people in this category because at the time I could not label them terrorists. I believe they might just be changed to terrorists. This category seems redundant to me. What you think? Would you label Lori Berenson as a terrorist? Born in the U.S.A., but acted in Peru. Would she be an American Terrorist or Peruvian Terrorist or both or none?--<a href="../../../a/a/a/User%7EAAAAA_5820.html" title="User:AAAAA">AAAAA</a> 5 July 2005 07:30 (UTC)</p>

<dd>IMHO, I would not label <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lori_Berenson_65ff.html" title="Lori Berenson">Lori Berenson</a> as a terrorist because she was not immediately involved in any terrorist acts but only allegations based on circumstantial evidence. It appears she is a terrorist supporter, maybe a Category:Terrorist supporters can be created. There are many people and organizations who have proven to be terrorist supporters. I don't think <a href="../../../p/e/o/Category%7EPeople_imprisoned_for_terrorism_78a4.html" title="Category:People imprisoned for terrorism">Category:People imprisoned for terrorism</a> is redundant because not all terrorists have been imprisoned. I find that multiple categorization is acceptable if definitive.

<p>Sorry about the deletion. I'm trying to make an article for all the schools in the county, and I was trying to go for a more uniformed look. I felt that some of the information deleted is cluttered and irrelevent, such as specific student achievements; only school achievements should be noted, or group achievements. The article becomes full of lenghty, sometimes useless information when you note such specific details. Also, I think the deleted section needs to be rewritten for better wording. If you'd like, try to blend in all the information into shoter paragraphs without making so many subcategories, especially dedicating an entire subcategory to just one sentence, this makes the article look very cluttered. You can keep the information about students that went to MIT and Harvard, and the visit by the Prince of Monaco, as well as the information on the school's naming, bomb threats, and the magnet program but all that information on students receiving awards really pertains more to the specific student than the school. Once that student graduates, his or her achievement becomes irrelevant to the school. Also, can you help me create articles for the lists on the M-DCPS page. Right now, I'm working on high schools and my friend is working on elementary schools but we hope to eventually have an article for every school in the county (high schools will be have more info and pictures, while middle/elementary and other schools will be stubs).

<p>Thanks for pointing out in the <a href="../../../d/o/c/Docusate.html" title="Docusate">docusate</a> article that the link was to an article that requires a subscription. I modified the presentations section since the distinction between the sodium, calcium, and potassium salts is not generally clinically relevant. In addition, the data to support its use for chronic constipation is quite limited. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew73_a1aa.html" title="User:Andrew73">Andrew73</a> 12:38, 12 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I would be glad to have some of your opinions in these topic. Apparently, we have a lot of Pro-Ecuadorian POV pushing in articles that try to explain that Peru did not invade Ecuador in 1941, and that Tumbes, Jaen and Maynas were never part of the ecuadorian republic.</p>
