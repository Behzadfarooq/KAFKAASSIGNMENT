<dd>I have a few of the citations from some review articles, but my office is packed up for a move right now.

<dd>I think it should be as a separate section. I noticed that when I want to find some statistical numbers related to disease (or whatever) I need to go and search for it in the text, which can be annoying. But like that anyone who comes to the page and looks in the "contents" can see right away the statistics, rather than wondering where it caN be.

<dd>I've just discussed some of this above, but the problem lies in defining what data defines a potential treatment. Because the actual pathogenic mechanism remains unclear, biochemical (i.e. amyloid beta levels and aggregation) and pathological (i.e. amyloid plaque count) surrogate markers have such a poor correlation with Alzheimer's disease risk, severity/symptoms, and progression. If a compound blocked the fibrilization of hyperphosphorylated tau in solution, would we really want that listed as a potential treatment? I argue that potential treatments need to be one of the following: very strongly mechanistically indicated, already in popular use, have human trials data supporting efficacy, or be in Phase II+ trials.--<a href="../../../i/p/e/User%7EIpeltan_2363.html" title="User:Ipeltan">Ipeltan</a> 04:53, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Due to increased misunderstading of what should be inlcuded in "Potentail Treatments" (understandablly so, since 'potential' means: possible, capable of being or becoming) I propose to rename "Potentail Treatments" section to avoid future (and present) confusion.</p>
<p>suggestion: "Possible Treatments for AD, that now are in Clinical Trals", if anybody can come with the title that underlines what section is for, are welcome. -<a href="../../../i/g/o/User%7EIgoruha_c8f6.html" title="User:Igoruha">Igoruha</a> 19:12, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I recently noticed that the evidences that we present for the amyloid hypotesis are inadequate. Therefore I decided to add a few more:</p>
<p>"It should be noted further that ApoE4, the major genetic risk factor for AD, leads to excess amyloid build up in the brain before AD symptoms arise. Thus, beta-amyloid deposition precedes clinical AD. Another strong support for the amyloid hypothesis, which looks at the <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beta-amyloid.html" title="Beta-amyloid">beta-amyloid</a> as the common initiating factor for the Alzheimer's disease, is that transgenic mice solely expressing a mutant human APP gene develop first diffuse and then fibrillar beta-amyloid plaques, associated with neuronal and microglial damage.</p>
<p>And yet another support for the amyloid hypothesis comes from the knowledge of other amyloid diseases. Humans get many amyloid diseases, generally referred to as amyloidosis. Blocking the production of the responsible amyloid protein ( e.g., beta-amyloid in AD) can successfully treat these diseases."</p>
<p>Is everyone ok with this addition&#160;? <a href="../../../i/g/o/User%7EIgoruha_c8f6.html" title="User:Igoruha">Igoruha</a> 13:59, 21 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I edited the comparison equating SORL1 and APOE. Given that 70% of association papers don't reproduce, the single Nature Genetics paper associating SORL1 and AD does not equate to the 150 replications of APOE-e4 and AD.</p>

<p>The drug attributes section that has been added is interesting on a theoretical level, but I am not sure how it relates to compounds that have been tested in human subjects. It might be more relevant in the disease mechanism section, although from what I observed at ICAD in Madrid, the alpha secretase clinical stream seems to be well behind the other modalities.

<dd>The topic is too controversial and definatly not adequate information is presented. For example, RIKEN, the biggest research institute in Japan, came out with the study in 2005 suggesting the combination of neprilasin (the AB degrading enzyme) gamma and beta secretase inhibitors (30% of each, to reduce side effects) will propably porduce a satisfying result of reducing AB levels by 63%. Again, this is just to illustarate that the topic if included should cover much more approaches, otherwise it would not satisfy the "complete" article we are trying to have. Can we do this, gather the approaches that are being taken by research initiatives, is a question. <a href="../../../i/g/o/User%7EIgoruha_c8f6.html" title="User:Igoruha">Igoruha</a> 17:46, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Furthermore, despite what is said, alpha-secretase is not attractive target for pharmaceutical intervention of AD, because the therapeutic upregulation of alpha-secretase poses greater logistic challenges than does the chemical inhibition of betta- and gamma- secretases. <a href="../../../i/g/o/User%7EIgoruha_c8f6.html" title="User:Igoruha">Igoruha</a> 10:46, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At the Fifth Annual Dementia Congress over the weekend exactly two compounds were mentioned to be in Phase 3 --Alzhemed and Flurizan. This came from Steven De Kosky who is on the FDA Advisory Board for Neurology products. Voyager stopped the trial for Memryte somewhat abruptly in October. I believe Xaliproden has results from their Phase 3s, but they have not been publicly announced. Other compounds may be products that have completed Phase 3 but stopped there. Also, approved compounds that do work in Alzheimer's might be counted at Phase 3. The TZD and statin trials might fit this. The author might be using PharmaProjects or a similar database to make this count. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrispounds_885a.html" title="User:Chrispounds">Chrispounds</a> 04:58, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Great question! As it turns out, the Phase 3 compounds in the US also are in Phase 3 trials with the EMEA in Europe. Alzhemed and Flurizan are still enrolling in Europe, Xaliproden had US and European trials at the same time (results in the next year or so), and Voyager only had US enrollment going when they halted things. Japanese Phase 3 trials lag by 5-6 years. The economics of pharmaceutical development favor starting US trials ahead of Europe. Prices are about 15-20% higher in the US for products in this category. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrispounds_885a.html" title="User:Chrispounds">Chrispounds</a> 22:24, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for clearing that up for me. It just puzzled me that everyone always speaks about drugs approved in the US here.

<dd>It might be surprising at first to someone not from U.S. I guess, but for those living in America it is even more surprising sometimes. Furthermore a lot of Americans see evil in all those "bloody" pharmaceutical companies charging all those “ridiculous” prices. Consider this: The United States has the most rigorous process in the world for new drug approvals. It takes 10 to 15 years for an experimental drug to become available to patients. It is estimated that only five in 5,000 compounds testing make it to human testing. And only one of those five is approved for manufacturing. It costs a company $802 million (Chrispounds can correct me if I am wrong) to get one new drug from laboratory to patients. R &amp; D investment in new drugs in the U.S. by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies was about $51.3 billion last year. The R&amp;D investments far exceed those of the international pharmaceutical industry and the NIH. To say more, it can be said that Americans are "obsessed" with medical advances, and this in fact turned my country (U.S.) into the world's research laboratory. If you followed this year's Nobel Price announcements, you may have noticed that every scientific price went to an American. To be fare, all these do not mean that we (Americans) have the best drugs and/or the best medicines. <a href="../../../i/g/o/User%7EIgoruha_c8f6.html" title="User:Igoruha">|Igoruha</a> 21:14, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Average costs of $800 MM is about right from the Tufts research, but for a given compound it could be much less--like $100 MM to get it approved. It just takes many tries before you get one in the goal. I think 7-10 years is the typical timeline. The EMEA process is equally rigorous now, but in the past there was more leeway in Europe. If the cost of a therapy is more than the substitutes, then by all means, the substitute should be used. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrispounds_885a.html" title="User:Chrispounds">Chrispounds</a> 00:58, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Good point, especially for some Alzheimer's "treatment." Expensive procedures - like some Alzheimer's treatments, some knee surgeries, and especially body scans - are often no more effective than basic ones. In other countries, I think, people have arrived at a better undertanding that health care necessarily involves economics triage - that $10,000 spent on quixotic care is &amp;10,000 than can't be spent more usefully. And stastics proves that, as in the United States health care expenditure per person is bigger than in any other country in the world, but life expectancy at birth is in the U.S. is behind most countries in Europe, Canada, and Japan. <a href="../../../i/g/o/User%7EIgoruha_c8f6.html" title="User:Igoruha">Igoruha</a> 22:42, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, but that fact has nothing to do with medicine or the medical system. The life expectancy in US states which have fewer socioeconomic and illegal immigration problems compare very well to the rest of the world. If you take the US states which have the best life expectancy, like Hawaii, Minnasota, South Dakota, and Utah, you find that they compare very well with those of Japan in Iceland. They are as good as anywhere in the world-- yet there is nothing special about the US health care system present in these states. For example, male life expectancy at birth in Hawaii is 75.4 and for females it's 81.4. For Utah men it's 74.9 and for Minnisota women it's 80.8. These are due to cultural factors completely independent of doctors, hospitals and even insurance plans. And so they are also in Japan and Iceland, too, no doubt. In fact, I have little doubt that the fact that Hawaii beats all the other states in the US in lifespan is due in part to the Japanese Americans who live there. It's not that Hawaiian doctors or hospitals are amazing.
<p>What drags things down in the US are places like Washington DC where males at birth can expect only 61.8 years and women 73.3. That gives an average of 67.5-- incredibly bad. Next is Louisiana at 72.7 and Mississippi at 72.6.</p>
<p>In short, if you have an ocean around you, or a big buffer-country to the South (like Canada) you can run a very fine tight health care system. Which would be immediately and totally destroyed if exposed to the population of New Orleans or the immigration problems of Arizona. Look at that life expectancy for Louisiana again.</p>
<p>A last point is that of course this has nothing to do with Alzheimer's disease treatment, except as a social argument about triaging resources between generations. The US has the best life expectancy AT AGE 65 of anyplace in the world. And yes, we waste a lot of money doing it. But it's not by doing PET scans to look for dementia. Rather, it's by NOT doing PET scans, and instead doing serial MRI scans (paid for by medicare) every time time elderly person with known dementia has some change in mental status. Which, in total, cost far more than a PET scan, and in total add very little to quality of health care, but a LOT to the cost of it. So in this case, the problem is not use of high-tech, it's use of the WRONG high-tech. <a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">arris</a> 21:58, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Realizing that this discussion group should be about Alzheimer's article, I'd allow myself to make a few short remarks unrelated to AD, to respond to the last comment. Reports, that <a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a>[[User:Sbharris|arris] probably came across, neglect to mention that Hispanics (many of whom are immigrants) in general live slightly longer than Whites, even though Hispanics have very high rates of lacking health insurance and have very low per capita incomes and high poverty rates. Recent San Francisco news report slammed lower life expectancy for city blacks, but completely overlooked that at 80.2 years, city Latinos rank among the longest living of any group anywhere in the world. This evidence is counter to the common wisdom that the Japanese live longer. This is of course not disregard that life expectancy in parts of U.S. comparable to third world. Plus, US has the longest life expectancy if you're already 80. Although all this is supposed to change for the worst as NIH suggests: "Over the next few decades, life expectancy for the average American could decline by as much as 5 years unless aggressive efforts are made to slow rising rates of obesity ...

<p>Thanks for that observation. I regret I do not have the time to do the research you require for your article.

<dd>Many things are causes of death without being necessarily or immediately fatal to all people, immediately. Any kind of paralysis or coma, for example. These things cause such gigantic care problems for any person that the patient becomes practically impossible to keep alive for the long term. It comes down to a matter of money, ala Terri Schiavo or Christopher Reeve. The more money you have, the better you can do, but it's a losing game, and for people with no effective consciousness, usually one that nobody is willing to play. <a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">arris</a> 23:26, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since there is no "cure" for AD, everyone who has it will die with it, but not necessarily from it. It can cause death by shutting down brain function. I will get a source and description of that, but of course, "How we Die" by Sherwin Nuland is the classic. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrispounds_885a.html" title="User:Chrispounds">Chrispounds</a> 23:38, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I do not think you'll find a case of anybody dying of Alheimer's which had progressed to the point of shutting down brain <i>stem</i> function and causing classical brain death.

<dd>Just to make it clear: People who develop Alzheimer's can live from 2 to 20 years with the disease, but Alzheimer's disease is a terminal illness. Due to the deterioration in the brain and body, a person becomes more susceptible to various complications, such as infection, that can cause death. While infection may be the immediate cause of death, the underlying cause is the deterioration brought about by AD. In the brain with Alzheimer's disease neurons continue to die over time and eventually the body will shut down. However, people usually die of secondary infection. It is usually not the actual Alzheimer's that ends a person's life, but rather, any one of a number of side effects of the disease. Such as influenza or pneumonia brought on by compromised immune system. --<a href="../../../i/g/o/User%7EIgoruha_c8f6.html" title="User:Igoruha">Igoruha</a> 23:34, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, and you can say just the same about being a high level quadruplegic. Potato, potahto. Aging itself is a terminal illness. Nobody has died of old age since 1955 when they outlawed it as a cause of death to put on death certificates. Since then, it's been putting down "complications" only. Doesn't change reality. <a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">arris</a> 04:41, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The AAGP document states that ginkgo is no well studied enough to recommend it as a treatment. We mention it later and point to the long-term trial that is reviewing it. Other treatments have seen safety and efficacy studies. If the editors can point me to this, we can keep it in, else I would say we keep the current statement in.

<p>In view of the number and results of studies on Ginkgo Biloba I suggest that the paragraph on "alternative treatments" be removed or modified (Intriguing studies on Curcumin exist but nothing to write home about quite yet, as far as I have discovered). Kim99 06:21, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Article says, "Notable cases of Alzheimer's disease have included ... Ralph Waldo Emerson ..." Article also says, "No medical tests are available to diagnose Alzheimer's disease conclusively pre-mortem. ... a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease must await microscopic examination of brain tissue, generally at autopsy."

<dd>the Shenk book describes Emerson's condition and together with the PBS miniseries <a href="http://www.pbs.org/theforgetting/experience/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.pbs.org/theforgetting/experience/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/theforgetting/experience/index.html</a> both are pretty clear about Emerson's dementia. Let me double check what the JAMA review says. Yes, it is an ex-post diagnosis without "definitive" pathological evidence. A couple of the stories in it about Emerson are really sad. I can retrieve the book from a colleague to give you page numbers if you like. Note that the book is cited as the source for these first few names. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrispounds_885a.html" title="User:Chrispounds">Chrispounds</a> 05:04, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We can diagnose DEMENTIA by symptoms alone, and therefore historically. But there are many causes of dementia, and AD is only one of them. About all we can say of Ralph Emerson is he got demented at the end, like Swift. It was probably AD, but it could just as well have been MID. Or a combo. We'll never know. <a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">arris</a> 06:03, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>JAMA says, "In some of the most publicized parts of the book, Shenk describes the dementia (not necessarily AD) of famous people, such as President Reagan and Frederick Law Olmsted, and of literary figures, such as Jonathan Swift, E. B. White, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. It is ironic that Shenk focuses in part on these literary figures with dementia, given the findings from Snowdon's longitudinal study of nuns1 that those with poorer literary skills and impoverished verbal output seemed to be at greater risk for developing AD." So, we do not have the medical confirmation of it.

<dd>I think it was back in October that we talked about what would be listed. Many products have failed in Phase 3 (Phenserine most recently), so unless something has reached late stage testing (Phase 3), they are not going to be listed. The vaccines were in Phase 2 back in 2002, but had a setback. Dimebon, PBT2 and the army of phase 1-2 compounds would make the article longer, and we already have a long article. If you want to summarize the research in alzheimer's disease into an article, I can give you a list of compounds to look at. Alzforum has not cleaned out some of the dead compounds from their list. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrispounds_885a.html" title="User:Chrispounds">Chrispounds</a> 16:54, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it would be a good idea to add a table describing prevalence and costs associated with the disease among countries (or regions around the world), to give readers a better prospective on the impact of Alzheimer's (or dementia in whole).
