<p>Years ago while studying a water option to get rid of a spring fed water supply in favor of a lake water source and alot of filtration it was noted that in Canada and the USA, they use Aluminum Sulfate to filter water. Problem is this adds to the Aluminum in the water, from .02 mg to .32 mg/litre.</p>
<p>No problem in Canada no standards for Aluminum in drinking water; why&#160;?</p>
<p>Have the lobby groups manipulated government&#160;?</p>
<p>Months later I found this scientest on the Internet, a Dr. Squitti doing research on Alzheimers and Copper...well she told me that Aluminum was always suspected of contributing to Alzheimers.</p>
<p>Well in Canada we got rid of glass pop bottles in favor of aluminum cans, and today Alcan Aluminum collects cans for Alzheimers Research; imagine that.</p>
<p>Remember the cigarette companies and how scientests preseted evidence to some grand jury that cigarettes did not cause cancer; well they <a href="../../../l/i/e/Lied.html" title="Lied">lied</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, they're the most politically active age group -- they've more leisure time. There's a reason politicians in the US and elsewhere don't dare touch pensions, for example.</p>
<hr />
<p>The article incorrectly stated that Alzheimer first identified the symptoms of the disease and therefore (citing the authoritative reference from the historian of the institute where they worked) I took the liberty of making this correction: The symptoms of the disease as a distinct nosologic entity were first identified by Emil Kraepelin, and the characteristic neuropathology was first observed by Alois Alzheimer in 1906. In this sense, the disease was co-discovered by Kraepelin and Alzheimer, who worked in Kraepelin's laboratory. Because of the overwhelming importance Kraepelin attached to finding the neuropathological basis of psychiatric disorders, Kraepelin made the generous decision that the disease would bear the name of Alzheimer (J. Psychiat. Res, 1997, Vol 31, No. 6, pp. 635-643).</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Rewrite for those who need this article -- families, policy makers</span></h2>
<p>There is a danger in starting a rewrite from the medical profession's literature, because of the prevasive effect of drug company studies combined with the medical model's focus primarily on perscription drugs, and primarily after diagnosis. The result is a subtle and pervasive bias in the medical journals' point of view, and adopting it uncritically would threaten to obscure the most useful information that a Wikipedia article can provide.</p>
<p>The audience that Wikipedia's Alzheimer's Disease article serves may include a few merely curious souls who want to know the basics, but far more often information on Alzheimer's is sought by family members struggling with the news of diagnosis of a loved one, or concerned about their own fate in old age, and directly or indirectly perhaps by policy makers.</p>
<p>There is a subtly slanted point of view pervasive in the medical literature, including the article on which it is suggested that this article be patterned. Neurological literature is driven by publication of new research studies. And the overwhelming majority of research studies are financed by drug companies hoping to promote costly proprietary treatments for Alzheimer's. Lost in this torrent of publications is the fact that efforts to find a cure have so far proven to provide very modest value at best.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the large gains available in the way of prevention have so far been demonstrated in only a few studies, those for which financing was found with non-company money. Impressive results have been observed with certain NSAIDs, vitamins C and E in combination, and exercise, among others. But these important results have drowned in the flood of publications reported in the journals most consulted by neurologists, which discuss drug company studies of (largely ineffective post-diagnosis) drugs. In reporting these studies, the medical journals adopt a pervasive POV focused on present and possible future profitable medicines. This focus has effectively buried the story about prevention, which is the actual headline. To the extent that medical doctors see their role as providing prescription rather than non-prescription remedies, and as acting only after diagnosis, rather than before, their POV conincides with that of the drug companies. If information isn't about cure after diagnosis, it receives short schrift in the medical journals and in medical practices alike.</p>
<p>But for families and individuals who need information on Alzheimer's, prevention and care are the information of greatest value. Prevention and nursing care are salient for families (news they can use) and useful in framing public policy. Information about the present, largely-ineffective proprietary treatements will be provided by almost any health-care professional consulted, and often adopted because not taking the (admittedly near-useless) patent medicines is presented as "doing nothing."</p>
<p>Wikipedia should not allow the POV that focuses exclusively on these low-value / high-cost treatments to crowd out useful, practical NPOV information that patients and their families desperately need on diagnosis, prognosis, nursing care (whether family provided or otherwise), and especially prevention.</p>
<p>Information about the gains in prevention is urgently needed in the debates by public policy makers. As some recent comments point out, most people currently get Alzheimer's if they live long enough. Most are cared for by female relatives, as one inestimable social cost. The remaining nursing-care costs threaten to swamp the social safety net in developed countries, which all have aging populations. Though few, the available studies show that cost-effective prevention works. The information in these studies is more valuable and more important than the many re-hashing drug treatments that have but little effect.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The review I suggested is quite impartial, and does not "rehash drug company studies". Of course the social context should be firmly embedded in the article. You may be shouting at a strawman. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 22:22, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What is it like? I want to know what it is like to live with someone with Alzheimers. Most of the articles I've read say that it kind of a drag but it doesn't have actual people with relatives that have Alzheimers. Someone that care for a person with Alzheimers should write their own version of what is like it live with them, we can't take doctors words as if its stone. Perhaps their relatives dont consider it boring and a drag.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Question</span></h2>
<p>I have been reading a lot of material about nCJD being misdiagnosed as Alzheimers - supposedly indicating why cases of Alztheimers are doubling/tripling (?) recently. Can anyone provide points of view on either side of this aurgument&#160;? Thanks</p>
<dl>
<dd>nCJD has a rather typical presentation of rapidly progressive diffuse mental deterioration and specific motor symptoms (such as myoclonic jerks). I think the increase in Alzheimer's is a result of people getting older in general and surviving other previously mortal diseases in particular. I think it would be immensely speculative to attribute this increase to CJD. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 16:02, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<b>Bold text</b>My mother had Alzheimer's and my best friend's mother has it in very advanced stages today. My mother was a version of Betty White off the Golden Girls, always dressed perfectly, every hair in place(done every Friday for 50 years). At first, no one could tell unless you talked with her more than 45min, when she then began to repeat herself. Even though she would be polite to people, you could see the fear in her eyes of not remembering who these people were. It was very dramatice for her to the point she stopped going to Church for fear someone would speak to her and she not know who they were. During this disease, there can be "cute-funny" parts of it, like blue skies and white puffy clouds or those are the prettiest red Christmas lights I've ever seen....and it's a see of red car taillights at 5:00 traffic.It is stressful for the caregiver....they do their best to help and frustrated to see their loved one digress. It's like taking care of a 2yr old. The patient gets very frustrated...they know they have something to say but cant remember how to talk...so they bang on the counter in anger and frustration. Same thing with using a bathroom...they forget where it is or how to use it...so they urinate on the floor....they look in your eyes knowing you are a safe person to them but seeing the confusion of who you are...this tears your heart to pieces. The ultimate is when they forget how to chew and swallow. These are pictures one never forgets no matter how much you focus on the funny and good times in your life with this person. The fact you are helpless in helping someone who is helpless is a horrible feeling. To me, this is the worst disease out there...it has no cure and it humiliates and degrade the person who has it.Making sure they live a full and happy life til the end is very important and NEVER take anything they may say or do personally....they are living in total confusiion and it is not you, the caregiver.Never speak to them like they are a child....always treat them the way you want to me treated...never yelled at, spoken to softly and kindly....keep them safe from themselves and outside influences. Take locks off bedroom and bathroom doors so they don't lock themselves in there. Dont let them watch vioent tv show/movies.....they cant tell the difference between real and not. It's a 24/7 job being a caretaker but it is the most rewarding job one can accomplish. To know you made a difference for someone special is very important for them and for you. I could write page after page on this subject....both my mother and my friend's have passes away. Patience, guidance, love and caring are required at all times and the rewards are ten times fold.Wenboop 16:18, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is probably quite accurate, but at the expense of accessibility. Can't some of the jargon be taken out of the article, particularly the introduction? --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a> 22:37, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've looked at the language in the intro and while bits of it are quite technical most of the terms are explained or a link is offered that explains the term. This article has become rather untidy and could do with a complete review. The introduction as it is now does present a number of advanced notions that perhaps could be discussed later on in the article. I'll try to have a go at tidying it up, perhaps with the help of some of my colleagues.

<p>This article has fallen prey to individuals pushing fringe theories with respect to the pathogenesis and treatment of the disease, such as the sections on heavy metal administration to rabbits and therapeutic use of Indian spices (turmeric), which have now mercifully been deleted. I would request that other neurologists and neuroscientists specializing in Alzheimer's disease join me in providing surveillance of this page so that the lay public can find a concise presentation of well-substantiated and valid information on the subject. There is already far too much quackery and chicanery concerning Alzheimer's disease available on the internet, which does a huge disservice to family members searching for information that possibly could help their loved one(s). The clinical and research communities should work together to make Wikipedia a sound and reliable source on medical subjects for patients and family members. -- Ve ri tas 22 April 2006</p>

<dd>There are new Alzheimer's articles every week, which shouldn't come as a surprise. But please don't list them here, as that would be an entirely unacceptable use of a talk page. If you'd like to summarize these alternative therapies, pointing to peer-reviewed studies, noting the rampant pseudoscience and quackery, then by all means, feel free. But do not clutter this talk page with a mere list of links to news articles when only a vanishingly small subset of their authors have bothered to read and understand the study in the first place. --<a href="../../../d/i/b/User%7EDiberri_3d04.html" title="User:Diberri">David Iberri</a> (<a href="../../../d/i/b/User_talk%7EDiberri_54fd.html" title="User talk:Diberri">talk</a>) 23:08, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That type of response is not in the spirit of Wikipedia's collaborative nature and is generally unhelpful.

<li>I'll change my attitude if you drop the holier than thou "You have to spend 50 hours finding peer review articles and weaving them into the article to contribute" attitude. I don't have the desire to search academic papers, but I do want to improve the article. Did you read the links? They are from Forbes and WebMD, reputable organizations. I am not an MD, I do not have the knowledge to decide if these are worth including on the article page HENCE THE LINKS. If someone with the knowledge can actually review them then the article improves. I am tryign to collaborate as much as I can in an area I don't understand. Also before I added those links the possible cures section was totally unreferenced. So please before you jump in and accuse someone of adding linkspam and quakery take a second and wonder why they are on the TALK page and not the article. -<a href="../../../r/a/v/User%7ERavedave_48c1.html" title="User:Ravedave">Ravedave</a> 04:02, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I appreciate the effort it takes to contribute to a WP article on a topic in which you are not an expert. I do it all the time.&#160;:-) By no means did I mean to insinuate that your contributions amount to quackery. I just wanted to suggest that if you were to add a section on alternative AD therapies, then you'd prominently mention the quackery involved in many of them. And the reason I suggested peer-reviewed studies is that they are generally preferred over news articles in medical topics. The reason I called it linkspam is that you originally said you'd be adding <i>any</i> articles you found to the talk page, which IMO amounts to spamming. I hope you can see that I wasn't trying to be condescending.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Proposed major revision</span></h2>
<p>I'm proposing a major revision of the later sections of this article which have become unwieldy at best. As per the comments of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Veritas.html" title="Veritas">Veritas</a> and <a href="../../../j/f/w/JFW_62d6.html" title="JFW">JFW</a> above, data has been added non-selectively, described in excess detail and used to support overly broad clinical assertions.</p>
<p>I'd suggest the following components for a revision:</p>
<ul>
<li>Break off the list of "famous" disease sufferers to its own page, and include a sentence like this one somewhere in the article: "Famous Alzheimer's disease sufferers have included President Ronald Reagan, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Rita Hayworth."</li>
<li>Convert the prevention section to bullet point format, including only popular and/or validated treatments. Where popular therapies have been called into question, include this information</li>
<li>Limit external links to a few of the many available highly reliable sites. If we're going to offer links, they should be neither redundent nor POV nor self-promotional.</li>
<li>Choose a consistent citation format for scientific and other articles (footnote or inline or PMID reference with or without full reference at the article's end). I propose the new new <a href="../../../f/o/o/Wikipedia%7EFootnotes_5088.html" title="Wikipedia:Footnotes">Cite.php footnote</a> format with full references.</li>
</ul>
<p>Towards this end, I've combined the epidemiology and prevention sections and converted it to an annotated bullet point format. I've based the information on prevention recommendations in Up-To-Date and the Cochrane databases. It should be notable that I've removed references to such things as green tea and caloric restriction. I've used the Cite.php format converted the only other two complete references as well. (The molecular pathway "reference" moved to external links since it wasn't really a reference.)</p>
<p>Depending on feedback, I'll complete additional parts of this revision in the next few days.</p>

A quote from the article: "the involvement of the Reelin signaling pathway in neurodegeneration has also been proposed (1, 6, 9, 15–17). First, Reelin binds to apolipoprotein E (ApoE) receptors, and some ApoE gene polymorphisms are considered risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Moreover, the lack of Reelin is associated with increased phosphorylation of Tau (1, 2, 18), whose hyperphosphorylation leads to intracellular tangles and neuronal degeneration (19). Disabled-1 binds to -amyloid precursor protein (20, 21) family members, whose proteolytic processing leads to the A-peptide-forming amyloid plaques. Recent data also indicate that Reelin is present in -amyloid plaques in a transgenic mouse model of AD (22).

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Standards for external links</span></h2>
<p>There was a question as to why the link to the Wash U. Alzheimer's site was deleted. First, the page states at it's top that is a copy of material from the government's Alzheimer.org site. The link should therefore go to that site and not the Wash U. site. Second, and more importantly, the same statement dates the material to 2000, which is extremely outdated in the world of Alzheimers. Much of the information at that site is therefore likely outdated. Third (and least important), the link is not formatted in the style now being used in this article.</p>

<dd>I think the following information, which can be supported by WUSTL, will be a good contribution to the article, since it gives the reader an important prospective on simular neurodegenerative diseases, which makes main article more informative for the reader.

</dl>
</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>the title can be: "Simularities to Other Neurodegenerative Diseases", or "Parallels between AD and Other Progressive Neurodegenerative Disorers, or "Overlapping Characteristics betweein AD and Other Neurodegenerative Diseases."</dd>
<dd>A common thread in neurodegenerative disorders is the abnormal aggregation of the proteins in the brain. Examples of these proteins include amyloid in AD; synuclein in Parkinson's disease; prions in prion diseases; huntington in Huntington's disease; BRI in familial British dementia; and tau in taupathies, such as frontotemporal dementia with Parkinson's disease, progressive palsy, and Pick's disease. Most reaserchers believe the the protein aggregates formed are toxic and give rise to the multiple brain changes that characterize the different neurodegenerative diseases. If one relationship between these diseases really is abnormal protein aggregation, then discovering ways to prevent aggregation, or the processes set in motion by the aggregation, may halt the disease process.</dd>

<dd>In my opinion, the section on Potential Treatments is one of the weakest elements in the main article. It should look to the future, and therefore should give a reader a full prospective on what is or will be studied in the current research (which, of course, would need to be constantly undated ). Here are some suggestions.</dd>
<dd>I would start as follows:</dd>
<dd>It has been hypothesized that an approach to preventing AD is to block the production of amyloid in the brain, though there is as yet no formal proof that this would prevent the development of the clinical symptoms of AD. An important focus of scientific focus research, therefore, if finding out how to block the formation of beta-amyloid. Another is finding ways to inhibit amyloid’s deposition into insoluble plaques. Here is the list of some potential treatments that are being explored in current research:</dd>
<dd>- pursuing an anti-amyloid vaccine.</dd>
<dd>- removing amyloid ( like, brain microglia, which may destroy amyloid naturally)</dd>
<dd>- preventing beta-amyloid from forming (for example, estrogen might reduce the risk of developing AD by lowering beta-amyloid secretion)</dd>
<dd>- breaking down beat-amyloid (which believed to be accomplished by “insulin degrading enzyme”)</dd>
<dd>- presenilins</dd>
<dd>- programmed cell death (apoptosis) (for example, telomerase, an enzyme that maintains chromosome structure, under certain circumstances can block specific apoptotic pathways and in tissue culture can decrease vulnerability to cell death induced by beta-amyloid)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As you see this is just a backbone (or a part of it, since I talk only about amyloid) of what can become, in my opinion, a great addition/revision to the main article. As so, I would like to fully develop this “backbone” here before posting it. Please, offer your suggestions.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Definitive diagnosis must await microscopic examination of brain tissue?</span></h2>
<p>Question. Diagnosis section of article says "...a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease must await microscopic examination of brain tissue,generally at autopsy." I'm looking at some pictures from www.alz.org/brain/overview.asp . Will a qualified doctor please look at pictures 8 and 9? They seem to show a very obvious, visibile-to-the-naked-eye deterioration of the brain. I was a bit shocked when I saw these because I had no idea that an Alzheimer's-afflicted brain looked so markedly different from a healthy brain--I thought the difference would be indiscernable to a layman. According to these pictures, the brain of a person with advanced Alzheimer's actually looks shrunken and shriveled--macroscopically. So, would the micronanalysis of brain tissue really be necessary other than to confirm the obvious? Or, are the pictures exaggerated to make it more intuitively clear to the lay-viewer. Does the Alzheimer's brain not really look this bad? Seems to me it actually shrinks to a substantial degree. Surely the tissue analysis is just to make it "official?" Thanks in advance. Colin.65.102.39.98 00:13, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>At the recent International Congress on Alzheimer's Disease in Madrid, post-mortem evidence was required to give a definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease. Several of the presentations on imaging were asked about post-mortems and that was the ONLY way to give a definitive diagnosis. Some of the imaging methods get to 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity, but they still need the post-mortem.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">This is a <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">Good Article</a></span></h2>
<p>After review, I'm promoting this article to <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">GA</a> status, based on the <a href="../../../w/i/a/WP%7EWIAGA_4080.html" title="WP:WIAGA">qualifications</a>. I think it is well written, and seems fairly up-to-date. However, I do have some suggestions for further improvement.</p>
<ul>
<li>The article needs more references. In fact, the references section is borderline. If I had chosen to fail the article, it would have been due to references. Things like statistics and the claims of the various theories of the disease pathophysiology really need references, so people can evaluate how up-to-date and valid the information is. I'd recommend sticking with the <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITET_7f44.html" title="WP:CITET">cite.php</a> format, which is already in use for most of the references. Remember that external links can be cited in the same way, particularly if they are stable online documents, and not just a 'general site about the topic'. For FA status, people like to see at least one reference per paragraph, typically. Keep this in mind as a goal while improving.</li>
<li>Continued expansion in the prevention and treatment sections would be nice. This is the part of the disease that is likely the most important to people, and should be very complete. It is good now, but would be a good place for more information.</li>
<li>Some images would be good. It's not as critical for articles of this type, but a few images can do a lot of good. Do any universities release medical images under a free license? If not, are there some particularly illustrative ones that we could use under a good fair-use rationale?</li>
</ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Why not add the 4 articles to External links?</span></h2>
<p>As of July 6, 2006, there are 4 Alzheimer's articles. Why not add these four to the "External Links" section on the main page? Not everyone reads the discussion page, there are only 4 articles, and I think they contain information a person should know about and can use; such as drinking <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_tea.html" title="Green tea">Green tea</a>, or taking Chinese Moss Extract better known as <a href="../../../h/u/p/Huperzine_A_5310.html" title="Huperzine A">Huperzine A</a>, which is sold at health food/vitamin stores.204.80.61.10 18:22, 6 July 2006 (UTC)Bennett Turk</p>

<dd>About Green Tea and Moss Extract – just a pseudoscience. We are trying to post whatever is generally accepted by the scientific community, not some medical quackery. Therefore, it would make the main article look unprofessional.</dd>

<p>The four links have strong medical backing; (1) the Alzheimer's Vaccine is listed at the online edition of "The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences". (2) The Chinese Moss extract is undergoing testing directed by Georgetown University. (3) The Green tea, (catechins), study is published in "The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition". (4) The Green tea, (EGCG), study is found in "The Journal of Neuroscience". Those are four reliable medical sources. In addition, according to the Wikipedia link to <a href="../../../h/u/p/Huperzine_A_5310.html" title="Huperzine A">Huperzine A</a>; the National Institute on Aging is conducting a Phase II clinical trial as far as it's safety and efficiency in treating Alzheimer's.24.195.241.149 00:39, 8 July 2006 (UTC)Bennett Turk</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Aluminum</span></h2>
<p>Aluminum is not a heavy metal, but I don't know if they're talking real heavy metals (thallium, lead, mercury) or aluminum. I've heard the aluminum theory (deoderant and soda cans) but I don't have a reference, so i'm not changing it. Edit: Oh wait, according to [heavy metals] "In medical usage, the definition is considerably looser, and "heavy metal poisoning" can include excessive amounts of iron, manganese, aluminium, or beryllium (the second-lightest metal) as well as the true heavy metals."</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Potential treatments section policy</span></h2>
<p>Given the consistent addition to the potential treatments section of compounds/therapies backed <i>only</i> by <i>early</i>-stage laboratory/animal evidence, I've tried to incorporate a way to include such material in the article while (1) making clear that these compounds are far from clinical use and (2) not using up extensive space in an Alzheimer's article on far-fetched therapies. Due to the abysmal relationship of effects on surrogate markers to effects on clinical disease course with this disease in particular, I think that these compounds should not be in the article, but the consensus seems to be against me on this.</p>
<p>Proposed policy: The way I propose to handle these compounds is as another list. Failure to follow the following standards should result in deltion of the listing with a reference to the talk page. Standards for inclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <i>correctly-formatted and complete</i> reference to a <i>reputable</i> source. Although a news report can supplement the reference to provide for a lay-language explanation of the scientific data, the primary scientific reference <i>must</i> be cited.</li>
<li>A wikilink should be part of the listing. If the compound/treatment is significant enough to merit a listing in an encyclopedia, it should exist in the wikipedia in some form. If it doesn't have it's own entry, a sentence or two describing the research data should be included in some relevant target entry. (This assumes the editors of that article find it merits inclusion. Of course, if they don't, it probably doesn't belong in the AD article either.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm aware that the PBT2 entry does not currently meet these standards, but I'll look to the editor who added it to bring it up to code. --<a href="../../../i/p/e/User%7EIpeltan_2363.html" title="User:Ipeltan">Ipeltan</a> 01:37, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree that this would be ideal, and better for article than what will quickly become a long list of potential therapies. What about the possibility of breaking this material off into a separate article?</dd>
<dd>The info from the AAGP guidelines is very good and merits significant revision of the article. Because of the significant and serious consideration that treatments like ginko, NSAIDs etc previously received and still receive, I think they continue deserve mention in the article stating clearly that current best practice does not recommend a role in treatment. Also, the section on vitamin E should be restored based on the AAGP info. --<a href="../../../i/p/e/User%7EIpeltan_2363.html" title="User:Ipeltan">Ipeltan</a> 12:58, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am ready to help edit the potential treatments. I would think it makes sense to have the text be brief and proportional to the testing that has been done in clinical settings in humans (note I said "in clinical settings", and not just "in humans", otherwise we might end up with 10,000 words on THC, dudes). If compounds get approved, they should have their own entry. If we think these potential treatments deserve more space, then we can work toward a new entry. What do we think about the links to the clinicaltrials.gov for the Phase 3 compounds? The diabetes, lupus erythematosus, and hypertension entries have considerably less of the potential treatments, although the "Treatment Research" has a few sentences in the Lupus article. "Diabetes Management" is a separate entry and "anti hypertensives" also has a separate entry (with references to a bunch of categories of treatments).

<dd>Thank you for providing an explanation before taking action. In a way I agree with you. But, I posted it in "potential treatment" because by potential treatments I understand some exiting progress in new therapies for AD. Such as: advances in adult stem cell research; advances in the earliest stages of drug discovery through post-marketing studies; and also advances that include: positive results from the first Alzheimer "patch". By potential treatments I understand not only drugs with new targets or a new mechanism of action, but also new methods of delivery.

<dd>I think he was trying to say that a new delivery system for a crappy drug, and indeed an entire crappy mode of thinking about drug treatment of this disease, is not that exciting. These people have brains full of dead or dying neurons. Dumping a little more of this or that neurotransmitter on them, a little nerve gas here or there by pill or by patch, is not an answer. We've spent decades now and billions for treatments that change things so little that it takes a big statistical study even to tell the difference between treatment and placebo. We've seeing changes of something like +1 in a score of 30 on the MMSE. For 6 months.
<p>By contrast, the vaccine trials that you mention below in the next section, really is a new mode of thinking, and deserves some of the space you used (and shouldn't have used) for the patch.<a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="blue">S</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris"><font color="orange">B</font></a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">H</a><a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbharris_26ab.html" title="User:Sbharris">arris</a> 00:49, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I remember reading somewhere that certain colours of dining plate are useful for Alzheimer's sufferers as the contrast helps them see what they're eating. So probably the thing to do is to make it clearer how the link relates to the article. These are my thoughts so far. <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunquam_Dormio_ecde.html" title="User:Nunquam Dormio">Nunquam Dormio</a> 15:13, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It seems to me a blog about the ongoing development of a particular Alzheimer's disease "center" isn't appropriate for an encyclopedia article on Alzheimer's disease. There are hunderds if not thousands of centers, clinics etc. that provide Alzheimer's treatment that would also deserve mention. Frankly, I wasn't able to understand exactly what the purpose of the blog, although this was not my reason for removing the link, where the AlzheimeUr Centre is located, nor what its purpose is going to be. Is it a residence facility, a research center, a treatment clinic, or a day/respite service? As Nunquam Dormio suggested, you might wish to a separate article on design for Alzheimer's. You could also add some material to the treatment section about lifestyle/living accomdations for patients. The social impact section of the main article is extremely weak; you might be able to make a contribution to this section as well. It also seems you have access to some great Alzheimer's histology images. These would be a major addition to the article if you'd be willing to add them. --<a href="../../../i/p/e/User%7EIpeltan_2363.html" title="User:Ipeltan">Ipeltan</a> 23:19, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Our weblog emerges from the wish to offer an insight into the process of creating ideas for the AlzheimUr Centre. This centre is the reference for the region of Murcia (Spain) to provide a comprehensive attention to the illness of dementia. This weblog is an added tool to the project. Besides proofing the elaboration of different criteria that guide the development of the work, it tries to encourage interactivity with a system of commentaries. This is done in order to enrich the project with significant suggestions. Interdisciplinary collaboration is believed to be an essential part of the architect’s work. Working sessions every day are based on different programmes to develop specific contents and objectives. At the beginning of the first ten days the approach will be very intuitive. Then it will formulate the brief which, without being completely defined, suggests aims and important interests which the project will be based on." Quoted from the first post of the weblog.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I hope this answers your questions on purpose of the blog, location of the centre, etc. Definitely, the design for an Alzheimer Centre is something much more complex than deciding the colours of the dining plates. It requires the strong collaboration of architects, doctors, patients and families. There is not much information on it and this weblog is recollecting facts on this theme. It is a pity to remove information of Wikipedia under such misunderstandings, so I would appreciate if you reconsider your action or somebody more qualified gives an opinion.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Determining AD</span></h2>
<p>I think we should add a section on the techniques (tests) used to determine the severity of AD's symtoms. Here is a list of a few that I found, if anybody can find them available online please provide a link:</p>

- Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)
- Disability Assesement in Dememntia (DAD)
- ADAS-Cog
- Caregiver Stress scale (CSS)

<dd>Given the length of the article, we could mention the more common tests (MMSE, perhaps Clock drawing and ADAS-Cog) and then create a page of neuropsychiatric tests. Some of these tests are Alzheimer's specific, but other tests are general neurological tests. Others I have heard of include the ADCS-Activities of Daily Living , Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR-Sum of Boxes), Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI), Brief Cognitive Rating Scale, Global Deterioriation Scale, and Clock Drawing. Some of these have been used in clinical settings to measure functional, cognitive or global changes. <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/509042_print" class="external text" title="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/509042_print" rel="nofollow">A Medscape article</a> looks at some of the tests in a diagnostic battery. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrispounds_885a.html" title="User:Chrispounds">Chrispounds</a> 22:42, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Although the normal layout places external links below references, I've asked for a discussion of this at <a href="../../../m/e/d/WP%7EMEDMOS_93c4.html" title="WP:MEDMOS">WP:MEDMOS</a>. Given the length of medical article ref sections and the relatively greater general utility of external links to references in these articles -- a situation that is different than a concisely referenced article on most topics -- it seems appropriate to use a different section order. I feel like the external links section belongs above references because it adds significantly to this article, wheras the references section has no stand-alone value.</p>

<dd>This information is based on a valid scientific study that has been referred in respected news networks (CNN, Reuters). It has nothing to do with being entertaining but with being a potential treatment for the disease. Who are you to decide about this case? Is it a common Wikipedia policy to censor facts if some people don't like them? I will put the information back on the article because there is no valid reason for it to not be there.

<dd>The length of this article (which has been discussed) is getting to the point where we have to decide what stays and what goes. Reading back at the discussion to the Potential treatments section about 6 weeks ago, we had discussed that a randomized control trial would be necessary for a something to make it into the potential treatments on this page. It may be time to do a split to create a page with potential treatments (things that that can show activity in a lab, animal model, human testing) and then summarize the relevant ones (lots of human testing, close to being approved) on this page. Many potential treatments are just not going to be approved by regulatory bodies and the things that have not been tested in at least Healthy Patients in clinical trials are at least 5 years from the market. Personally, I did work with a cannabinoid to treat agigation in Alzheimer's in 1999, but it is 7 years later and the product is not much closer to being approved. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrispounds_885a.html" title="User:Chrispounds">Chrispounds</a> 21:39, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look at the reference list. Only a handful are NOT from scientific articles (with PMID links). Just this week in Neurology there was a paper on mediteranean diet that has not yet been included, but that has been in a peer-reviewed journal. The THC hypothesis for "treating" Alzheimer's has not even been verified in the literature. Yes, AD is costly (one of the non-scientific sources has good data on that), but I would hope that we could focus people on what is likely or probably effect and not on unproven therapies. Notice the comment on Vitamin E and its risks. We mention Gingko and the huge trial it has running. I think the Potential therapies page is the way to go with this and I will leave THC here until I can move it to where it can be seen with information of the same quality. Of course, given the status of the "war on drugs," some therapies may not have their day in a clinical trial. AVE 1625 is a cannabinoid from sanofi-aventis and is currently in phase 1 for Alzheimer's. When that gets to late Phase 2, we should be glad to add it to this page. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrispounds_885a.html" title="User:Chrispounds">Chrispounds</a> 22:17, 10 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is not the length of the article per se that means the THC information does not belong in this article but rather the poor relation of the data to actual treatment. (See potential treatments above for a discussion on this very topic that reached consensus among article editors.) The data on THC is based purely on biochemical data and does not include animal studies much less human trials. Despite the statements in the press release linked as the reference, the relevance of this study to potential treatments is therefore extremely uncertain.</dd>

<dd>The standards for compounds like PBT2, green tea, and blueberry extract apply equally to THC. The data relating these compounds to reductions in Alzheimer's symptoms are extremely poor but are, nevertheless far better than for THC. Editors of this article reached a consensus that the literature on compounds and others like them was insufficient to support a treatment role in Alzheimer's for inclusion. Ravedave and Jnx, if you wish to re-address the topic of standards for potential treatment inclusion in the main article, please do so. But until a new consensus is reached about the prequisites for including a potential treatment in the main article, I am deleting the THC paragraph. A new article on potential treatments would be an appropriate place for THC and every other of the hundreds of compounds that can alter the behavior of amyloid-beta.--<a href="../../../i/p/e/User%7EIpeltan_2363.html" title="User:Ipeltan">Ipeltan</a> 03:22, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Is green tea also <i>a considerably superior inhibitor of amyloid plaque aggregation to several currently approved drugs for treating the disease</i> as the study for THC claims? If not I think this fact alone makes THC a different case and certainly a <b>potential</b> treatment. I do realize that this article is of a very high quality as far as Wikipedia articles go and I understand the points you made but I certainly hope research for THC continues. As far as I can see, according to this study it could provide a lot cheaper and possibly even better treatment for AD than drugs currently commercially available.

<dd>The current therapies do not target amyloid, so it does not take much to beat them. Two Phase 3 compounds have effects against amyloid in animal models and have shown to change CSF levels in humans. THC could be "possibly even better", but it would need to make it through at least 6 years of clinical testing and be successful to be marketed. In the recent AAGP paper, THC was not even mentioned--and they did mention many different "potential treatments." --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrispounds_885a.html" title="User:Chrispounds">Chrispounds</a> 14:06, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then what does it mean that "formation of amyloid plaque is the primary pathological marker for Alzheimer's disease." I have a strong feeling it means that the formation of amyloid plaque has a lot to do with the symptoms of Alzheimer's, especially since in the article you can read that "majority of researchers support the alternative hypothesis that amyloid is the primary causative agent." We are talking about potential treatments here and this finding certainly makes THC a <b>potential</b> treatment. Wikipedia is supposed to be a complete resource, not an abstract of AAGP paper.</dd>

Levels of acetylcholine, which was first identified in 1914, are abnormally low in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Currently, there are four FDA-approved drugs that treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting the active site of acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for the degradation of acetylcholine.</b></dd>

<dd>There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding here about the evidence that makes something a potential treatment for a disease. Jnx, your comments indicate misunderstandings about the pathogenesis of AD. Specifically, amyloid aggregation does <i>not</i> represent a good surrogate marker for disease state. There also seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding about what constitutes a reference for this article. By97aa, I disagree with you strongly. In a scientific or medical encyclopedia article, it is up to the authors to decide whether the claims advanced in a research article are valid before including them. Jnx, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a "complete resource." This means that information is included selectively based on its importance and validity. Since this issue seems important to maintaining a quality article I'll address these questions at length, starting with the latter.</dd>

<dd>News articles covering research may be adjunctive; press releases should <i>never</i> be used as a source. Here's why: setting aside the fact that a reporter's knowledge of Alzheimer's may be limited to his/her few hours writing the article, the news media interest in research is calibrated only in part by the importance, reliability, and quality of a study. Another major factor for a reporter is interest for the general public. Therefore, claims that a controlled substance may be a treatment for Alzheimer's may be newsworthy without being an important or valid study.</dd>

While a press release may promote an important, valid, and/or clinically relevant study, a study is not automatically important, valid, or clinicially relevant because a press release is issued. It's more obvious with a "classic" press release: are the statements <a href="http://www.democrats.org/a/2006/10/the_bush_econom_2.php" class="external text" title="http://www.democrats.org/a/2006/10/the_bush_econom_2.php" rel="nofollow">here</a> true simply because they are in a press release? Of course not. Are they false because they are in a press release? No. The risk with a scientific press release is to not recognize that scientific press release have the same underlying goal as political press releases and therefore require a similarly high index of suspicion when judging truth claims made therein. To make this judgment, we need to consider the primary data, <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/sample.cgi/mpohbp/asap/html/mp060066m.html" class="external text" title="http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/sample.cgi/mpohbp/asap/html/mp060066m.html" rel="nofollow">the study itself</a>.</dd>

<dd><i>The simple fact that research has been published does not make its data valid or its conclusions true.</i> Note first that this article appears in a new, practically unknown, and very low impact journal. We next note that the data derives from pure biochemical studies. That is to say the data does not derive from studying cells, animals, or humans, but proteins in solution and computer models of protein behavior. Even if the mechanism of Alzheimer's pathogenesis were precisely known, such data would have extremely low relevance to treatment, defined as <i>whether a compound alters disease course or symptoms</i>. But the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's is not understood. While amyloid beta is almost certainly involved, how and why remains unclear despite 20+ years of research. When or even whether Abeta aggregation is pathogenic is less clear; whether AChE-mediated Abeta aggregation is important is essentially unknown. Furthermore, the mechanism of AChE inhibitors is not well understood either but is not generally understood to have to do with Abeta aggregation. To summarize this study, purely biochemical tests revealed that THC interferes with a process not generally understood to be involved in the pathogenesis or symptomotology of Alzheiemer's.</dd>

But this article still doesn't support THC's inclusion because it still doesn't meet the standards previously established by consensus that require data showing efficacy in <i>human</i> patients. We decided on this requirement because biochemical (amyloid beta levels and aggregation) and pathological (amyloid plaque count) surrogate markers have such a poor correlation with Alzheimer's disease risk, severity/symptoms, and progression. Similarly, even the best Alzheimer's animal models are so dramatically different from the real human disease that even dramatic effects in these animals have very dubious relevance to actual treatment.</dd>

Wikipedia is supposed to be a complete, neutral encyclopedia, not just a collection of what you want to have included in the article. Many of the points you try to make are really weak in my opinion. CNN and Reuters both thought this study was worth telling about (<a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=healthNews&amp;storyID=2006-10-10T223447Z_01_N10385225_RTRUKOC_0_US-MARIJUANA.xml&amp;WTmodLoc=HealthNewsHome_C2_healthNews-7" class="external free" title="http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=healthNews&amp;storyID=2006-10-10T223447Z_01_N10385225_RTRUKOC_0_US-MARIJUANA.xml&amp;WTmodLoc=HealthNewsHome_C2_healthNews-7" rel="nofollow">http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=healthNews&amp;storyID=2006-10-10T223447Z_01_N10385225_RTRUKOC_0_US-MARIJUANA.xml&amp;WTmodLoc=HealthNewsHome_C2_healthNews-7</a> , <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/10/05/pot.alzheimers.reut/index.html" class="external free" title="http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/10/05/pot.alzheimers.reut/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/10/05/pot.alzheimers.reut/index.html</a>).

I've already addressed why Reuters is not a good arbiter of research validity. (Note that the CNN article is actually just the Reuters article posted to CNN, by the way.) This isn't at all about THC per se, but rather what evidence constitutes a basis for calling something a potential treatment.

You earlier said that THC is the same as green tea as far as treatments for Alzheimer go, which simply isn't true. Chrispounds straight-out lied about the current treatments. You say that some press release involving a POLITICAL CAMPAIGN has something to do with a scientific press release about a study - what kind of argument is that?

<dd>The basis for me to make claims about currently marketed compounds comes from the FDA approved label. Amyloid is not mentioned in any of them, and their understood mechanism is cholinergic not amyloid. The Scripps article about cannabinoids (which have been looked at in other places too <sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> ) does not present any findings about clinical effects in humans. Even if you had sourced the item the right way (refering to the scientific journal article) or with multiple references, several of us who work on this page do not see that evidence as equivalent to the other information that is listed. I think it is 100% about the science and 0% about the politics.

Chrispounds is precisely correct. Even if THC is the best inhibitor of AChE-induced Abeta aggregation the world has ever seen, AChE-induced Abeta aggregation isn't generally understood to play any role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Similarly, to suggest that THC was better than current pharmaceuticals for Alzheimer's was disingenuous on the part of the researchers (and the reporter who paraphrased the press release). The understanding of <a href="http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2003/403_alz.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2003/403_alz.html" rel="nofollow">why commercially marketed drugs work</a> (see the treatment section of this FDA article) is increased acetylcholine levels, not interference with Abeta aggregation. Essentially, this study showed that THC better inhibits a process that drugs like <a href="../../../r/i/v/Rivastigmine.html" title="Rivastigmine">rivastigmine</a> are not even targeting.--<a href="../../../i/p/e/User%7EIpeltan_2363.html" title="User:Ipeltan">Ipeltan</a> 14:54, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Any treatment that is not (1) in phase III trials, or (2) being regarded by the research community as a very promising lead should <i>not</i> be in this article. This is a general purpose encyclopedia; cholinesterase inhibition is miles ahead of THC.

<dd>We are talking about a disease that has no cure.

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Are you really telling me this lead is not promising or did I understand something wrong? At least Reuters reported that <i>"The researchers said their discovery could lead to more effective drug treatment for Alzheimer's, the leading cause of dementia among the elderly."</i> THC was found to be more effective AChE-inhibitor than commercially available drugs, does that not make this finding a very promising lead in your opinion?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>That the study could lead to a "more effective drug treatment" is not a fact but a contention and unlikely based on current knowledge and the study's own data. THC was actually NOT shown to be a more effective AChE inhibitor than existing drugs: it was only compared to approved drugs for AChE-mediated amyloid aggregation (which I've already pointed out is NOT how those drugs improve disease symptoms). Here's what the authors actually said about THC's ability to inhibit AChE in the <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/sample.cgi/mpohbp/asap/html/mp060066m.html" class="external text" title="http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/sample.cgi/mpohbp/asap/html/mp060066m.html" rel="nofollow">report</a>: "Steady-state kinetic analysis of THC inhibition revealed that THC competitively inhibits AChE (Ki = 10.2 M) (Figure 3A). This level of inhibition is relatively modest..."</dd>

<dd>This is what the study actually says: <b>We have demonstrated that THC competitively inhibits AChE and, furthermore, binds to the AChE PAS and diminishes A aggregation. In contrast to previous studies aimed at utilizing cannabinoids in Alzheimer's disease therapy,8-10 our results provide a mechanism whereby the THC molecule can directly impact Alzheimer's disease pathology. We note that while THC provides an interesting Alzheimer's disease drug lead, it is a psychoactive compound with strong affinity for endogenous cannabinoid receptors. It is noteworthy that THC is a considerably more effective inhibitor of AChE-induced A deposition than the approved drugs for Alzheimer's disease treatment, donepezil and tacrine, which reduced A aggregation by only 22% and 7%, respectively, at twice the concentration used in our studies.7 Therefore, AChE inhibitors such as THC and its analogues may provide an improved therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease, augmenting acetylcholine levels by preventing neurotransmitter degradation and reducing A aggregation, thereby simultaneously treating both the symptoms and progression of Alzheimer's disease.</b> The administrator still has not replied to my questions. I will add the information back into the article. There is no valid reason to not include THC as a <b>potential</b> treatment. --Jnx 08:47, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That's a well-written paragraph. However, numerous editors of this article and a Wikimedicine administrator have explained in detail in the above discussion why this study and all other biochemically-demonstrated "potential treatments" do not belong in this article. I'll take one more shot at it. I wasted some time trying to explain what makes a quality study and the difference between published data and proven facts. These points were irrelevant.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Here's what's relevant: it is the <b>consensus policy</b> in this article -- established during this discussion and also during a separate, previous discussion -- that the definition of "potential treatment" used by this article requires: 1) advanced research trials in <i>human subjects</i> supporting clinical use; 2) wide use in clinical or popular practice for treating Alzheimer's; or 3) the <i>general acceptance in the fields</i> of neurology and Alzheimer's research that a particular modality is a major hope for successful treatment. Familiarity with the field is helpful but not necessary to assert category three; you might, for instance, cite a review article published in a major medical journal.</dd>

<dd>Just like blueberries, green tea, and several hundred other compounds that have been shown in biochemical studies to interfere with one of Alzheimer's postulated mechanism of pathogenesis, THC does not come close to meeting the requirements for inclusion that have been set forth.

If you start and flesh out an article on "Mechanistic approaches to Alzheimer's treatment," I will add a link to it from the main article.--<a href="../../../i/p/e/User%7EIpeltan_2363.html" title="User:Ipeltan">Ipeltan</a> 05:41, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This potential treatment should be included because Wikipedia rules state that a neutral point of view must be presented to the reader.

I do acknowledge that the THC post belongs to a group of potential (or possible) treatments for the Alzheimer's, and I support the enthusiasm of those of you who want to see it in the main article. But please understand "Potential Treatments" section was not meant for "THC" and like posts (since we did not intend to have postings of every study that comes out, no matter how "potential" it can be), Chrispuonds, with support of other editors, changed the title to "Treatments in clinical development," to avoid the growing confusion. I'd like to remind that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a research forum; if anyone interested is really interested in THC discussion I invite you to the www.alzforum.org. <a href="../../../i/g/o/User%7EIgoruha_c8f6.html" title="User:Igoruha">Igoruha</a> 20:46, 18 October, 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>While editors in the past have come to a consensus that can be applied to this situation, it seems clear that the current consensus is not to exclude this statement. Consensus can change, and you have reverted it's removal from 3 editors putting it in now. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 01:09, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do you even know how many potential treatments there are for the AD ? Do you want start posting any treatment that appears in the sceintific literature ? There are literally hunderds of the promising treatments for the AD. Tell me what do you want to do, either we keep "Potential Treatments" and then it would take atleast another 5 pages just to list all of them, or we change title to "Treatments in clinical development" and keep only those that are in the clinical phase trials right now. We simply can not list potential treatments because it would take too much space.</dd>

<dd>I disagree that 3 <i>editors</i> have put it in. Three people who think THC belongs in the AD article have put it in, but their credibility with respect to Alzheimer's has not been demonstrated. Also consider that we are not censoring the information about Alzheimer's and THC--since the editors here have left it to the editors of the THC page to include it on that page without removing it. The standards we (the AD editors) have established on this page are not being respected and at least two administrators have agreed with us. You have tried to argue with NPOV, but this has been established to be very weak because you have failed to argue for other potential treatments over THC. Also, the <i>editors</i> understanding of the disease is poor when they did not understand that the current therapies do not target amyloid, and thus the paper they support demonstrates weakness in its scholarship. I would ask you to carefully these points and to remove the THC content from this page. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrispounds_885a.html" title="User:Chrispounds">Chrispounds</a> 02:54, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Wow. I just stumbled across this on AN/I and this is inane. The cited study on THC is not at the level of proposing a meaningfully potential treatment; it's a couple of experiments and a docking pose. None of those who propose to mention this study - excluding the literally hundreds of similar studies on less, erm, popular molecules - have demonstrated significant familiarity with the Alzheimer's literature or with the drug discovery process. Contrary to claims of POV exclusion of the THC data, it is in fact giving undue weight to a very minor and preliminary study to leave it in, so I've removed it once. Consensus is clear among those who are familiar with the subject. (I only wish the data on aggregation inhibition by <a href="../../../p/s/i/Psilocin.html" title="Psilocin">psilocin</a> had ever been published...) <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 03:42, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we are going to a dangerous direction when we let people decide which scientific studies are good and which are not. I also wonder will THC ever get proper attention from the research community if people in scientific circles consider THC "entertaining" or "erm, popular".. While I am not going to add THC again, it does strike me as a surprise that there are hundreds of compounds that have been found to be considerably superior to drugs currently on the market. 195.148.156.16 08:14, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have been told by those opposed to the addition that it is not bias against illegal drugs. I can only take their word for it. However the bias(intentional or not) of the scientific community to experiment on these drugs is evident, mostly through the prohibition from governments to do human tests.</dd>

<dd>In some cases Wikipeida is capable of being more nuetral than society as a whole, other times it is limited to the level of societies neutrality(due to the requirement of verifiability). This is not a bad thing, an encyclopedia should reflect societies current beleifs, regardless of the accuracy.</dd>

<dd>I don't agree with the removal, but I do not think any editors are introductin their own bias here. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> 13:51, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think it would be a good idea to maybe summarize and/or reiterate the conclusions that we came to for editing the main page, and also keep some ideas/suggestions for the future development of the main article. Or maybe have some sort of FAQ and answers &amp; ideas for the future improvment/projects.
