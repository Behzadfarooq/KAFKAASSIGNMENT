<p>The ref desk is not a soapbox; that's made very clear atop the page. You're welcome to restructure your comments to be factual rather than some opinionated political rant. Otherwise, expect removal; I find that far more honest than restructuring it all myself. — <a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomn_e5f3.html" title="User:Lomn">Lomn</a> | <small><a href="../../../l/o/m/User_talk%7ELomn_137a.html" title="User talk:Lomn">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomn_RfC_1736.html" title="User:Lomn/RfC">RfC</a></small> 12:49, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You answered with a parallel couched in the strongest possible POV terms. As above, I felt soft removal was more appropriate than chopping your comments into something else, and I attempted to leave <i>no</i> POV (not "my own POV") as a result. RD guidelines are quite clear that "If you wish to argue a particular viewpoint, please do so on an appropriate talk page". Points 7, perhaps 8, and 11 are fine. The rest are in clear violation. — <a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomn_e5f3.html" title="User:Lomn">Lomn</a> | <small><a href="../../../l/o/m/User_talk%7ELomn_137a.html" title="User talk:Lomn">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomn_RfC_1736.html" title="User:Lomn/RfC">RfC</a></small> 04:07, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It would be refreshing to see a response to the Ref Desk "no soapbox" policy rather than rambling vitriol. — <a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomn_e5f3.html" title="User:Lomn">Lomn</a> | <small><a href="../../../l/o/m/User_talk%7ELomn_137a.html" title="User talk:Lomn">Talk</a> / <a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomn_RfC_1736.html" title="User:Lomn/RfC">RfC</a></small> 16:06, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Sorry if my tone was misintepreted -- rather than just say 'thank you for your kind words', I meant what I wrote above as playful kidding, by recycling icut4u's compliment to you.

<p>Hello alteripse, i think we've got off on the wrong foot. I usually ramble on when i post, so i'm sorry for that already, hehe. Well, what i was referring to, is that there is a basis to all healthy diets, which is balance in micronutrients, and lessened intakes of salt, fat, sugar, and so on. In other countries, they have different food that makes up this balance.</p>
<p>As for the perspective, sure! I welcome new perspectives! and sure, i will write information relating to healthy eating with children, but the majority of the article relates to dietary advice that is to be given to children, and that is different from the healthy diet of sedentary adults, but the basis of balance is the same.</p>
<p>The problem is, that in the United Kingdom, particularly, children don't eat healthy foods at school, which is supposed to be the institution which provides them a figure which is supposed to be helping them, when in actual fact, they're receiving cheap procvessed burgers and chips from huge food companies! Now, weening children off these foods is difficult, because they're not likely to eat vegetables and healthier alternatives, because if they have the choice, they'll choose burgers (Jamies Kitchen also dealt with this issue).</p>
<p>However, as you can see, such a topic is very expansive, and would be ill-placed within tyhe healthy diet article. I will be adding the section relating to children, but it will be a small section, with a link to the fuller article which will contain a much more in-depth look at the issue.</p>
<p>Sorry for all the misunderstanding, i do apologise profusely! If you wish to help, your help is more than welcome on Wikipedia:Wikiproject_Nutrition.</p>

<dd>Question for SimonP. I just looked at the virilization article. It is really basic stuff, mainly definitions and terminology. I wrote virtually the whole thing as part of preparation for a go at redoing our atrocious intersex article which I haven't mustered the courage to attempt yet-- I am trying to make sure that there are plenty of available uncontroversial background articles on basics before I try. Do you think there is anything in it that needs citation because of being potentially controversial or not agreeing with other reliable sources on this topic, or are you just asking me to provide more references in general?

<p>I have found it fascinating to trace back certain key concepts to their first mention in the literature, even if the classical material is not available online. Personally I try to do both - a classical resource and a recent review/textbook chapter (I favour reviews). <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 22:54, 4 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The problem is, the more I make it like work, the more I ask myself "why am I doing it <i>here</i>"? Actually, that is only a partial answer.

<p>I'm not quite clear about gold stars of truth beyond their sounding good, and I don't know what it refers to, but my experience of your contributions here has been so positive I'm positively itching to know. Can you point me in the right direction?</p>
<p>Now to the instant issue. There has been a disassembly of the diabetes article (see the history, of course) and creation of some new ones (to wit Type 1 and Type 2 and perhaps others, there are now pointers in the main diabetes article). I've left comments at all three mentioned out of irritation at exactly what I (and I'm pretty sure you) foresaw would likely happen. But leaving aside my pique, WP's coverage of DM has decreased in quality (however low it was before) in respect to overview and perspective, especially for layfolk (ie, victims). Not a Good Thing. You have many things on your plate, but you also have professional qualifications and knowledge and, more to my point, an ability to write clearly, hence this note. Your probable observation about punishement for the virtuous is apposite, but history suggests inevitable.</p>
<p>Perhaps you could look into these and at least leave a guiding comment or two (as from an MD) to encourage (and even, may the gods approve!!, direct) further refactorings/revisions/aultiy reductions? My beginnings are, I'm sure, inadequate, and, in any case I'm sure, too pique ridden to have much effect in those directions. Perhaps even candidates for Medical Collaboration of the Week?

<p>Hi Alteripse, Can you show me where you have found a "oil suspension" for testosterone? Than you, <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECavell_ed91.html" title="User:Cavell">Cavell</a> 04:22, 2 January 2006 (UTC)Cavell</p>
<p>The oil suspension is the main one used for treatment of hypogonadism and delayed puberty in the US. A common brand is Delatestryl. I put the url link in the edit comment for you when I removed your edit. Here it is again: <a href="http://www.drugs.com/PDR/Delatestryl_Injection.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.drugs.com/PDR/Delatestryl_Injection.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 04:30, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi, thank you for the link. I <b>am</b> aware of course of testosterone enanthate, but was unaware of the fact that it was regarded as a <b>suspension</b> in oil. Since your knowledge of this exceeds mine, thank you for the clarification. <a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECavell_ed91.html" title="User:Cavell">Cavell</a> 02:45, 4 January 2006 (UTC)Cavell</p>
<ul>
<li>You are welcome. Sesame oil to be precise. You can use your lack of detailed knowledge of this as evidence of lack of personal use of this stuff if you need to (<i>joke</i>) since if you had used it, you would have known that the oil suspension makes it difficult to draw with any needle thinner than 18 gauge, quite different from aqueous solutions of injectable hormones. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 02:54, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you mean to say that <i>all</i> test. enanthates possess this characteristic, because I can easily use every enthanate I have ever had with as small as a 25 gauge. Also, are all injectable, oil based steroids (enthanates, propanates, decanotes, undelclaotes, etc) regarded as "suspensions"?<a href="../../../c/a/v/User%7ECavell_ed91.html" title="User:Cavell">Cavell</a> 05:14, 4 January 2006 (UTC)Cavell</p>
<p>OK, then I will confess I haven't actually had it in my hands for a very long time. I have done a few testosterone shots in past years when a nurse was not available, but it has been <i>many</i> years since then, and it has been decades since I looked at the prescribing info for Delatestryl closely. I just checked the PDR and found</p>
<ol>
<li>It is still sesame oil, which is what I remembered, but it is currently described as a solution in oil rather than a suspension. There is a basic chemistry difference between a solution and a suspension, especially when in water. I think the practical difference between most solutions and suspensions is whether the active ingredient settles or not while standing. So if your original point was that it was an oil <i>solution</i> rather than an oil <i>suspension</i> it appears that you are correct with regard to the current formulation of Delatestryl. I thought the issue was whether it was in oil or water-- it is and AFAIK has always been oil since steroids are not easily water soluble. I think it was once described as a suspension but I may be wrong and have nothing at hand to prove or disprove it.</li>
<li>Delatestryl seems to be reformulated and marketed by a different company than in the 1980s. I note that the newer formulation comes in syringes with 20 gauge needles. It used to come in vials and the nurses complained that it was hard to draw so we usually prescribed it with 18 gauge needles. I am not sure whether it has been reformulated and is thinner than it used to be or whether you have different standards for "drawing easily".</li>
<li>Testosterone cypionate no longer has a PDR entry. I haven't had a pharmacy ask if they could substitute it for enanthate for a couple of years and maybe it is no longer available in the US.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bottom line: the major current US brand formulation of testosterone for parenteral injection seems to be Delatestryl, which is properly described as an <i>oil solution</i> for IM injection. Does that cover it? <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 11:33, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, alteripse. I was wondering if I'd misunderstood your post to HW on WP:ANI. You seem to be inviting her to go ahead and create yet another sock account, but I can't believe that's how you meant it. Were you aware that she's still blocked? I've blocked her new account. There seems to be consensus, apart from your message, that sitting out <i>this</i> block is the least we should ask of her. (Actually behaving herself for the last two days of her block would be the first gesture of good faith she's ever made.) And yet you haven't unblocked her either, so I'm not sure what you think of the situation. Could you please take a look at my reply? (I probably won't post again tonight, as it's 3 AM in my timezone.) <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 02:12, 14 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I made the suggestion on the assumption that she seemed to have access to more IPs and that the block was not working. I agree that sitting out the block would have been the wisest choice if she wanted to continue to use the HW account. I don't particularly care, but was sick of the whining and my response was an attempt to get her to see that she has created so much ill will that a fresh start might be the wisest course. I probably just should have ignored her as her interests seems far away from mine. I don't intend to get further involved, certainly not a dispute over how to handle her. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 04:05, 14 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed the block's not working, since her IPs are nimble and her range too big to block. I do think, though, that the least we have to ask ask is that she <i>honor</i> the block for two days (out of two weeks of block evasion). It's too absurd that the community would make <i>all</i> the concessions, and the user with the richly-deserved block none. I do appreciate the things you said to her about all the (quite unreasonable) bitching and moaning. You may even have gotten through to her — I hope so. <a href="../../../b/i/s/User%7EBishonen_58d5.html" title="User:Bishonen">Bishonen</a> | <a href="../../../b/i/s/User_talk%7EBishonen_5449.html" title="User talk:Bishonen">talk</a> 05:09, 14 January 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<p>I think LADA is a topic worth a page. Unfortunately a large amount of the page content is vague and indistinguishable from general diabetes info. I would be inclined to emphasize what is distinctive about LADA, and make the other general teatment recommendations very concise and mainly pointing to the major diabetes treatment articles.</p>
<p>This same user inserted an interesting link in the <a href="../../../m/o/d/MODY_c58e.html" title="MODY">MODY</a> article. If you looked at the link, she/he has copied exactly the text you and I wrote for our MODY article without acknowledging wikipedia as the source. Conversely, the content of the new LADA page is identical to the Islets of Hope content.</p>
<ol>
<li>I am inclined to insist that the Islets of Hope site acknowledge our work if they want to include it.</li>
<li>I wonder whether the LADA material was borrowed from another copyrighted source since they did not bother to attribute the MODY material to ours.</li>
<li>I haven't looked at their other contributions or compared other parts of their website to see if more recombination has occurred.</li>
<li>I don't want to discourage a new contributor with some diabetes knowledge and good intentions but we need to clarify the relationships of the this site and hers. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 11:58, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>A comment: I had added the information on hyperosmolar coma to the Glucose meter article. Although today's glucose meters do not provide specific values beyond their high — which as you indicate is &lt;=600 — the ability to monitor very high blood sugars is important, allowing a patient to take action before they reach the point of of hyperosmolar coma (e.g. prevent the complication). Compare to the pre-glucometer days ... I've not added the information back, but would appreciate a conversation on the point. —<a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">ERcheck</a> @ 11:56, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I worked as a mainstream OB/GYN nurse for 2 decades. I have a good understanding of mainstream medical standards. Obstetric nursing has always looked at the family. So, I have been exposed to these topics for over two decades. In the United States family centered OB care has been the rule for decades. I worked with OB families with special needs and always attempted to met a father's needs. Since he wasn't the patient, this was unbillable. We do it because it is morally right.</p>
<p>I'm interested in reproductive issues. The abortion debate in the US has polluted the topic. Many mainstream researcher avoid it because it always leads back to the abortion and abstinence debate. This means much of the research is done by the those with an extreme pov. IMO, Ellis is pushing a pov. Easy to do with weak study design. Today, issue groups are using it to push their agenda. That is not alright because it wastes research money and condones weak research methods. We need solid research that links bio-medical and sociology/anthropology. I hope this help you understand my comments. --<a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFloNight_10cf.html" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a> 16:19, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Alteripse - in spite of your ad hominem attacks on me, you will now have noticed that your article on HGH - which I think is necessary, contained lots of good information, and was well intended - has degenerated into an edit war. It is very important to write even initial drafts of articles as neutrally as possible, or at least provide a structure that lends itself to constructive editing, or else people with different points of view go nuts on it. I want to encourage you to work on the article, because you obviously have a lot of knowledge on and interest in the matter; but you will get nowhere if you want to make it a soapbox. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 02:13, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>No edit war. I removed the text I had added because I don't have the time and energy for fighting over it at the moment. Your input on this and the anti-vaccine pages has been a combination of useful suggestions and a couple of really blind misrepresentations of wikipedia policy to support a pro-quackery POV.

<p>I am a 34 year old Norwegian female with Turner syndrome (mosaic 45,x/46,XX). I became spontanousely pregnant and I have a perfectly normal six year old son. I know a little genetics from my university studies. I am still a bit confused and anxious. If I tried to get another ichild, would the possibility of a chromosome disorder be greater than normal? I guess the big question is: Will one of my abnormal cells divide and produce egg cells or is it just my normal cells who produce egg cells? Would an eggcell without a sex chromosome be able to mature and produce a follicle at all?</p>
<p>If anyone have any information on the matter, or any information about any other female with Turner syndrone who spontanousely became pregnant, I would greatly appreciate it. Please Email me: lenef@sensewave.com</p>

<p>You mentioned a way to make chloral hydrate at home. I have prescriptions for it and pay through the nose for it. If I had a way to make it that would be dandy. It really helps sleep. I was sad to hear in can cause liver damage though..</p>
<ul>
<li>I am sorry, but I am the person who removed the recipe because I thought it was reckless of us to be posting a recipe for "knock out" drops. I always thought chloral hydrate was cheap but I am either misinformed or simply comparing it to so many newer drugs. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 02:05, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>From Jim- I understand. It's expensive now because not too many companys will carry it. Currently I think Somnote is the only one. Thanks</p>
<p>From Jim again- Might I also mention it is a good drug as a sleep aid for headache sufferers because it doesn't have rebound effects that some drugs have such as acetaminophen. Most doctors are unaware of the rebound effects from pain killers and sleep aids. Other headache sufferers should keep this in mind or mention it to their prescription writers. Chloral hydrate is an old drug but is free of rebound effects and grogginess in the morning.</p>

<p>Hi Alteripse. Thanks for the welcome. I am who my tag suggests. I figure that it would be strange for me to edit intersex content with a pseudonym, and might seem shady if people learned that I had done so. No? You offered some suggestions for how to make edits to controversial pages. May I ask you to be more specific? I'm trying to be respectful of the wikipedia community and content. Do you think that the edits I have made should have been posted to talk pages first? Can you direct me to a controversial article where edits have been negotiated at talk pages, so I can learn the style? Are some of my edits too large? Also, since you know my identity, and say that we have met, would you like to tell me your identity? Cherylchase 01:09, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am fairly new to wikiedia, and I couldn't find the answer to this. Is a reference valid when it is a link to a forum that is closed to viewing, where you have to register, with email verification, to even view the forum? Just wondering about the reference here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Blood_type_diet#Lost_results" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Blood_type_diet#Lost_results" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> just below: The serological data is lost, but something may yet come as a result of the original study:</p>
<p>"On a case-control basis there is some pretty good data, which I should tease out and do something with." (then the reference to the closed forum) But then again.. I guess anything goes in discussion? Thanks. Stmrlbs 00:07, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Basically anything civil and relevant goes on talk pages. Most editors would remove closed forum links unless they offered information both vital to the article and unavailable elsewhere, but would describe the link. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 00:31, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thanks. I did not think cites were even required for discussion until apers0n asked me for one.

<p>I read you're an endocrinologist, cool. I'm very interested in metabolic disorders and would like to specialize in endocrinology some day if I get the chance, I have one question though I'm wondering maybe you have an answer to me. A med student friend of mine said that endocrinologists mainly work with diabetics. Is this true? While diabetes is indeed a very interesting disease I get the feeling that working post-residency until retirement with mostly diabetics would become boring in the long run. What's your experience? Regards, <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_Daw_c15b.html" title="User:Jack Daw">Jack Daw</a> 17:25, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Diabetes represents about half the endocrine disease out there. However, there are lots of ways to do endocrinology, and some avoid diabetes by being in big departments where they can specialize in a narrower range of problems. In general there are two kinds of endocrinologists: (1) those for whom diabetes is the most important and interesting disease of all because it requires knowledge and therapeutic intervention at every level from the molecular to the social and necessitates a personal relationship with a patient, and (2) those who don't like those very characteristics, and would much prefer thinking about lab tests and hormone physiology to why their patient does or doesnt do what you wish he did. You have to decide which description fits you. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 18:08, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I appreciate your working toward simplicity in the lead section of <a href="../../../d/o/w/Down_syndrome.html" title="Down syndrome">Down syndrome</a>. The first paragraph was the result of compromise among some very strong-willed editors, starting around the first of the year, and concluding with this discussion: <a href="../../../d/o/w/Talk%7EDown_syndrome_Archive_2_c50e.html#What.27s_in_a_name" title="Talk:Down syndrome/Archive 2">Talk:Down_syndrome/Archive_2#What.27s_in_a_name</a>. While one of the editors finally gave up and has not been seen since, I'd hate to go back on a compromise that was worked out. If nothing else, it has withstood several attempts to change it. In the United States and Canada, the accepted term among genetic professionals is <i>Down syndrome</i>. In other parts of the British Commonwealth, it seems that <i>Down's syndrome</i> is the accepted term. If we are after accuracy, then this is needed, and I think the compromise wording does it with minimal fuss. Why use less precise wording? <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedE_dbe1.html" title="User:TedE">Ted</a> 01:30, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The terms are interchangeably recognizable by the entire english-speaking world. The intro sentences of an article should inform the reader as to the topic of the article so he immediately recognizes he is at the right place, and then provide perhaps the 3-6 most important facts about the topic. The largely ignored geographic differences in apostrophe use results from a medical journal style decision in the 1970s which has been adopted only unevenly around the world. I suspect the actual usage does not follow the claimed geography very cleanly but dont care enough to argue that aspect, and have never heard anyone actually argue strenuously for one form over the other. While we can mention the origin of the two terms farther down in the article, perhaps in the history of the terminology, I would not put it in the top 50 facts about Down syndrome that an encyclopedia article should provide. It certainly does not belong in the lead sentence of the article. I just got the new edition of a standard genetics text which has an excellent 3 page article on the topic, and I was planning to add a few missing things to this article but was stopped by the awkward, trivial, and questionably accurate opening sentence. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 11:57, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You are welcome to contribute or not as you see fit. It is entirely up to you. I'll look again at the introduction in the light of simplicity. As for "questionably accurate," the whole problem is with accuracy. Should we also include "Mongolian Idiocy?" It is still used, and is broadly recognized. However, it doesn't reflect professional usage. I guess I'm stuck on "professional" usage. Thanks again for your comments. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedE_dbe1.html" title="User:TedE">Ted</a> 19:32, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>It is a matter of style even more than accuracy. The geographic distribution of <a href="../../../e/s/t/Estradiol.html" title="Estradiol">estradiol</a> and <a href="../../../o/e/s/Oestradiol.html" title="Oestradiol">oestradiol</a> fits the American/British demarcation far more accurately and their equivalence is far less immediately obvious than Down and Down's, but the opening sentence simply informs the reader they are equivalent and leaves the geographic usage distinction far later. If you doubt my claim that the geographic distinction is not entirely accurate, all you have to do is search medline for Down syndrome once and Down's syndrome once and look at the national origins of the first 20 journals using each term. You will find immediate exceptions to the geographic claim: British journals such as Nature and Paediatr Nursing using Down syndrome, while American journals such as Curr Opinion Obstet Gynecol use Down's. And I have no idea what you meant by dragging in Mongolian idiocy-- I was trying to make the opening sentence <i>less</i> encumbered by imprecise terminology explanations, not more. If you are really invested in the geographic claim, leave it in, but I still dont think it is important enough or accurate enough to belong in the opening sentence. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 21:45, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Relating to the context under <b><a href="../../../d/o/w/Down_syndrome.html#History" title="Down syndrome">History</a></b> my opinion is that the expression "mongolian idiocy" should not be used and be replaced with <i>it</i> or <i>this</i>: <i>By the 20th century, ‘’this’’ had become the most recognizable form of mental retardation”</i>, as both expressions have been used sufficiently in the sentences above, thus avoiding overusing what has become a negatively charged expression and emphasizing the correct one – even if the dispute and change is described further down (no pun intended). --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProfero_8db0.html" title="User:Profero">Profero</a> 16:38, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>A, you have joined the side of the censors who are attempting to vandalize the article on the Presbyterian Church's anti -Semitism problem. Despite third party reputable sources that report that the PC has been accused of anti-semitism, you have supported those who consistenly delete that information. If you feel the PB church is not anti semitic, you are certainly free to add information to the article and cite sources that say it is not - it is vandalism, however, to delete information that such a controversy even exists. I would guess that you are a man of science from your talk page, since that requires a clarity of thought I would hope that upon reconsideration YOU will edit the PC article to include the anti-semitism information (adding to it if you wish information that would attempt to refute that charge).</p>
<p>Only a rabid and bigoted fanatic assumes that an objection to Israeli policy is the same as antisemitism. You have similar intellectual difficulty with the concept of vandalism, which is not applicable to a content dispute. I don't even consider your nonsense to be vandalism, just unacceptable from a factual and POV standpoint. And note that I did not remove your references or the fact that some jewish extremists equate criticism of israel with antisemitism-- all I did was make sure it was attributed as an opinion rather than presented as an indisputable fact. That you call that censorship and vandalism should tell you how ridiculous your accusations are. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 19:44, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Excuse me, but where did I ever say that objectng to Israli policy constitutes antisemitsm? You have established a straw man, allow me to knock it down - it is very permissible to criticise Israel policy on a specific matter and not only fail to be an anti semite but actually be a pro Israeli Jew - Jews and Israeli Jews constantly criticise Israeli policy, there are several democractically elected parties there that constantly clash on policy. There is a tipping point, however, where valid criticism can cross over to actual anti Judaism (that man, who happens to be a Jew, is a crook v. all Jews are crooks); legitimate sources are quoted as saying that the Presbyterian Church is antisemitic (you can read the cites for their reasoning) - that the PC is accused of anti semitism is a legitimate, valid point to raise in an article about the PC - I did not state in the article that I thought the PC is antisemetic, I edited to indicate that valid sources have taken that position (I have made my own beliefs clear in the talk section, where the standards for what is permissible are different). To take out that information is censorship, and an attempt to withhold from the article information that should be known to the reader. I would therefor suggest you once again read the Wiki rules, and make the appropriate edits yourself.Incorrect 00:38, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Your cites say no such thing. None of them mention the terms antisemitism or blood libel. As I responded on the talk page, you are only person to use those terms, referenced with articles that simply complain about their anti-israeli- policy policy.

:::BIRMINGHAM, June 16 — Presbyterian James Woolsey ran the Central Intelligence Agency during part of President Bill Clinton's administration, so his take on world events carries a certain weight among General Assembly commissioners. He minced few words when he spoke during an unofficial General Assembly gathering Friday. Woolsey criticized the General Assembly's 2004 decision to consider divesting in companies that refuse to reform such practices as selling bulldozers to raze the homes of Palestinians living on land disputed with Israel.
</pre>
<p>"We have, I'm afraid, moved into a posture…that, unless what we did two years ago is rejected, we are clearly on the side of theocratic, totalitarian, anti-Semitic, genocidal beliefs, and nothing less," Woolsey declared. <a href="http://www.pcusa.org/ga217/newsandphotos/ga06031.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.pcusa.org/ga217/newsandphotos/ga06031.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcusa.org/ga217/newsandphotos/ga06031.htm</a> incorrect</p>

<dd>I moved them to talk, where I explained that it is a distinct issue and would be better covered in the article on treating hypothyroidism. I am not done revising the end, but I assume you noticed that neither reference used desiccated thyroid, and both used different mixes of T4 and T3, and thus are of little relevance to the efficacy of Armour thyroid.

<p>I just wanted to personally thank you for answering my question on the MD "Mess" page, about andropause. I am well acquainted with menopause (sigh), but was not familiar at all with any serious discussion of 'male menopause'. With all the television advertising, I have sometimes wondered if diseases or disorders ("social anxiety disorder" comes to mind) are invented to sell pharmaceuticals. Alas, it would not surprise me if aging is someday labeled a 'disorder'. I consider aging a normal life process, and have no desire to be 30 again. Anyway, thank you again.

<p>Hi, I was wondering if maybe you could help me with an endocrinological question of sorts. I thought it might be more convenient to ask you directly rather than ask at the reference desk. Anyway you can just ignore this question if you so choose... The question:</p>
<p>I've recently read up on biochemistry and in the part about gluconeogenesis there's a chart of the "event" showing that alanine is used somehow in synthesis of cytoplasmic pyruvate from lactate. Now, the book explains that "Alanine and glutamine are the major amino acids exported from muscle for gluconeogenesis." My question is, what other amino acids are used? The chart includes Glu/Gln and Asp/Asn in the TCA cycle, but are there any more? I would appreciate it very much if you could give me an answer, or perhaps refer me to some other "e-Doctor" :) <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_Daw_c15b.html" title="User:Jack Daw">Jack Daw</a> 17:09, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Muscle protein contains many other amino acids besides ala and gln. However, when it is catabolized, most of the other aa's must be transformed into ala or gln in order to be converted to pyruvate and participate in gluconeogenesis. Does that answer your question? <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 16:36, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Pretty much yes. Follow-up question: If there is ala and gln in the blood in the event of stress (triggering gluconeogenesis) will muscle still be broken down or will the ala/gln in the blood be used first before turning to muscle "stores" of the aa's? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_Daw_c15b.html" title="User:Jack Daw">Jack Daw</a> 15:33, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Not sure if I understand your question. Perhaps the answer would be found in one of these generalities, which I think to be true:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>There is always measurable ala and gln in the blood. The amount there will not support much gluconeogenesis.</li>
<li>If a stress signal induces gluconeogenesis, it will involve both liver and muscle, and result in catabolism of muscle.</li>
<li>I do not think artificially elevated levels of ala and gln could prevent or suppress the metabolic consequences of a stress signal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Does one of those items cover it? <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 19:44, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Most of us who monitor articles of interest may not look at every edit marked minor, as they are usually simply spelling or punctuation corrections or link insertions. The danger of marking a substantive text change as minor is that someone who disagrees with you will accuse you of trying to sneak in a change "under the radar". Don't worry about the last one, but watch the minor change box on your next edit and you will see what I mean. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 21:07, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>ok.. I noticed that my edit here was also marked minor. So I checked my preferences and I see that I had checked the "Mark all edits minor by default".. by mistake. I unchecked it so this won't be the default. sorry.</dd>

<p>Tonight I started going through the admin list to see who is and who is not active and got sidetracked by noting who and who is not using edit summaries. Just a bit of constructive criticism: you're extremely low in this regard (at least recently) relative to other admins. I'm kind of leaving this note generically to 1 in 4 people (I very much doubt I'll get to Z :) so hope you take it well.

<dd>Actually, I just manually looked at the last two hundred where the first fifty showed a lack. No bot. I don't know if I should bother as I'll just wind up with a bunch of "wtf is this?" messages. There is a logic at work though: I've started regularly voting on RfAs and edit summaries is one criteria I use. I thought if that's the case, it's fair to expect it from established admins. However there is no hard and fast rule in this regard and you're perfectly entitled to different criteria.

<p>Hi, alterprise. No hard feelings, but I want to make sure we're clear. Your suggestion was to accept his apology. Which I'm not going to do, because I don't. I also explained, in my original post on AN/I, why I am not going to ask him not to make any more weird comments. I feel that he is being more and more outrageous in order to goad me into responding to him.

This newsletter is designed to perform two equally important functions. Firstly (and obviously, perhaps) it will serve to inform the members of the MCB project of such things as important discussions, votes, and article improvement drives. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the periodic correspondance will hopefully encourage a greater level of participation from the MCB community by acting as a gentle reminder of many of the the interesting tasks that are awaiting completion.

<dd>Thanks for the response. Ok, can you get a get HSV2 during delievery\prenatally but be a carrier, or for a lack of better words, be able to infect other people, without showing any symptoms, even 'till the day you die'? I know that HSV2, you get get anywhere. Ok, I'll explain my situation. My parents never tested themselves for STI's and they still haven't. I am a virgin. But from the wikipedia article Herpes simplex virus, it says you can can it anywhere, &amp; from what I garner from my talk page, InvictaHOG says that you can get HSV2 and NEVER display symptoms even by the time your dead [And come to think of it maybe even after your dead. Am I right?]. From this information, I just want to stay away from people. But that's so inconsiderate. So maybe as much information you guys could provide would be greatly appreciated.

<p>There seems to be a user called 'richard perterson' who continues to edit the Anabolic Steroid page and refuses to defend his edits on the talk page. He continues to add the 'expert needed' template and won't defend his addition of the template on the talk page. He just keeps adding it when I remove it. I have started a topic on that talk page for him to defend his actions on but I am not sure he will do so. He might simply re-add the template and ignore any attempts at discourse. So I am asking for your help if this turns out to be the case. Hopefully he will discuss his edits without resorting to an edit war but I can never know. So I thought I would give you a heads up to keep an eye on his edits to that page.

<p>Hello, I was wondering if perhaps you know anything about a study I participated in while on GH treatment for deficiency during childhood. I started treatment at around age 7 which persisted till I was 18. At first I took injections in the evening, but after some time I was asked if I wanted to participate in a study where you split the dose in half, taking one injection in the morning and one in the evening. I never heard anything about how the study went, if it was more effective or not. Is this anything that you know about? If not, do you know how I could find the results of the study?</p>
<p>While I'm at it I'd like to ask, if I want to find out if I have got any of the side effects stated in <a href="../../../g/r/o/Growth_hormone_treatment.html#Risks_of_GH_treatment" title="Growth hormone treatment">Growth_hormone_treatment#Risks_of_GH_treatment</a>, such as decreased insulin sensitivity, could I ask my endocrinologist or should I assume I haven't suffered from any side effects if no disease has manifested three years post-treatment?

<p>Hi, I read your note on the article on hypoglycemia unawareness. I did know that there had been fears with copyright violations of this. These may have been observed after my initial proposal that the article should have been merged with another paper (I am inclined to share your views on the initial short article). The best thing to do would probably be to include this information on this topic in another article. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EACEO_4c06.html" title="User:ACEO">ACEO</a> 21:16, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Regarding the eu-FEDS hypothesis, there are now many physicians (primarily reproductive immunologists) out there that are very interested in this model but desire a brief summary for their residents and other interested parties. This article was meant to address this issue. The recent demonstration of an overlap in glycosylation between CA125 and gp120, plus the data indicating that CA125 is actually an immunosupppressive glycoprotein (not just a tumor marker) has induced substantial excitement in gynecological oncology. In addition, our latest data showing that human sperm express immunosuppressive carbohydrate sequences that are also upregulated on virtually all aggressive human tumor cells, is causing many cancer and reproductive biologists to take notice. And now many retrovirologists are also taking a very hard look at this work, as witnessed by grant support for this extremely unconventional approach to AIDS pathogenesis in both humans and monkeys. The eu-FEDS hypothesis was notable before, but now it is about to take wings and fly.</p>
<p>It is purely logical that pathogens and aggressive tumor cells would attack us via the reproductive imperative. The immune system <i>must</i> genuflect before the reproductive system to enable reproduction between histoincompatible individuals. It is now up to all biomedical scientists to target this insidious system thus enabling us to finally eradicate these highly destructive pathogens and tumor cells. In the end, that is all that really counts. I was really beginning to wonder if anyone would see the light here. Now I see that someone has. Thank you very much for your support.--Clarkgf 17:36, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello. I guess you couldn't find that GH study I mentioned earlier, that's fine, thanks anyway.</p>
<p>Got another question. In the GH deficiency article it says that several agents may be used to evaluate pituitary function, including arginine. Is this something that you in your work has used, or has insulin become the exclusive GH-inducing agent to use? What is the relative efficiency of arginine to insulin in inducing a release of GH? Also, does it work if arginine is taken orally? If it has to be injected, is it IV or...? Thank you for your always very informative and educational answers. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_Daw_c15b.html" title="User:Jack Daw">Jack Daw</a> 16:04, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Arginine has been a standard for many years. Most of us stopped using insulin in the early 90s. Insulin is a stronger stimulus for GH release and has been specificity (fewer false positives) but arginine has better sensitivity (fewer false negatives). An insulin test is a much more unpleasant test to put someone through and requires bedside supervision, though it has the advantage of serving as a test of the pituitary adrenal axis also. I have never seen a study of arginine by mouth and do not know if there are any drawbacks to oral administration. If you are thinking of daily arginine as a way to boost long-term growth hormone production by a non-deficient person, each substantial IV dose produces only a single peak of GH lasting about 40 minutes (a clonidine trial, based on the same idea, did not acclerate growth). The only oral GH stim test, very popular in England in the 60s and 70s was the <a href="../../../b/o/v/Bovril.html" title="Bovril">Bovril</a> test. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 01:03, 4 December 2006 (UTC) PS I sent you an email about my unsuccessful search for the published study.
<dl>
<dd>As you confirm such stimulations have little if any impact on growth, so I wouldn't use arginine to increase GH secretion, although there are probably several bodybuilders and the like who do so. No, this is merely for my never-ending quest of becoming an amateur endocrinologist, hehe. So about the arginine, how much is injected and by what method? Is it free form? <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_Daw_c15b.html" title="User:Jack Daw">Jack Daw</a> 15:20, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is an iv infusion, run into a vein over half an hour. The dose is 0.5 g/kg to a maximum of 30 g. Draw blood samples for GH level every 15 minutes for an hour. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 00:07, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Please do not deliberately introduce incorrect information into articles. It is considered <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">vandalism</a>, (see "Sneaky Vandalism" on this page, which includes adding misinformation). Also, when one deliberately introduces incorrect information into an article, and falsely attributes this information to a published study, this is considered <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forgery.html" title="Forgery">forgery</a>. This is a very severe form of vandalism, and therefore this will be your <b>only warning</b>. The next time you deliberately introduce incorrect information into an article, as you did to <a href="../../../p/u/b/Puberty.html" title="Puberty">puberty</a>, you <i>will</i> be <a href="../../../b/l/o/Wikipedia%7EBlocking_policy_2eb0.html" title="Wikipedia:Blocking policy">blocked</a> from editing Wikipedia.</p>
<p>In this case, you edited the article <a href="../../../p/u/b/Puberty.html" title="Puberty">puberty</a> and added fabricated data that you falsely attributed to a published study. More precisely, you quoted some genuine data from this particular study regarding age and sexual development in girls, and then intentionally falsified additional data and combined it with the geniune data and presented it together.</p>
<p>Although Wikipedia has a policy requesting that editors assume good faith when evaluating the actions of other editors (<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>), "<i>this guideline does not require that editors continue to assume good faith in the presence of evidence to the contrary.</i>" In this case, the evidence is overwhelming to the point that a violation has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. A substantial portion of the data in these tables matches the data from full text of the above published study the you cited as the source, proving that this is where you got the the data from. You then added additional data to these tables for paramaters that were not even evaluated at all in the study, i.e. you falsified these values.</p>
<p>For the record, this matter involves data you incorporated into the article <a href="../../../p/u/b/Puberty.html" title="Puberty">Puberty</a> as tables 2a and 2b, data which you attributed to the following study: "Secondary sexual characteristics and menses in young girls seen in office practice: a study from the pediatric research in office settings network." Pediatrics, 1997; 99:501-12, (Herman-Giddens ME, et al.). This data was reflected in article <a href="../../../p/u/b/Puberty.html" title="Puberty">Puberty</a> as indicated on the recent page history: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Puberty&amp;diff=91513613&amp;oldid=91513504" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Puberty&amp;diff=91513613&amp;oldid=91513504" rel="nofollow">Click here</a>.</p>

<p>Note as to exactly what data was falsified: This study only evaluated sexual maturation in girls aged 3 to 12, and only made observations on mean age of menarche, and Tanner stages 2 and 3 for pubic hair (PH2, PH3) and breast development(B2, B3). No observations were made for Tanner stages 4 and 5 (PH4, PH5, B4, B5). No girls 13 and over were evaluated for this study. However, Alterprise misrepresented the data from this study by fabricating additional data that he included for the values for PH4, PH5, B4, &amp; B5. He also apparently fabricated the data for some of the 3rd percentile and 97th percentile columns.</p>

<dd>It is a descriptive term in general use, not a medical term. It implies "around the beginning of puberty" and could probably be used casually to refer to ages 10-11 y in girls, or 11-12 y in boys, but it would be more technically correct to denote a child approaching or just having achieved the earliest physical changes. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 03:49, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is a very uncommon word. Pubescent means about the same thing, and the prefix "peri-" simply means "around the time of...". Anyone with a good vocabulary should grasp the intended meaning. I suppose interpreted broadly, peripubescent children could range from 8 to 14. It might not be a graceful word choice, but I guess it is not incorrect: perhaps the choice is intended to convey a labored academic style in the context? <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 04:04, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, I'll tell you what it is. I keep an eye on <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">Pedophilia</a> and related articles. We cite a couple of different definitions of pedophilia: <i><a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychopathia_Sexualis_ac81.html" title="Psychopathia Sexualis">Psychopathia Sexualis</a></i>, which says the attraction is "toward children, either prepubescent or at the beginning of puberty," the <a href="../../../i/c/d/ICD_10d0.html" title="ICD">ICD</a>, which says "usually of prepubertal or early pubertal age," and the <a href="../../../d/s/m/DSM_ff6c.html" title="DSM">DSM</a>, which in the <b>short</b> version of diagnostic criteria available online, says "prepubescent child or children (generally age 13 years or younger)."</p>
<p>You see the problem. Not only does one source not quite fit with the others, but it seems to set the age of puberty at thirteen -- which doesn't fit at all with the way you lay out the Tanner stages in <a href="../../../p/u/b/Puberty.html" title="Puberty">Puberty</a>.</p>
<p>Further, I have read a lengthier version of the DSM's diagnostic criteria which differs from the brief bullet-point version we quote in a number of ways. It seems as if the DSM may be inconsistent with its own reduced summary.</p>
<p>Add to this the fact that many of the editors of <a href="../../../p/e/d/Pedophilia.html" title="Pedophilia">Pedophilia</a> strongly prefer a definition which includes <b>only</b> prepubescent children. (This allows the use of the less-stigmatized term "ephebophilia" for attraction to any child who has entered the first stages of puberty -- a usage I find dishonest and absurd, particularly given the wide variance in the age of menarche.)</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, another editor and I sort of sidestepped this problem by changing the definition in the lead from "prepubescent" to "prepubescent or peripubescent." The embarrassing truth: I inserted the word <i>peripubescent</i> without having an exact idea of what it means. And now it appears that the word has no precise meaning.</p>
<p>All this has been on my conscience! I started this account largely to counteract POV editing on this subject, but I find I'm a bit out of my depth. Sorry for the rant on your talk page! Any advice you can give is appreciated. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanB_DanD_1af1.html" title="User:DanB DanD"><font color="darkpurple">Dan</font><font color="black"><b>B</b></font>†<font color="blue">Dan</font><font color="darkblue"><b>D</b></font></a> 04:35, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>OK, I wondered what your context was. That is not a topic in which I have any particular expertise or interest, but I will tell you what those words mean to me and you can decide what fits your intended meaning best. <i>Pubertal</i> means having some of the physical changes of puberty but not yet having achieved full adult growth and body shape. <i>Prepubertal</i> means showing no physical signs of puberty. Pubertal and prepubertal have precise medical meanings. <i>Pubescent</i> implies "beginning puberty" because the root "-escent" often implies "in the process of attaining" (cf <i>adulescens</i> meant "becoming an adult"), and I would consider the terms <i>pubescent</i> and "early pubertal" to be synonymous. On the other hand, I think many people use pubescent less precisely as a synonym for pubertal, but as you can see from the article, puberty for an endocrinologist may have a longer duration and include more advanced stages than in the popular concept. <i>Peripubescent</i> is a vaguer word that would include children about to show signs of puberty along with those who do show such signs. A typical 5 year old would be described as prepubertal rather than pubescent (unless he actually showed signs of precocious puberty, in which case pubescent might be applicable). The best use of the word peripubescent might be to describe the group of children around the age of beginning puberty, some of whom will be pubescent (early pubertal) and some of whom will be still prepubertal. Peripubescent is probably a fair word to apply to a group of 8-14 yr olds. Is that too complicated? I think part of your problem is that there is not an exact congruence between the medical categories and the social categories, nor between the words. In fact, to distinguish between prepubertal and very early pubertal, you have to examine a child undressed, and thus this distinction cannot be readily made about an individual child in most social contexts. In my opinion ephebophilia is simply a subset of pedophilia, as it refers to the type of children that an individual adult does or would like to engage in relationships with. The legal and social concept of pedophilia is based on the highly unequal power, knowledge, harm, and benefit involved in a sexual relationship between an adult and a child and these are not erased with the onset of puberty. That imbalance changes gradually, but there must be a precise age boundary for social purposes and I do not admire those who want to weasel it down on the basis of semantics. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 12:53, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello, Alteripse. Being one of the few MDs regularly contributing to the reference desks (at least I know of no others), you might take a glance and throw in a comment at the whole discussion on medical advice which keeps being re-raised at the <a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia_talk%7EReference_desk_6456.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Reference desk">talk page</a>. (Then again, you might not). ---<a href="../../../s/l/u/User%7ESluzzelin_c586.html" title="User:Sluzzelin">Sluzzelin</a> 18:04, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I actually did comment early on in the discussion, in response to the disturbing legal review that was posted. Nothing novel or worth responding to has been said in the last few days. Basically, the legal article suggested only medical professionals are at personal risk for answering questions at the RD, and while the risk is low, the personal satisfaction of correcting the medical misinformation provided by high school students is not exactly rewarding enough to continue there. But thanks for thinking of me. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 04:55, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I understand - what a shame that those people who have the professional expertise, experience <i>and</i> good judgement when it comes to qualifying their answers are the exact ones who may not answer according to that article.

<p>Currently there is no article <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gonadectomy.html" title="Gonadectomy">gonadectomy</a>, it redirects to <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castration.html" title="Castration">castration</a>. On the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intersex_surgery.html" title="Intersex surgery">intersex surgery</a> page I corrected the wikilink for gonadectomy so that it went straight to castration, rather than through a redirect. I fail to see the point of your reverting this change. Are you planning on writing a gonadectomy article separate from castration? Ciotog 07:10, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Thanks for taking the trouble to track me down. I should have left an explanation. In most cases in intersex surgery, the gonads that are removed are non-functional; in rare cases they are producing hormones that are ineffective or unwanted for the person's gender. Castration is used almost exclusively in other contexts for removal of functional gonads, producing a loss of appropriate hormones. The connotations and results and contexts are so different that I thought a redirect that seemed to equate the two circumstances was misleading to the reader. Obviously this is my opinion rather than unarguable fact. I guess if you want to include enough of a description in the castration article so that the differences are clear, I would not object to restoring the link. Either way, I will not fight over it. <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 11:26, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<p>Thanks for setting me straight on Life history...busy trying to find an appropriate article name to deal with Rushton's theory, and he called it "life-history theory".

<dd>I think by the mid-1990s, life history theory was a widely recognized concept among anthropologists.

<p>While reading various articles on human biology to see what article needs to be worked on, I have read your experience on the talk page of the Desiccated thyroid extract. And could not resist answering. It is indeed true that various studies did not show significant differences between T4 + T3 vs T4, but this doesn't mean that everything is placebo.</p>
<p>The studies in question were not specific and not designed for particular subjects.</p>
<p>Here is the situation, it is true that most patients after being treated with T4 alone do feal well. This is what the studies have been mostly designed to measure. What those studies were not designed for, is if the subset of patients who do not feel well, how much a difference would it make for <b>them</b>. Studies sensibility (which measures the numbers of subjects needed to get the sensibility wanted) won't measure still a statistically significant differences which it would have measured if the study concentrated on a subset (in this cases, it would be those who still get symptoms after being treated with T4).

<p>I see patients from around the world here in Richmond Virginia. I have been working on public education about Plastic Surgery problems now for more than 30 years. If what I have been doing yesterday is OK with Wikipedia admin, will continue for other Plastic Surgery and Cosmetic Surgery sections. I have found the need to change major components so far in a few sections such as <a href="../../../o/t/o/Otoplasty.html" title="Otoplasty">otoplasty</a>, <a href="../../../u/m/b/Umbilicoplasty.html" title="Umbilicoplasty">umbilicoplasty</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/m/Tummy_tuck.html" title="Tummy tuck">tummy tuck</a>. I hope I am using the right format for additions so that my time here is maximized.</p>
<p>Someone deleted a great video resource about the emotion of living with gynecomastia:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gynecomastia&amp;diff=115976545&amp;oldid=115820037" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gynecomastia&amp;diff=115976545&amp;oldid=115820037" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gynecomastia&amp;diff=115976545&amp;oldid=115820037</a></p>
<p>It has been hard getting such source material, patients really do have a hard time expressing themselves about this problem and that tape is the product of hundreds of hours of trying to get that emotion on record. I have been told by wives, family, and friends of gynecomastia patients that it helped them understand the patients' concerns and issues. Should it be added back in a different way?</p>

<p>P.S. Additionally, my initial point stands.

<dd>Thanks. I have no quarrel with either point. I was trying to avoid non-public exchanges. If you recall, my first response was to tell him your initial questions were well within accepted bounds here, and that links that promote one's own websites have a much higher quality to meet. We aren't far apart on that, but I actually was sincere in my opinion that collections of pictures of actual people have reassuring value for readers. I told him he was overreacting to your criticisms, but as I just posted, his credentials are arguably superior to yours-- and neither one of you should be arguing credentials anyway (look at your claim again-- it sounds as if you believe expertise is either inherited or sexually transmitted). Let's drop the credential trumping and work on the wording of the article, ok? <a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlteripse_f1cb.html" title="User:Alteripse">alteripse</a> 00:49, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have already dropped credential thumping altogether (as of 2 or 3 exchanges ago). If you examine the Klinefelter's syndrome talk page, you'll see that I withdrew my comments completely about DrBermant's mental health-related opinion qualifications, and I don't think I've mentioned anything else except for the literal truth of his documented board certifications/licenses since.</dd>
<dd>As for my own narrative of what I feel makes me qualified to do medical research, I think you know what I was driving at vis a vis the environments I live in and the company I keep, so I'll let you do with that as you will.</dd>
<dd>Professional qualifications-wise, it does sound like DrBermant has plenty of qualifications to have an opinion on the therapies he publicizes on his business web site. The fact remains, and yes, I think you and I agree, that citing that site is still against Wikipedia Attribution policy (as long as a substantively similar site exists that is not his own site).</dd>
<dd>Also, as long as I cite my sources, follow Wikipedia policy and style guidelines and strive to present a balanced view, I shouldn't need even a high school diploma to contribute to the topic or any other on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalcolmGin_0a65.html" title="User:MalcolmGin">MalcolmGin</a> 01:29, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
